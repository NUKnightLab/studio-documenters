CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good morning.

I want

2

to be respectful of everyone's time so we're

3

going to start.

4

Jorge is at a breakfast meeting with

5

Alderman Burke and I think he'll show up at some

6

point.

7

We do have a quorum here so we are going to get

8

started.

9

We just don't know exactly what time.

First I'd like to welcome all of

10

you, and I would also like to welcome the Board

11

Members and also congratulate them on their

12

confirmation which I think all of you know just

13

took place last week; and, in fact, this is our

14

first meeting as the Chicago Infrastructure

15

Trust, so welcome to the Board Members and

16

welcome to all in the audience.

17

you being here, and we hope to be able to do

18

some great things for this City.

19

We appreciate

I think I'll start out with an

20

introduction of the Board Members.

21

with myself.

22

bios but just to give you a brief introduction

23

to each of us.

24

I'll start

I think you might have read our

I'm James Bell.

I'm the Chairman of

 3
1

the Trust Board.

2

Boeing after a 40-year career in finance.

3

retired as the CFO and the corporate president,

4

so I've had a number of senior financial

5

positions and had an opportunity to run the

6

company for a short period and then to help the

7

current chairman and CEO operate the company

8

over the last 10 years.

9

I just retired in April from
I

So I feel pretty comfortable that I

10

can help the City try to do something innovative

11

and unusual that would help the citizens of this

12

town, and this is my adopted home, and I want to

13

be able to give back and do that.

14
15
16

With that, I'll turn it over to you,
David.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

17

Nice to see everybody here.

First of all, I

18

appreciate the welcome, and I am looking forward

19

to the opportunity to work with everyone.

20

As you heard when we were before the

21

City Council Finance Committee last week, I gave

22

a short statement setting out what I thought

23

were the principles, and maybe just for this

24

group I'll summarize what I've said publicly on

 4
1
2

that at our first meeting.
In my view, the concept of a local

3

infrastructure trust has great potential but

4

only if it is done the right way.

5

forward to working with everyone here to jointly

6

create a process that is ethical, transparent,

7

inclusive and deliberate.

8
9
10
11

I look

And I had four principles that I
talked about before the Finance Committee that
I'll just set out very briefly here.
First, the Board and the Trust must

12

be independent.

13

our independent judgment about whether specific

14

infrastructure investment plans are truly in the

15

public interest.

16

independence very seriously and I will call

17

things as I see them.

18

Our task will be to exercise

I take the issue of our

Second, the Trust must operate with

19

full transparency.

Given the legitimate

20

concerns about transparency with the parking

21

meter deal and given that the Trust is a new

22

venture accompanied by uncertainty about how and

23

whether it will work, full transparency is

24

critical, critical to the credibility and

 5
1

integrity of the Trust effort, critical to

2

overcome concerns that connections will trump

3

merit and the public interest, and critical to

4

achieve public involvement and gain public

5

trust.

6

Third, there must be time for full

7

public deliberation of a proposal to flush out

8

whether it is a good idea.

9

vetted and examined fully in the light of day

Proposals must be

10

with adequate time to hear from relevant

11

experts, to consider alternatives and to hear

12

dissenting views.

13

the public interest.

14

This is a key protection for

Fourth, the Trust must allow robust

15

oversight from the relevant bodies, including

16

the City IG.

17

period, regardless of the type of project.

18

Besides, that office may end up having excellent

19

suggestions for the Trust.

20

We must be open to the City IG

I don't know whether private

21

entities will come forward with infrastructure

22

investment proposals that will be in the City's

23

best interests.

24

if the Trust operates openly, publicly and

They may or they may not.

But

 6
1

deliberately and attempts to answer the key

2

questions, what the short-term and long-term

3

costs and benefits are for the City, how City

4

taxpayers are being protected by the deal and

5

whether there are better alternatives, then I

6

believe it has the potential to be viewed over

7

time as an excellent idea.

8

I went into a bit more detail in my

9

statement, which I'll spare everybody here, but

10

I wanted to set that out for folks here.

11

I'm really looking forward to this.

12

This is the first of multiple meetings obviously

13

and just getting started in something that is

14

being created.

15

positive that as we looked around for what

16

models should we turn to to figure out how we do

17

this, we found, as we heard before, that there

18

really aren't any clear models and that it

19

appears among cities and municipalities we're

20

going first.

21

and I'm looking forward to working together with

22

everybody here.

23
24

I'm excited and find it quite

I look forward to that challenge,

CHAIRMAN BELL:
John?

Thank you, David.

 7
1

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Chairman.

2

My name is John Pope.

3

Alderman representing the far southeast side of

4

the City.

5

I'm the 10th Ward

It's also my pleasure to be here.
I'd like to congratulate my fellow

6

Board Members and our Chairman.

7

Alderman for three terms and a lifelong resident

8

of the City, so I think I may have a little bit

9

more insight in terms of the specific needs in

10
11

I've been an

terms of infrastructure for our City.
And sitting before the City Council

12

and going through the budget hearings each and

13

every year, I recognized more and more each and

14

every year the growing needs and demands placed

15

on the City and other municipalities to meet our

16

growing infrastructure needs.

17

This is an exciting opportunity

18

taking into account what David said and I think

19

we're all in agreement to really address those

20

needs in a creative, aggressive way and not

21

necessarily just to be a leader in the country

22

but to meet the needs for our citizens here in

23

the City of Chicago and also to ensure that

24

their tax dollars, their interests are

 8
1

represented and protected properly.

2

I take great pride in my position

3

on the Board here and am thrilled because the

4

City Council argued for representation, so I

5

seek to represent the Council and the entire

6

City proudly and look forward to working closely

7

with my colleagues.

8
9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you, John.

MS. FERGUSON:

Thank you, Chairman

Diana?

10
11

Bell.

Good morning, everyone.

12

honored to be a member of this Trust Board and

13

look forward to working with my colleagues here

14

on the Board and doing innovative and exciting

15

things for the City of Chicago.

16

I also am really

My background is in finance

17

primarily.

18

finance roles in both the private sector and in

19

public sector work, so I hope to bring those

20

skills to bear to help evaluate the projects

21

that we are going to be considering and making

22

sure they are in the best interests of the

23

citizens of Chicago.

24

I spent over 20 years in various

Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.

Let's move

 9
1

onto the second agenda item and we'll get a

2

little -- we'll have a little more discussion

3

among the Board as to this subject, but in

4

general the purpose of this Chicago

5

Infrastructure Trust is to develop another

6

source of financing to accelerate the

7

improvement of the City of Chicago's

8

infrastructure.

9

As stated previously by other

10

members, we want to make sure we do that in a

11

way that's transparent and really satisfies the

12

best interests of the citizens of this City, but

13

we also want to make sure we have a balanced

14

deal that will continue to attract investments

15

from third parties.

16

And so that when you think about the

17

budget challenges the City has, we need to

18

figure out if there are other sources that

19

can allow us to do some of the needed work

20

without -- and doing it in a more timely manner,

21

but we got to do that in a way that is up front,

22

transparent and definitely suits the needs of

23

our people.

24

So that's pretty much the purpose.
The goal is to do it in the way that

 10
1

David articulated and John spoke a little bit

2

to.

3

we'll talk about a little later, you know, we

4

try to incorporate all the tenants in terms of

5

the operating principles that ensure that we

6

operate in a way that always puts the public

7

interest first.

But when you look at our bylaws, which

8
9

That is a goal of this Board.

That

is I think a tenant that I think that you will

10

find that all the Members of this Trust feel

11

very, very strongly about.

12

Now, as a Board, we're going to have

13

to decide operationally how to put that in

14

practice.

15

these things, but the real key for us is going

16

to be able to do that in a way that allows us to

17

encourage investors to come forward and come up

18

with a deal structure that makes a lot of sense

19

for both them and for the people of Chicago, so

20

we're going to work very, very hard in doing

21

just that.

Obviously it's easy to say a lot of

22

So with that, I'll open it up to the

23

other Board Members to see if you have any other

24

comments relative to that topic.

John?

 11
1

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman, I just want

2

to I guess reemphasize not only the need for the

3

infrastructure improvements but the ability to

4

share the risk that the taxpayers have

5

traditionally bore for so many years, and

6

bringing private sector dollars into play will

7

certainly do that and offer them an opportunity

8

for financial benefit, of course, but to share

9

some of that risk outside of the public dollars,

10

the public sector.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

In prior deals we felt

12

that the people of the City of Chicago probably

13

bore more the risk of doing that so, John, good

14

point.

15

a deal where we're going to use this alternative

16

financing source, it definitely has to be

17

balanced and it has to take into consideration

18

all the interests.

19

appearance of a good deal financially.

20

to also make sure it's really good for the

21

people of Chicago.

22
23
24

We got to make sure that when we come to

Okay.

It just can't be the
It has

Any other comments?

(No response.)
Let's move on to the incorporation

 12
1

under State law.

2

us a highlight of what we're talking about here?

3

David, would you sort of give

MR. NAREFSKY:

Certainly.

I would be

4

happy to.

So I'm David Narefksy with Mayer

5

Brown.

6

the City to help get the process started.

7

worked with the City's Law Department on the

8

ordinance to establish the Trust, and so we're

9

sort of trying to help continue that role as we

We have been working previously with

10

get the Trust organized from a basic

11

organizational structure.

12

We

In that regard, the first thing that

13

the Trust really needs to do is have basic

14

articles of incorporation filed.

15

walk before you run.

16

straight forward for a not-for-profit

17

organization of this kind and a kind that would

18

expect to apply for 501(c)(3) status under the

19

Internal Revenue Code, so there's nothing

20

particularly unique about them.

21

of standard best practices for organizations

22

having a mission of this kind.

23
24

You got to

The articles are pretty

CHAIRMAN BELL:

They are kind

Thank you, David.

Now,

the articles of incorporation were included in

 13
1

our pre-read.

2

of the Board Members before we put this matter

3

to vote?

4

Are there any comments from any

MR. HOFFMAN:

I've looked at the

5

articles of incorporation.

6

noncontroversial.

7

anything of great significance.

8

David.

9

we need to do to be registered, so I think

10
11

I think they are

I don't think they say

It's just kind of a pro forma thing that

they're fine and I would approve them.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Anyone else?

12

(No response.)

13

Do I have a motion?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

So moved.

15

MS. FERGUSON:

Second.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

I agree with

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)

18

Thank you.

19

Election of officers.

You know, in

20

the bylaws we talk about having a vice chair and

21

a secretary and treasurer being the other two

22

officers of the Board.

23
24

You know, I think when I look at it,
it's just a best practice to have someone that

 14
1

would help in terms of the vice chair to sit and

2

organize and run meetings in the event that I'm

3

not available, and I think in terms of the

4

secretary/treasurer, it's more of the treasurer

5

role to oversee the Trust's finances.

6

You know, I have talked to all the

7

Board Members and I'm going to recommend that we

8

elect John Pope as the vice chair and Diana

9

Ferguson as the secretary/treasurer, Diana with

10

her extensive financial background.

11

I think I want to send a strong

12

message to the City Council that John is really

13

going to be a partner in this Trust and we

14

really take seriously his input, and that I

15

think is important and that's why I recommend

16

it.

17

Now, I don't think I want to put

18

that to vote today.

19

at the next meeting unless other Board Members

20

have different feelings, but we can discuss it,

21

and I want you to think about it, but I do want

22

to do that for those two reasons.

23
24

I think I'd like to do it

So with that I would like to open it
up to the rest of the Board if you have any

 15
1
2
3

other suggestions.
MR. NAREFSKY:

Just a technical

observation.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

MR. NAREFSKY:

Yes.

Go ahead.

Beyond reasons you were

6

I think suggesting maybe taking this up at a

7

subsequent meeting, I think just as a matter of

8

good practice that would be the right way to go.

9

It's best to get the articles filed,

10

have bylaws adopted and then maybe bylaws are up

11

for adoption at a subsequent meeting as well

12

just to take things in a logical way.

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good to have a lawyer

14

on our side to make sure we do things

15

technically right as well as things that make

16

good common sense.

17

Jorge has just joined us.

18

through and did a brief introduction.

19

you do the same and welcome.

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

21

Jorge Ramirez.

22

Federation of Labor.

23
24

We went
I'd like

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

My day job is with the Chicago

I'm happy to be here.

I'm happy to

be working with all of the Members and

 16
1

congratulate you on your appointments.

I don't

2

know if condolences or congratulations are in

3

order.

4

congratulatory side.

5

here and I look forward to working with

6

everybody.

But in all seriousness, it's on the

7

It is a pleasure to be

I think this is a rare opportunity

8

in government where you can get something -- an

9

idea to come to fruition as quickly as this has,

10

and I know that there's going to be a lot of

11

other folks from other cities and other places

12

around the country, in the world looking at this

13

as a model.

14

it in that structure to get some things done for

15

the people that live here.

I'm looking forward to working with

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

Thank you and welcome.

Jorge, you missed that

18

there's been a tentative recommendation that we

19

be at the kids table.

20

We're at the nonofficer table.

21

no objection to that.

22

There was a discussion --

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

straight.

24

other.

I certainly have

Actually the table was

We have to be able to look at each

I would have preferred a round table,

 17
1

but it is what it is, guys.

2

Let's move on to the Advisory Board

3

Members.

4

of the Trust structure we're going to have six

5

advisory, at least six Advisory Board Members,

6

three which will be appointed by the Mayor which

7

is the Class 2 Advisory Board Members and

8

Class 3 which are the three that we, the Board,

9

will select and vote on.

10

Now, I think we all know that as part

So I only want to introduce that to

11

say that that's something we need to be thinking

12

about and thinking about getting done sooner

13

rather than later.

14

today.

15

It's not something for

But what I would like to see us do

16

is maybe develop a list of candidates that we

17

would want to consider as our appointees and

18

then we can work our way through that hopefully

19

in the next meeting or two.

20

Any other thoughts on that matter?

21

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Chairman.

24

Just a comment that the City Council did pass

 18
1

action least week as well that calls for the

2

City Treasurer position to be on the

3

nonadvisory, and I think that makes sense in

4

term of bringing that professional expertise and

5

insight to the table, so that's something that

6

we passed last week as well.

7
8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

have one member appointed.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Good.

So we

Great.

James, what's your

10

thought about timing and procedure both on this

11

and it sort of taps into I think generally going

12

forward.

13

necessarily have to decide, for instance, you

14

know, when our next meeting is, although you

15

may announce that at the end.

16

know.

17
18
19

I'm not -- I don't think we

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I don't really

Well, we're going to

talk about that.
MR. HOFFMAN:

But I guess one thing

20

that I have in mind just generally that probably

21

would be helpful, and I would absolutely defer

22

to you, is to come out of this meeting with both

23

a thought -- a general outline of what our

24

agenda looks like for the next meeting and a

 19
1

general sense of timeframes of those things.

2

And so I would put this one time

3

frame for when we expect to have possible

4

candidates for the Advisory Committee Members,

5

how we want to discuss that.

6

defer to you on procedure.

7

we get to the end of the meeting we should be as

8

firm as possible on timing and agenda items for

9

next time.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Again I would

I just think that if

Yeah, I think what I

11

would like us to do is to think about

12

conceptually what should be the characteristics

13

of those Advisory Board Members.

14

we should have people that can help us, you

15

know, in this complex and financial structure,

16

so I think we should have a member that would be

17

able to provide some insight and maybe have some

18

ability to connect us with some sources.

19

My thought is

So, I mean, that's a thought on one

20

member.

I think we ought to think about other

21

things too that.

22

that we fulfill the full tenants of our

23

operating principles and have Advisory Members

24

on this Board to help us do that.

You know, we want to make sure

 20
1

I think in terms of thinking through

2

it, that's how we should think about it.

3

Timing, sooner is always better than later, but

4

getting it right is really the key thing.

5

so I think we ought to develop names and then we

6

ought to air those names out, talk about them so

7

we all have a good appreciation for what they

8

would bring to the table.

9

And

Now I'm thinking in terms of the

10

next board meeting probably within the next

11

30 days.

12

We'll talk about that when we get down to those

13

dates.

14

I'm looking at the end of August.

Any other thoughts, comments?

15

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman, just for

16

clarification, I stated that last week the City

17

Council took action to recommend that the

18

Treasurer of the City serve as an Advisory

19

Member.

That's one of appointees made by the

20

Mayor.

Three by the Mayor three by this Board.

21

Just for clarification.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And the City Council is

23

helping the Mayor through that selection

24

process, we understand that.

Okay.

Any other

 21
1

thoughts?

2
3

(No response.)
Moving to the bylaws.

We all got a

4

copy of the bylaws.

They're pretty extensive.

5

I've asked David to talk a little bit about the

6

concept he used in developing them.
Thank you.

David?

7

MR. NAREFSKY:

So we tried

8

to I think achieve two purposes.

9

following sort of general best practices for

One was

10

Illinois non-for-profit corporations; but,

11

second, and maybe more importantly, was trying

12

to be completely sensitive to the requirements

13

that the City Council and -- the City Council

14

imposed on the Trust by virtue of the

15

authorizing ordinance and also the Mayor's

16

expectations for the Trust and the executive

17

order that he promulgated when the ordinance was

18

being adopted.

19

So there are a series of, you know,

20

transparency and best practices and openness

21

requirements that were in the ordinance and in

22

the executive order, and we thought it very

23

important that each one of those requirements

24

show up in the bylaws.

 22
1

And so in that regard the bylaws are

2

somewhat longer I suppose than the normal best

3

practices for non-for-profit corporations, but

4

it just seemed to us to be very important to

5

make that kind of a statement from the get go

6

about the seriousness with which the Trust is

7

taking its responsibilities pursuant to the

8

ordinance.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

with that I'll open for comments.

11

we need to vote on it.

12

vote on it today as to the incorporation.

13

do want us to have a common appreciation of what

14

the intent was and that is to try to incorporate

15

in our bylaws all the things that we have in our

16

confirmation hearings and we committed to go do

17

relative to transparency, openness of our

18

meetings and the mission itself in terms of the

19

financing with the best interests of the City of

20

Chicago in mind.

21

Thank you, David.

So

I don't think

In fact, I don't want to
But I

So I think we just got them out

22

within the last couple of days and so I don't

23

think anybody has really had enough time to

24

really go through it, but anyway, that's the

 23
1

spirit and the intent, and so if we can get

2

comments and get them done so that we can

3

consider them for our next meeting or the

4

meeting thereafter.

5

them done and we have a strong operating set of

6

framework, I think the better off we would be.

I think the sooner we get

7

Clearly we want to take the time to

8

make sure everyone is comfortable with them and

9

that they indeed do what we intend them to do.

10

Any other thoughts or comments?

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

12

I agree with you a hundred percent about the

13

timing.

14

impressive document. I appreciate, David, the

15

work of you and others in putting it together,

16

and I agree about taking the time to look at it

17

and ask questions and figure out -- make sure we

18

get it right.

19

This is I think a fairly long and

Just a couple of maybe preliminary

20

comments/questions.

First, I really -- I mean,

21

you know, I really appreciate that we have David

22

Narefsky to do things like this at the beginning

23

for us because if we don't have that kind of

24

assistance to put together bylaws by someone who

 24
1

knows what they're doing and is highly

2

experienced then we can't move forward, so I

3

really appreciate that and that shouldn't go

4

unnoted.

5

I think that going forward it will

6

be important for us in the right time frame to

7

ensure that whatever our -- whoever our counsel

8

is meets our independence standard and

9

that's without making any decisions in advance

10

about who that would be, I think that's

11

important, and we need to make sure that we're

12

receiving counsel that fits our independent

13

standard.

14

I had one -- I read this last night,

15

and without comparing it side by side with the

16

ordinance, I noted that it was going on at great

17

length to make sure, it seemed to me, that it

18

was following the provisions of the ordinance

19

and the executive orders, so I saw that,

20

including the parts that we were bound by the

21

Open Meetings Act and FOIA and so on.

22

appreciated that.

23
24

So I

I appreciate the opportunity to sort
of think about it and consult with folks about

 25
1

other provisions, but I think maybe just one

2

question.

3

policy which was attached, and I think that if

4

it's correct that we can also agree on a

5

conflict of interest policy at the next meeting,

6

that would be great.

7

It referred to a conflict of interest

So then I read the conflict of

8

interest policy.

And, you know, I thought part

9

of it was a bit confusing frankly, especially

10

that there are two different definitions of

11

financial interest here, one in the policy and

12

then one with a reference to the City's ethics

13

ordinance.

14

often those can be confusing enough.

15

I think that even if you have one,

But the other thing I was confused

16

about that I thought was worthy of maybe of a

17

little bit of discussion and question for you,

18

David, is there's an article at the end that's

19

bracketed so maybe it's a draft that says

20

conflicts of fiduciary duties.

21

there's two parts to that.

22

think understandably says that the Board

23

Members --

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

You know,

The first one I

Excuse me, Dave.

Can

 26
1

you reference specifically what page you're

2

looking at?

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

I'm on Pages 4 and

4

5 of the draft, conflicts of interest policy,

5

Article 10.

6

There's two parts.

One says, you

7

know, the directors may have other roles where

8

they are serving as directors and other things

9

or other positions, and if those two positions

10

come into conflict, they will have to decide

11

whether there's a conflict and deal with that

12

accordingly.

13

Then there's a special section for

14

when a voting director is an alderman, and it

15

says "and such director's fiduciary duties to

16

the Trust and to the City and/or his

17

constituents present a conflict of interest",

18

and then it talks about -- I'm sorry, John, I'm

19

on Section 10.2.

20

resolve this.

21

There's a discussion of how to

My question, David, is this.

And I

22

really ask this without thinking that there's

23

some clear resolution, but since we're just

24

getting started, I thought it was a good thing

 27
1
2

to talk about.
My reaction to that was I'm

3

thinking about the Trust and our duties where

4

our key duty is to think about whether in the

5

future a project is in the City's best

6

interests, whether it is in the public interest.

7

So I was confused as to when the Trust and the

8

City's interests would be "in conflict".

9

And I understand this was in

10

reference to a section regarding the alderman,

11

but the way I was -- I think, again, John, your

12

thoughts would be, of course, more than welcome

13

if you want to say something at this point, but

14

I'm thinking if we expect the alderman who's on

15

the Board to have two different hats, one for

16

the Trust and one as an alderman and decide

17

whether those two hats are in conflict, first,

18

that's a really difficult thing for him to do;

19

and, second, it seems inconsistent with the

20

vision of this as although we are a separate,

21

independent, non-for-profit corporation, our job

22

is to determine whether something -- to ensure

23

that something in our independent judgment is in

24

the public interest.

 28
1

So again very preliminarily I

2

thought it was worthy of discussion as we just

3

get started.

4

I wanted to ask you that question.

MR. NAREFSKY:

That's a fair question.

5

The initial thought process was at a much more

6

modest level I suppose, David.

7

Trust is expecting to receive some initial

8

funding from the City pursuant to grants that

9

were contemplated in the authorizing ordinance

You know, the

10

so it does -- you've got the alderman in a

11

situation where he's both a City official as an

12

alderman providing moneys to the Trust as a

13

separate enterprise, and so we really were just

14

trying to think about how best to handle that

15

kind of a situation and do it -- and nothing --

16

it's all transparent.

17

intended.

18

would be consistent with everyone's expectations

19

about conflict of interest considerations.

20

I think we know what's

We're trying to do it in a way that

Given that we've all got a little

21

bit of time to think some more about some I

22

think higher level issues that maybe you were

23

raising, I'm not -- we have to think about that

24

some more.

I'm not sure I have sort of an easy

 29
1

answer off the top of my head.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Another circumstance

3

could be where the City is authorizing or

4

approving a project separate and above from the

5

funding structure would come to us.

6

could be in a situation there where he has to

7

decide how he wants to deal with it.

8
9

And John

So I think we should think through
it.

I think it's a good point, David.

I can

10

see it happening, you know, where we're only

11

interested in -- not only interested but our

12

responsibility is the alternative funding

13

source.

14

agencies that develop the project and go through

15

their approval process.

16

that those agencies really want to prioritize,

17

it's something that they'll get done.

18

It will usually be the City or other

If that's something

I mean, we're going to have some

19

circumstances -- We're going to have to learn as

20

we go.

21

talked about, I think all of us up here are

22

going to be in a circumstance at some point in

23

time where we have to recuse ourselves because

24

of our prior lives and our prior -- our current

I think one of the things this Board has

 30
1

interests in some cases.

2

I'm on the board of a bank, for

3

instance, so if JP Morgan Chase chose to want to

4

make an infrastructure investment, I would

5

recuse myself for the whole deal.

6

not -- I don't want to have the perception of,

7

you know, conflict.

8

the same if it was your law firm involved.

9

I just would

And I think you would do

I think we just got to work our way

10

through it.

11

intent is to be completely transparent and to be

12

completely independent, and this Board is going

13

to act and do what we have to do to make that

14

happen.

15

to the City.

I think that's what our commitment is

16
17

I think the key point here is our

Any other comments?

Any other

thoughts?

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Responsibilities

20

of the Board Members.

You know, I think some of

21

what we just said is part and parcel of that.

22

think now that we have been confirmed and we are

23

operating as a Board, we now have to think about

24

how we act going forward as it relates to the

I

 31
1
2

Trust.
I mean, we're no longer individuals

3

in terms of that concept.

4

sure as Board Members we always think about, you

5

know, what the Board has decided and what the

6

Board has come to a consensus on in terms of how

7

we're going to operate or how we're going to

8

view the business of this Board, and that

9

obviously has to always be in the context of our

10

overarching tenants, transparency, openness and

11

doing what is right for the City and for its

12

constituencies.

13

I mean, we have to be

But the fact of the matter is that

14

the Board Members have to act as a Board, not as

15

individuals, as we conduct this business, and

16

that's going to be our intent.

17

that, that's sounds easy, but as you can see,

18

we're going to have differences of opinion as to

19

how to do what's right.

20

Now, having said

We're not going to have a difference

21

on the fact that our intent is to do the right

22

thing and do what's best for the City, but how

23

to get to that point there's usually going to be

24

more than one way and there's going to be

 32
1

different views on the best ways to get there,

2

and this Board and the individuals on the Board,

3

the Board Members, are going to have to decide

4

through a process which is we'll vote on things

5

and we'll come to a consensus, and then that's

6

got to be how we move forward, that we're all

7

going to support what the Board action is.

8
9

And so I wanted to have this on
there because I think our bylaws have a pretty

10

detailed discussion of all the things we need to

11

do and do right, but the devil is always in the

12

detail.

13

As you get the individual

14

transactions, as we talk about certain topics,

15

we obviously are going to have different views.

16

I want those different views aired out in this

17

forum.

18

discussions.

19

all of us are thinking as it relates to any of

20

the issues that are put in front of us, and we

21

got to have a candid, honest discussion, and we

22

move on after the Board decides which direction

23

to go.

24

manage secrets and so I want everybody to feel

I mean, we absolutely have to have those
We absolutely have to know what

We can manage information.

We can't

 33
1
2

comfortable to speak out.
The other thing is every Board

3

Member has one vote.

4

only have one vote.

5

what happens here, nor would I want to, and so

6

that's why it's even more important that all

7

Board Members feel very, very comfortable in

8

this forum to speak their minds and put issues

9

or concerns on the table so they can be

10
11

I'm the Chairman but I
It's not like I can dictate

addressed at the Board level.
That's all I wanted to say about

12

that, but I did want to get any input from the

13

Board Members as to their thoughts about those

14

roles and responsibilities.

15

MR. RAMIREZ:

I think it's an important

16

agenda item, Mr. Chairman, and, you know, I

17

think it's important that we think about how we

18

handle the public, not just at these forums, but

19

I know that I have already received some calls

20

as well from different folks, and once we start

21

to make decisions, get involved in the

22

decision-making process, it's going to be

23

important that we understand, you know, how to

24

lay that out and how to move forward when it

 34
1

comes to dealing with the community, dealing

2

with the press, dealing with the financial

3

institutions.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I think it's

5

extremely important as a Board that we have

6

commonality of message.

7

got to decide what we're going to do and then

8

that has got to be the message we take forward

9

regardless if you have a different view during

10

I mean, this Board has

the discussion.

11

Once we decide as a Board that

12

we're going to go in this direction or this is

13

how we're going to operate then that should be

14

the message we take forth as individuals as we

15

talk to the external stakeholders in this

16

process.

17

We just have to operate that way,

18

otherwise it just causes dissension and it

19

causes us to not be cohesive as a Board, and we

20

won't be able to move this process forward.

21

So hopefully we all are in

22

agreement with that.

23

what a different approach ought to be for us.

24

Okay.

If not, I'd like to hear

Let's see.

Applications to

 35
1

the IRS for the 501 status.

2

package or something we need to talk about?

3
4

MR. NAREFSKY:

No.

Was that in the

It's information on

something --

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MR. NAREFSKY:

We got to do?
Once the Trust is

7

incorporated I think the vision of the

8

organization was that it would be --

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. NAREFSKY:

Non-for-profit.
-- important to do that

11

or good reasons obviously to achieve that.

12

It's just to note for everyone's benefit that

13

it's a useful next step, one of the useful next

14

steps.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Absolutely important.

16

We got to do that.

17

wife, you surely don't want to cross the IRS.

18

So clearly that's something we got to get done.

19
20
21
22
23
24

Okay.

Second to crossing your

Any other comments or

discussion?
(No response.)
Lois, you're going to give us an
overview of the first project?
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Thank

 36
1

you, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations to

2

everyone.

3

which is in your packages this morning.

4

I have a very short presentation

The first and only project that the

5

City is intending to present to the Chicago

6

Infrastructure Trust --

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Ms. Scott, welcome.

I

8

looked at the court reporter as you started.

9

You have the disease that I have which is

10
11
12
13

talking very rapidly.
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:
was being slow.

And I

Thanks.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I know.

Just for only

14

the benefit of the court reporter, whatever you

15

can do to slow the pace down, again a problem I

16

can appreciate.

17
18

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

I'm

happy to do that.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

21

City of Chicago is working on one project which

22

we intend to bring to the Trust and we're

23

calling that Retrofit Chicago.

24

Thank you.
So the

I'm going to give just a very short

 37
1

overview of that project.

2

under development and very fluid as we speak,

3

but what we want to give you, the Board, the

4

earliest possible look at what we're thinking

5

about from the Retrofit Chicago Project.

6

It is still very much

Retrofit Chicago is about energy

7

savings, reducing our cost of financing and risk

8

transfer to private parties, and importantly we

9

hope to do that with job creation for our

10
11

community.
We expect that the project will be

12

approximately $200 million.

13

all in one moment in time, but approximately

14

$200 million investment program to drive energy

15

efficiencies not just for the City but also for

16

our sister agencies.

17

That won't happen

For those of you who are not

18

familiar with how the City itself works, the

19

sister agencies include the Chicago Park

20

District, Chicago Public Schools, CHA, CTA and

21

the City Colleges, among some other

22

organizations.

23

The energy savings themselves are

24

intended to finance the capital improvements.

 38
1

These may include things like improved lighting

2

systems, energy dashboards, HVAC systems,

3

windows, et cetera.

4

The facilities to be improved will

5

include a number of City of Chicago buildings

6

throughout our City, many of our Chicago Public

7

Schools and certain water pumping stations.

8

expect the energy savings to be approximately

9

20 percent of the energy costs associated with

10
11

We

those improvements.
Because we're aggregating so many

12

different projects, we expect that we'll be

13

staging what we bring in front of the Chicago

14

Infrastructure Trust.

15

from our working group, we're putting them into

16

different project cohorts.

17

We're putting them --

Retrofit 1 maybe approximately 25 to

18

50 million, largely for projects identified by

19

the City of Chicago's Fleet and Facility

20

Management Office to include things like

21

retrofitting lightings in certain buildings,

22

programs improving windows, et cetera.

23

We also know that we have a number

24

of City of Chicago Public School projects that

 39
1

are ready to move.

2

dashboards into schools so they can monitor the

3

use of energy in real time.

4

appears to be coming together quite nicely and

5

will form the first cohort.

6

These include putting energy

That project

The second cohort would likely look

7

at the Department of Water Management.

They

8

have a number of very sizeable pumping stations

9

that are going to be converted from steam power

10

to electricity.

11

with those are very significant, and the savings

12

would be sufficient to finance the necessary

13

conversion costs.

14

The cost savings associated

Because they're very sizeable and

15

unique to the Department of Water Management, we

16

believe we'll bring them separately in their own

17

cohort to the trust.

18

Retrofit 3 will be projects that are

19

not quite ready but are being developed by our

20

various City departments, including Fleet and

21

Facility Management and the Department of

22

Aviation as well as further CPA projects.

23
24

And finally is the fourth bucket of
retrofit projects that we expect will be

 40
1

developed over the coming 18 to 24 months.

2

In developing our finance plans that

3

we would like to bring to the Trust for

4

consideration, there are a number of proof

5

points that we are working to make sure we

6

satisfy.

7

is more operational.

The first is financing and the second

8
9

I'll speak first to the financing
goals.

The first is can we attract funding from

10

multiple sources of capital, many of which we as

11

a City do not presently benefit from.

12

include public pension fund -- excuse me,

13

pension funds, labor friendly investment funds,

14

community reinvestment act dollars from banks,

15

charitable organizations and foundations both

16

interested in making grants and making program

17

related investments, alternative investment

18

programs and, of course, infrastructure

19

investors.

20

These

The second proof point is can we

21

aggregate the needs of our City in a somewhat

22

different way than we have done before.

23

the City has a project, the City finances.

24

schools have a project, schools finance.

When
When

One of

 41
1

the proof points we would like to show to the

2

Trust and to the public is that we can get

3

savings and efficiency by consolidating some of

4

these needs.

5

The third, as Alderman Pope spoke

6

about, which I fully support, is the ability can

7

we really transfer risk off the back of our

8

taxpayers in a real genuine risk transfer

9

device.

10

The fourth financial proof point we

11

would like to bring to the Trust is can we

12

achieve a diversified and efficient capital

13

structure that may include senior debt,

14

subordinated debt and forms of equity.

15

are the four elements that we are hoping to put

16

from a financial perspective in front of the

17

Trust.

18

Those

In terms of energy savings, we also

19

have proof points that we would like to bring to

20

the Trust, and that is that we can expand beyond

21

the traditional ways of financing infrastructure

22

through the Retrofit Chicago Program.

23

to demonstrate tangible savings among our

24

different entities and achieve energy savings of

We want

 42
1

approximately 20 percent.

2

proof points that we'll bring to the Trust.

3

Those will also be

And with that I'll take any

4

questions that you may have and I just want to

5

reiterate that this is a very fluid process.

6

expect there to be lots of changes along the way

7

as certain projects come into or out of focus

8

depending on what savings we can generate on

9

them, and we look forward to working with the

10

Trust on a process that really fulfills your

11

desires for transparency, openness and real

12

savings for our community.

13
14
15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you, Lois.

Any

comments, questions?
MR. HOFFMAN:

I've got a few questions.

16

I really appreciate your presentation.

17

very helpful.

18

your last comment about it being fluid, I

19

really appreciate that.

20

important.

21

We

It's

Maybe the first thing I'd say is

I think that's so

I think one of the mistakes arguably

22

in the past was the instinct to want to develop

23

everything behind closed doors, wrap it up

24

really nicely with a bow and then just be done

 43
1

as opposed to what I think we're doing now which

2

is developing something gradually in a more open

3

process and not be afraid to say, you know, it's

4

going to change along the way, which is just

5

what you said and I think that's important.

6

just a comment on that.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So

Lois, I have a couple

8

of things.

Obviously we got to get staffed

9

before we can really address this project.

I'm

10

assuming in the interim it's going through the

11

normal City approval and transparency.

12

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

13

everything will be normal City approval process

14

and Board of Ed or any of the sister agencies

15

that are involved.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes,

Yeah, because I want to

17

keep -- make sure that we keep clear on what

18

this Trust responsibility is and what remains

19

with the City and the other agencies which is

20

the process of getting projects approved.

21

You know, they do that and then once

22

that's done then it could come to us.

Remember,

23

we're not eliminating the other sources of

24

funding these projects.

We're trying to expand

 44
1

them by having this alternative and seeing if

2

some of these projects that would be otherwise

3

approved by their agencies or by the City, to

4

see if there's another way to do it, to

5

accelerate it and to relieve some of the

6

pressure on the budget.

7

I want us to make sure we stay

8

mindful of that.

You know, hopefully that, you

9

know, just because we're not acting yet, you're

10

still going through that process and you're

11

still getting the amount of transparency and

12

openness in the right forums.

13

So I'm going to assume, John, you've

14

seen some of this or you will see it before it

15

comes to us and the City Council will have a

16

chance to weigh in and that the project itself

17

will be conducted using the City's processes and

18

the City's due diligence.

19

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

A couple of substantive

questions.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

Right.

I'm sorry.

No.

didn't want to cut you off.

No.

I'm sorry.

I

 45
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

Go ahead.

And then I want to go

3

back and maybe have a discussion among ourselves

4

if you're amenable about the process for

5

selection.

6

But to jump in on a couple -- first

7

of all, the two proof points, the first page of

8

the proof points that had the four bullets, I'm

9

not really diving into it, and I think that my

10

reaction is simply that I appreciate the

11

framework and I know this will -- I will

12

continue to have questions going forward once we

13

get into the nitty gritty based on this

14

framework, but I think it feels to me as someone

15

who doesn't know as much as you do on this that

16

it's a good framework.

17

The only question I have now for

18

your reaction is on the first one, attract

19

multiple sources of capital.

20

question from people, and it's quite

21

hypothetical at this point, but why is this

22

likely to be better than just the generic

23

traditional process of issuing bonds?

24

When we hear the

I see this first bullet point as a

 46
1

significant part of the answer.

2

view about whether I'm thinking about that the

3

right way.

4

know you've thought about that.

5

that question, is this one of the important

6

points?

7

I know you talked about this.

very important point.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

I

When we get

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

8

10

I wanted your

It's a

Can you explain that a

little bit?
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

One of

12

the key areas for the Trust is basically

13

expanding the universe of investors who will

14

take a look at projects.

15

So typically the City of Chicago or

16

any government looks to the tax exempt bond

17

marketplace, and the tax exempt bond marketplace

18

prefers projects where the taxpayer remains on

19

the hook.

20

The reason that they are low

21

interest rates in tax exempt bonds are really

22

two things.

23

exemption but also because it is backed up by

24

the communities taxing ability.

One because of the federal tax

So the risk is

 47
1

borne by the taxpayers on these projects.

2

But the tax exempt market is a very

3

small subset of investable dollars in the world,

4

a very small subset, and probably with the

5

continuing economic crisis a smaller and

6

smaller percentage of folks are in a tax paying

7

concern.

8

You know, increasingly the amount of

9

people who have a demand for tax exempt income

10

is shrinking so we want to tap into the much,

11

much broader world of investment capital to

12

bring that to our doorstep and actually take a

13

look at what they can offer as well.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you for the

15

explanation.

16

don't know enough about the details and you know

17

much more so I really appreciate the educational

18

comments on it.

19

You know, when I read -- I just

When I read what President Clinton

20

has written about this generally in the past,

21

this is one of the main points he makes.

22

is something that Jorge has stressed to me in

23

talking about this, and it seems like a good

24

point.

This

I think the question will be whether it

 48
1

comes to fruition, but I think it seems like a

2

very good point.

3

The second question on the next page

4

is in your third bullet point about energy

5

savings.

6

is tentative and fluid, a question to sort of

7

help us think about this.

8
9

Again with the understanding all this

So my understanding about what the
City is tentatively thinking about this is that

10

the reason that investors -- the way that

11

investors will get a return from this would be

12

that they would share in the energy savings that

13

are anticipated.

14

In other words, the savings that the

15

City expects from the energy -- lower energy

16

costs is how the City will pay some rate of

17

return to the investors.

18

tentative thought as I understand it.

19

It's sort of a

And if I'm right about that, what is

20

the initial tentative thought about what if

21

we're wrong.

22

we believe and how do you think about the risk

23

to the City and/or the Trust if the energy

24

savings aren't as achieved, you know, as

What if the energy are less than

 49
1

expected?

2

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

3

think implicit in your question is that there's

4

only one type of investment return, and if you

5

look at the preceding page, the last bullet

6

point is that we want to see if we can package

7

something with a diversified capital structure.

8
9

Well, I

So some investors will be paid and
have an economic win or loss based on the

10

savings, but there might also be a level of debt

11

that is debt that is based on a cash flow and a

12

coverage level and less risk transfer.

13

But at the bottom, a small

14

percentage on the equity side will have the risk

15

transfer whether the savings have actually been

16

achieved or not.

17

But one of the important pieces

18

here is that we want to see if we can transfer

19

that risk to the private sector so if it's a win

20

or loss that they're picking up that risk.

21

It would be our hope that at some

22

point the Trust would entertain whether it

23

should also retain an ownership interest in that

24

gain or loss as well.

 50
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I would say that

2

that makes sort of logical sense and we'll see

3

how it plays out.

4

conversation and I know the proof will be in the

5

details and how it's applied and I'll look

6

forward to having further versions of this

7

conversation when more details arrive.

8
9

I appreciate the early

The last thing on this,
Mr. Chairman, and this is really about our

10

process, sort of a question about our process.

11

As you have heard me say before the Finance

12

Committee, my early thinking about our

13

organizational processes is that there's only

14

three things we're going to be doing.

15

One is selecting the project

16

generally.

17

terms or parameters would be of a potential deal

18

and, therefore, the document that we want to

19

send out to the world and say is anyone

20

interested in bidding on this.

21

third is the process for assessing bids or

22

proposals that come in.

23
24

Second would be deciding what the

And then the

So the question about the first
stage, which is really probably the easiest one,

 51
1

is what should be our process for selecting

2

projects.

3

at the beginning because this one, you know, I'd

4

like to hear if, you know, we'll have a chance

5

to flush out whether there are dissenting views

6

and reasons why the Trust shouldn't take this as

7

a first project.

8
9

Arguably this may end up being easy

But just hearing from Lois and
thinking about it and looking at this, looking

10

at presentation, it certainly seems like a good

11

project and very different from one where the

12

City, for instance, is contemplating leasing a

13

significant amount of its assets for many years.

14

That's not what this project appears to be

15

doing.

16

So it seems fairly straight forward

17

and noncontroversial to adopt it as the first

18

project, but I note that her first point was

19

that it's anticipated to be the first project,

20

and my expectation is that it would be normal

21

for the City, the administration to propose a

22

project and then the Trust to decide we agree.

23
24

So I thought it might be helpful -I think it would be useful for us to create a

 52
1

document, that may be a very short document,

2

that sets out our procedures for selection of

3

projects.

4

So with that --

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think we ought to

5

talk about it, but clearly I think the project

6

has to create some kind of revenue service to

7

debt.

8

initially is going to be very tough for us to

9

figure out a structure that is, you know,

10
11

I mean, I think to go beyond that

external money involved.
Maybe there are investors that just

12

want to invest in infrastructure in cities and

13

they just think it's good reputationally for

14

their organization.

15

I don't know.

But I think if you look at a return

16

and having to be serviced and it's not on the

17

backs of the taxpayers, then the individual

18

project has to create a revenue source that

19

we're comfortable with and would allow us to

20

service the debt.

21

And then also you have to look at it

22

from the standpoint that there's not a windfall

23

in the way that the deal is structured to the

24

person that makes the investment so that they

 53
1

get obviously a huge return, a much higher

2

return on it than what the risks would support,

3

the risk posture would support.

4

But I think we got to flush it out,

5

David.

I think that we're not going to go out

6

seeking projects.

7

agencies are going to bring things to the table,

8

and we got to sort through does it make sense to

9

structure a deal -- does the project have the

The City and the other

10

tenants that make sense to structure a deal that

11

you can take to an external financing source.

12

So I think we're going to figure

13

that out.

This one seems to have some of it,

14

but you raised the point.

15

20 percent savings, you got to be sure that that

16

exists, and more importantly the investor has

17

got to be sure it exists because there will be

18

no recourse to the City of Chicago.

I mean, the

19

I mean, it's got to be -- it's going

20

to be on that deal and they are going to have it

21

take the risk of that.

22

the detail.

23

there.

24

The devil will be in the

I think you are absolutely right

We got to work our way through it.
MR. RAMIREZ:

Mr. Chairman, I think

 54
1

it's important for folks to understand as well

2

that for the folks that are going to be playing

3

with this on the investment side, this is no

4

different than any other investment they engage

5

in.

6

We're not asking them to do

7

something riskier than they have done in the

8

past.

9

kick the tires on this investment, gather due

10

diligence like they would any other investment

11

on it.

They're going to value this investment,

12

I think one of the things that we do

13

is we take a hundred percent of the burden of

14

the project away from the taxpayer and spread

15

that risk with these folks that are going to

16

determine whether or not it's a healthy

17

investment for them as well.

18

So it's going to be interesting for

19

me as part of this process to see how they kind

20

of evaluate this and kick the tires.

21

going to engage in common due diligence

22

amongst -- if there's more than one or how will

23

it work?

24

find out shortly.

I don't know.

Are they

I think we're going to

 55
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Going back to this issue

2

of creating procedures for our selection of

3

projects.

4

we would be taking a vote or making a decision

5

about whether X is a project that we're going to

6

do.

I was anticipating that at some point

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

We will.

And so a question about

sort of the timing of that.

And then, second,

10

is there agreement that we should create some

11

documents that I think can be quite broad but

12

something that sets out procedures for

13

selection?

14

And to add to that, I agree with

15

you that it would be normal and expected that

16

most of the projects will probably come to us

17

as suggestions from the administration.

18

think that's the point of this and consistent

19

with it.

20

I

I also think that it would make

21

sense to provide some sort of vehicle for

22

suggestions from outside the administration

23

because people are likely to have very good

24

ideas about possible projects.

 56
1

I think if the administration thinks

2

that something is a bad idea, it's not going to

3

have any legs because basically -- you know, at

4

the end of day when we're done, it's got to be a

5

City project.

6

But I think it would be a useful

7

tool -- the Trust can serve as a useful vehicle

8

to provide for the receipt of ideas outside of

9

the administration.

I think in that regard we

10

would probably just be passing them along to the

11

administration for their consideration.

12

a very --

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's

I guess from me, from

14

my perspective I think that would be

15

overwhelming for the Trust at this stage.

16

could be something we could do downstream, but,

17

you know, again I think the project has to have

18

a supporter, and it's the City's infrastructure

19

we're talking about, so it's going to come from

20

the City or one of the other agencies.

21

So it

I mean, coming directly to us

22

without getting vetted through those other

23

processes, I'm not sure what we do other than to

24

send it to them.

I mean, that's my point.

I

 57
1

think they should be -- we should encourage them

2

to bring them up through the normal processes

3

that they would have, either as an agency or the

4

City in terms of getting that project vetted or

5

getting it aired out and having the due

6

diligence.

7

And then once that's done then they

8

got to look at what are the sources of

9

financing, and in some cases some of those

10

projects may have enough in them, and I firmly

11

believe they got to have some ability to create

12

revenue to service the debt or get third party

13

financing and then they would come to us.

14

I mean, I think it won't be that

15

many.

16

detail and that's why you don't see one of these

17

trusts in every city in the country because

18

everybody is having budget pressures and

19

everybody has the same challenge.

20

I really do believe the devil is in the

So I don't envision that we're going

21

to see a lot of things that is going to say

22

automatically this thing will work.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
was -- I mean --

Yeah, I guess what I

 58
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

about should we have a document.

3

has to be high level.

4

these things is going to be so different.

5

And to your other point
If we do, it

I think every one of

I think the whole point is, yeah, as

6

a Board we're going to have to vote on whether

7

it makes sense for us to even try to take this

8

thing out to the market.

9

to do with every project.

10

That's what we've got

I'm open to a process or document.

11

I just don't know how detailed it could be.

12

has to be pretty much what we've already said.

13

We got to look at everything on the value and

14

say does it meet some of the fundamental

15

requirements that you can package and get a

16

deal, and particularly since, you know, as part

17

of our -- the way the ordinance reads, we can't

18

structure a deal that has some impact back to

19

the citizens of the City.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

It

We just can't do it.

I guess I was thinking

21

that, and maybe it's combined with the document

22

that sets our procedures for setting the terms

23

of a potential deal, but I think it would useful

24

for clarity that we know whether topic one is on

 59
1

our docket for development either by us or by

2

the staff, future staff, of what the terms will

3

be.

4

And I think that it would be useful

5

for us to make that decision, have something

6

which I think, as you said, is what is

7

contemplated and have something that says that

8

once that decision is made yes, we agree as a

9

Trust that retrofit is something that should be

10

examined and we ask someone to start developing

11

the potential terms that then we go forward.

12

A question for Lois on my thought

13

about -- you know, what I'm imagining is once

14

the Trust later has a website and actually has

15

someone to look at this stuff that it might be

16

useful to be a vehicle to receive public

17

proposals -- I agree with James.

18

we serve much role at the beginning other than

19

to just pass them along, but in a way if it's a

20

useful vehicle to attract ideas, why not?

21

really you're maybe the best person to react to

22

that.

I'm not sure

But

What's your thought on that?

23

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

I think

24

the public has many ideas and I think if we can

 60
1

create a place where those ideas can be

2

presented, and we can collectively move the City

3

and the agencies as well as us to try to work

4

through how to prioritize the ideas that the

5

public want to be.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I do think that the

7

public is going to view us as a receptacle for

8

those ideas, David, so I think the thought about

9

how we deal with that is something we need to

10
11

address.
I don't think they will fully

12

understand, you know, how finite our role is in

13

this overall process so we do need a way to

14

capture them and then get them to the

15

appropriate channels.

16

we got to take under consideration.

17
18
19

So I think it's something

Any other thoughts or any other
questions for Lois?
MS. FERGUSON:

Just in terms of

20

prioritization maybe, can you just remind us,

21

Lois, given the enormous list of potential

22

infrastructure projects that the City would

23

contemplate, how did Retrofit come to the top

24

of the list as your initial proposal for the

 61
1

Trust?

2

you just remind us?

3

Why was it prioritized by the City?

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Can

I think

4

because it has the best opportunity to really

5

demonstrate what the Trust can offer in terms of

6

(unintelligible) capital because we see a very

7

specific savings stream for the taxpayers

8

because we are not doing these projects today.

9

We need -- additionally, they are too small to

10
11

to do.
I think the goals is to aggregate to

12

really attract capital.

13

without having an increase in revenues.

14

really all about taking -- getting savings we

15

are currently not capitalizing on and using that

16

to strengthen and rebuild our infrastructure and

17

to produce jobs.

18

All of those things are
It's

When we have this number of

19

buildings that we need to be touched throughout

20

our City, we have the opportunity to have

21

workers in all of these communities really

22

helping build our City and moving forward.

23

It seems to meet the goals and

24

criteria that we were talking about prior to the

 62
1

creation of the Board as a way of trying to do

2

something very different in transforming the

3

community.

4
5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Have you looked into

issuing bonds for this project now?

6

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

We

7

have.

So as part of the process, one of the

8

things the Trust is required to do under the

9

executive order is to evaluate alternative

10

financing structures and strategies to make sure

11

the Trust is additive and important.

12

You know, it's difficult to do a

13

$500,000 retrofit project for one school because

14

the contractors would like that work and we

15

would be happy to finance the cost with bonds,

16

but we believe there are better and stronger

17

ways of doing that.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I guess, Lois, the real

19

question to get down to is would you just be

20

looking for projects that have the possibility

21

of being financed other than through the

22

traditional sources to bring to the Trust?

23

mean, is that sort of the mind set of this City

24

and the other agencies?

I

 63
1

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

That is

2

the mind set.

3

remember that the overall capital plan on the

4

City that's been announced by the administration

5

is a $7.2 billion program.

6

that's being proposed for the Trust -- proposed

7

to the Trust.

8
9

I think it's important to

Of that 200 million

The 7 billion itself we intend to
proceed with, whether that is Aviation, CTA,

10

school, et cetera.

11

that right now is to focus on that $200 million

12

piece which is somewhat different than

13

traditional capital needs and ongoing needs of

14

our City.

15

The Trust's role in all of

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And the reason I ask

16

that for the other Board Members is that I think

17

the bulk of what the City is going to do and the

18

other agencies in terms of improving their

19

infrastructure won't have a ghost of a chance of

20

going through an alternative source of

21

financing.

22

They just won't.
There's no way to structure a deal

23

that they would want to take the risk on and

24

there's probably no way for us to pay for it out

 64
1

of the project either, and so I think it will be

2

very limited.

3

into what there is a possibility for us to do

4

and what there isn't, and it will be a very

5

small percentage of the overall effort I would

6

think.

It will be very obvious as we get

Anyway we'll see.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chairman, do you

8

anticipate -- what is your thinking about the

9

timing of when the Board would decide about

10

whether this project is going to be our first

11

project?

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, we got to get

13

staffed first so we can have our people --

14

getting back to the independence, we've got to

15

have an executive director that we'll talk

16

about later or a financial advisor that can look

17

at this and advise us as to whether or not this

18

is something that really makes sense for us to

19

do.

20

Because I think the key is sorting

21

through this savings, how do you ensure and

22

guarantee it, and then we can somehow rely on a

23

portion of that being used as the revenue to

24

fund it.

 65
1

So I don't know what the timing of

2

that is, David.

First and foremost we got to

3

get the staff up and running.

4

that sooner rather than later but we got to get

5

the right people.

6

that.

7

before we're staffed.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'd like to do

It's going to be dependent on

I don't think we start taking a project

I agree.
Okay.

Moving onto the

10

financial report.

I mean, this is just for

11

information only.

We have an initial budget and

12

seed money in the budget of $200,000 for the

13

rest of this year and that we'll obviously use

14

to try to get staffed.

15

all of it with the timing of it.

16

We probably won't need

And then we have 2 million in seed

17

money that we have investors interested in

18

putting up.

19

be granted to us by a grant from the City which

20

we don't have yet.

21

All of that will have to ultimately

That's something just to be sure

22

we're aware of is coming and then we'll have to

23

work our way through, but that's what's expected

24

initially both in operating budget and for seed

 66
1
2

money.
Staff support, you know, we sent out

3

the job description for the executive director.

4

We have also talked about -- I talked with Lois

5

and David about the idea of in the interim

6

having a financial advisor or if the Board chose

7

to always use a financial advisor as opposed to

8

have permanent staff, and I think that's

9

something we should decide on now, how we want

10
11

to approach that.
Obviously we need to get the job

12

description posted in a manner that's public,

13

that is consistent with the best practices that

14

the City has in their hiring, and we obviously

15

don't have just obvious ways to go do that, and

16

we've talked about that.

17

But I'm really interested from the

18

Board's perspective on how do we ensure that

19

once we decide that we want to go with an

20

inhouse executive director, how do we get that

21

posted so that it gets as much public exposure

22

as possible and then we can start figuring out

23

how to sort through and screen those candidates.

24

And also I'd like to flush out the

 67
1

concept of do we want to consider in the interim

2

having a financial advisor until we can go out

3

and find somebody either to do it pro bono or

4

someone from the City's preapproved list of

5

advisors that we can get up on speed sooner

6

rather than later.

7

for discussion.

8
9

So I would throw that out

MR. HOFFMAN:

The job description, I

haven't had a chance to take a look at it.

I

10

know we received it as a draft, but I'd like to

11

take a look at it today or tomorrow, but I would

12

think that subject to everyone's comments on the

13

Board, my guess is that that is likely to be

14

ready to get out the door in a few days.

15

I'm no expert in where we would post

16

it.

I had mentioned to you that I thought that

17

from a combination of HR experts at the City,

18

finance experts of the City and other people who

19

we could consult with outside of the City on

20

both those things, there's going to be a finite

21

set of either trade or subject related places to

22

post it both online and in publications, and

23

that would be -- it seems to me that once you

24

hit the sort of core group of those places to

 68
1

publish that word gets out and that's about the

2

best you can do and that we'll need to set a

3

deadline for when applications are due and then

4

probably set -- you know, I think probably best

5

case scenario is that the person is starting 30

6

to 60 days after that depending on who we pick

7

and their schedule.

8

Those are my thoughts.

I think on the financial advisor as

9

a matter of -- when you mentioned the City's

10

preapproved list, was that a -- because that

11

would be a legal requirement or just an easy

12

list to go from?

13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, one or two

14

things.

For timing purposes if you don't go to

15

that list then you have to open it up to a

16

permit process that you go out and it will run

17

as long as probably it takes to hire the

18

executive director, and so again the interim

19

solution is either that preapproved list or

20

someone that would be willing to do it pro bono

21

temporarily and then we go with the permanent

22

executive going through the normal process which

23

is going to take a while.

24

reason we considered that.

That was the only

 69
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think it's fair that at

2

the beginning we're going to need some interim

3

short-term solutions, and there's no rush, but

4

on the other hand just as a matter of being

5

practical, what you're saying makes sense,

6

especially if it's clear at the beginning that

7

it's just an interim solution then I agree.

8
9

MR. RAMIREZ:

Starting in reverse

order, I think the financial advisor is probably

10

a prudent thing to do so we can start getting

11

our brain around this project and others.

12

But on the Health and Hospital

13

Systems Board, which I serve on, under similar

14

pressures at the beginning to get things done

15

and to get positions hired and management, we

16

were very successful in using a search firm to

17

do that.

18

don't think we should overlook.

19

of vetting as well, and if you get somebody

20

who's an expert in this area or in these areas,

21

they'll know where to go to get a lot of the

22

candidates.

23
24

It's an option that's out there that I

CHAIRMAN BELL:
bono?

They do a lot

Do they do it pro

 70
1

MR. RAMIREZ:

No, we paid a fee for it,

2

but either way I think it would cut through

3

some of the red tape and might be worth looking

4

at.

5

MS. FERGUSON:

Mr. Chairman, just to

6

echo what Mr. Ramirez has highlighted, I think

7

we would be well served to potentially have a

8

search firm to help vet some of the candidates

9

and potential applicants and help us screen them

10

versus our job description and the competencies

11

that we're looking for.

12

I also think that referencing and

13

picking from the pool of preapproved financial

14

advisors is practical from an expediency

15

standpoint, and they are no doubt well

16

recognized and reputable firms that have been

17

vetted for this type of work, so it would be

18

credible in lending their expertise, so I would

19

be strongly in favor of that.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

John?

21

ALDERMAN POPE:

I'm in full agreement

22

understanding that that advisory firm would

23

possibly recuse themselves from any votes or

24

action immediately for the Board.

 71
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Just to state an obvious

2

point, I mean, I think it's not inherently

3

inconsistent to choose someone off the list,

4

but, you know, as we've -- this is echoing a

5

comment that we've all made, that an independent

6

financial advisor, you know, the underlying

7

adjective there is going to be independent, and

8

as long as we're assessing that when we make the

9

choice, then I'm comfortable with that.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, I was just going

11

to make that point.

I am sensitive to the

12

independence issue.

I am also balancing that

13

with the practicality of, you know, we can't do

14

it ourselves and we need to get someone up and

15

running as quickly as possible.

16

The recuse part, that is part of the

17

issue.

18

exact point because they would rather

19

participate in some of the deals and provide the

20

advisory services and we will not let them do

21

both.

22

Some won't want to do it because of that

There's no question about that.
We've asked one firm to do it pro

23

bono.

I think they told us no.

We'll ask some

24

more.

I'm not ashamed to ask them for free

 72
1

work, you know.

2

living in this City, some of them should feel

3

some conscience in helping us to do this.

4

just need to figure out how to go forward.

5

I mean, since they make their

So we

So I want to make sure I got the

6

right census here.

7

permanent director, is that pretty much what I'm

8

hearing?

9

So search firm for the

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think it makes sense.

10

I would like to hear what ultimately that's

11

going to cost.

12
13

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're going to ask for

it for free first.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

I am with that.

15

MS. FERGUSON:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

A civic minded firm.
I've got to be sure I'm

17

not creating a conflict of interest.

Some of

18

these people owe me from my prior life, you

19

know, and I want to be sure that I separate

20

that.

21

Board goes out and given what we're trying to do

22

for the City in which they reside that, you

23

know, they can provide us some services.

24

is not going to be a huge search.

But I think it's reasonable that this

This

It shouldn't

 73
1

be a huge amount of effort on their part.

2

Now, the financial advisory services

3

I think they may be a little different because

4

they are a lot smaller, I think, and it may tax

5

their resources and we may not have as much

6

success on asking pro bono.

7

But anyway, let's go out and look at

8

the search firms for the permanent director and

9

let's look at the list and see if there's

10

somebody on there that maybe one of us knows and

11

and could contact and then let's see if we can

12

get them to do it pro bono, and, if not, if they

13

can do it at a discounted rate and, if not, a

14

good deal.

15

ALDERMAN POPE:

I agree, Chairman.

16

Just a clarification, this person would not be a

17

City employee and thus not subject to City

18

residency requirements, am I correct, or maybe

19

some of our counsel can add some advice.

20

MR. NAREFSKY:

21

MR. RAMIREZ:

22

MR. NAREFSKY:

That's correct.
What is?
City residency

23

requirements do not apply to employees of the

24

Trust.

You can make a policy obviously.

 74
1

ALDERMAN POPE:

We have plenty of

2

talent in Chicago.

3

on the short list will be from the City.

4

I'm sure some of those names

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Do we need to

5

have a motion on that or can we just operate

6

based on general consensus?

7

MR. NAREFSKY:

I think consensus.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think that's fine.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

I will work with Lois

and we'll figure out how to go get that done.

11

Okay.

The next is let's establish

12

the next board meeting.

13

talked to the three that were here earlier about

14

Tuesday, August the 28th.

15

the other two?

16

o'clock.

17

I had jotted down and

Does that work for

I'm thinking about 10:00

9:00 is o'clock a little early.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Give me one second here,

19

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Tuesday the 28th?

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

24

James.

Yes.

It's fine.
Good.

So that's what

we'll are set as our next meeting at 10:00

 75
1

o'clock.

2

record.

3

So make sure we get that in the

MR. HOFFMAN:

What's the -- Let's go

4

back to the staff and sort of support for us.

5

know we're all enthusiastic about having a

6

website at some point that requires -- I

7

certainly can't build a website.

8

maybe the Chairman might, that might be within

9

your --

10
11
12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I thought

Airplanes, not

websites.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Do we -- Is there a plan

13

for who and how to do that and when that might

14

be operational even in a very basic way?

15

I

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, I think we have

16

started working on that.

17

done or not.

18

website and will be so -- people don't even know

19

where we are or how to find us yet.

20

was my thinking that we would set it up and have

21

a link from the City's website to us initially

22

and then we can decide if we want to really

23

separate that.

24

I'm not sure if it's

We're linked into the City's

MR. HOFFMAN:

But that

Obviously whatever --

 76
1

there needs to be sometime to develop it so

2

whatever is reasonable for that, but then I do

3

think it would be very useful to -- even if it's

4

just a one pager, a one page website where we

5

can -- where the information would be posted,

6

that there's maximum transparency about, you

7

know, what we've talked about, we can get the

8

transcript uploaded of the meeting, just, you

9

know, maximum transparency quickly, and then,

10

you know, the dates there, the times, the

11

meeting locations there, all the things that I

12

know we all want to do, but I think that should

13

be very easy to establish.

14

And then it might again be a nice

15

vehicle, very easy just to create something for

16

public comment, and those then very early we'll

17

have been able to achieve some of the core

18

things that we want to accomplish with

19

transparency.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I actually think we

21

have an obligation to do that.

Don't we have

22

to -- we have to publicly post these minutes.

23

We got to get a website up.

24

working with Lois and Scott to get that done.

I'm going to be

 77
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Great.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.

But again the

3

framework, I think we have to then decide how we

4

want to expand the content.

5

something we got to call like the public comment

6

piece I think is good, we need to have that, but

7

we need to think our way through, what do we

8

want to do with that website.

9

I think that's

The only thing I've said is because

10

people won't know where to go find us yet, let's

11

have a link to us on the City's website.

12
13

MR. HOFFMAN:

As Jorge said, we need to

get the executive director.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

did make an executive decision.

16

logo.

17
18
19

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's right.

But I

We do have a

You know, I saw that.

Do

you want to explain that?
CHAIRMAN BELL:

No.

It was the top one

20

of a list of six and it was late and I said take

21

that one, let's do it, but it does have the -- I

22

wanted one that sort of exemplifies the closed

23

loop process, getting into transparency, making

24

sure that we're going to have all stakeholders

 78
1

involved in something that looks like a pyramid

2

which is foundational.

3

MS. FERGUSON:

4

Would you like

(unintelligible) on your executive decision?

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

No, I don't think I

6

want to spend any more time on that unless

7

somebody really wants to.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

but it was late.

Good explanation.

So we got the meeting done.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

I gave it some thought,

Did you say 9:30?
I said 10:00.

Thank you.
9:00 is a little early.

Now let's move to the public comment

16

section.

17

until I recognize you and stand up and give your

18

name and spell it so the reporter can get it

19

down correctly.

20

later.

21

your comments.

22

comments.

23
24

Now, if you have public comments, wait

She doesn't want to find you

Let's try to limit it to two minutes,
Raise your hand if you have

MR. MELLIS:
and Board Members.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman

My name is Allan Mellis and,

 79
1

first of all, I'd like to say I'm very much

2

impressed with the backgrounds of all the

3

Members of the Committee so I feel much more

4

comfortable.

5

And you covered a lot of these so

6

I'm going to summarize my comments very briefly.

7

I guess my basic comment, and this is derived

8

from your conversation, it's very difficult for

9

a citizen to suggest projects to the City.

10

I mean, you go through the alderman.

11

I've been active in the community as people here

12

know for 40 years.

13

opportunity for the public to provide projects,

14

not necessarily good or bad, that you could

15

consider.

This seems to me an

16

So when you're looking at -- I know

17

initially that getting projects that are vetted

18

I really think on this website, which was one of

19

my items too, is that you solicit projects and

20

maybe you do as you pass them along, I

21

understand that, but I really think this

22

Infrastructure Trust is a way for the public to

23

provide input to the structure of what projects

24

they think are important, and also, as I think

 80
1

Mr. Hoffman said, a way to get some feedback

2

from them too.

3

So that was my first point.

The other thing is there are -- I

4

gave you a list of my testimony but there's some

5

things that -- projects that might be considered

6

and I put on here things like the Lincoln Park

7

Zoo.

8

you doing that.

That's free.

9

Well, I don't want to see

So I think you also have to look at

10

what criteria you set up that projects you don't

11

want to consider because they're not in the

12

public interest.

13

On the other hand, a new public

14

school.

15

the head of the Public Building Commission, all

16

the funding for new public schools is coming

17

from TIF funds.

18

funding source and maybe the Board of Education

19

provides the return, that there's some other

20

source other than TIF funds to build new

21

schools.

22

Now, right now my understanding from

Well, maybe we need some other

Some things that may be considered

23

are CTA railcars and buses that are selling and

24

leasing back.

Midway Airport obviously has been

 81
1

discussed.

I'd also just from a PR point of

2

view like to see the parking meter contract

3

come back so we have more control to maybe

4

expand it -- you buy it back and expand the time

5

that the investment has to come back.

6

And then things like private

7

entities.

You know, I read in the paper this

8

morning that there's some more talk about

9

Wrigley Field.

Wrigley Field is private.

All

10

the funding we see for stadiums seems to be

11

public stadiums.

12

could be considered is that it should become a

13

public facility and maybe there is funding

14

through it.

15

Well, maybe something that

So that's pretty much my comments.

16

I just want to reemphasize how important your

17

website is.

18

People have to know about it.

19

It doesn't have to be pretty.

You know, as to bylaws, the meeting

20

dates, the presentation we saw, I think it's

21

important to have project solicitation from the

22

community, and I think, you know, that's

23

something where you have the press here can help

24

you not only publicize the website but have

 82
1

people give you projects.

2

It will also be nice for the

3

citizens to know what projects you're

4

considering, and then also the job descriptions

5

that you're going out.

6

So just those few comments.

Again I

7

think you're -- I'm just very much impressed by

8

not only the Members and your background but the

9

thoughtfulness you're doing in realizing this is

10

a fluid situation.

You didn't come up here and

11

say this is the way we're going to do it.

12

You're listening and I appreciate it.

13

very much.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you

Thank you, Mr. Mellis.

Thank you, Mr. Mellis.

16

You know, let me just say while you're there, I

17

know all of us appreciate you and other members

18

of the public who take time from your private

19

lives to come up here and give your comments

20

through this.

21

It's very much appreciated.

You heard me talk about the website.

22

I think, you know, soliciting ideas from the

23

public is really important.

24

should be that, you know, depending on who the

The expectation

 83
1

executive director is and what their thoughts

2

are, it may be all that we're doing is passing

3

it on to the administration.

4

But it may give the executive

5

director an excellent idea.

6

discussion with the City officials that wouldn't

7

have happened but for that public suggestion.

8

So I completely agree.

9

It may prompt

I think that, you know, as to

10

Wrigley Field, I know that -- I thought we had a

11

Cubs fan in the Mayor's Office.

12

maybe sort of ambiguous now.

13

thinking more about the south side.

14

really sure.

I think that's

Maybe he's
I'm not

I'm joking obviously.

15

But I appreciate the comments and

16

we'll look forward to hearing from you in the

17

future.

18

MR. MELLIS:

Thank you.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MS. PATEL:

Yes?

Good morning.

Thank you,

21

Chairman, and thank you to the rest of the Board

22

for getting a chance to be able to talk.

23

My name is Amisha Patel.

I am

24

Executive Director of Grassroots Collaborative.

 84
1

We're a community labor coalition that works on

2

economic and racial justice issues in the City

3

and statewide.

4

When the Infrastructure Trust was

5

first proposed, we had some serious concerns

6

about it and they have boiled down to two

7

essential points.

8
9

One is a question around
accountability.

We were really pushing to have

10

City Council approval of every single deal.

11

yes, the sister agencies have the ability to

12

approve the deals but those, of course, are

13

appointed and they're not elected by these like

14

Alderman Pope and his colleagues.

15

So,

But the other question is around

16

equity, and so, you know, for us the question is

17

how will projects actually benefit working

18

families in Chicago.

19

neighborhoods in the City that are low income?

20

Will it benefit

And there is two angles on it, so

21

one is in terms of having -- folks being able to

22

have jobs actually, you know, for these

23

projects.

24

residents have access to these jobs created by

Like how do we make sure that local

 85
1
2

the projects.
But the other piece is how do we

3

decide what projects actually get selected and

4

it goes back to this question around selection,

5

and so will projects actually benefit low income

6

neighborhoods and address the historic and

7

present inequities that exist in low income

8

communities and communities of color.

9

So, for example, when we talk about

10

the schools that are going to retrofitted, how

11

do we decide -- as a Board are you going to be

12

looking to see where are these schools, what

13

communities do these schools serve, is it

14

actually addressing inequity?

15

You know, partly to me this is a

16

core question.

I'd like to hear from you,

17

Chairman, and anyone else who wants to answer

18

how are you looking at the question of equity in

19

your decision around which projects to address,

20

right, because we know that in terms of

21

infrastructure the higher -- you know, a lot of

22

the projects that are possible, you know, that

23

are more attractive or more lucrative for

24

investors aren't necessarily going to be in low

 86
1
2

income neighborhoods.
So how are you going to make sure

3

that there's equity involved in any decision

4

that gets approved by this board and any other

5

principles that you're going to be looking at

6

initially at this point in terms of how you

7

decide selection of projects.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, obviously we

haven't completely worked that out, but clearly

10

we're going to be looking at what does make

11

sense to be packaged for an external financing.

12

Obviously we're interested in the

13

whole City benefiting from this process so we'll

14

take that into consideration, but we surely

15

haven't figured out in terms of exactly how

16

we're going make that happen, but we will be

17

looking at it.

18

John?

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Chairman.

19

One of the things that I thought about and

20

haven't discussed publicly is the need to

21

package these.

22

an interest by a company and there's a very

23

lucrative deal, it maybe encouraging them,

24

requiring them to do less attractive deals so

As the Chairman said, if there's

 87
1

that we do have equity in terms of projects that

2

otherwise wouldn't have gotten done.

3

Projects in challenged neighbors

4

like mine where we don't have as much TIF

5

dollars to help with schools, for example, if

6

there's an ability to package a school that has

7

more lucrative return with another school, for

8

example, that is not as attractive so we can get

9

both of them done, that's something that I think

10

would be essential in considering these type of

11

situations.

12

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

I would

13

hope that is what the Retrofit Chicago Program

14

does.

15

out in ways that otherwise would never have

16

occurred.

17

schools.

18

certainly benefits every type of school.

19

It will take small projects and help them

It's intended to be for all of the
Whatever savings were achieved

ALDERMAN POPE:

And one other thing,

20

these projects are subject to the City of

21

Chicago's procurement requirements including

22

MBE, WBE and, to the extent applicable,

23

residency requirements too.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I appreciate the comment.

 88
1

You know, another reason why I think these

2

public comment periods are very helpful is

3

because it allows us to discuss that might not

4

come out.

5

Frankly my reaction on the equity

6

point is in part -- you know, when you see the

7

City come over and say hey, let's do Retrofit

8

Chicago and it says schools and new windows for

9

schools, you know, the immediate thought is if

10

this process allows us to fund that in a way

11

that it ordinarily wouldn't, and if those

12

windows are going in schools that have been

13

neglected over the years, what a wonderful

14

project and what a thing that does answer

15

precisely this issue of equity.

16

My second point though is that it

17

really depends on the details.

Are we going

18

to -- is the project that we approve going to be

19

as detailed as listing the specific schools or

20

will it just say generally there shall be X

21

number of schools.

22

Frankly we don't know.

We don't

23

know whether it's going to be that granular or

24

not.

I think that question of what schools get

 89
1

it will be -- is the only way to respond to your

2

concern, which is an important, obviously valid

3

concern.

4

And whether that process is here or

5

it ends up being at some future City process

6

that says it's going to be ten schools but then

7

they decide, you know, we don't know.

8

question should remain with us.

9

with us.

But that

It will remain

It should be continue to be asked, and

10

then I think the point at which we'll -- you

11

know, someone will be called upon to answer is

12

what schools would get it if this succeeds.

13

Very quick comment on

14

accountability.

15

City Council meeting that really echoed those

16

not really concerns but said that my view was

17

that we should always ask the City Council to

18

weigh in and give it the opportunity to weigh in

19

on every proposed infrastructure project, even

20

if it involved City agencies.

21

control whether the City Council would want to

22

do that.

23
24

I had made some comments at the

We couldn't

I think as a legal matter after the
ordinance, if it's a sister agency project, it's

 90
1

the sister agency board that has the final

2

decision-making process, but, you know, the City

3

Council is the only legislature that the City

4

has that's elected.

5

accountability points that you and others have

6

raised I agree with, and I think that it

7

therefore would be beneficial for us to give

8

them the opportunity as part of the process to

9

weigh in, and how they do that and whether they

And therefore the

10

do that will be up to them.

11

raised that point.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

So I'm glad you

Any other --

I think most of it's been

14

said already, but I just want to thank you,

15

Amisha, for coming and giving testimony.

16

important that those perspectives be heard and

17

that we as a Board be reminded as well and that

18

folks understand that they can come and say

19

these things that -- especially as a

20

representative of their communities that are of

21

great concern and something that we should be

22

looking at.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

It's

Mr. Chairman, as a

process point, I think that the question raises

 91
1

the issue of how will we be addressing the

2

selection of topics.

3

Take Retrofit, which, you know, I'm

4

struggling to think of what the critiques would

5

be and why we shouldn't take on that topic.

6

Frankly, I would like maybe an agenda item for

7

the next meeting would be public comment on

8

Retrofit Chicago, and it seems to me that would

9

likely be the last step in the Board saying

10

okay, we feel comfortable saying this will be a

11

topic, and it doesn't mean that these are the

12

terms, but I sure would like to give the public

13

the opportunity to say we shouldn't do Retrofit

14

Chicago.

15

Frankly, you know, I haven't heard

16

what those points would be, and I think that

17

given how straight forward the project is, you

18

know, I don't want to prejudge what may be said

19

against it, but it would helpful to give the

20

public the opportunity to say those things.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

22

we're far enough along.

23

it is.

24

devil is in the detail.

I'm not even sure
I don't even know what

I mean, I just heard the concept.

The

And so I'm not sure

 92
1

what the public would be at this time commenting

2

on to be honest with you.

3
4

MR. HOFFMAN:

We've got a power point

presentation.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I got it.

That's my point.

That's a

6

power point.

You know, I

7

think we need to be careful that, you know, they

8

said this might be the first project.

9

been brought to us yet.

It hasn't

You know, so we can

10

decide that we want to go out and get public

11

input on what comes to us, but this hasn't been

12

brought to us yet.

13

us.

14

Nothing has been brought to

We wanted an overview for ourselves

15

to get some thought on what the City is

16

thinking, but I don't want to get too far ahead

17

of ourselves here that we have a lot -- that we

18

can do a lot with a lot of information that's

19

not specific to projects and that we don't -- I

20

don't know what we would do with it.

21

we do with it?

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

What would

Yeah, well, the point is

23

fair that if nothing really is going to happen

24

until we have an executive director and that

 93
1

person is getting settled and at that point the

2

process will really start and at that point

3

there will be time to hear public comment about

4

whether Retrofit is a good idea, then I

5

completely agree that this is premature and we

6

should -- I want to make sure.

7

I actually think I know that we're

8

all in agreement on that.

9

issue.

It's just a timing

If we're just sort of waiting for that,

10

which makes a lot of sense, executive director

11

to be in place and then we'll start considering

12

the selection of projects then I think the

13

timing makes sense.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

like to see.

16

comment?

17

All right?

That's exactly what I'd
Any other public

(No response.)

18

Thank you.

20

conduct today that we have not conducted that

was on the agenda?
