update on other pending requests. He stated that many of the responses to the requests were posted on the
shared drive; some of the responses to requests are still in process.
With regard to the information provided for posted and request-to-hire positions, Chairman Zopp requested a
breakdown of how long these positions have been pending from the date the request to hire has been signed off
by the System1.
Mr. Small replied that this information will be provided and posted to the shared drive.
The discussion turned to the subject of filling open positions, while keeping in mind the System’s ongoing
strategic planning efforts. Mr. Small stated that he would look to ensure that those positions for which they are
actively recruiting are critical positions. He will update the Committee on the results of this review2.
Director Carvalho inquired regarding the information provided on displacement positions, in relation to the
Department of Public Health and the Family Case Management transition.
Mr. Small stated that he would review the information and provide a response to Director Carvalho’s question.

Update on the status of recruitment and hiring for senior leadership positions.
Mr. Small provided information on the status of recruitment and hiring for senior leadership positions.
Director Carvalho inquired whether the Corporate Compliance Officer’s responsibilities would include
receiving complaints relating to human resources and personnel matters.
Mr. Small responded that the Corporate Compliance Officer could receive such complaints, through, for
example, an employee hotline. For such complaints, they would be responsible for reviewing and determining
the appropriate action. Such actions could include forwarding it to the human resources area or to the County’s
Compliance Administrator. He added that there are many existing routes available for employees to report
human resources and personnel matters.
Chairman Zopp stated that she envisions this position to be one relating to corporate compliance and ethics. She
added that she expects that complaints forwarded to the County’s Compliance Administrator will be monitored
by the Corporate Compliance Officer for any appropriate action necessary or to provide updates on the issue to
the Board.
In response to Chairman Zopp’s inquiry on whether the position description was available on the shared drive,
Mr. Small replied that he would ensure that it was posted4.
Chairman Zopp asked Mr. Small to provide the Committee with an update on the development of a Request for
Proposals (RFP) for external recruitment firms.

Mr. Small stated that the State’s Attorney’s Office is assisting in the development of a number of RFPs,
including the RFP for external recruitment firms. He stated that the Committee should be seeing the draft fairly
shortly; as soon as it is received it will be distributed to the members for their review and input. He asked
Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Office of the State’s Attorney, to elaborate.
Ms. Reidy stated that they are currently working on four RFPs for the System; the drafts for three should be
received by the end of the week and the fourth for the search firm should be received by the next week. She
stated that the RFP for the search firm is unique in that it will allow for the retention of one or more search
firms, not exceeding a maximum dollar amount.
The Committee discussed the position relating to press and community relations. Director Carvalho inquired
whether these functions should be combined into one position; Chairman Zopp indicated that when the position
description is drafted, the Committee should review and discuss the issue.
Dr. Maurice Lemon, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, informed the
Committee that the System-wide credentialing position has been filled. He stated that this critical position has
been filled by a highly-respected individual with a great deal of experience in this area.
