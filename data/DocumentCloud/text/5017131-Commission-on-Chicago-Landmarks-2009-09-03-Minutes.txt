(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed demolition of a 2-story single- family masonry residence
constructed in 1977

building, constructed in 1977, is non-contributing to the Old Town
Triangle District.
Furthermore, a demolition permit application would require approval by
the Commission on Chicago Landmarks and the City Council, in
accordance with Section 2-120-825 Permits For Demolition of Landmarks
City Council Approval Required of the Municipal Code of Chicago.

The west elevation of the enlarged detached garage and garage door
elevation shall be included in the permit application plans; and,

 2. New brick and brick veneer shall be standard, nominal-sized brick to
match the existing brick in color, size, profile, and texture. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve the brick samples prior to
order and installation; and the mortar shall match the existing mortar
in composition, color, and joint profile.

3.

2317 N. Orchard
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed refacing of deteriorated sandstone, front façade (using limestone
as substitute material) of a 3½ - story building, including rebuilding the
front porch and stair.

Action:

1. The applicant shall make best efforts to find replacement sandstone to
match the historic sandstone in size, color, finish, and texture. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve material samples for
rusticated and smooth stone units and mortar color prior to order and
installation.
If no such replacement sandstone is identified, in consultation with
Historic Preservation staff; alternative natural stone (preferred) such as
Kasota stone or alternatively, stained limestone may be considered as a
substitute material, subject to Historic Preservation staff review and
approval, and provided that it matches the sandstone in color, size,
texture, and other visual qualities. Specifications and a sample of the
stain shall be submitted with the permit application. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve control samples of the
stained rusticated and smooth units and mortar color prior to order and
installation;

any materials or beginning construction to discuss the project and the
conditions of approval;
3. The corners of the front façade and front porch should have stone units
with rusticated edges and returns to match the appearance of the
original stone corner units. This may be achieved by installing corner
masonry units with rustication on the two corner faces or by chiseling
the rustication in the field. Historic Preservation staff shall review and
approve a sample of the corner rustication at the site prior to
installation. Details of the front parapet ornament, finials, string
courses, window trim/brick mold, etc., shall be submitted with the

a square column with a rounded top to reflect the design of the existing
masonry at that location;

documents; and,
6. The existing cornice and historic metal railings shall be salvaged,
repaired as necessary, and reinstalled in the same location.

determine their visibility prior to permit approval. The heights of the
existing parapets will be verified by staff and shall not be altered;
