Question/Comment
“CCH is opposed to the new mandatory work
requirements which the CHA seeks to impose on
its public housing tenants…. CCH urges the CHA
to drop these ill-conceived new requirements and,
instead, to work cooperatively with CCH and other
advocates to reach a fair resolution that will not
threaten eviction and increased homelessness will
afford residents good job training and
opportunities.”
When will copies of the revised ACOP be
available?

Status
The Work requirements are designed to help families move
towards self-sufficiency. The requirements are not in place to
hurt families. The CHA has many initiatives in place to assist
residents with any issues or barriers they may face.

The revised ACOP is now available on the CHA website,
www.thecha.org.
