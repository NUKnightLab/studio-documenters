Cayla,

We are happy to assist the Quicken Loans Community Fund in its collaboration with the Downtown
Detroit Partnership (DDP) on the markets that are being activated in Cadillac Square, and Capitol
Park for the winter season. We understand that portions of the markets are expected to open in
November of 2018 and may remain open into January 2019. During the period that the markets are
open, Bedrock plans to cause on behalf of the Quicken Loans Community Fund, cleaning and
maintenance service to be provided to the greenhouse market areas and food and beverage areas,
other than the food truck operator areas. With teamwork, we are con?dent that this will be the best
winter Detroit has seen yet!

Thank you,
Francesca George

The 080 AcousticDesignTM AD-S12 is a
surface mounted low impedance. 12" two-
way loudspeaker system. ideally suited for a
wide variety of foreground and background
sound reinforcement applications.

AcousticDesignTM series offers integrators a
premium quality installed sound solution
where performance. coverage. and
aesthetics are paramount. Combined with
unprecedented ease-of?installation and high
weather resistance, the AcousticDesignTM
series provides integrators a versatile and
confident install solution.

The 2 features a high quality 12"
weather treated paper cone woofer on a
2.5" voice coil. A carefully selected 1" exit.
1.4" compression driver perfectly matches
the sensitivity and performance of the
woofer for outstanding full-range
reproduction.

Consistent and even 75? axisymmetric
(conical) coverage is achieved through
(Directivity Matched Transition). a
080 innovation which matches the
directivity patterns of the woofer and the
high-frequency waveguide at the crossover
point. The result is a coherent transition
between transducers and improved off-axis
response.

With rugged ABS enclosures, sealed input
panel covers, and powder-coated aluminum
grilles for weather resistance. the
AcousticDesignT'V' surface mounted series
exceed IE060529 IP-54 ratings for dust and
splash resistance.

Installers will appreciate the award-winning
X?MountTM system included with each full-
range AcousticDesignTM model. This
ingenious mounting solution achieves
unprecedented ease-of-installation in
horizontal, vertical. wall. or ceiling
deployments. Knurled surfaces at the pivot
planes ensure the load will not drift or sag
over time. Articulation marks allow
preconfiguration of the X-MountTM while on
the ground with no special tools required.
Once secure. the loudspeaker installs in
seconds. allowing the installer to work safer.
smarter. and faster with repeatable results.

The AD-S12 also includes M10 fittings for
optional yoke mount (YMS12) or shoulder
eybolt (M10 Kit-C) accessories for
installation versatility.

To further enhance performance and speed
of install with optimum result. advanced
voicing filter sets using 080 lntrinsic
CorrectionTM techniques are obtainable
using Q-Sys networked audio processing
platforms. including CXD amplifiers for a
complete QSC systems solution.

The AcousticDesignTM series feature a
stylish appearance free of obtrusive logo
adornments for aesthetically sensitive
installations. AcousticDesignTM surface
loudspeakers are available in 080 standard
black (RAL 9011) or white (RAL 9010) and
may be painted to match any decor.

Structural Certification Letter
Junior-T Orangerle Greenhouse
Manufactured by Janssens AluSystems in Belgium

Hollingsworth Pack has performed a structural analysis of the Junior-T Model Orangerle Greenhouse
to determine compliance with the International Building Code, which has been adopted by State
and Local governments across all US. States and Territories. The Junior-T Model Orangerle Is a
pre-fabricated aluminum greenhouse covered 4mm tempered glass panels. A photograph
of the greenhouse can be found in the appendix of this letter.

Based upon our analysis, we have concluded that the greenhouse as currently Installed by Exaco
Trading Co. Is adequate to support the following loads per the 2015 International Building Code:

Wind Load:
Snow Load:
Roof Live Load:

120 MPH (3-second gusts)
35 PSF (ground-snow load)
20 PSF

Our structural analysis and conclusions assume that the greenhouse is installed with a minimum
8"x16" tall concrete beam or solid-grouted masonry foundation continuous below the perimeter of
the greenhouse walls. The greenhouse should be anchored to the foundation with (8) mounting
brackets attached to the greenhouse frame, as specified in the Junior?T Mounting
Instructions? document to resist overturning and uplift forces.

If you have any questions regarding the matters addressed, or if additional information Is required,

please do not hesitate to contact us. We apprecnate the opportunity to be of service.

During meetings of the Public Health and Safety standing committee in September 2018, Council
Member McCalister inquired regarding the City government agency with responsibility for alleys.

In response to this inquiry, Article VI of the City Code, Sections 50-6-1 through 50-6-8, is attached.
It is entitled OF ALLEYS TO EASEMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL It
authorizes vacating an alley or a portion thereof in a residential area upon petition of two-thirds of
owners of abutting properties.

The ordinance states that upon receipt of such a petition, Council shall transmit it to the former
?community and economic development department.? By current practice, the responsibilities for
alley closures formerly entrusted to that defunct department have been taken over by the City
Engineering Division of the Department of Public Works (DPW). (see. attached
memorandum dated July 18, 2018 from City Engineer Richard Doherty)

The ordinance goes on to specify the roles of the Law Department, City Council, the City Clerk,
and the Director of Public Works in the process of vacating an alley in whole or part, depending
on the request made by the speci?c petition.

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
further research and analysis upon request.

ARTICLE VI. - CONVERSION OF ALLEYS TO EASEMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS

Sec. 50-6-1. - Petition by two-thirds of abutting property owners required; investigation and report by
community and economic development department.

A petition for the vacating of any dedicated alley or portion thereof in a residential area in the city
shall be presented to the city council by not less than two-thirds 2/3 of the owners of the property
abutting on such alley or portion thereof sought to be vacated who shall signify, in writing, their consent to
the granting of such petition. Where property owners elect to keep the alley open either due to the need
to gain access to their garages or for reasons verified and approved by the director of the department of
public works, they shall be responsible for the cleanliness and maintenance of the alley. If found in a
littered condition, as defined under sections 22-2-84 and 22-2-85 of this Code, the director of the
department of public works shall be authorized to barricade said alley as he or she deems necessary. No
action shall be taken by the city council regarding petitions for alley conversion until a complete
investigation and report thereon shall have been made by the community and economic development
department.

(Code 1964, 58-5-1; Ord. No. 7-5-78; Ord. No. 31-93, 1, 12-1-93)

Sec. 50-6-2. - Transmittal of petition by city council to community and economic development
department.

Upon the receipt of a petition the city council shall, by its clerk, transmit such petition to the
community and economic development department.

(Code 1964, 58-5-2; Ord. No. 267-H, 7-5-78)
Sec. 50-6-3. - Duties of community and economic development department generally.

When a petition for the vacation of an alley, as provided in this article, has been received by the
community and economic development department, the department shall be chargeable with the
following duties:

(1) It shall prepare a sketch to clearly define the alley or portion thereof sought to be vacated and
shall show the property abutting thereon.

(2) It shall cause to be made a list of the owners of all the property abutting on such alley or
portion thereof to be vacated.

(3) It shall check the petition and shall determine whether or not the owners of two-thirds or more
of the property abutting on such alley or portion thereof sought to be vacated shall have
signified, in writing, their consent to the granting of such petition.

(4) It shall cause an investigation to be made as to the objection of any dissenting abutting
property owners who refuse consent to the granting of such petition, and shall obtain from the
law department an opinion as to the legal merit of such objections.

(5) It shall contact all other necessary city departments and outside utility companies and shall
ascertain the need for such alley for the carrying on of such public services, such as garbage
and rubbish collection, sewer maintenance or any other such public service, and shall make a
determination as to whether or not adequate provisions can be made for such services and for
all utilities purposes through the creation of an easement.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 1847 XLN INVEST LLC, request to temporarily close two alleys in the
area of 11345 11385 Green?eld Rd.

Petition No. 1847 of XLNC INVEST LLC, request for the renewal of the temporary closure of
the north?south public alley, 18 feet wide (previously closed on a temporary basis by a resolution
adopted on November 20, 2012J.C.C. pages 2300-01); also the east-west public alley, 18 feet wide,
all in the block of Elmira Avenue, 60 feet wide, Plymouth Avenue, 86 feet wide, Winthrop
Avenue, 60 feet wide, and Greenfield Avenue, 106 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The last petition (#2224) to temporarily close the referenced north-south alley was granted by City
Council on November 20, 2012 .C.C. pages 2800-01 for a period of 5 years has expired. The
property owner at 1124.5 1188.5 Green?eld uses the alleys as access to parking for the apartments
and wishes to provide safe secure access and prevent illegal dumping in the alleys.

All involved City departments and privately owned utility companies have reported no objections
to the proposal, provided they have the right to ingress and egress at all times to their facilities.

There is an appropriate resolution, containing the necessary conditions, attached for consideration
by your Honorable Body.
