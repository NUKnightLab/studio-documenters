RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
RECOGNIZING MAY 1, 2016 AS NATIONAL LAW DAY
WHEREAS, Law Day is a national day set aside to celebrate the rule of law. Law Day underscores how
law and the legal process contribute to the freedoms that all Americans share; and
WHEREAS, Law Day has its origin in 1957, when American Bar Association (ABA) President Charles S.
Rhyne envisioned a special day for celebrating our legal system; and
WHEREAS, on February 3, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established Law Day by issuing a
Proclamation proclaiming it "fitting that the people of this Nation should remember with pride and
vigilantly guard the great heritage of liberty, justice, and equality under law which our forefathers
bequeathed to us." Every President since has issued an annual Law Day Proclamation; and
WHEREAS, on April 7, 1961, Congress passed a Joint Resolution, designating May 1 as Law Day. The
theme of Law Day 2016 is "Miranda: More than Words"; and
WHEREAS, the year 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in legal history, the United States
Supreme Court’s landmark 1966 decision in Miranda vs Arizona. In Miranda, the Supreme Court held that
the state may not use statements stemming from custodial interrogation of a suspect in police custody unless
it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination;
and
WHEREAS, the Miranda decision put forth the rule that requires the police to provide legal warning to
criminal suspects in police custody before they are interrogated. This legal warning apprises suspects of
their right to remain silent, their right to an attorney, and their right to appointed counsel in cases where
they cannot afford an attorney; and
WHEREAS, the Miranda Warning has become one of the nation's most recognizable legal expressions and
a symbol of procedural fairness; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, the criminal justice system still faces many challenges and we rededicate ourselves to the
goal of ensuring that all are aware of their rights and have the opportunity to exercise them in a meaningful
manner; and
WHEREAS, this Law Day provides an opportunity to understand the procedural protections afforded to
all by the United States Constitution and how these rights are safeguarded by the courts and why the
preservation of these principles is essential to our liberty.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby recognize May 1, 2016 as National Law Day and its theme of "Miranda: More
than Words"; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County Law Library will celebrate the Law Day by continuing
in its mission of providing legal information resources as a component of access to justice to ensure that all
can explore and discover their legal rights.
Approved and adopted this 13th of April 2016.

WHEREAS, on April 22, 2016 Earth Day will be celebrated across the country for the 46th year; and
WHEREAS, the goal of Earth Day 2016 is to broaden and diversify the environmental movement in
order to build a healthy, sustainable environment and address climate change; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Government has invested in energy efficiency improvements for buildings
resulting in an 11% decrease in harmful greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since 2010; and

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, to continue decreasing GHG emissions it is necessary to broaden and diversify the number
of employees participating in sustainable and efficient practices at work and at home; and
WHEREAS, with a workforce of over 22,000, Cook County through its employees can make significant
contributions to reductions in GHG emissions throughout the County; and
WHEREAS, an employee change program to address energy-consuming behaviors was included as a
part of the guaranteed energy savings projects approved by this Board in July 2015; and
WHEREAS, employees’ thoughts and suggestions on sustainability are the basis of the program through
the feedback they have provided in working groups and surveys; and
WHEREAS, this feedback will determine how the behavioral change program will be structured to create
and sustain cultures of energy efficiency in the many various work settings across the County; and
WHEREAS, this program provides information to employees that they can share with their family and
neighbors, spreading good environmental practices throughout the community; and
WHEREAS, the County is committed to creating a livable and sustainable community by working with
our employees and communities to reduce the effect of human activity on the environment by initiating
and promoting energy and material conservation programs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners support April 22, 2016
as “Earth Day”.

HONORING THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT AND
PROCLAIMING THE MONTH OF APRIL FAIR HOUSING MONTH IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, April 2016 marks the 48th Anniversary of the passage of the U.S. Federal Fair Housing Act.
Adopted in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the Fair Housing Act transformed
the legal rights that all Americans have to rent and own homes in communities across the country; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Fair Housing Act created a national policy of fair housing and today prohibits
discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status or disability; and
WHEREAS, 2016 additionally marks the 37th anniversary of the Illinois Human Rights Act, a law which
prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, color religion, national origin, sex, physical or mental
disability, familial status, age, ancestry, marital status, disability, military status, unfavorable discharge
from military service, sexual orientation or order of protection status; and
WHEREAS, housing discrimination and barriers to equal housing opportunity are corrosive and undermine
a common sense of decency and fairness; and
WHEREAS, economic stability, community health and human relations in all communities are advanced
by diversity and integration; and
WHEREAS, advocates and non-profits for fair housing assisted by the Federal Fair Housing Act have
worked tirelessly to promote just and nondiscriminatory practices; and
WHEREAS, one of those non-profits is Open Communities, a leading voice for housing, economic and
social justice in north suburban Chicago. Their mission is to educate, advocate and organize to promote just
and inclusive communities in north suburban Chicago. Open Communities will host a celebration of the
Fair Housing Act at their 12th Annual Fair Housing Month Event entitled “What is Home” on Wednesday,
April 19 at Curt’s Café South from 6pm to 9pm at 1813 Dempster Street in Evanston; and
WHEREAS, the talents of grassroots and non-profit organizations, housing service providers, financial
institutions, elected officials, state and county agencies, and others must be combined to promote and
preserve integration, fair housing and equal opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County takes great pleasure in honoring and celebrating the 48th
Anniversary of the Federal Fair Housing Act and herewith honors the progress and impact that the Fair
Housing Act has made in bettering the lives of the citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and

CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF JIM AND PETE’S RESTAURANT
WHEREAS, in the spring of 1941, brothers-in-law Jim Sorce Sr. and Pete Pizzo opened Jim and Pete’s as
a counter-service pizzeria at Chicago Avenue and Pulaski Road in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, a few years later, the two parted ways and Sorce Sr. moved the pizzeria to River Forest, near
the corner of North and Harlem avenues; and
WHEREAS, Jim Sorce Sr. couldn’t afford a new sign when he moved the business so the old Jim and
Pete’s sign came with him even though there was no longer a Pete involved in the business; and
WHEREAS, after spending more than thirty years at the River Forest location, the restaurant moved north
across the street and a few blocks west to its current Elmwood Park location at 7806 West North Avenue;
and
WHEREAS, although both original owners are deceased, the current owners, Jimmy Sorce Jr. and Michael
Bucchianeri, expanded the business in 1991, doubling the size of the restaurant and offering a full-service
bar; and
WHEREAS, Sorce Jr. and Bucchianeri remain committed to using the finest ingredients and designed a
menu that balances updated items with traditional favorites, such as fried calamari, pasta, and meatballs,
which they make by the thousands each week; and
WHEREAS, Jim and Pete’s famous pizza-the recipe unchanged since 1941-remains a menu favorite; and

RECOGNIZING ROSA E. MARTINEZ-COLON - PAVING THE WAY FOR 25 YEARS
WHEREAS, a Puerto Rican native, Rosa E. Martinez-Colon’s first experience with HIV/AIDS was when
a neighborhood friend died from the virus. Soon after, more friends experienced the devastating symptoms
of HIV/AIDS. At this time, Rosa did not know just how much her life’s work would impact the lives of
thousands of people affected by HIV/AIDS; and
WHEREAS, Rosa was one of several community activists, service providers and HIV positive (+)
individuals who responded to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Latino community in 1991 by founding
CALOR (Comprensión y Apoyo a Latinos en Oposición al Retrovirus) along with co-founder Omar Lopez.
Rosa was approached by Saul Maravilla, a classmate, looking for a space a group of Latinos needed to meet
on this vital topic, Rosa opened the doors to the first support group; and
WHEREAS, Rosa was invited to attend training offered by the now defunct Stop AIDS Chicago on Women
and HIV. It was here that Rosa would find her calling. Rosa was set on her path by the lack of information

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

offered to women on the virus, even though women were as heavily impacted by HIV/AIDS as men were.
Spanish material on the virus was almost non-existent. Rosa knew she had to change this; and
WHEREAS, with the need for more support groups and resources for the Latino communities, CALOR’s
mission, was to continue offering support groups for Latinos affected by the HIV virus and for Hispanic
HIV/AIDS service providers. The emphasis was put on providing intervention initiatives and building
support systems for people recently diagnosed. In 1993, with the help of grants, the organization began
offering case management and mental health services. Later, essential prevention initiatives were developed
along with employment placement services; and
WHEREAS, in 1997, CALOR merged with Anixter Center, a well-respected and established provider of
services for people with disabilities of all ages. The merger allowed CALOR to increase the programs and
services it offered to people with HIV/AIDS and to reach out to people with other disabilities. Following
this merger, CALOR continued to expand, opening Casa Contreras, a 17-unit building named after two of
CALOR’s other founding members-Salvador and Jose Luis Contreras. Then, a new HIV/AIDS prevention
and education program targeting young Latino men called A.C.E (Advocating for Community
Empowerment), now one of CALOR’s programs they are known for; and
WHEREAS, having moved to a larger space located at 5038 West Armitage, on the city’s north side,
CALOR is still growing. From a weekly support group, CALOR has grown to offer 7 programs providing
services to 6 different populations. In 2010, Rosa was Community Co-Chairs for the Host Committee for
the U.S. Conference on AIDS, which was held in Chicago in 2011; and
WHEREAS, the following year she was selected as an Ambassador to the XIX International AIDS
Conference in Washington, D.C. Most recently, Rosa was elected Co-Chair of the National Latino AIDS
Action Network. She also serves as a member of the Steering Committee for the Alliance for Research in
Chicagoland Communities, as well as with the AIDS Foundation of Chicago’s Service Provider Council
and the Case Management Cooperative Leadership Council.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board, issue a
proclamation that all the citizens of Cook County thank and congratulate Rosa E. Martinez-Colon for 25
years of continuous dedication to not only the Latino community but to the countless patients, families and
friends suffering from HIV/AIDS and the effects of such; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body, and an official copy of same be presented to Rosa E. Martinez-Colon present today to commemorate
this milestone event.
Approved and adopted this 13th of April 2016.

BOYCOTTING THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA-BASED
BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, on March 23, 2016, the State of North Carolina adopted the Public Facilities Privacy &
Security Act, which is officially known as an act to provide for single-sex multiple occupancy bathroom
and changing facilities in schools and public agencies, and to create statewide consistency in regulation of
employment and public accommodations, prohibiting anti-discrimination rules being established except on
the basis contained in the state's anti-discrimination laws; and
WHEREAS, because the state's anti-discrimination laws do not include discrimination on the basis of
sexuality or gender status, the legislation has been widely described as anti-LGBT, due to the act’s
restriction of the definition of sex to the sex at birth, forcing all government-controlled facilities to maintain
single-sex bathrooms for matching biological sex only; and
WHEREAS, the process of adoption of this discriminatory law took less than 24 hours, from presentation
and vote by the House of Representatives, through a speedy vote by the Senate, ending in official enactment
upon the signature of Governor Pat McCrory that same day; and
WHEREAS, on March 28, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of North Carolina,
Lambda Legal, and Equality North Carolina, filed a federal lawsuit challenging House Bill 2, arguing that
North Carolina's new law “violates the most basic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution";
and
WHEREAS, a number of companies have publicly announced their opposition to the law, including Red
Hat, Dow Chemical, Biogen, Wells Fargo, American Airlines, Lowe's, PayPal, Apple, Google, Facebook,
Twitter, IBM, Yelp, and Salesforce.com; and on March 29, 2016, an open letter signed by 80 corporate
CEOs against House Bill 2 was sent to Governor McCrory; and
WHEREAS, as of April 3, 2016, the states of Connecticut, Minnesota, New York, Vermont, and
Washington, the District of Columbia, as well as the cities of Boston, Chicago, New York City, Portland,
San Francisco, Seattle, and West Palm Beach have issued travel bans in response to House Bill 2, barring
government employees from non-essential travel to North Carolina; and
WHEREAS, the State of North Carolina has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist politics
before the rights of all of its residents, and betrays our most deeply-held American values; and
WHEREAS, North Carolina’s House Bill 2 seriously undermines the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment
which grants Equal Protection by providing that laws in the United States must apply equally to everyone;
and
Page 28 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, when in 1996 the Supreme Court struck down then
Colorado’s anti-LGBT law in Romer v. Evans, this law “seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward
the class it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests”; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State of North
Carolina, is to assure that the State of North Carolina’s isolation is tangible rather than symbolic; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, the 2nd largest county in the nation with a budget of over 3.3 billion dollars
and a diverse population of more than five million, should be a leader in protecting the rights of people.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
members of this Board hereby find North Carolina’s House Bill 2 to be offensive to the values of the
taxpayers of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board hereby
boycotts the State of North Carolina and North Carolina-based businesses until North Carolina’s House
Bill 2 is repealed or invalidated; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that unless and until North Carolina’s House Bill 2 is repealed or
invalidated, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County Departments refrain from, to
the extent practicable, and in instances where there is no significant additional cost to the County nor
conflict with law, entering into any new, renewed, or amended contracts to purchase goods or services from
any company that is headquartered in North Carolina; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that County government

Summary: The County and CCHHS have determined that Clayco, Inc. (Developer) has completed

The Agreement provides that upon completion of Phase 1 the County and CCHHS may elect to engage

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The objective of the JOC program is to provide an alternate procurement method to enable
the County to rapidly engage construction projects simultaneously.
The request to increase in the amount of $3,500,000.00 is based on the available capacity of the JOC
Contractors. The Gordian Group’s fee for the services provided is assessed as a percentage of the value of
construction procured by the County through the JOC program. The increase requested through this
amendment was calculated by the applying The Gordian Group’s percent fee against the total value of
construction that is available to be purchased by the County through its JOC contracts. The County is
under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay The Gordian Group’s fee
when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. This amendment will allow the County
to utilize these services on the new JOC contracts during their contract term.
This contract was awarded through a Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures in accordance with Cook
County Procurement Code. The Gordian Group, Inc. was awarded based on established evaluation criteria.

PROPOSED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT - DISASTER RECOVERY
(CDBG-DR)
Page 110 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

Department: Planning and Development
Other Part(ies): Presidio Capital, LLC, Hinsdale, Illinois
Request: Approval of a CDBG - DR Loan with Developer and Homebuyer Subsidies
Total Development Cost: $7,000,000.00
Project Loan Amount: $7,000,000.00
Fiscal Impact: None
Account(s): N/A
Summary: The Department of Planning and Development within the Bureau of Economic Development
respectfully submits the attached Community Development Block Grant - Disaster Recovery project loan
recommendation in the amount of $7,000,000.00 to Presidio Capital, LLC. This project loan will be
utilized to support CDBG -DR-eligible project costs incurred during the new construction of 29 new
townhomes and single family homes in Cicero, Illinois as replacement housing for households displaced
by the 2013 Flood. The area of Cicero where these homes will be built (northeast corner) is not in a 100
year flood plain, but is near transit and meets the new energy star ratings for new construction. The
construction of these units is in keeping with Planning for Progress and the CDBG -Disaster Recovery
Action Plan.
The requested CDBG -DR funds would subsidize the project via a permanent loan based upon the
following terms:
Loan Type: Construction Loan will be provided to the Developer, and then the down payment
assistance will be recorded as Second Mortgage by Cook County and remain subordinate to the
permanent first mortgage to the homebuyer
Interest Rate: The loan will be a zero percent (0%) interest repayable of the sale of each home to a
qualified homebuyer
Loan Term: The Project is estimated to have a “construction” phase of (12) months to complete with a
detailed schedule to be set forth in final loan documents subject to the guidance and final approval of
HUD.
Lien Position: County is the sole lender and recorded in first position during construction and then
Cook County will award on a case by case needs basis a second mortgage for each homebuyer to ensure
compliance with the abovementioned Affordability Period.
Buyer Down Payment Assistance: Qualified Buyers will receive down payment assistance based upon
individual needs. Fifteen properties will be sold to Buyers with less than 80 percent of AMI and fourteen
properties will be sold to Buyers with less than 120 percent of AMI.
Affordability Period for Home Buyer: The homebuyer will be awarded a second mortgage on the
property based upon the needs of each qualified homebuyer. The second mortgage will come with an
Page 111 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

affordability period of 15 years if the subsidy is $20,000 or less and 20 years if the subsidy is $20,001 or
more.
Guarantee: Presidio Capital, LLC guarantees that any home not sold by 12/31/2017 will be repaid in
“balance” (outstanding balance minus any projected developer subsidy) to the County, after the complete
exhaustion of the “sales plan” initiative. On 10/1/2017 any unsold units will be evaluated and determine
the units prices need to be decreased or if an extension beyond 12/31/2017 is necessary to sell all units.
If on 12/31/2017 units still remain unsold the County and Developer have the option to convert the units
to supportive services rental housing units in conjunction with an approved non-profit agency. Finally,
any reprogrammed funds will be utilized at the sole discretion of the County for projects that are eligible
under the CDBG-DR regulations.
The Bureau would like to request approval for the attached recommended CDBG -DR project loan and
authorization to proceed to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the aforementioned project.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided the County with the CDBG
-DR funds due to the flooding that occurred in April of 2013. The Cook County Board has approved The
Action Plan for the CDBG - DR funds on 3/12/2014 with two Substantial Amendments on 9/10/2014 and
4/1/2015.
This project is being submitted for review by the Housing and Community Development Committee and
then for Board Approval on 5/11/2016. As such, this item will require Board review and approval in the
same meeting on 5/11/2016.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned commercial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and

HUMAN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
MEETING OF APRIL 12, 2016
16-2333
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING UPON THE CITY OF CHICAGO TO RESCIND THE $0.05 BOTTLED WATER TAX
WHEREAS, in the aftermath of the water supply crisis in Flint, Michigan, an increasing level of public
concern is being expressed in communities throughout Chicago and Cook County about the age of the
water-related infrastructure and the content of the water supply in Chicago and Cook County, including
whether or not there are quantities of lead present in that water supply; and,
WHEREAS, much like the water delivery infrastructure in Flint, Michigan, the water delivery
infrastructure in many parts of the City of Chicago and Cook County is rapidly aging and composed
primarily of lead pipe; and,
WHEREAS, there exist clear and numerous pieces of scientific evidence demonstrating that exposure to
lead causes significant neurological and developmental damage to babies, toddlers and children, and that
the effects of that damage include higher rates of developmental delay, learning disabilities, and hearing
loss; and,
WHEREAS, there exist clear and numerous pieces of scientific evidence demonstrating that lead exposure
in adults can lead to mood disorders, decline in mental functioning, miscarriage and infertility, as well as
an increased risk of cancer; and,
WHEREAS, recent analysis indicates that while the lead pipes that supply water to most of the City of
Chicago and Cook County generally pose only a slight health risk, recent construction projects which
disturb the water lines around the County have caused the risk to increase; and,
WHEREAS, many informed residents of the City of Chicago and Cook County, in the light of the
aforementioned risks, choose to drink bottled water rather than tap water; and,
WHEREAS, many Chicago and Cook County residents with low and moderate household incomes rely
upon bottled water as their cleanest source of drinking water, as an installation of a water filtration system
in their homes is cost-prohibitive; and,
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago should recognize the reality that large numbers of its citizens rely on
bottled water, and must purchase that bottled water commercially; and,
Page 134 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, the existing five-cent per bottle tax on bottled water imposed by the City of Chicago is
regressive, in that it disproportionately impacts citizens of Cook County and Chicago with the least
disposable income; and,
WHEREAS, rescinding the five-cent per bottle tax will make bottled water more affordable to lower
income residents who rely on bottled water for purposes of ensuring a clean drinking water source for their
families; and,
WHEREAS, it is right and proper for the Cook County Board of Commissioners to opine and advocate on
matters that affect the health and welfare of the citizens of Cook County;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
do hereby call upon the City of Chicago to rescind the five-cent bottled water tax, to ensure that the citizens
of the City of Chicago and Cook County have a more affordable source of clean, healthy drinking water.

Code. Clarity Partners, LLC was awarded a contract based on established evaluation criteria.
For any subsequent expansion of such services to design, implement and host Cook County websites, other
than Using Agencies under the Offices of the President, the Board of Review and the County Clerk, the
Bureau of Technology will utilize a competitive solicitation as prescribed in the Cook County Procurement
Code. This agreement will also allow the Bureau to develop any future solicitation for a unified web services

Agent/Attorney: Gregory Dose Esq. of the Goldstine, Skrodzki, Russian, Nemec and Hoff, Ltd.,835
McClintock Drive, Burr Ridge, Illinois.
Current Zoning: C-4 General Commercial District
Intended use: Applicant seeks a Special Use for the operation of a school bus service and maintenance
facility in unincorporated Orland Township.
Recommendation: ZBA Recommendation is of Approval with Conditions.
Conditions:
1.
Limit the proposed use at the existing building at the current size.
2.

Limit the repair work to Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 5:30 PM.

3.

The service work within the facility shall be limited to minor maintenance, such as fluid changes,
tire changes, tune-ups, and replacement of lights, batteries, belts and windshield wipers; and no
body work, painting, brake testing, or engine rebuilding shall be performed within the facility. No
heavy mechanical work.

4.

No outside contractors, only employees are to be used on site for repair work.

5.

Only school buses and passenger vehicles be parked on the Subject Property. No tractor trailers
are to be parked on the Subject Property.

6.

No more than two 2500 lbs. tanks are to be used for storage on the Subject Property.

7.

On-site fuel tanks shall be installed above Flood Protection Elevation in accordance with the
County Floodplains Ordinance Sec. 106-9(1)a. It states that no installation in a flood zone that
contains flammable liquids or other hazardous materials can be below the “flood protection
elevation (FPE).” In Sec. 106-2 of the Floodplains Ordinance, “Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)”
is defined as “the elevation of the base flood or 100-year frequency flood plus two feet of
freeboard….” Hence, the provision would address concern that fuel containers be situated well
above flood level so their contents will not be released into flood waters and damage other property.

Objectors: On Tuesday, 2/16/2016, the Zoning Board of Appeals received a Resolution from the Village
of Orland Park, objecting to the proposed Special Use Application.

BOYCOTTING MISSISSIPPI AND MISSISSIPPI-BASED BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, the State of Mississippi adopted a controversial new law, HB1523, dubbed the Protecting
Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination, which would allow government employees to
refuse to issue marriage licenses or perform marriage ceremonies; and
WHEREAS, HB1523 allows businesses and faith-based groups to deny housing, jobs and adoption and
foster care services to people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity; and
WHEREAS, there will be no disciplinary recourse for businesses or government employees that decline
to participate in the provision of treatment, counseling, or surgery related to gender identity,
psychological, counseling or fertility services; and
WHEREAS, the Mississippi anti-LGBT Law, which will not take any disciplinary or enforcement action
against a person who denies the aforementioned services, will have a negative effect and undermine the
level of trust and cooperation between local police and communities; and
WHEREAS, the advocacy group, Freedom for All Americans, referred to Mississippi HB1523 as, “the
Nation’s worst piece of anti-LGBT legislation”, the law goes even further than Indiana’s and North
Carolina’s anti-LGBT laws, Gov. Bryant’s bill goes even farther in denying critical protections of and
enabling discrimination against LGBT individuals; and
Page 205 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, the State of Mississippi has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist politics before
public safety and respect for human dignity, and betrays our most deeply-held American values; and
WHEREAS, HB1523 seriously undermines our basic American principles of fairness, justice and equality
and will not protect anyone’s religious rights; and
WHEREAS, the State of Mississippi continues to be one of three states to combine Robert E. Lee and Dr.
Martin Luther King as a state holiday on the same day; one a Confederate General that led the Confederate
Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War, a fight where the South fought to continue the enslaved labor
of blacks and economic system that slavery made possible; and
WHEREAS, on the polar opposite, Dr. Martin Luther King dedicated his life to win equal rights and
opportunities for African Americans, the State of Mississippi has again chosen to isolate itself from the rest
of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, many states, such as Vermont, Washington, and New York have passed legislation to ban
official state-funded travel or sponsored travel to Mississippi and the District of Columbia is considering a
similar measure; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State of Mississippi,
is to assure that the State of Mississippi’s isolation is tangible rather than symbolic; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, the 2nd largest county in the nation with a budget of over 3 billion dollars and
a diverse population of more than five million, should be a leader in protecting the rights of people.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this oard
of Commissioners hereby finds the Mississippi anti-LGBT Law to be offensive to the values of the
taxpayers of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board of
Commissioners hereby boycotts the State of Mississippi and Mississippi-based businesses as long as
Mississippi HB1523 stands in its current form; and

ESTABLISHING A LOAN PROVISION OPTION FOR THE COOK COUNTY EMPLOYEE
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
WHEREAS, On February 2, 1978, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved the establishment
of the Cook County Employee Deferred Compensation Plan. Since that date, Cook County employees have
had the benefit of choosing to participate in said Plan; and
WHEREAS, thanks to County employees’ contributions the account had $1.2 billion by the end of 2015,
which does not include the $14.5 million contributed just during the current calendar year through March
2016; and
Page 207 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, the stated goals of the plan allow county employees to put aside money from each paycheck
toward future economic security through pretax contributions from their own salaries; and
WHEREAS, the plan allows for employees to make a wide variety of autonomous decisions about
contributions up to a maximum, as well as their own decisions about investment options and funds; and
WHEREAS, although the primary function of Deferred Compensation is to provide greater economic
security in retirement, there are provisions of the federal law which allow for greater financial flexibility
while still employed by the County and participating in the plan, specifically loan provisions for
participating employees; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Deferred Compensation Plan does not currently allow participants to access
their own Deferred Compensation funds through loans against an employee’s own investment; and
WHEREAS, other governments with Deferred Compensation Plans administered by the same
administrator locally and nationwide are offering their employees the opportunity to access their own funds
via loan provisions; and
WHEREAS, employees in these governments have found it possible to use these funds to put towards the
down payment on a home, pay tuition bills for their children or themselves and reduce excessively high
interest on credit card debt; and
WHEREAS, deferred compensation loans may be an alternative to an unforeseeable emergency
withdrawal; there are no taxes to pay as long as loan conditions are satisfied and the employee essentially
"pays interest to themselves," rather than to a conventional lender; and
WHEREAS, employees who take a loan, are borrowing from their own Plan account with no credit check,
easy approval and repayment of the loan, plus competitive interest rates back to their own Plan account in
monthly installments within a specified period of time; and
WHEREAS, despite disadvantages of retirement plan loans including lost investment opportunity and
penalties for failure to repay, loans should be an option for Cook County employees; and
WHEREAS, the ultimate control and authority of an employee’s decisions -including, but not limited to,
levels of contribution, investments, emergency withdrawals, loans or even the basic decision to participate
in the program at all-must rest with the participating employee and not with Cook County or the plan
administrator.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners asks the
appointed Deferred Compensation Committee to work with the County’s deferred compensation plan
administrators to establish a loan provision option for consideration by this Board; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is the desire of the Cook County Board of Commissioners to see
a loan provision added to the County’s Deferred Compensation Program by the end of the 3rd quarter of
Cook County’s current fiscal year.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Commissioner Murphy
Request: Approval of transfer of funds
Reason: To pay independent contractor
From Account(s): 086-110
To Account(s): 086-260
Total Amount of Transfer: $20,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
4/1/2016 and the balance in the account on that date was $2,400.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
We hired an independent contractor to cover office duties of an employee that is on unpaid family medical
leave. The unpaid family medical allowed us to have extra funds in 086-110.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.

WHEREAS, Section 6(a) of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that “a
County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... (is) a Home Rule Unit”
and The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of

State of Illinois, as amended (the “Debt Reform Act”), and the other Omnibus Bond Acts, as amended,
exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not
limited to, the power to tax and to incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the County has the power to incur debt payable from ad valorem property tax receipts or from
any other lawful source and maturing within 40 years from the time it is incurred without prior referendum
approval; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the County (the “Corporate Authorities”) has not adopted
any ordinance, resolution, order or motion or provided any County Code provisions which restrict or limit
the exercise of the home rule powers of the County in the issuance of general obligation bonds without
referendum for corporate purposes or which provides any special rules or procedures for the exercise of
such power; and
WHEREAS, the County has heretofore issued and there are now outstanding various series of general
obligation bonds (collectively, the “Prior Bonds”), including General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2006A (the “2006A Bonds”); and
WHEREAS, the 2006A Bonds are now outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $333,680,000,

County or to restructure the debt service burden on the County; and
WHEREAS, the aggregate costs of the Refunding, including consulting, financial advisory, legal services,

interests of the County to borrow from time to time for the purpose of the Refunding, and to pay costs of
issuance, and, in evidence of such borrowing, to issue one or more series of full faith and credit bonds of

All Bonds shall become due and payable as provided in the relevant Bond Order, provided,
however, that no Bond shall have a Stated Maturity which is later than the date which is thirty (30) years
after its Dated Date.
The Bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates percent per annum not to exceed seven percent (7.0%)
per annum. The Bonds shall bear interest at the rate or rates percent per annum as provided in the relevant
Bond Order.
Each Bond shall bear interest from the later of its Dated Date or the most recent interest payment
date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, until the principal amount of such Bond is paid,
such interest (computed upon the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months) being payable, subject
to the provisions of any Bond Order, on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on such May 15 or
November 15 as determined by the Chief Financial Officer in the Bond Order therefor.
So long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, interest on each Bond shall be paid to the
Depository by check or draft or electronic funds transfer, in lawful money of the United States of America,
as may be agreed in the Representations Letter; in the event the Bonds should ever become available in
physical form to registered owners other than the Depository, interest on each Bond shall be paid by check
or draft of the Trustee, payable upon presentation thereof in lawful money of the United States of America,
or by electronic funds transfer of lawful money of the United States of America, as may be provided, to the
person in whose name such Bond is registered at the close of business on the applicable Regular Record
Date, and mailed to the address or transferred to such account of such registered owner as it appears on the
Bond Register or at such other address or account as may be furnished in writing to the Trustee.
Principal of and premium (if any) on each Bond shall be paid upon surrender in lawful money of
the United States of America, at the principal office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee or its proper
agent.
The Bonds shall have impressed or imprinted thereon the corporate seal or facsimile thereof of the County
and shall be signed by the manual or duly authorized facsimile signatures of the President and County Clerk,
as they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on any Bond shall cease to be
such officer before the delivery of such Bond, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for
all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
All Bonds shall have thereon a certificate of authentication substantially in the form hereinafter set
forth duly executed by the Trustee as authenticating agent of the County and showing the date of
authentication. No Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or be entitled to any security or benefit
under this Ordinance unless and until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by
the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate of authentication upon any such Bond shall be
conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this Ordinance. The
certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the Trustee if signed
by an authorized officer of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that the same officer sign the certificate
of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.

Sec. 4.Book-Entry Provisions.
The Bonds shall be initially issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
of the maturities of each Series of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond shall
be registered in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the “Book Entry
Owner”) and, accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated Officer is
authorized to execute a Representations Letter or to utilize the provisions of an existing Representations
Letter. Without limiting the generality of the authority given with respect to entering into the
Representations Letter for the Bonds, it may contain provisions relating to (i) payment procedures, (ii)
transfers of the Bonds or of beneficial interests therein, (iii) redemption notices and procedures unique to
the Depository, (iv) additional notices or communications, and (v) amendment from time to time to conform
with changing customs and practices with respect to securities industry transfer and payment practices.
With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book Entry Owner, neither the
County nor the Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank, or other
financial institution for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository (each
such broker-dealer, bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a “Depository
Participant”) or to any person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an interest in the
Bonds. Without limiting the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the County nor the
Trustee shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the records of the
Depository, the Book Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant with respect to any ownership interest in
the Bonds; (b) the delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner
of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the Representations Letter, of any
notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption; or (c) the payment to any Depository
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of
any amount with respect to principal of or interest on the Bonds. No person other than a registered owner
of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register shall receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the
event that (x) the County determines that the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities
described herein or in the Representations Letter, (y) the agreement among the County and the Depository
evidenced by the Representations Letter shall be terminated for any reason, or (z) the County determines
that it is in the best interests of the County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to
obtain certificated Bonds; the County shall notify the Depository of the availability of Bond certificates,
and the Bonds shall no longer be restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry
Owner. The County may determine at such time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and
deposited with a successor depository operating a book entry only system, as may be acceptable to the
County, or such depository’s agent or designee, but if the County does not select such successor depository,
then the Bonds shall be registered in whatever name or names registered owners of Bonds transferring or
exchanging Bonds shall designate, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Sec. 5.Redemption.
A. MANDATORY REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be
issued as Term Bonds and be subject to mandatory redemption by operation of the Bond Fund at a price of
par, without premium, plus accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date or dates as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and
subject to such provisions as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will

Page 221 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

redeem Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide
Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal amounts
of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier optional
redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future mandatory
redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief Financial Officer
may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of such Bonds shall be
credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological order of such payments
beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the amount subject to
mandatory redemption on the redemption date immediately preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In
addition, on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may,
and if directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory redemption
date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give written
notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B. OPTIONAL REDEMPTION. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order, any Bonds may be
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such times and
at such optional redemption prices, including any make-whole optional redemption prices, as shall be
determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. Such optional redemption prices,
other than for any make-whole optional redemption, shall be expressed as a percentage of the principal
amount of Bonds to be redeemed, provided that such percentage shall not exceed one hundred three percent
(103.00%), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. Optional redemption prices and other provisions
related to any make-whole optional redemption with respect to any Bonds shall be determined by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof.
If less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be called
shall be called from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as may be determined
by the County and within any maturity in the manner hereinafter provided.
C. REDEMPTION PROCEDURE. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise notified by
the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any further order or direction from
the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45)
days prior to any optional redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee),
notify the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds to be
redeemed.
2.Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. The Bonds shall be redeemed only in the principal amount
of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of the Bonds
of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by
the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and
Page 222 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions
thereof so that each $5,000 principal amount of such Bond shall be as likely to be called for redemption as
any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to
the time of the giving of official notice of redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon
advice from the County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order, for purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected
by the Trustee pro rata based upon a fraction the numerator of which is the principal amount of Bonds to
be redeemed on a given date and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of such Series
of Bonds and of the given Stated Maturity remaining unpaid immediately prior to such redemption. If the
Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the time of such redemption, the County shall direct the Trustee to
instruct the Depository to select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption pro rata among
such Bonds, which redemption may utilize the Depository’s current pro rata pass-through distribution of
principal procedure or similar or substituted procedure promulgated from time to time. If while in Book
Entry Form the Depository has no procedure for pro rata redemption, then such partial redemption shall be
accomplished by lot, as described above. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or
obligation to insure that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.
3.Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the
Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless waived by the registered owner of Bonds
to be redeemed, official notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County
by mailing the redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be
redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by
such registered owner to the Trustee. All official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds
and at least the information as follows:
(a) the redemption date;
(b) the redemption price, or for any optional redemption utilizing a make-whole redemption
provision, a description of the formula by which the redemption price shall be determined;
(c) if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular maturity are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of Bonds of a Series within such
maturity, the respective principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;
(d) a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become due and payable upon
each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from
and after said date; and
(e) the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price, which
place of payment shall be the office designated for that purpose by the Trustee.
4.Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such notice of redemption, such
notice may, at the option of the County, state that said redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of
Page 223 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received,
such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such moneys were not
so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
5.Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described, the
Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in paragraph 4.
immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for
redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price.
The procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as herein provided
for payment of interest otherwise due.
6.Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver. Neither
the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered
owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice
shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in
the notice. Such notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such
notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of
notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent
to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so
long as the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation
Letter, and the giving of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner,
as registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption to the Trustee,
as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or defect in notice.
7.New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any Bond,
there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like Series and tenor, in Authorized
Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid
principal.
8.Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for redemption
shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from
the redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption.
9.Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been redeemed shall
be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued. Upon the payment of the redemption
price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the
CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such
check or other transfer.
10.Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as it may
deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account any requirements or
guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the
Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other federal or state agency having jurisdiction or
authority in such matters; provided, however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b)
Page 224 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

solely in the discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a condition
precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any failure or defect in such notice
shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for which proper official notice shall have been given.
Reference is also made to the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with
respect to the Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.
11.Trustee to Advise County. As part of its duties hereunder, the Trustee shall prepare and forward
to the County a statement as to notices given with respect to each redemption together with copies of the
notices as mailed.
Sec. 6.Registration of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners; Bonds Lost, Destroyed, Etc.
The County shall cause the Bond Register to be kept at the office maintained for the purpose by the
Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is authorized
to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Bond blanks executed by the County for use in
the transfer and exchange of Bonds.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Bonds in Book Entry Form, any Bond may be
transferred or exchanged, but only in the manner, subject to the limitations of and upon payment of the
charges as set forth in this Ordinance. Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the office maintained for
the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney
duly authorized in writing, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in
the name of the transferee or transferees a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same Series of the
same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate
principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any fully
registered Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like
aggregate principal amount of such Bonds of the same tenor, of the same Series, interest rate and Stated
Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The Trustee shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond during the period from the close
of business on the Regular Record Date for an interest payment to the opening of business on such interest
payment date or during the period of fifteen (15) days preceding the giving of notice of redemption of
Bonds or to transfer or exchange any Bond all or a portion of which has been called for redemption.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Bond shall constitute full and due authorization
of such Bond, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and
deliver such Bond in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance; provided, however, the principal amount
of Bonds of each Series and maturity authenticated by the Trustee shall not at any one time exceed the
authorized principal amount of Bonds for such Series and maturity less the amount of such Bonds which
have been paid.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner thereof or his or her legal
representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon
such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
Page 225 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Bonds, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like Series, date, maturity date,
interest rate, denomination and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding;
provided that
(a) in the case of any mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee,
and
(b) in the case of any lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the
Trustee evidence of such loss or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee,
satisfactory to the Trustee. In the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured
or is about to mature, or has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee
shall pay the same without surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such
loss, destruction or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any
substitute Bond, the Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.
Sec. 7.Security.
The full faith and credit of the County are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of and interest on the Bonds. The Bonds shall be direct and general obligations of the County,
and the County shall be obligated and hereby covenants and agrees to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the
taxable property in the County for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon, without limitation as
to rate or amount. The County hereby pledges, as equal and ratable security for the Bonds, all present and
future proceeds of the Pledged Taxes on deposit or to be deposited in the Bond Fund for the sole benefit of
the registered owners of the Bonds, subject to the right, hereby expressly reserved by the County, to transfer
certain interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund to other funds of the County.
Sec. 8.Forms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall be in substantially the forms hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that if the
text of the Bonds is to be printed in its entirety on the front side of the Bonds, then the second paragraph on
the front side and the legend “See Reverse Side for Additional Provisions” shall be omitted and the text of

purpose as necessary; and when the Pledged Taxes shall have been collected, reimbursement shall be made
to said funds in the amount so advanced.
C.Covenants re Pledged Taxes. The County covenants and agrees with the purchasers and
registered owners of the Bonds that so long as any of the Bonds remain outstanding, the County will take
no action or fail to take any action which in any way would adversely affect the ability of the County to
levy and collect the Pledged Taxes. The County and its officers will comply with all present and future
applicable laws in order to assure that the Pledged Taxes may be levied, extended and collected as provided
herein and deposited into the Bond Fund.
D.Ordinance and Bond Orders to be Filed. A copy of this Ordinance, together with a subsequent
copy of each Bond Order, duly certified by the County Clerk, shall be filed in the office of the County
Clerk, and such filings shall constitute the authority for and it shall be the duty of said County Clerk, in

collection, such taxes to be in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized
to be levied by the County on its behalf.
E.Abatement. Whenever and only when other funds from any lawful source are made available
for the purpose of paying any principal of and interest on the Bonds, so as to enable the abatement of the
Pledged Taxes levied herein for the payment of same, the Corporate Authorities shall, by proper
proceedings, direct the deposit of such funds into the Bond Fund and further shall direct the abatement of
the Pledged Taxes by the amount so deposited. A certified copy or other notification of any such
proceedings abating taxes may then be filed with the County Clerk in a timely manner to effect such
abatement.

purported to be pledged by this Ordinance in the manner and to the extent provided in this Ordinance.
The Pledged Taxes and all other moneys deposited or to be deposited into the Bond Fund are
pledged as security for the payment of the Bonds. This pledge is made pursuant to Section 13 of the Debt
Reform Act to the fullest extent applicable and shall be valid and binding from the date of issuance of the
initial series of the Bonds. All such Pledged Taxes and the moneys held in the Bond Fund shall
immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act and the lien
of such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or
otherwise against the Country irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
The Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds so pledged are and will be free and clear
of any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with,
the pledge created by this Ordinance. The County shall at all times, to the extent permitted by law, defend,
preserve and protect the pledge of the Pledged Taxes and other moneys, securities and funds pledged under

or proceeding.

are hereby authorized and directed to approve or execute, or both, such documents as may be necessary to
accomplish such purchase. The Senior Managers, Co-Senior Managers and Co-Managers listed in
Paragraph C of this Section 11, and any underwriting affiliates thereof, are hereby approved and confirmed
as dealer managers with respect to the purchase of any Prior Bonds with the proceeds of the Bonds.
Sec. 12.Creation of Funds and Appropriations; Abatement of Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds.
A.Bond Fund Created. There is hereby created the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2016, Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”), which shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
All receipts of the Pledged Taxes received by the County Treasurer, acting ex officio as the County
Collector, shall be deposited daily, as far as practicable, with the Trustee. All other moneys appropriated or
used by the County for the payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on the Bonds shall
be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the
Trustee. The Trustee is hereby expressly authorized to establish such accounts within the Bond Fund as
shall be necessary to account for the Pledged Taxes levied for each Series of Bonds issued hereunder. All
Pledged Taxes, and all such moneys, shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Bond Fund.
The County Treasurer is hereby expressly authorized and directed to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to provide for the prompt deposit with the Trustee, in accordance with this Ordinance, of
all Pledged Taxes.
The Bond Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee.

in a relevant Bond Order. Moneys in the accounts of the Bond Fund may be withdrawn or may be transferred
among the accounts of the Bond Fund by the County upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer.

Page 235 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for paying
the principal of and interest on the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or account from which advances
to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on the Bonds prior to receipt of
Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond
Fund for payment of future principal of and interest on the Bonds or, to the extent lawful and as determined
by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other funds as may be determined.
B.Escrow Accounts. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the
principal proceeds and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds, together with such money in
the debt service funds for the Refunded Bonds as may be advisable for the purpose, shall be used to provide
for the Refunding, pursuant to the provisions of the relevant Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements.
Any funds remaining to the credit of the County pursuant to an Escrow Agreement upon the termination of
the Escrow Agreement shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to the County as directed by the Chief
Financial Officer.
C.Expense Fund Created. The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the
principal proceeds of each Series of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby
created, to be known as the “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016 Expense Fund” (the
“Expense Fund”) and shall be disbursed upon the delivery of that Series of Bonds by the Trustee at the
written direction of the Chief Financial Officer or shall be used by the County to pay costs of issuance in
accordance with normal County disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense
Fund on the date which is six months following the date of delivery of the Bonds shall be transferred to the
County Treasurer for deposit into such fund or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may
direct.
D.Investments. The moneys on deposit in the Bond Fund may be invested from time to time by the
Trustee at the written direction of the Chief Financial Officer in Qualified Investments. Any such
investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further direction from the County as
moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Bond Fund has been created. In addition, the Chief
Financial Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by telephonic, electronic or facsimile
transmission by the County to the Trustee and confirmed by electronic or facsimile transmission by the
Trustee to the County) to sell such investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Bond Fund
or any accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed to the account for which
the investment was made.
E.Deposits. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the provisions of
this Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or with such
banks, national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan associations, that
are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the President or the
Chief Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial institution in an amount
exceeding 20 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution shall certify to the Trustee
and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such financial institution. No such
moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial institution in excess of the amount
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, unless (a) such financial institution
shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a Federal Reserve Bank or branch or,
with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer, pledged to some other financial

institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Bonds, as collateral security for the moneys
deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a market value (exclusive of accrued interest)
at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys, and (b) the Trustee shall have a perfected first
lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations serving as collateral, and such Federal Obligations
or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third party liens. The Trustee shall allow and credit interest
on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it customarily allows upon similar funds of similar size and
under similar conditions or as required by law. Interest in respect of moneys or on securities in any fund
shall be credited in each case to the fund in which such moneys or securities are held.
F.Repurchase Agreements. The County may invest any moneys pursuant to a repurchase
agreement. Each repurchase agreement shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act
of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or such
Qualified Investments as may be specified in a relevant Bond Order, having a market value, marked to
market weekly, at least equal to 102 percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus
accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency
Obligations perfected (i) by possession of certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third party
acting on behalf of the Trustee if the institution serving as Trustee is also the counterparty to the repurchase
agreement and is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures specified in 31
Code of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq. The President
or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to enter into, execute and deliver any investment or
repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall be necessary to
accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
G.Taxes Levied for Refunded Bonds. To the extent not theretofore abated and as determined
necessary by the Chief Financial Officer, the taxes previously levied and collected (or in the process of
collection) to pay the Refunded Bonds shall be used to effectuate the Refunding as provided in the Escrow
Agreement or shall be used to effectuate the Restructuring, or to the extent not needed due to the issuance
of the Bonds, shall be deposited into the Bond Fund and used to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
Taxes previously levied for the Refunded Bonds but not yet extended for collection shall be abated. The
Chief Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized to file an abatement certificate with the County
Clerk, without further official action of the Corporate Authorities, to effectuate such abatement.
H.Purchase Refunding. The proceeds of any Bonds issued in accordance with Paragraph H of
Section 11 of this Ordinance shall be used to purchase Prior Bonds from their owners on a date or dates not
later than 90 days after the issuance of such Bonds.
Sec. 13.General Tax Covenants.
A.Not Private Activity Bonds. None of the Tax Exempt Bonds shall be a “private activity bond”
as defined in Section 141(a) of the Code.
B.Pertaining to Rebate.
The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of Section
148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate Requirement”) to the
United States:

Page 237 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

1. Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.
2. Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best
interests of the County.
3. The Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be
established, at such time and in such manner as they may deem necessary or appropriate
hereunder, a “General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2016, Rebate Fund” (the
“Rebate Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Bonds, and such officers shall further, not less
frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the amount
determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty. Said
Designated Officers are hereby expressly authorized and directed to cause to be paid to
the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to
time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the
Penalty.
4. Interest earnings in the Bond Fund are hereby authorized to be transferred, without
further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as required,
to the Rebate Fund for the purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Tax Exempt
Bonds and other lawfully available funds of the County are also hereby authorized to be
used to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty, but only if necessary after
application of investment earnings as aforesaid.
Sec. 14.Registered Form.
The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued and
to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the County
agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Bonds to be issued in, or converted into, bearer
or coupon form.
Sec. 15.Further Tax-Exemption Covenants.
The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Bonds not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing provisions,
but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further
specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or advisable;
(b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or agreements as
may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with such advice as
may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be required and in a
timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and pay fiscal agents,
financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance.
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Underwriters and registered owners of the
Tax Exempt Bonds from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in
connection with the Tax Exempt Bonds, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
Page 238 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

the sale of the Tax Exempt Bonds or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Bonds to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Bonds) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Bond to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Bonds to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes. The County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination
by the Internal Revenue Service of the exemption from federal income taxation of interest on the Tax
Exempt Bonds, under present rules, the County may be treated as a “taxpayer” in the examination and
agrees that it will respond in a commercially reasonable manner to any inquiries from the Internal Revenue
Service in connection with such an examination.
Sec. 16.Opinion of Counsel Exception.
The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Bonds in any manner,
notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 15 herein, provided, that it shall
first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel to the effect that such use or investment as contemplated
is valid and proper under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment will not
adversely affect the Tax Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Bonds.
Sec. 17.Payment and Discharge; Refunding.
The Bonds may be discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as
follows:
(a)Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the
registered owners of the Bonds the principal, premium, if any, and interest, to become due thereon
at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses of the Trustee
shall have been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and singular the
covenants and promises in the Bonds and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept, performed and
observed by it or on its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall cease, determine
and be void. If the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the registered owners of all Outstanding
Bonds of a particular Series, or of a particular maturity within a Series, the principal, premium, if
any, and interest, to become due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and
herein, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under the Ordinance,
and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the County to the holders of such Bonds shall
thereupon cease, terminate and become void and discharged and satisfied.
(b)Provision for Payment. Bonds for the payment or redemption or prepayment of which
sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the Trustee
or an escrow agent having fiduciary capacity (whether upon or prior to the maturity or the
redemption date of such Bonds), and accompanied by an express declaration of defeasance of the
Bonds by the Corporate Authorities, shall be deemed to be paid within the meaning of this
Page 239 of 277

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Ordinance and no longer outstanding under this Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly
given as provided in this Ordinance or arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
made for the giving thereof. Defeasance Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said
investments mature and bear interest in such amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient
cash to pay currently maturing interest and principal and redemption premiums if any when due on
the Bonds without rendering the interest on any Bonds taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Bonds
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any
manner whatsoever, and such Bonds, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be
paid and retired.
(c)Termination of County’s Liability.` Upon the discharge of indebtedness under paragraph
(a) hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance Obligations
(such sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the retirement of any
particular Bond or Bonds, all liability of the County in respect of such Bond or Bonds shall cease,
determine and be completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to
payment out of the money and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations deposited with aforesaid
for their payment.
Sec. 18.Duties of Trustee.

to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the execution of any trust hereunder, or for

written notice of an Event of Default as hereinabove provided, and unless also the registered owners of
twenty-five percent (25%) in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding shall have made written
request of the Trustee after the right to exercise such powers, or right of action, as the case may be, shall
have accrued, and shall have afforded the Trustee a reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the
powers hereinbefore granted, or to institute such action, suit, or proceeding in its name; and unless, also,
there shall have been offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall have refused or neglected to
comply with such request within a reasonable time; and such notification, request and offer of indemnity
are hereby declared in every such case, at the option of the Trustee, to be conditions precedent to the
execution of the powers and trusts of this Ordinance or for any other remedy hereunder; it being understood

cumulative, and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at

Sec. 33.Waiver of Default.
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing

(A)first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest

entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference; and
(B)second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal
and premium, if any, on any of the Outstanding Bonds which shall have become due (other
than Bonds matured or called for redemption for the payment of which monies are held
pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest
upon such Outstanding Bonds from the respective dates upon which they became due, and,
if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Bonds due on any
particular date, together with such premium, then to the payment ratably according to the
amount of principal and premium due on such date, and then to the payment of such

shall constitute proper application by the Trustee; and the Trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the
County to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such funds, so long as the
Trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the
same in accordance with such provisions of this Ordinance as may be applicable at the time of application
by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such funds, it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest
payment date unless the Trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to

the terms upon which such Bonds may be issued or secured.

Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds over any other Outstanding Bond or Outstanding Bonds,
or otherwise alter or impair the obligation of the County to pay the principal, interest or redemption
premium, if any, at the time and place and at the rate and in the currency provided therein of any

any such modification or amendment reduce the percentage of the registered owners of Outstanding
Bonds required for the written consent of such modification or amendment without the consent of
the owners of all of the Outstanding Bonds. Upon receipt by the Trustee of a certified copy of
such ordinance and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Bondholders as
aforesaid, the Trustee shall accept unless such supplemental ordinance affects the Trustee’s own
rights, duties or immunities under this Ordinance or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in

of principal and interest by a municipal bond or financial guaranty insurance policy, a letter of credit, or
some other means, and such policy provider or letter of credit provider shall not be in default, then any
consent to amendment as herein provided shall not be given by the owners of Bonds of such Series, but
rather shall be obtained from such provider, whose consent may or may not be given in its complete
discretion, and whose consent shall be binding on such owners and all successors in interest. Ownership
of Bonds for purposes of consent by the registered owners thereof shall be conclusively proved by the Bond
Register.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Bondholders under this paragraph to approve the particular
form of any proposed supplemental ordinance, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the
substance thereof.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE

COOK COUNTY ANIMAL ABUSER REGISTRY
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois and the County of Cook have criminalized abuse and cruelty towards
animals; and
WHEREAS, despite these laws against animal cruelty and abuse, animal cruelty continues to be a problem
in Illinois and Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the number of cruelty cases reported daily on various media sources is not reflective of the
actual number of cases, as most cases are never reported, and most animal suffering goes unrecognized and
unabated; and
WHEREAS, further complicating this issue is the fact that, unlike violent crimes against people,
information on reported cases of animal abuse have not been compiled by state and federal agencies, making
it difficult to calculate the prevalence or trends in these crimes; and
WHEREAS, intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence
against people, and data on domestic violence and child abuse cases reveal that a staggering number of
animals are victimized by abusive parents or partners each year; and
WHEREAS, in light of the above-mentioned link between animal abuse and crimes against people,
including violent crimes and domestic violence, after a years-long lobbying effort and the backing of the
National Sheriffs Association and the Animal Welfare Institute, in 2014, the FBI agreed to elevate animal
cruelty to its own separate offense category defined as “Intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly taking an
action that mistreats or kills any animal without just cause, such as torturing, tormenting, mutilation,
maiming, poisoning, or abandonment.”; and

Page 259 of 277

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

April 13, 2016

WHEREAS, 2016 marks the first time the FBI will collect data on animal crimes the way it does for other
serious crimes such as homicide or rape by having their own organized category within the National
Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), the FBI’s public collection of national crime statistics; and
WHEREAS, the goal is that after several years of collecting statistics other law enforcement agencies will
be able to see trends that will allow them to better allocate their resources to catching animal abusers and
in the process hopefully better protect both animals and people; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of the residents of Cook County and their animals that an online
registry be established identifying individuals residing in Cook County convicted of animal abuse crimes
that will prevent these individuals from adopting, purchasing, or otherwise obtaining animals from any
animal shelter, pet seller, or other person or entity involved in the exchange of animals by adoption, sale,
or other means.
