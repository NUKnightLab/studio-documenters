Officer. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Dr. Shannon noted that, as discussed at the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting, the organization continues
its process regarding The Joint Commission (TJC) accreditation. Serious focused efforts have been ongoing; staff
continues to work on addressing the observations that were made in the October 27th report.
Director Marsh stated that Dr. Das has probably the most challenging areas on which to give a report; she taken a lot
of data, reduced it to one (1) page, and has given the Board and Dr. Shannon a good, solid place to start thinking about
what is needed to change the trajectory of these numbers. In addition to presenting these data, she asked Dr. Das to
bring to the Board what she thinks is needed to change the trajectory.
Chairman Hammock noted for the record that these minutes include the presentation on TJC update which was
discussed at length at the Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting; the update contains key issues raised and
activities in response.

Board and Committee Reports
C. Finance Committee Meeting, November 20, 2015 (continued)
During the discussion of the metrics, Director Lerner recommended that a couple of lines be added to include
admissions and length of stay data, as that is what really drives the patient days. Chairman Hammock clarified that
this data is collected and shared with the Finance Committee; if the Board wishes that it also be included in the metrics
presented to the Board, this can be done.
Chairman Hammock, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of all of the action
items presented for consideration at the November 20, 2015 Finance Committee Meeting, which
included nine (9) Contracts and Procurement Items; proposed Transfers of Funds; and two (2)
proposed Resolutions authorizing management to close Oak Forest Health Center bank accounts

D. Managed Care Committee
i. Metrics (Attachment #6)
Director Lerner reviewed the Metrics with Mr. Glass. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.

E. Human Resources Committee
i. Metrics (Attachment #7)
Director Wiese reviewed the Metrics with Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources. The Board reviewed and
discussed the information.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding the provision of mammography services, in light of all of the clinics
that were closed in the last year or so at the City level. Dr. Shannon stated that the administration has executed a
Memorandum of Understanding with the Chicago Department of Public Health regarding that subject; CCHHS will
be assuming the provision of mammography services that the Chicago Department of Public Health will be
abandoning. He anticipates that CCHHS will be doing an addition 5,000-10,000 mammograms in the coming fiscal
year because of this arrangement. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether this additional provision of services
will require the hiring of additional CCHHS staff. Dr. Shannon responded that he believes that one (1) new
mammographer was recently hired; a second mammographer may be brought in soon. Ms. Lopez added that a new
Division Chair of Mammography is scheduled to start in February.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Report from Cook County Department of Public Health (continued)
During the discussion of the information regarding CCDPH’s involvement and activities in the reduction of lead
poisoning in children, Dr. Mason noted that he believes that the current reportable level of lead exposure is too high
and should be lowered; currently, children with an elevated blood-lead level of greater than 10 micrograms/dL are
reported to CCDPH. If that reportable threshold was lowered, Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the cost to
identify, inspect and remediate for those candidates; he asked whether this would double the budget for those services.
Dr. Mason stated that he and his staff will take a look at that subject to determine what that would mean from a
financial perspective, if the State reduced the threshold for the reportable level of lead exposure for children. He
noted that currently, children with reportable levels are reported to the State, then the State reports that to CCDPH;
CCDPH then goes out and either performs or is involved in the functions involving inspections, care management
and remediation, on behalf of the State.
Following discussion, Chairman Hammock asked Dr. Mason and his staff to return to the Board at a later date to
present information at a very high level on some of the things that could be done that would be effective to eliminate
lead poisoning exposure and how much it would cost. Director Lerner requested that intergovernmental relationships
be included in that discussion.
Director Wiese requested that, when collecting and presenting CCDPH data, when referencing race/ethnicity, a
column should be included for American Indians, rather than including their data in the “Other” category. This would
be helpful to their community, as “Other” does not indicate anything in particular about their needs, especially in
terms of health needs.

ii. Receive and file the following reports (Attachment #9):
a. Annual Tuberculosis Surveillance Report – 2014
b. Annual Tuberculosis Surveillance Report – 2013
c. HIV / AIDS Surveillance Report – 2013

Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved to receive and file the four (4) reports from
the Cook County Department of Public Health. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

VII. Report from Chairman of the Board
A.

Overview of Dual Employment and Accounting of Disclosures Reporting (this was deferred to December)
Chairman Hammock stated that the 2016 Board Meeting schedule is now finalized. The Committee Chairs are
currently working on their schedules for the coming year. He encouraged the Directors and Committee Chairs to
make the upcoming fiscal year a year of emphasis on Ambulatory Services; this should remain an important topic
for the Board and all Committees. Also, he asked that the Committees work with Dr. Shannon and his staff to
establish three (3) or four (4) major priorities for the coming year. The Board wants to know that the objectives that
Dr. Shannon and staff are setting are consistent and aligned with what the Board perceives as the objective for the
entire System. He asked that each Committee review those major objectives in January and track them over the
course of the year.
Chairman Hammock stated that Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel, has chosen to step down after many years of
service. She has been an enormous asset to CCHHS, but has decided that it is time to do other things. He presented
her with a Board Resolution (Attachment #11) in honor of her remarkable service, leadership and steadfast
commitment to the mission of CCHHS and the people it serves. Dr. Shannon stated that it is hard to express the
value that Ms. Reidy has brought to the organization. He stated that she is not only a source of institutional memory,
but also a major source of institutional wisdom, judgment, maturity and critical strategic considerations.

VIII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #12)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #12.
For the record, Dr. Shannon expressed his great gratitude, not only to the Cook County Health Foundation Board, but also
to the many benefactors who participated in the Cook County Health Foundation Gala on November 4th. He stated that it
looks like the Foundation may have raised as much as $200,000 to support cancer care services.

 The Birth of GPO’s
• In 1986, Congress granted GPOs in healthcare "Safe Harbor" from federal
anti-kickback statutes after successful lobbying efforts.
• By 2007, there were numerous healthcare GPOs, "affiliates" and
cooperatives in the United States that were collecting patronage dividends
from vendors in the form of administrative fees, or "remuneration."
• 96 percent of all acute-care hospitals and 98 percent of all community
hospitals held at least one GPO membership. Additionally, 97 percent of
all not-for-profit, non-governmental hospitals participated in some form of
group purchasing.

Legislative Update

Local
0 On November 13, 2015 the Cook County Finance Committee approved a number of revenue ordinances
introduced by President Preckwinkle in order to close the budget gap. The approved ordinances included
increases to County taxes on hotels, ammunition, e-cigarettes, as well as an increase in the Amusement Tax
closing a loophole with regard to ticket brokers.

On Wednesday, November 18, 2015 the Cook County Board approved the FY2016 Annual Appropriations
Ordinance. The Cook County Health and Hospitals System budget, as approved by the Board in August
2015 and submitted to the Cook County Board in September 2015 remained mostly intact. The budget
as approved by the Cook County Board was amended with a technical amendment submitted by CCH HS
correcting various line-items and included a further reduction to the Health Fund Tax Allocation from to


Additionally, a county-wide amendment was approved delaying implementation of the 2% Cost of Living
Increase (COLA) for all non-union employees from December 1, 2015 to June 1, 2016.

The FY2016 year begins December 1, 2015.

State
. .
- Illinois is now in its 20t week without a comprehensive state budget in place. The Governor and four legislative
leaders are scheduled to meet in person on November 18th. These leaders have not met together since May.
Federal

- The Bi-Partisan Budget Act of 2015 mapped out a two year budget plan that was negotiated by Congress and the
President prior to former Speaker Boehner?s retirement. This deal helped avert a government shutdown on
October 1, 2015, the beginning of the 2016 Federal Fiscal Year, and it extended the debt limit through March
2017. The deal resulted in an overall increase in discretionary spending by roughly $80 billion divided equally
between defense and discretionary domestic programs. The only Medicaid provision in the agreement would
require "manufacturers of generic drugs to join manufacturers of single-source or innovator drugs in paying
rebates to state Medicaid programs for price increases over inflation."

The broad budget deal did not include specific appropriations levels for discretionary programs. Therefore
under the agreement, Senate and House Committees on Appropriations are currently working on appropriations
legislation that must to be finalized by December 11, 2015? when the Continuing Resolution (CR) that currently
funds the government expires. lfthere is no agreement by that time and/or riders are attached to these
discretionary funding bill that are unacceptable to the President, it is possible that Washington could see
another government shutdown.

- While major cuts to entitlements, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), are not part of
the 2 year budget agreement, there are efforts underway in Congress to reduce them. The House of
Representatives recently passed budget reconciliation legislation. While Medicaid expansion was not repealed
in reconciliation legislation passed by the House, there were a number of other ACA provisions that were
repealed including: the individual mandate, employer mandate, Cadillac tax and the medical device tax. This bill
would also prohibit the flow of federal funds to Planned Parenthood for one year. The Senate has not yet taken
up this package and it is unclear whether there are enough Republican votes to pass such legislation. Even if
this measure were to pass the Senate in the House version?s current form, it would be vetoed by the President
and there are not enough votes to override a veto in either the House or the Senate.

2 Page

Page 92 of 96

- Although the 2 year Bi?partisan Budget Act contains no Medicaid reductions and the House passed reconciliation
bill focuses only on drug rebates?and Planned Parenthood? there are discussions under way in Congress
about how to approach Medicaid. House Committee on Energy Commerce Chairman Upton (R-MI) recently
created a Medicaid Task Force to work on ?strengthening and sustaining the critical program for the nation?s
most vulnerable citizens.? Currently, only Republicans are serving on the Task Force. Additionally, much of the
debate in the Senate is centered on whether to repeal or cutback on Medicaid expansion as part of a
reconciliation package.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
