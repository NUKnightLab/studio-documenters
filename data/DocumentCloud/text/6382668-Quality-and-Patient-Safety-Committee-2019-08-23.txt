CY19 Q2

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary
measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR >
1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted,
conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were
observed than predicted.

Program Overview
• Includes general, vascular, and subspecialty surgery cases
• Includes target cases
• Program uses clinical data (not administrative data)
• Outcomes assessed at 30 days after index surgery (inpatient or outpatient)
• Highly standardized and validated data definitions
• Data collected by a trained abstractor
• Advanced data analytics and hospital audits ensure data quality
• Provides data-driven tools for clinical decision making

Page 35 of 77

18

 NSQIP Case Selection
Systematic Sampling Process
• Cases are selected based on the NSQIP inclusion/exclusion criteria
•

Inclusion based on CPT® codes of major cases

•

General exclusion criteria
• Pediatrics
• Trauma and Transplant
• ASA class 6

• An 8 day cycle yields on average 250 surgical procedures
• Once exclusion criteria are applied to about 30% of the cases, there are enough cases remaining
to fulfill the 30 cases per cycle NSQIP requirement

“Exemplary” is assigned if the hospital is a low statistical outlier or is in the 1st quartile of adjusted OR
percentiles.
“Needs Improvement” is assigned if the hospital is a high statistical outlier or is in the 4th quartile of
adjusted OR percentiles.
“As Expected” is assigned if the hospital is neither a statistical outlier nor in the 1st or 4th OR quartile.
Complete explanations of statistical methods and how results should be interpreted are in the SAR
and available on the Resource Portal.
