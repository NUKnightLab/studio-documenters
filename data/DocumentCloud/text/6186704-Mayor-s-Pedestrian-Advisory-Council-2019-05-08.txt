Chicago Scooter Pilot

Mayor?s Pedestrian Advisory Council

May 7, 2019

2019 Scooter Pilot
Increasing transportation access for all Chicagoans
is a fundamental goal of the City.
In March, the New Transportation and Mobility Task Force
recommended a modest 2019 Scooter Pilot in a defined
area. The Chicago pilot was designed to address:
✶
✶
✶
✶
✶

Safety issues
Impact on the blind/visually impaired and other people with disabilities
Operator performance in managing sidewalk clutter and access to buildings
Best locations for these services
Effects on the Divvy system, transit and community choices.
16

 Overview
✶ 4-month shared scooter pilot, with 2,500
total scooters, beginning June 15 on the
West Side of Chicago
✶ Designed to test the impact of scooters
on transportation access and quality of
life in a variety of community types

priority area every day.

down and eventually stop upon leaving the operating
zone.

19

 Equity Considerations
