evenings.
2. The committee reviewed the voting member application of Cortney Lederer
Motion: to approve Cortney Lederer as a voting member of the WPB Arts Committee.
All in favor
3. The committee discussed funding a mural program
a. DG describes the idea- it would be similar to a façade rebate program to encourage
more building owners/businesses to add art in the community. But DG is concerned
that it is not equitable, it is only open to people with an open wall. SM- maybe it could
also be in vacant storefronts
i. SM would prefer to put together a program to paint the underpasses
b. CR- this could be a benefit to businesses because it could draw people in. SM- what
about the “What would you like to see here” prject
c. SM- can we get an intern to research the landmarks district? DG- how do we gather all
of this information about what is happening in the neighborhood? SM- can we sponsor
a photo show of happenings?
i. The Arts tab is meant to collect the information of arts happenings in the area
1. CR will put together an outline of suggestions for the website.
