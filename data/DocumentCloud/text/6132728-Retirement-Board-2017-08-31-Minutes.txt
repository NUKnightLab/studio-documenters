The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters. .
•

Sometime ago, the Board approved a motion seeking lead plaintiff class action status, in the
Treasury Security Auction Antitrust Litigation. This litigation alleged that financial institutions
serving as primary dealers in the US Treasury market colluded with high frequency trading firms
and employed an anticompetitive scheme to manipulate the Treasury market. The counsel hired by
the Fund, Scott & Scott, for this case has indicated that the Fund will not be included in the
amended complaint as a representative plaintiff, nor have any requests been forthcoming from lead
counsel to further assist in the prosecution of this action. Scott & Scott recommends dismissing the
action and will file papers with the court withdrawing from the case.
It was then moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Maloney that the Board withdraw from the case
based upon the recommendation of hired counsel Scott & Scott.
