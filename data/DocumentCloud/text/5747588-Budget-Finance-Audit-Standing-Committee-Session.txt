Submitting report relative to a review of the Michigan Lame-Duck Bills (Nov. 18, 2018Dec. 31, 2018). (Due primarily to the impact of Michigan’s State office term limits law,
there was a significant turnover of lawmakers in both the Michigan State House and
Senate. This year, during the State Legislature’s Lame-Duck Session, the State House
and Senate submitted approximately 340 bills for the Governor to consider, of those
bills, the Governor vetoed 55 bills. It appears the term limits law has influenced the
legislature to promote bills which disproportionally support the concerns of special
interest, while railing against causes which would help the less fortunate of Michigan,
such as curtailing the recent voter approved referendum on minimum wage increases,
under Senate Bill 1171, which is detailed in this report. We have attached a complete
list of the Lame Duck legislation and actions for Council’s edification.) (REFERRED
