Reason: For the purpose of purchasing call center technology for the office.

To Account(s): 11000.1040.13945.531690, $160,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $160,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on 4/11/2019 that the account would require additional funds. The balance in the
account was $273,898.80, but that balance has obligations designated to it for the remainder of FY2019.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account used for the source of the transferred funds was identified as having enough funds to
accommodate the postage needs of the office for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in

the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The prior CCAO administration estimated the postage needs for the office for 2019. We have revised our
postage needs for the year based on changes made to the volume of mailings done for 2019, as well as the
need for the funds to cover a vital project key to the new assessor’s operational priorities.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

matters involving Civil, Criminal, Family, Probate, Mental Health, Traffic, Juvenile, Bankruptcy and other
proceedings without leaving their homes or offices; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, In its Call to Action: Achieving Civil Justice for All, the Conference of Chief
Justices’ Civil Justice Improvement Committee set forth a convincing series of findings and
recommendations, which among them was the promotion of remote audio and video services for court
hearings and management; and
WHEREAS, the Center for Legal and Court Technology, a non-profit research organization that
improves the administration of Justice through the use of technology, progressively encourages the
utilization of remote and video court appearances throughout the United States to enhance the efficiency
of judicial administration and court proceedings for both attorney’s and the public; and
WHEREAS, in 1992, the Supreme Court of Illinois adopted rule 185 to allow for telephonic appearances
in certain civil proceedings; and in 2017, the Supreme Court of Illinois amended its rules to also allow for
remote video conferences; and
WHEREAS, in Los Angeles Superior Court a system with approximately 494 judicial officers and
comparable to the Cook County Circuit Court, over 200 of those judicial officers allow for remote court
appearances with a volume of over 83,000 appearances in 2018; moreover, approximately $4.6 million in
revenue over a three-year period attributable to remote court appearances in Los Angeles was generated;
and
WHEREAS, in Illinois, approximately 20 counties spread over 12 Judicial Circuits utilize some form of
audio and video remote appearances with approximately 4,516 remote appearance being completed in
2018; more particularly, the following “Collar” county courts use remote court appearance technology: the
16th Judicial Circuit - Kane County 3,305 appearances since 11/2011, the 18th Judicial Circuit Court DuPage County 1,379 since 9/2014, the 19th Judicial Circuit - Lake County 1,456 since 6/2016 and the

WHEREAS, Cook County has been and continues to be a leader in technology through strategic
Countywide initiatives and collaboration with elected offices; thus, our existing applications and resources
will allow for a seamless integration of our existing technology platforms with audio and video remote
appearances; and
WHEREAS, the use of video and audio remote court appearances has the potential to offer key benefits
to the public, such as cost savings on attorney fees for lower-income citizens, increasing pro bono
assistance, availability of court interpreters, travel costs and work absences associated with attending a
court hearing can deter self-represented litigants from effectively pursuing or defending their legal rights,
thereby further promoting access to justice in courts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request a hearing of the Technology and Innovation Committee be convened to review and discuss
the potential feasibility, application, and access to justice that remote court appearances may have in Cook
County courtrooms; and

(6)

The Good Faith Effort Transparency Report shall be due at the time the bid or proposal is
due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Good Faith
Effort Transparency Report, as approved by the CCD, shall be incorporated into the
Contract. Failure to include a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report upon submission of
a request for a partial or full waiver shall result in no consideration for waiver and render
the bid or proposal not Responsive.

(7)

Once the CCD approves a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report, the Contractor, Person,
or Business may not change the Good Faith Effort Transparency Report without the prior
written approval of the CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the Using Agency. Upon
such written approval by the CCD, the revised Good Faith Effort Transparency Report
shall be incorporated into the Contract as an amendment by the CPO and made available
to the Board for review no later than one week prior to the Bid appearing on the Board
agenda for approval. The CCD shall promulgate policies and procedures with respect to
changes to a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report.

Sec. 34-282 - Additional Good Faith Effort Factors for Consideration.
(a)The Contract Compliance Director may also consider additional factors, if known, including,
but not limited to:
1.

Whether the Contractor, Person, or Business followed up with PCEs who it originally
identified but were unable to include in the bid, based upon prior communication, but prior
to submitting its bid;

2.

Whether the Contractor, Person, or Business established delivery schedules which will
encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of the Procurement permit;

3.

Whether the Contractor, Person, or Business used the services and assistance of the CCD's
staff, the Small Business Administration, and/or the Office of Minority Business
Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;

4.

Whether the Contractor, Person, or Business timely notified appropriate community, and
minority, and/or women business organizations, identified as assist agencies, of the
opportunity for participation in the Procurement;

5.

Whether the Contractor, Person, or Business maintains or commits to establish and
maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or more PCEs that is enforceable and that,
in the judgment of the CCD, has performance standards and outcomes that are clearly
established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring additional skills,
experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE, consistent with
the provisions of Section 34-271(d).

(b)
In determining whether a Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith Efforts,
the levels of participation by PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Contractors, Persons,
or Businesses for the same Procurement may be considered. For example, if the apparent successful
Contractor, Person, or Business fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average
216

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

PCE participation obtained by other Contractors, Persons, or Businesses, this may be evidence that the
apparent successful Contractors, Persons, or Businesses made Good Faith Efforts.
(c)Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those
professionals whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1)

A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good
faith" efforts shall be demonstrated by the submission of the Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report, by the Contractor, Person, or Business, and CCD’s consideration of
additional factors pursuant to Sections 34-271 34-271, 34-281, and 34- 282; provided,
however, such Contractors, Persons, or Businesses shall not be required to attempt to
subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type of
Procurement. In such cases, the Contractor, Person, or Business shall also complete a Good
Faith Effort Transparency Report detailing the reasons for not subcontracting the
professional services for the specific bid.

(2)

The Contractor, Person, or Business will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies,
equipment, goods, or services for such Contractor, Person, or Business’ business
operations not specifically for the Procurement.

(3)

If such Contractor, Person, or Business is required to have or has an affirmative action plan
and goals, such plan and goals shall be submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD
shall compare such plan and goals with the Contractor, Person, or Business’ actual
affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County
in future Procurements.

(d)Mentor/protégé agreements. Where a Contractor, Person, or Business enters into or maintains a
mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to improve or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE,
the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such agreement as a factor in determining good faith efforts. The
mentor/protégé agreement may provide for the Contractor, Person, or Business to assist the PCE in such
areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial management, or providing on-the-job
training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protégé agreement shall satisfy the following
requirements.
(1)

The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;

(2)

The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and

(3)

The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor, Person, or
Business and the PCE and includes specific, measurable goals to be attained by both
parties through the performance of the agreement. In order to be a factor in establishing
best efforts, the mentor/protégé agreement must be for a reasonable period of time.

(e)The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1)

There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods, or
services required for the Procurement;
217

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

(2)

(3)

The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and

(4)

Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Contractor, Person, or
Business’ Utilization Plan and Good Faith Effort Transparency Report.

(f)Should the CCD grant any partial or full waiver, the CCD shall report, in writing, its
justification for granting the waiver, pursuant to Section 34-283.
Sec. 34-283. - Contract Compliance Director Waiver Transparency Reporting.
The CCD shall report to the Board, in writing, on a monthly basis, and at least three (3) days prior
to the Board meeting where such Contracts seek Board approval with a waiver request, a report

regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why
agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject PCEs as being unqualified

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, Chapter 34 Finance, Article IV
Procurement, Division 8 Minority and Woman-Owned Business Enterprises, Section 34- 297 Contract PreAward Compliance Procedures is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 34-297. - Contract Pre-Award Compliance Procedures.
(a)

a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from which the Contractor, Person, or Business solicited
bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement of the Goals or
its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. Any
Contractor, Person, or Business requesting a partial or full waiver shall submit a Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report with its Utilization Plan when the Utilization Plan is due. In the event a bid or
proposal leads to a Contract with the County, the Utilization Plan as approved, and any Good Faith Effort
Transparency Report as approved and applicable, by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material
commitment on the part of the Contractor, Person, or Business to each relevant PCE, and the contractor
Contractor, Person, or Business, and the County. Failure to include a Utilization Plan, and Good Faith
Effort Transparency Report, where applicable, shall render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b)

the Contractor requires that the PCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is
prohibited.
(c)
Where the contractor Contractor, Person, or Business cannot achieve the Project
Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine whether the Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith
Efforts to meet the Goal(s), based upon the submission of a Good Faith Effort Transparency Report by
the bidding Contractor, Person, or Business and consideration of additional factors by the CCD, pursuant
to Sections 34-281 and 34-282. Parties A Contractor, Person, or Business submitting bids or proposals for
Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established Project Specific
Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum,
whether the Contractor has: the Good Faith Effort Transparency Report, pursuant to Section 34-281 and
additional factors, pursuant to Section 34-282.
(1)

Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all PCEs certified in the scopes of work of
the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested PCEs with timely, adequate
information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow PCEs
222

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with
interested PCEs.
(2)

Selected portions of the work to be performed by PCEs in order to increase the likelihood
that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking
out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate PCE participation,
even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own
forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to PCEs
and to select those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability
of PCEs to facilitate their participation.

(3)

names, addresses, and telephone numbers of PCEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for
subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with PCEs. The Contractor may
not reject PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough
investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet
the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a
Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does not relieve it
of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that could be
subcontracted.

(4)

Made efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide
assistance in the recruitment and placement of PCEs.

Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or
more PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance
standards and outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the
PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term
success of the PCE consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).

(d)
In determining whether a Contractor, Person, or Business has made Good Faith Efforts,
the performance of other Contractors, Persons, or Businesses in meeting the Project Specific Goals
may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails to
meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with
additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor, Person, or Business fails to
meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other
223

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

Contractors, Persons, or Businesses, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor, Person,
or Business made Good Faith Efforts.

or services to be performed or provided by the PCE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the
time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f)

and the letters of intent from PCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing of items listed in the
Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts augment or modify any Good Faith Effort Transparency Report.

have been achieved or accepts the Good Faith Efforts Transparency Report submitted, made, with the
concurrence of the User Agency, the CCD and User Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.

sufficient Good Faith Efforts Transparency Report, the CCD shall communicate this finding to the
Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this
determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO COSPONSOR AND
SUPPORT H.R. 96 (VETERAN’S DENTAL CARE)
WHEREAS, The purpose of the Veteran’s Administration is, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, “To care
for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan”; and
WHEREAS, The Veterans Administration provides health care to many Veterans through its 1,250 health
care facilities, including 172 VA Medical Centers and 1,069 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity;
and
WHEREAS, After serving our Country, our Veterans have earned the very best healthcare possible,
something the Veteran’s Administrations has pledged to provide; and
WHEREAS, Despite providing various types of healthcare to over 9 million Veterans, the Veteran’s
Health Administration (VHA) fails to provide dental care to most of those Veterans; and
WHEREAS, According to the VHA’s own statistics, while over 9 million Veterans are eligible for
healthcare under the VHA, only about 500,000, or 5.6%, of those are receiving dental care, as the
qualifications require a Veteran to be 100% disabled or have been a POW to receive full dental care; and
WHEREAS, While Veterans are able to purchase dental insurance through the VA Dental Insurance
Program (VADIP), it is not an affordable option, leaving Veterans with no other choice but to walk
around with rotted teeth and other signs of a lack of dental care; and
WHEREAS, Dental health has been proven to affect other aspects of health including cancer,
Alzheimer’s, diabetes and more. Good dental care can prevent many of these diseases, leading the VA to
save money on treating future diseases; and
WHEREAS, According to the 2016 Oral Health in Illinois Report, in 2015, over one third of adults in
Illinois (36%) reported not having visited the dentist in the past year, with lack of insurance being one of
the barriers to dental care; and
230

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

WHEREAS, H.R. 96 introduced by U.S. Rep. Julia Brownley would amend Title 38, USC, to require the
Veteran’s Administration to furnish dental care in the same manner as any other medical service, giving
more Veterans access to full dental care that they severely need; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby recognize the right of all Veterans to have full coverage for dental care; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the Illinois
Congressional Delegation to sign on as co-sponsors to H.R. 96 and support it in any manner possible to
ensure that our Veterans receive the proper and sufficient dental care that they deserve; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body and copies of this resolution be presented to U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, and U.S. Representative
Bobby Rush as representatives of the delegation.

URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO SUPPORT HB2495, THE
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACT
WHEREAS, every individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about one's own
reproductive health; and
WHEREAS, every individual who becomes pregnant has a fundamental right to continue the pregnancy
and give birth or to have an abortion; and
WHEREAS, no person who has terminated a pregnancy has made that deeply personal decision lightly;
and
WHEREAS, accessing reproductive health care is not a criminal activity; and
WHEREAS, the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health non-profit, found that women around the
world access abortion services at a statistically same rate whether they are legal and safe or illegal and
unregulated; and
WHEREAS, deaths and injuries from unsafe abortions are preventable; and
WHEREAS, marginalized individuals are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions as they are
unable to seek safe and legal services in another country, state or county or access private care; and
WHEREAS, over the last 60 years, more than 30 countries have changed their laws to allow for greater
231

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

access to abortion in recognition of its vital role in protecting women’s lives and health; and
WHEREAS, in 1973 the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade to protect legal rights to safe abortions;
and
WHEREAS, criminalization of abortion results in a chilling effect, in which medical professionals may
apply more narrow restrictions than required by the law or in which women and girls may be deterred
from seeking health care for life-threatening complications due to unsafe abortions or other pregnancy
issues; and
WHEREAS, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW, or the Treaty for the Rights of Women), has consistently stated that restrictive
abortion laws constitute discrimination against women; and
WHEREAS, under international human rights law, everyone has a right to life, health, and to be free from
violence, discrimination, and torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that being forced into
illegal, unsafe abortions constitutes a violation therein; and
WHEREAS, nearby states with restrictive laws are also served by Illinois’ safeguards and as of 2017,
about 5,500 out-of-state women had the procedure performed in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, in 2017, Illinois legislators passed a law that was signed into law by then Republican Gov.
Bruce Rauner requiring state health insurance and Medicaid to cover abortions; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Reproductive Health Act (IRHA) establishes and protects the fundamental right
to safe and legal reproductive health care including contraceptives, maternal care and abortion care; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA protects all personal choices individuals may make about their reproductive
health, including the right to choose or refuse birth control, the right to carry a pregnancy to term and give
birth, and the right to choose or refuse abortion; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA codifies current standards of medical best practices on who can perform abortions
and prescribe non-surgical abortion-related medications; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA regulates clinics that perform abortions like all other medical clinics; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA finally repeals the decades-old Illinois Abortion Law of 1975 and the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act, which, though currently enjoined by courts, established criminal penalties for
performing an abortion and providing certain types of contraceptives, and allowed a husband to prevent his
wife from having an abortion; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA amends the Illinois Insurance Code to ensure that private insurance companies
will also cover health care costs for services related to abortion, adding to already required coverage
related to contraception, infertility treatments, and maternity care; and
WHEREAS, we must ensure fundamental health care protections for future generations of women and
safeguard the reproductive rights of women in Illinois and beyond; and
232

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

May 23, 2019

WHEREAS, protections provided by Roe v. Wade is under increasing threat in states across the country
including in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Georgia and Missouri; and
WHEREAS, these state laws may lead to a US Supreme Court challenge of Roe. V. Wade, that may
overturn federal protections; and
WHEREAS, should Roe v. Wade be overturned, the provisions of Illinois’ restrictive Abortion Law of
1975 and Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act will go into effect; and
WHEREAS, the IRHA was filed with the Clerk as H.B. 2495 by Representative Kelly M. Cassidy, with
Chief Co-Sponsors including Representative Sara Feigenholtz, Representative Emanuel Chris Welch,
Representative Marcus C. Evans, Jr., Representative Jehan Gordon-Booth and 35 additional co-sponsors;
and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby recognize the need to keep abortion and reproductive health care safe and
accessible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners urges the Illinois
General Assembly to pass H.B. 2495 of the 101st General Assembly, also known as the Illinois
Reproductive Health Act, and support it in any manner possible to ensure residents can continue to be
able to practice their fundamental rights to choose their reproductive futures.
