Summary: An extension is required to complete roofing work. This request is for time only. Delays
occurred due to the contractor’s difficulty securing bonding for the project. Though this contract was
awarded in July, the contractor was not able to produce adequate bonding until October. By the time
materials were approved, ordered and ready for delivery to the site, the weather had changed to make
installation of the roofing systems problematic. Since the weather has now changed, the work has started
and is proceeding to schedule.
