There were no requests to address the Board.
LEGISLATION
Legislative Update
Mr. Mohler updated the Board on status of the Fund sponsored legislation currently being considered in the
Illinois State Legislature. Additionally, Mr. Mohler reviewed the Legislative Report provided by the Fund’s
Legislative Liaison.
Ms. Burns updated the Board on other proposed legislation that may affect the Fund. Specifically, Ms.
Burns discussed SB 2575 a proposed “Local Government Protection Act” which could allow governments to
declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Ms. Burns suggested that should such legislation move out of committee,
the Fund give the Fund’s Legislative Liaison the authority to submit a slip in opposition of the bill. No action
was taken other than to direct the Fund’s Legislative Liaison to closely track the Bill.
