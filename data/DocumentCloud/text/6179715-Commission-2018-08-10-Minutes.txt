Has the website map been corrected? It was showing Events separate from
Experiences on main page but later showed Events were under Experiences.

Barry – CTA street adapters?

New Business
There are a couple of people interested in being SSA #19 commissioners.
Marilyn Banks was mentioned by Barry – Charlotte is concerned with her
activity in the community and how she maintains her place.
It would be good to have someone from Paulina as a commissioner – a
property owner or a business owner.
The Recyclery is a co-op – has a co-op board and it could be complicated to
have them as a commissioner but they could assign a representative.
What about businesses west on Howard?
Simone is still listed as a commissioner – listing her reinstatement here in the
minutes.
For the September meeting, have the potential commissioners attend so they
can be vetted.
Need to let Cynthia know if you cannot attend a meeting and try to be available
by phone.
Charlotte Walters moves to reinstate Simone Freeman of Sol Cafe as
commissioner. Gale Howard seconds it. Motion passed.
There was a discussion regarding Barry Hoven’s activities as Chair who is
operating without the consent of the other commissioners and they expressed
their concern that there needs to be a consensus, especially in sending emails
and meeting with City officials that oversee the SSA program in Chicago.

Carrie Sullivan moves to do a 2 month check-in with Barry Hoven as
Commissioner. Charlotte Walters seconds it. Motion passed.
