of the discussion.
Commissioner Carter - explained that heading was changed to include IEPA and
USEPA methodology
Commissioner Pressnall - (Under IEPA EJ Policy heading) move to add
explanation of IEPA’s EJ demographic screening tool, its methodology, and how
the IEPA incorporates data to this system.
Commissioner Harley - should define USEPA criteria for overburdened
communities

USEPA’s definition of an “overburdened community.” Directly above the

“USEPA Criteria for Overburdened Communities”.
Commissioners continued discussion of paragraph organization, wording changes
and how the IEPA discussion should relate to the USEPA EJ SCREEN
