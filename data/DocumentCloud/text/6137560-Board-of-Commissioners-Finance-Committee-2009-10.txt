 FINANCE COMMITTEE REPORT
OCTOBER 20, 2009
PAGE 24
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois’ Video Gaming Act (230 ILCS 40/1 et seq.; PA 10
96-0034) became law July 13, 2009 and allows licensed retail establishments to
conduct video gambling; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that some Illinois local jurisdictions would desire to opt
out of video gambling, Section 27 of the Video Gaming Act permits counties and
municipalities to prohibit video gaming by ordinance within their respective
corporate limits or unincorporated areas; and
WHEREAS, states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina have
abandoned experiments with the legalization of video poker because of regulatory
difficulties, corruption, and the high social costs associated with this form of
gambling; and
WHEREAS, electronic gaming is designed to entice people to play longer, faster,
and at higher rates of wagering, according to a study by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County
Board President agree that legalized video poker would present a variety of
adverse impacts on residents of Cook County including the potential for corruption,
increasing the costs of law enforcement, regulatory difficulties, and high social
costs; and
WHEREAS, the legalization of video poker within Cook County is not consistent
with our desire to maintain a family friendly environment for citizens and their
children; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County
Board President call on every municipality within Cook County to join the County in
prohibiting video gaming.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, that Chapter 58 Offenses and Miscellaneous Provisions, Section

section does prohibit any video gaming authorized by 230 ILCS 40/1 et seq. and
