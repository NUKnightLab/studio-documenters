Summary:

The Department of Transportation and Highways respectfully requests that the Fair Transit

BOARD AGENDA

September 5, 2019

The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation..
Summary: Requesting authorization to enter into contract with Axon Enterprise to allow the Sheriff's
Office to upgrade and expand its existing body worn camera and TASER weapon inventory to outfit more
sworn members. This upgrade and expansion will provide the public and sworn members with additional
safety and security. This contract includes cloud storage for video footage recorded on body worn
cameras to Axon Evidence (Evidence.com), which provides seamless end user accessibility. Additionally,
this contract with Axon includes the TASER Assurance Plan (TAP) which is comprised of hardware
extended coverage, spare products for Axon cameras, upgrade models, Axon body camera and Axon
docking stations, only available through Axon Enterprise, Inc. Axon exclusively maintains their products
and services.
Any work completed/attempted to be completed outside of the original manufacturer
renders the manufacturer's warranty void.

Axon is the only company that sells law enforcement grade weapons which are sold strictly to law
enforcement agencies. The TASER brand weapon is the only weapon that will activate the body worn
camera (v3) manufactured by Axon. Axon is the sole distributor of all TASER brand products. The body
worn camera and TASER weapon both manufactured by Axon are one of a kind because when the
TASER weapon is utilized, the body worn camera is activated. Axon cloud storage is unique to the Axon
weapon and Axon camera because when docked on the respective docking station, the data/video uploads
directly to the cloud without the user having to do anything more than dock the camera/weapon.
Public Defender: Axon Justice Systems provides body worn cameras by contract with the Chicago Police
Department and several other law enforcement agencies in Cook County. Each of those agencies has a
duty, through the pre-trial discovery process, to share the videos recorded by those cameras with the
Public Defender's Office.
The only means of sharing those videos which won't require the Public
Defender's Office to buy and maintain permanent storage is to maintain an account with Axon Justice
System. This account would allow us to receive and keep videos that are essential to the representation of
our clients. Axon Justice System is the only provider we could use for this as their body cameras and the
videos they create are designed to work with an account with their agency. No other system would allow
us to watch and store the videos.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
