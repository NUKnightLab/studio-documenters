Journal - Final

May 21, 2014

URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO FORM A TASK FORCE TO RESEARCH,
DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE LEGISLATION FOR LEGALIZING AND REGULATING CANNABIS
USE FOR ADULTS IN ILLINOIS
WHEREAS, in 2000, the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) attempted to restate the goals of the
“War on Drugs”; “to educate and enable America's youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco; to
increase the safety of America's citizens by substantially reducing drug related crime and violence; to reduce health
and social costs to the public of illegal drugs use; to shield America's air, land, and sea frontiers from the drug
threat; and to break foreign and domestic drug sources of supply”; and
WHEREAS, in reality, most scholars agree that despite spending more than $1 trillion dollars over the last 40 years
on the “War on Drugs”, we have succeeded in none of these goals; and
WHEREAS, despite the efforts of the War on Drugs, the health and social costs of drugs increase every year, and
drug users are at heightened risk of death, illness and overdose, as the drugs available on the black market are
generally less safe. Drugs are no less available than before, our borders are not secure, and treatment is not
available to the vast majority of people who need it; and
WHEREAS, in 2010, the Obama Administration’s inaugural National Drug Control Strategy charted a new course
in our efforts to reduce illicit drug use and its consequences in the United States by calling for drug policy reform
rooted in scientific research on addiction, evidence-based prevention programs, increased access to treatment, a
historic emphasis on recovery and criminal justice reform; and
WHEREAS, the 2013 Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) strategy consists of the following goals:
“prevent drug use before it ever begins through education; expand access to treatment for Americans struggling
with addiction; reform our criminal justice system to break the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration while
protecting public safety; support Americans in recovery by lifting the stigma associated with those suffering or in
recovery from substance abuse disorders”; and
WHEREAS, between 2001 and 2010, there were over 8 million marijuana arrests in the United States, 88% of
which were for possession. Marijuana arrests have increased between 2001 and 2010 and now account for over half
(52%) of all drug arrests in the United States, and marijuana possession arrests account for nearly half (46%) of all
drug arrests; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large number
of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled in a manner that
makes poor use of limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, the criminalization of marijuana use disproportionately harms young people and people of color,
sponsors massive levels of violence and corruption, and fails to curb youth access; and
WHEREAS, on average, an African-American is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession
than a Caucasian, even though African Americans and Caucasians use marijuana at similar rates. In the states with
the worst disparities, African-Americans were on average over six times more likely to be arrested for marijuana
possession than Caucasians. In the worst offending counties across the country, African Americans were 10, 15,
even 30 times more likely to be arrested than Caucasians in the same county. Such racial disparities in marijuana
possession arrests exist in all regions of the country, in counties large and small, urban and rural, wealthy and poor,
and with large and small African American populations; and
WHEREAS, there have been 1 million arrests for misdemeanor marijuana possession in the State of Illinois from
1975 to 2009 and Illinois ranked sixth in the nation in per-capita marijuana arrest rates in 2007, representing 58

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

May 21, 2014

percent of all drug arrests in the state; and
WHEREAS, mirroring national trends, throughout Illinois, non-whites are arrested at a higher rate than whites
relative to their representation in the general population. Arrest data from 2007 indicated that disproportionality
in drug arrests occurred in 62 of the 102 counties in Illinois, including urban, suburban, and rural areas and that
most of the disproportionality in Illinois drug laws was related to drug possession charges, which accounted for
nearly 75 percent of felony drug arrests across the State; and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that the City of Chicago decriminalized small amounts of marijuana possession 2
years ago and the number of arrests for marijuana possession have dropped to their lowest level in 12 years, police
continue to make an average of 44 arrests a day for misdemeanor possession more than for any other offense and
78 percent of those arrested since August 2012 for carrying small amounts of pot were African American, 17 percent
were Hispanic, and just 4 percent were Caucasian; and
WHEREAS, marijuana related arrests in every Cook County municipality, including Chicago, result in staggering
costs to County government by virtue of the necessary involvement of the County jail, Sheriff’s department, State’s
Attorney, Clerk of the Court, Judiciary and often times, the Public Defender, annually costing Cook County
taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, for the last several years, while Chicago police have made approximately 23,000 arrests a year for
marijuana possession, an astounding 97 percent of charges involving 2.5 grams or less were dismissed between
2006 and 2010, creating nothing more than an unnecessary arrest record for some 20,000 individuals; and
WHEREAS, arresting people for cannabis possession does nothing to reduce its use, rather it can often create
barriers to living a normal life by negatively impacting public housing and student financial aid eligibility,
employment opportunities, child custody determinations, and immigration status, even if as is almost always the
case, the charges are dismissed; and
WHEREAS, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), a nonprofit organization made up of current and
former members of the law enforcement and criminal justice communities, is speaking out about the failures of our
existing drug policies and how they continue to fail to effectively address the problems of drug abuse, especially
among juveniles, the problems of addiction, and the problems of crime caused by the existence of a criminal black
market in drugs; and
WHEREAS, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) stated vision is to have a system of legalization and
regulation which will end the violence, better protect human rights, safeguard our children, reduce crime and
disease, treat drug abusers as patients, reduce addiction, use tax dollars more efficiently, and restore the public’s
respect and trust in law enforcement; and
WHEREAS, noted neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta has stated that marijuana was classified as a Schedule 1
substance, despite evidence that it was not as addictive as alcohol or tobacco; and
WHEREAS, existing evidence from other states and countries show there is no indication that decriminalization
of marijuana leads to a measurable increase in its use; and on the effects of marijuana decriminalization on marijuana
use provides no indication that decriminalization leads to a measurable increase in marijuana use; and
WHEREAS, a 2005 report by Harvard University Professor of Economics, Dr. Jeffrey Miron, entitled “The
Budgetary Implications of Marijuana Prohibition” has been endorsed by more than 530 distinguished economists,
who signed an open letter to then President George W. Bush, the United States Congress, and Governors and State
Legislatures across the country calling for “an open and honest debate about marijuana prohibition,” and stated,
“We believe such a debate will favor a regime in which marijuana is legal but taxed and regulated like other
goods”. Chief among the endorsing economists were three (3) Nobel Laureates in economics: Dr. Milton

 Board of Commissioners

Friedman of the Hoover Institute, Dr. George Akerlof of the University of California at Berkeley and Dr. Vernon
Smith of George Mason University; and
WHEREAS, approximately $8.7 billion in savings would result from legalization of marijuana at the national level;
and
WHEREAS, the citizens of Colorado and Washington, both States having previously legalized the use of medical
marijuana, voted in favor of ballot referendums in 2012 to legalize and regulate the use of recreational marijuana
for adults over the age of 21, which were subsequently enacted in 2013; and
WHEREAS, Colorado State's Joint Budget Committee expects to collect approximately $184 million in tax
revenue from recreational marijuana in the first 18 months of legalized sale, and projects tax revenue of about $610
million when looking at both recreational and medical marijuana sales for that same time period. Washington state
budget officials estimate the state will reap about $134 million in tax revenue generated by marijuana sales in the
2015-2017 biennium; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is facing severe budget and financial constraints and lawmakers face the undesirable choice
of deciding between increased taxes or substantial service cuts, creating an intelligent, practical framework of
cannabis legalization, regulation and taxation can help address a myriad of problems such as improved health and
public safety, reduced criminal justice and jail costs, law enforcement efficacy, black market drug displacement as
well as increased revenue for education and treatment protocols.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does herby urge the
Illinois General Assembly to form a task force to research, develop and introduce legislation to legalize and regulate
cannabis use in Illinois for adults; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of the Illinois
House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.

Journal - Final

May 21, 2014

WHEREAS, though there is no way to adequately repay our nation’s military personnel for their service and
sacrifice, we can demonstrate our gratitude by forging a collaborative effort between businesses and government
that will connect veterans and active-duty military personnel with merchants who choose to honor their military
service through special discounts and promotions; and
WHEREAS, the discount card program, to be named after adoption of this resolution by mutual assent of the
relevant County departments and agencies including, but not limited to, the Bureau of Administration, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office, will provide veterans - those
honorably discharged and other veterans generally discharged for reasons other than discipline, misconduct,
resignation in lieu of misconduct charges, unfitness for duty, voluntary resignation, or court martial - and military
personnel currently serving our country, with discount cards that can be used at recruited merchants throughout
Cook County who agree to honor the card by providing holders with a discount on goods and services, or another
appropriate money-saving promotion of their choice; and
WHEREAS, the veterans’ and military discount card program will be mutually beneficial, helping veterans save
money with discounts on goods and services, and helping business owners to enjoy increased traffic and sales in
their stores; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office operates a Veterans Service Office, whose main function
is to record, safeguard and retrieve DD-214 military discharge records, which are documents issued to servicemen
or women upon completion of their service; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds’ Office will issue and produce the veteran identification cards;
the Cook County Recorder will use DD-214 military discharge records in conjunction with photo identification
such as a driver’s license, state ID card, federal military or Veterans Affairs ID, or passport, to issue the card to
veterans; in the case of active-duty military, a valid military ID or other official government identification that
denotes active-duty service and photo ID if needed, will be used; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Veterans Affairs Division within the Cook County Bureau of Administration already
has the outreach capabilities to let our servicemen and veterans know about this program and the Recorder’s Office
will assist with promoting this and other Cook County veterans’ benefits; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Office of the Cook County Board President may
also disseminate information and assist in this program; and
WHEREAS, this program is dedicated to the nearly 225,000 veterans in Cook County, who represent almost
one-third of all Illinois veterans, and to the active-duty personnel currently serving, as well as to those who have
made the ultimate sacrifice.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that the Cook County
Veterans Affairs Division and the Cook County Recorder of Deeds honor those who serve this great nation by
implementing a Veterans’ Discount Card Program.

ADULT ORAL HEALTH CARE
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6 (a) of the
1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, this country’s strength and ability to prosper is grounded in the health and safety of its people. For
many years now millions of Americans could not afford adequate healthcare. The Affordable Care Act affords us
an opportunity to provide and improve health care services to every American; and
WHEREAS, while the passage of the Affordable Care Act has moved this country in a direction for all people to
have health insurance, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the need for adjustments as a program of this
magnitude is implemented; and

WHEREAS, the U.S. Surgeon General refers to dental disease as a silent epidemic. In 2000 the U.S. Surgeon
General issued a report on the Oral Health of American, in it the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
Research showed the link between general health and oral health. The report went on to say that many systemic
diseases and conditions have oral manifestations. These manifestations may be the initial sign of clinical disease
and as such serve to inform clinicians and individuals of the need for further assessment. More importantly, the
report notes that the oral cavity is a portal of entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that affect
general health status; and
WHEREAS, it is also acknowledge by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the lack of
access to dental care is extremely important because left untreated oral disease can lead not only to pain, infection
and tooth loss, but also contribute to an increased risk for serious medical conditions such as diabetes, heart
disease and poor birth outcomes; and
WHEREAS, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention there are threats to oral health across
one’s lifespan. Nearly one-third of all adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay. One in seven adults
aged 35 to 44 years has gum disease, this increases to one in every four adults aged 65 years and older; and

ADULT ORAL HEALTH CARE
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a) of the 1970
Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government
and affairs; and
WHEREAS, this country’s strength and ability to prosper is grounded in the health and safety of its people. For
many years now millions of Americans could not afford adequate healthcare. The Affordable Care Act affords us
an opportunity to provide and improve health care services to every American; and
WHEREAS, while the passage of the Affordable Care Act has moved this country in a direction for all people to
have health insurance, it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the need for adjustments as a program of this
magnitude is implemented; and
WHEREAS, the Affordable Care Act excludes adult oral health care services while it covers many essential health
benefits. It has been acknowledged by oral health care agencies and professionals that oral health care is essential
to insure overall quality of health; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Surgeon General refers to dental disease as a silent epidemic. In 2000 the U.S. Surgeon
General issued a report on the Oral Health of American, in it the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
Research showed the link between general health and oral health. The report went on to say that many systemic
diseases and conditions have oral manifestations. These manifestations may be the initial sign of clinical disease
and as such serve to inform clinicians and individuals of the need for further assessment. More importantly, the
report notes that the oral cavity is a portal of entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that affect
general health status; and
WHEREAS, it is also acknowledge by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that the lack of access
to dental care is extremely important because left untreated oral disease can lead not only to pain, infection and
tooth loss, but also contribute to an increased risk for serious medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and
poor birth outcomes; and
WHEREAS, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention there are threats to oral health across one’s
lifespan. Nearly one-third of all adults in the United States have untreated tooth decay. One in seven adults aged
35 to 44 years has gum disease, this increases to one in every four adults aged 65 years and older; and
WHEREAS, according to Oral Health America, the older adult population is the fastest growing segment of the
United States and many are facing a dire situation when it comes to oral health. Accordingly, by 2030 there will
be 72+ million older adults in the U.S., most won’t have access to dental care, impacting overall health; and
WHEREAS, a 2013 study, issued by Advance for Nurse Practitioners and Physicians Assistants, reported that 30%
of older adults lose their teeth, 23% have gum disease, 50% have untreated cavities and that there are 30,000 oral
and pharyngeal cancers diagnosed annually; and
WHEREAS, the American Dental Association (ADA) states that oral health is essential for a healthy America.
The ADA further states that no law, regulation or mandate will improve the oral health of the public unless

(4) Class 4. Real estate owned and used by a not-for-profit corporation in furtherance of the purposes set

(6) Class 5b. All real estate used for industrial purposes as defined herein and not included in any other class.
(7) Class 6a. Real estate used primarily for the purpose of a retail center with a grocery store component
deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Amended Class 6a, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or real estate used primarily for the purpose of a retail development enterprise deemed
“qualified”, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated.
a. A property may be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a if:
i.

The retail center with a grocery store component that occupies the premise or retail development
enterprise that will occupy the premise will generate sales tax revenue through the Retail’s
Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax; and

ii.

With regards to the retail center with a grocery store enterprise, the retail center with a grocery
store component that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that the Amended Class 6a designation is necessary for the retail center with a
grocery store component to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and
that without such designation the retail center with grocery store component would not be
economically viable, causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming or continuing to
be vacant and unused. With regards to the retail development enterprise, the retail development
enterprise that will occupy the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a determination
that the Amended Class 6a designation is necessary for the retail to be developed, and that without
such designation the retail development enterprise would not be economically viable, causing the
property to be in imminent risk of continuing to be vacant and unused.

b. An applicant must obtain, from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County
Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that it has
determined the property is “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a and that it supports and consents to
the Amended Class 6a application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be
filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a. If
the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that an Ordinance or
Resolution supporting the incentive has been requested.

May 21, 2014

c. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution or letter confirming that an Ordinance or Resolution has been
requested, whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of
the County Board for distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required
to validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a, and a
County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must present the municipal enabling Ordinance
or Resolution obtained in accordance with Section b to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose
of the Amended Class 6a and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A certified copy of the County Resolution
validating such a finding that the property is deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a need not
be filed at the time of filing the Amended Class 6a application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Amended Class 6a.
e. The Assessor shall provide rules for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Amended Class 6a
incentives granted as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Amended Class 6a site.
In such reports, recipients shall be required to certify whether the retail center with grocery store component or the
retail development enterprise continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Amended Class 6a
incentives shall be required to report to the Assessor within 30 days if the retail center with grocery store component
or the retail development enterprise ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded
by the Assessor’s Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the County Board
from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor’s rules shall
result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the retail center with grocery
store component or the retail development enterprise ceases operations at that location, then the Amended Class 6a
incentive granted shall terminate.
f. Class 6a applications for newly constructed of substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement of such new construction
or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6a incentive.
g. This classification will begin from date of the notice of approval regarding the retail center with
grocery store component or from the date of such new construction (excluding demolition, if any) regarding the
retail development enterprise and will continue for a period of 12 years or until the retail center with grocery store
component or the retail development enterprise ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.
h. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment
level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:
i.

The property can continue to be deemed “qualified” for the purposes of the Class 6a;
ii. The applicant notifies the Assessor’s Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
iii. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the premise continues to be deemed
“qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a, and supports and consents to renewal of
the Amended Class 6a; and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

May 21, 2014

iv. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor’s
Office before the expiration of the ten percent assessment level period.
i. The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and the
property continues to be deemed “qualified” for the purpose of the Amended Class 6a.
j. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor’s Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the County Board from the affected districts.
k. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next 2 years, pursuant to Section
74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.
l. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of
all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Amended Class 6a.
(7)(8) Class 6b. Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, consisting of all newly constructed
buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned
property, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their
value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation
adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the
incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the
total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance
or Resolution need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must
be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class
6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that
time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance
supporting the incentive has been requested.
b. A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution
to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
c. Class 6b applications for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement of such new construction
or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive. With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b
application must be made to the Assessor prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused
property.

d. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of Class 6b, unless:
1. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant
and unused prior to such purchase; or
2. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be
included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is
required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of
Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must obtain
the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances and
present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County prior to its
determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is deemed
"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect. A
certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as
a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class
6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the
date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is
not filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that
time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the instance
where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the
municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose of a Class 6b
under the TEERM Program if there has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other
structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12 continuous months. The finding of
abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the
Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application under the
TEERM Program. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the
County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant
must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect.
A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well
as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the

the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the County Board,
as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER Program if:
1. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten (10) years prior to the date of application for the SER Program;
2. The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship supporting a
determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the industrial enterprise
to continue operations at its current location and maintain its staff, and that without such
designation the industrial enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to
be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and unused; and
3. The applicant is not receiving another Cook County property tax incentive for the same
property.
The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of
the County Board is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified"
for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property
is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that effect.
A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as
well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a finding that the
property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing
the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than
the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the
Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
Applications for the TEERM Program or SER Program under a Class 6b application must be
received by the Assessor's Office on or before November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the number
of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be required to
certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the Assessor
within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER
application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by
the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the

 Board of Commissioners

County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to
the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the Class 6b incentive granted
pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction (excluding
demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of
abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the
TEERM Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant to the SER
Program, this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date of the notice of approval, or until
the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that
location if that occurs sooner.
f. Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if
the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the incentive from the
municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or the County
Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and
3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Assessor's Office
before the expiration of the ten percent assessment level period.
g. Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are not renewable.
For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.
h. A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the affected districts.
i. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two (2) years, pursuant to Section
74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification
under this Division.
j. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 6b.
k. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 6b recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will
be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to Members of the
County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

(8)(9) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property is
situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone environmental
testing and remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter" from the site remediation
program.
a. To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further Remediation
Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the industrial or commercial use.
b. The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having previously owned
or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or being associated through a family or business
relationship with anyone who has owned or operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the
contamination which was remediated pursuant to a site remediation. A present owner who can successfully
demonstrate that the owner was not responsible for the contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.
c. An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the
municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is
necessary for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the Ordinance
or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C classification. A copy of that Ordinance or
Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts.
d. To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be made within
one (1) year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an application for Class C classification
encompasses less than all of the contiguous property owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been
completed, the one (1) year limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C
classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent application
is made within seven (7) years.
e. Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs, including site
investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring, and engineering and legal fees
associated with the remediation process, must total at least $100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25
percent of the market value of the real estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior
to the remediation, whichever is less.
f. The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial and commercial
property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16
percent assessment level, if the following requirements are met:
1. The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the incentive
from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area;
2. The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3. A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the 16 percent assessment level period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and qualify
for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the adoption date of
the Ordinance from which this Division is derived will be eligible for this renewal term at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements. The notice of intent to request
renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to Members of the County Board from the effected districts.
g. If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment level is higher
than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16 percent assessment level
for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the Resolution and renewal application.
However, if, as of that effective date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted
a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of
the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two (2)
years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such 10 year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.
h. For commercial properties, once the original 12 year incentive period has expired, the commercial Class
C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real estate shall revert
to the applicable classification under this Division.
i. The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine eligibility for the
Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class
C classification.
j. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class C recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class C site. Such reports shall be verified.
Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.
(9)(10) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified
commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area in need
of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not exceed
$2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon
which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this Division, including the land upon
which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to
the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to
the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the
square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel.
a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify that
the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the
specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and

 Board of Commissioners

consenting to the Class 7a application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be
determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:

A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
B. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance or

b. This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new construction (excluding
demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of
abandoned property, from the date of substantial re-occupancy. After such 12 year period, the real estate shall
revert to the applicable classification under this Division.
c. The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class 7a recipients
as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the Class 7a site. Such reports shall be verified.
Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for
the period relating to the non-filing.
(10)(11) Class 7b. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, as defined in this Division,
comprising a qualified commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a),
located in an "area in need of commercial development", where total development costs, exclusive of
land, exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures, including
the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon
which such property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified land related to
the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to
the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the
square footage added by the rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the
parcel.
a. In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein,
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b. The finding of abandonment, along
with the specification of the special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 7b application. Not withstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be
determined to justify finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:
A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not been vacant and
unused prior to such purchase; or
B. There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been vacant and
unused for less than 24 continuous months.
Such Resolution or Ordinance must be filed with the eligibility application. If the Ordinance or
Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board is required to validate such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 7b and a Resolution to that
effect shall be included with the Class 7b eligibility application filed with the Assessor.

qualified land related to the rehabilitation.
a. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements.
The amount of land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the

(13)(14) Class S. Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this Division, consisting
of land and existing buildings and structures, which is has been subject to a Section 8 contract renewal.
The portion of the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number
of Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. The proportion shall be applied only to property
used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for commercial purposes.
a. Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed pursuant to
one of the following alternatives:
1. HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the mark up to market option, after
finding that:
i.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an inspection by
HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the property is decent, safe, sanitary
and in good repair with no uncorrected Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) violations;

ii. The property does not have a low-and-moderate income use restriction that cannot be
eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current rent is lower than the
use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option to increase the rents to the use
restriction level, which would be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and
iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable market
rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2. HUD has approved a contract renewal for five (5) years of the Section 8 contract under the mark
up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the property meets at least
one of the required criteria:
i.

A vulnerable population is affected;

ii. There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based assistance difficult
to use, or a lack of comparable housing; or
iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a contribution of
state or local funds to the property.
3. HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not-for-profit corporation under any
available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal
Policy Guidelines.
b.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
1. At least 20 percent of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low-and-moderate
income persons.
2. The owner must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for at least five (5)
years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.

renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.

d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a mark up to
market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 2001 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any
renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The classification shall continue until the
expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section 8
contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006 assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term, including any

discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation
under any available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of
the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the following
three options: 1) the mark up to market option; 2) the mark up to market option under HUD's
discretionary authority; or 3) by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under
HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon
filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days prior to termination of the contract, for renewal
of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application
for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the
contract renewal, or notification of other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided
under Class S.

(14)(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a landmark or
contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial rehabilitation must
constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's full market value as
determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the commencement of the substantial
rehabilitation.

 Board of Commissioners

a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land underneath
the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous
months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the Assessor, the land upon which the
building is situated shall also be eligible for the incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain an
Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is located, which
expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;

2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of the project
for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's budget and proposed
scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or exceeds the Standards of the United
States Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration and
Reconstruction of historic properties.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the time the
Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be filed with the Assessor
no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed, the
applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a Resolution
or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested, whichever is filed
with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for
distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L classification, an
eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one (1) year prior to the commencement
of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has been completed, the
preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it is eligible under Subsection
(14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the eligibility application with a copy of the
determination of the preservation commission prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such substantial
rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be renewed during
the last year a property is entitled to a 16 percent assessment level, if the following requirements are
met:

 Board of Commissioners Journal - Final May 21, 2014

Board of Commissioners

May 21, 2014

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is
necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class
L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the Office of the
Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply and
qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's
Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for
distribution to Members of the County Board from the affected districts.

i.

If, as of November 23,1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment level is
higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and receive a 16
percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing and approval of the
resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective date, the taxpayer's assessment
is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a renewal of the incentive for subsequent years,
no reduction of the current assessment level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If
no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section
74-64. After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12 year incentive period has expired, the commercial
Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to renewal and the real
estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all
factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all Class L
recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of persons employed
at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's rules
may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

Sec. 74-64. Market value percentages.
The Assessor shall assess, and the Board of Review shall review, assessments on real estate in the various
classes at the following percentages of market value:
(1) Class 1: 10 percent.
(2) Class 2: 10 percent.

Sec. 74-65. Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project be located
in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or local agency as a
conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or
project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the
Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development

May 21, 2014

(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or potential
real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted
Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will materially assist
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial development project would
not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably expected
to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the
area.
(b) Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from the
municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an Ordinance or Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as
the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present and
that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 7a or 7b
application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such Ordinance or Resolution shall be included with the Class
7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the Ordinance or
Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board
for distribution to the Members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include
any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of
doing so.
(c) Inasmuch, as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the County,
support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of such applications, the
Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section for Class 7a
applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size if it
otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as provided in
Subsection (a)(4) of this Section, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation
agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to
share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this
Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Division.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

May 21, 2014

(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary supporting
data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of the County. The
Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding stating whether the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section are present. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds the
conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt
of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under
this Division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one (1) year from the date of issuance unless new construction
or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the commercial development
project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it is
necessary that:
(1) The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful
Resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for
private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the
area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall
review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the
severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial
revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to
the fact that an area is located in a Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial revitalization,
as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In making this determination
statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area for which certification is sought
may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be the community area as defined in
this Division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area
is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June
22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal Resolution that the area is
in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8 certification, such
certification shall be automatic pursuant to this Division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8
incentive within the certified area must file an application in a timely manner.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this Division.
The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

Section: 12-6HISP-36-ES
County Board Districts: 1, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17
Agreement Number: N/A
Agreement Period: 02/21/2002
Fiscal Impact: $64,106.19
Accounts: Motor Fuel Tax Fund (600-585 Account)
Summary: First amendment to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, Lake County Storm water Management Commission, Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and the County of Kenosha, Wisconsin wherein the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers will be the lead agency to perform a Feasibility Study to determine the feasibility of improvements to
reduce flood damage, restore the environment, enhance recreation and protect water quality in the Upper Des Plaines
River Watershed. This Amendment terminates the participation of Cook County in the Study, adds the MWRD as
a participating “Sponsor” to the Study and allows the MWRD to assume certain obligations of Cook County related
to the Study, and increases the estimated total Study costs. The Agreement is further amended to reflect Cook
County’s increased share of the Study as $1,412,105.60 (originally $1,086,125.00) and to reflect Cook County’s
remaining obligations under the Agreement and provides for payment from Cook County to the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers for the amount of $64,106.19 (determined as the balance of $1,412,105.60 less previous cash payments
and in-kind service credits totaling $1,186,771.41 less the MWRD share of $161,228.00).
The original Agreement was approved by this Honorable Body on 2/21/2002 and this Amendment is needed to
terminate the participation of Cook County in the Study and officially add the MWRD as a participating “Sponsor”
to the Study which is appropriate given that the Illinois State Legislature conveyed the general supervision of storm
water management in Cook County to the MWRD on 11/17/2004.
The Amendment has been examined and approved by this Department and by the State’s Attorney’s Office.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT
Department:

Office of Capital Planning and Policy

Summary: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief Procurement
Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County’s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to complete the (4) capital
project listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a
multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The JOC
process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential contractors through a competitive procurement
process, and then identifying projects for such selected contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs, replacement and
routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this region.
JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work performed by
the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would receive 5% administrative
fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The Gordian Group will manage the JOC process
and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract
within the County. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, proposes to assign the projects listed below to the
Gordian Group to share with participating JOC contractors.

Division I /Division VII Chilled Water Coil Replacement - Division I/Division VII chilled water coils are failing
and need to be replaced. There are a total of 20 chilled water coils that need to be replaced. The coils are the
size of a small car and will need to be lifted onto the roof of the buildings with a crane. The penthouse wall will
need to be opened to allow these water coils to be lifted onto the roof and into the building.
JTDC Digital Video Data Center - The intent of this project is to install a new data center to support the digital
video and RFID rounds tracking systems. The new data center will provide adequate space for server cabinets and
include installation of new mechanical, electrical and fire suppression systems. JTDC Ceiling Replacement - JTDC
ceiling replacements will ensure the safety of the juveniles housed at the detention center. In order to comply with
the federal court decree and the Illinois Department of Corrections building code, we will be installing steel panel
ceilings and flush mounted light fixtures to reduce the risk of a hanging hazard within the living units.
Skokie Entrance and Exterior Lighting Improvements - The existing store front entrances at the Skokie courthouse
need to be replaced/refurbished in order to accommodate the plant to segregate the judges from the public while
entering and existing the Courthouse. ADA improvements will also be made at these new entrances to ensure that
all persons with disabilities can gain proper access to the Courthouse. This project will also include the installation
of new exterior lighting to increase the visibility of people traffic from the parking structure to the new entrances.

PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE
Department:

Real Estate Management

Other Part(ies): Hispanic Housing Development Corporation, Chicago, Illinois
Action: Requesting authorization to exercise an option to purchase real estate contained in a Lease Agreement

which houses the Dr. Jorge Prieto Health Center of CCHHS’ Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County (ACHN).
Section: N/A
Parcel(s): 16-27-218-022-0000
Location: 2424 S. Pulaski, Chicago, Illinois.
Board District: 7
Fiscal Impact: $125,000.00 plus Purchaser’s share of customary closing costs and title charges up to
$15,000.00
Accounts: 728 - 560 Account
Summary: Under the terms of the lease, the County has the option to purchase the building at the end of the
lease term for $125,000 by giving Landlord written notice of County’s intent not later than 6/1/2014. By
exercising the option, the County and CCHHS would save the annual base rent and real estate taxes estimated to
be $130,000 annually. An inspection has indicated that certain repairs and upgrades to the property will be
necessary, at a cost estimated to be in the range of $250,000, however, these improvement costs can be spread out
over several years.
If the Board approves the proposed acquisition, this approval shall include the following authorization:
(i) For the Real Estate Director to execute any and all notices under the Lease; and
(ii) For the President or the Real Estate Director to execute any and all documents and instruments and to take
such other action as may be necessary to effectuate the purchase of 2424 S. Pulaski, Chicago, Illinois; and
(iii) For the Comptroller to pay the Purchase Price of $125,000 and Purchaser’s share of customary closing costs
and title charges up to $15,000; and
(iv) For the Comptroller to pay any real estate taxes accruing prior to the approval of an exemption by the Illinois
Department of Revenue, at which time such taxes should be refunded to the County.
The CCHHS Board of Directors approved the exercise of this option and requested the Cook County
Board of Commissioners approve this action at their meeting on 4/25/2014

To Account(s): 200-638, $50,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $50,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was the
balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 4/21/2014 it became apparent that DFM would need additional funding in this account. The balance in
account 638 was $6,936.00.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 450 was chosen because of the amount of funds that had not been encumbered.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred, delayed,
or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the account that
funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally budgeted
in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account was chosen because of the unobligated amount in the repair building and industrial supplies.

Summary: Since 2008, the Chicago Bar Foundation has managed operations for the Circuit Court’s Legal
Advice Desk for Eviction Court Defendants under Contract No. 11-41-19, which is scheduled to expire on
9/1/2014. Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with Cook County’s Procurement

The CBF was the sole responder to the RFP. The CBF is recommended for the contract based on its qualifications

federal court and the City of Chicago as well.
The Legal Advice Desk for Eviction Court Defendants is located on the 6th floor of the Richard J. Daley Center.
The role of the CBF is to oversee and coordinate volunteer lawyers who, in conjunction with court staff, work to
ensure litigants find available legal assistance. The CBF works with following two local legal aid organizations to
link pro-se litigants to attorneys who provide pro bono legal assistance: Coordinated Advice & Referral Programs
for Legal Services and Chicago Legal Clinic, Inc. Assistance may include in-court representation in appropriate
matters.
Benefits of this contract are that thousands of pro-se litigants with eviction cases pending in the First Municipal
District (Chicago) are receiving free legal assistance to better prepare them for their court appearances. This
contributes to the fair, impartial and efficient administration of justice.

Summary: A contract extension and increase are requested to authorize Presence Behavioral Health to
continue the provision of services while a new Request For Proposal (RFP) is conducted. The Office of the Chief
Procurement Officer issued an RFP in August 2013. The Circuit Court has requested to reissue the RFP because
the court and the community would be better served by contracting with more than one community-based vendor.
Presence Behavioral Health Program participants are offenders who are diverted from incarceration. Services cover
client care management, as well as mental health, psychiatric and substance abuse interventions.
This amendment to contract no. 10-41-163 will continue a variety of services to adult offenders participating in the
Circuit Court of Cook County’s six adult mental health treatment courts who are diverted from incarceration. These
services are client care management, which includes screening and clinical assessments, case planning, referral to
substance use and mental health treatment services and intensive case management services.
The Circuit Court’s Specialty/Treatment Court Program operates a network of 19 courts in Chicago and across
suburban Cook County which are dedicated to providing mental health treatment, veterans support, drug
treatment and support to persons charged with felony prostitution. The program helps low level criminal
defendants who suffer from an underlying mental health, social or substance abuse problem from becoming
repeat offenders. The hallmark of the program is intensive judicial supervision and the delivery of treatment and
services from community-based sources, such as Presence which has provided services to the Circuit Court's
Specialty/Treatment Courts Program since 2010.

Summary: Over the last two decades, the Circuit Court of Cook County has been recognized as a model reform
site for community-based alternative juvenile detention programs by the Annie E. Casey Foundation.
These
programs are administered by the court’s Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department and have helped to
divert tens of thousands of minors from the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. Not only have these programs
steadily lowered the population of the JTDC throughout the last 20 years, they also have reduced recidivism and
significantly lowered costs for Cook County.
The grant funds will be used to host delegations from other jurisdictions made up of multi-disciplinary juvenile
justice professionals. These delegations come to witness firsthand how the court’s community-based continuum
of alternative programs and services for at-risk court-involved minors achieve success. In 2013, for example, the
court hosted groups from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee, as well as college students
from around the country. In addition, the grant will provide resources for advanced training of court practitioners,
ancillary services for diversion programs, bus passes for court-involved minors and family members, and supplies.
It will also fund program evaluations of JDAI programs to help the court to identify opportunities for further
program enhancements and potential service gaps.
