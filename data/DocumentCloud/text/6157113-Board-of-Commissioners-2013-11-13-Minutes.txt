THE HONORABLE LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A REVOLVING
BAIL BOND FUND FOR COOK COUNTY JAIL DETAINEES
WHEREAS, the Cook County Jail has been at or near capacity for most of 2013; and
WHEREAS, the average cost of keeping a detainee in custody at the Jail has been estimated to cost $143
a day; and
WHEREAS, the average length of stay for detainees who post bond was 13 days in 2013; and
WHEREAS, it often costs more to keep a detainee in custody than their assessed bail bond is worth; and
WHEREAS, any bail made sooner will save Cook County $143.00 per detainee released, per day; and

 Board of Commissioners

Journal - Final

November 13, 2013

WHEREAS, many detainees are non-violent offenders and not flight risks for whom judges have low
bond amounts that the offender cannot post, and thus would pose little risk to the general public should
they be released from custody on bail; and
WHEREAS¸ a possible solution to the problem would be to create the “Cook County Revolving Bail
Bond Fund;” and
WHEREAS, the purpose of the fund shall be to provide no-interest loans to detainees at the Cook County
Jail for payment of their court-ordered bail bond and provide an ongoing source of funding through
achieved savings; and
WHEREAS, in order to be eligible for a loan in the fund, detainees must meet requirements, including
but not limited to, the following: 1) be charged with a non-violent misdemeanor or felony; 2) not use the
loan proceeds for payment of private legal services; 3) be eligible for a “c” or “d” bond which entails the
posting of a total bond amount of $2,000.00 or less (i.e., if the “c” bond is for $20,000.00 or less, or the
“d” bond is for $20,000.00 or less); 4) the posting of such bond will cause the detainees release from
custody; and 5) possess health insurance at the time of release or apply for CountyCare at the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Budget Director and the Executive
Director of the Justice Advisory Council (JAC) shall review the legal and financial feasibility of a
program to establish a revolving bond fund to provide prompt posting of bail for non-violent detainees
and make a recommendation to the Board of Commissioners by March 1, 2014. The purpose of the fund
shall be to provide no-interest loans to detainees at the Cook County Jail for payment of their courtordered bail bond and provide an ongoing source of funding through achieved savings. The
recommendation to be provided to the board shall include: a legal review of authority to pay such bonds;
a method for loaning such funds to non-violent detainees; a financial model to identify savings; a
recommended amount for the fund; and, if recommended for implementation, an implementation plan. In
order to be eligible for a loan, detainees must meet requirements, including but not limited to the
following: 1) be charged with a non-violent misdemeanor or felony; 2) not use the loan proceeds for
payment of private legal services; 3) be eligible for a “c” or “d” bond which entails the posting of a total
bond amount of $2,000.00 or less (i.e., if the “c” bond is for $20,000.00 or less, or the “d” bond is for
$20,000.00 or less); 4) the posting of such bond will cause the detainees release from custody; and 5)
possess health insurance at the time of release or apply for CountyCare at the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System.

As indicated in Resolution 2684, the City requests 47 parcels of the requested 56 to allow redevelopment
opportunities along our Dixie Highway Commercial Corridor and 154th Street in our Downtown Business
District, which is in close proximity to the Municipal Center.
In addition, the City has two (2) Third Party Requestors, EQ Illinois and Outreach Community
Development Corporation. EQ Illinois is requesting one (1) parcel of commercial property for the
expansion of their business in Harvey. Outreach Community Development Corporation is requesting
eight (8) parcels of land to redevelop residential properties to increase the housing within the City of
Harvey.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. The City will report as required to the
Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually from the date of sale on each parcel for five (5)
years or until the development is completed. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the No Cash bid, the
City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the cost of the
municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after the tax sale
for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: It is the intention of the City of Chicago Heights to convey all parcels to the Third Party
Requestor, Wilkins & Son, LLC. Wilkins & Son, LLC is currently leasing the land from the current
owners and minimal work is being conducted within the actual structure. Building upon recent growth
and expansion, Wilkins & Son has had a successful and longstanding presence in Chicago Heights
resulting in growth and job expansion for the community. As background, Wilkins & Son, including
Wilkins Rebuilders/Brookfield Iron & Metal, is a metal scrapping company that dismantles all types of
machinery and farms out parts to be reused or remanufactured. Also, Wilkins has had two property
expansions in the last two years, adding nearly 50 jobs.
This new land opportunity would allow operations to continue to expand with the creation of a trailer
dismantling center in addition to the opening of a rail facility that would utilize the onsite rail spur to
transport scrap. With this added mode of transportation Wilkins also could trans-load scrap for two
publicly traded companies. A direct result of this new expansion will be an increase of job opportunities
in Chicago Heights. The redevelopment of the parcels will return the property to a viable use beneficial to
the municipality. The redevelopment will also return the properties to a tax producing status, thereby
generating economic development for the municipality and other taxing bodies.
The City of Chicago Heights will accept an assignment of all Tax Certificate of Purchase from Cook
County and will undertake such legal proceedings and tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax
deed and will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the City
of Chicago Heights agrees to submit, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, No Cash
Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs
last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. Finally, the City of Chicago Heights, if
needed, will file for tax exempt status on all parcels obtained and will retain such status until such time as
the parcel is conveyed.

Tax Delinquency.

and June 17, 2013.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of October 9, 2013 in the amount of $213,605.11
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The

disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
October 21, 2013.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date, inclusive of

Good(s) or Service(s): Hearing Officer for Commission on Human Rights
Fiscal Impact: $5,608.17
Accounts: 002-260
Contract Number(s): N/A
Summary: The Department of Human Rights and Ethics is preparing to transfer all hearing
officer/administrative law judge services to the Office of Administrative Hearings in FY2014. In closing
out payments to existing Commission on Human Rights Hearing Officers for FY2013, the Department
discovered an unpaid invoice from Hearing Officer David L. Lee for services rendered in June and July
2013 for $5,323.17. The Department contacted Hearing Officer David L. Lee to determine whether he has
already rendered any other non-invoiced services to the Commission on Human Rights since this
June-July 2013 invoice, and he estimates this sum to be no more than $285.00. Hearing Officer David L.
Lee will not render any additional services for the Commission on Human Rights during FY2013, and the
Department has contacted all other Commission on Human Rights Hearing Officers to ensure that
anticipated FY2013 billing does not exceed $5,000.00 in aggregate for any Hearing Officer. Going
forward, hearing officer/administrative law judge services will be provided to the Commission on Human
Rights by the Office of Administrative Hearings in FY2014 and that will ensure that the Department does
not exceed the direct payment limit of $5,000.00 for hearing officer/administrative law judge services.

Contract Number(s): 1341-13159
Concurrence(s):
The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Bureau of Technology (BOT) is requesting approval to enter into a twenty-four (24)
month, sole source agreement with NTT for the purpose of providing web hosting services. Cook County
developed its current website in NTT’s hosting environment after NTT won an RFP for provide hosting
services. After the competitive award, the County developed its website on NTT’s hosting servers, for
which NTT held a proprietary license. Now, because the County’s website relies upon this licensed
technology (i.e., an NTT-owned operating system license), migrating to another website hosting service
would require the County to rebuild its entire website in a manner that does not rely upon NTT’s
operating system license. Simply rebuilding the County’s current website as-is from the ground up is an
inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.
Instead, BOT will focus on a rebuild that also redesigns and modernizes the County’s website, for which
the County issued an RFP on 10/15/2013. Procuring a redesigned and modern replacement solution will
allow the County to migrate to a different hosting provider. Also during the remainder of the two year
term of the NTT agreement, and while BOT remains in NTT’s hosting environment, BOT will virtualize
its website servers, which will allow the County to utilize NTT’s cloud hosting services and retire BOT’s
current, legacy hosting services that NTT is maintaining solely for Cook County. This virtualization will
save an expected $120,000.00 over the remainder of the two year agreement.

Fiscal Impact: $4,618.28
Accounts: 335-440
Contract Number(s): N/A
Summary: The services were to provide maintenance coverage for mailroom equipment. The proposed
renewal invoice for the equipment was received subsequent to the scheduled renewal period. Once the
invoice was received the Clerk of the Circuit Court (Clerk’s Office) requested for a portion of the
maintenance cost to be removed from the proposed amount due to the equipment software and hardware
being obsolete. Additionally, in an effort to generate cost savings and due to infrequent equipment
breakdowns the Clerk’s Office contacted the vendor to request for all maintenance costs to be removed.
Upon receiving the new invoices it was discovered that the invoice amount included maintenance costs
for the entire year instead of a pro-rated amount up to the date the vendor received the Clerk’s Office
notification request. The revised invoices were recently received, totaling $4,618.28. Due to the Direct
Pay limit the Clerk’s Office would exceed the $5,000 direct pay amount.
