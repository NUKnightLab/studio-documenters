RE: Amendment to Rule 23. 0 Reporting

There have been numerous concerns regarding the dispensation and duplicity of awards presented by Council
Members with some members of our community receiving several copies of the same award. As a way to
address and alleviate these concerns, I?m proposing the following amendment to Rule 23.0 of the Rules of
Order for the Detroit City Council. Speci?cally, I would like to include the following language:

23.3 Awards- Each Council Member shall provide to Council a report of awards presented to
members of the public, organizations and entities. Awards are de?ned as Testimonial Resolutions
in Memoriam, Testimonial Resolutions, Spirit of Detroit Awards, Awards of Recognition,
Distinguished Service Awards and any future awards created by the Detroit City Council). This
report shall be compiled quarterly and shall be submitted to all members of Council and the City
Clerk?s of?ce and placed under ?Awards? on the City Council website.

I would like for this matter to be considered during the Detroit City Council Rules Committee on Thursday,
February 21, 2019. If you have any questions, please contact my Policy Analyst, Edwina King, at 313.224.9530.

Thank you for your cooperation.
