 GENERAL BACKGROUND
In September 2008, the Board authorized CHA to enter into a contract with HCP for an initial
term of twelve months with two (2) one-year options to provide relocation services to families
that had to relocate from their existing public housing units. In August 2009, the Board
authorized CHA to exercise the first one-year option. The services provided during the base
term and first option year included: a) obtaining and maintaining lease compliance, b)
assessment of relocation options, c) community tours, d) placement, and e) follow-up services to
ensure families have been educated about community resources (e.g. local schools, park districts,
etc.) and transferred to their case management provider, if applicable. CHA families that lived in
buildings that were scheduled for closure due to redevelopment, rehabilitation were relocated to
other CHA public housing units or private-market housing using a Housing Choice Voucher.
During the base term and first option year, HCP satisfactorily provided mobility counseling and
relocation services for families that are impacted by building closure and consolidation. HCP
also provided housing counseling to educate families on the benefits of moving to “Low
Poverty” and “Opportunity” areas of the City, unit tours, community tours and HCP referred
residents to case management services (e.g. FamilyWorks) to address any barriers to successful
relocation and resident self-sufficiency. During the second-year option, HCP will provide
mobility counseling and relocation services to former public housing residents that currently live
in the private market with a temporary housing choice voucher to encourage families to consider
a second move to low poverty or opportunity areas.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to exercise the second one-year option
of Contract No. 8063 with HCP to provide relocation services for the period of November 1,
2010 through October 30, 2011, and to increase the contract’s not-to-exceed compensation
amount by $500,000 adding it to the carryover balance remaining at the end of the agreement’s
current term. The contract’s new aggregate total not-to-exceed amount will be $ 1,861,000.
