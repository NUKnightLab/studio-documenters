 AGENDA ITEM #6A

Date: October 26, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager

Re:

Status Update: 2018 Contract Alignment Process and Wholesale Water Contract
Reopeners

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) model water contract currently
provides for designated reopener dates in year 2, year 5 and every 5 years afterwards, until
the end of the 30-year term of the contract. In the fall of 2017 the GLWA contract
negotiation team met with 33 member communities which are served under the model
contract for regularly scheduled reopeners, including one out-of-sequence reopener
(Commerce Township) to renegotiate contract values. The next regularly scheduled
reopener for most of these member communities is scheduled for 2022. The GLWA
contract negotiation team will be meeting with 54 member communities throughout 2018
to reopen their model contracts as part of the Contract Alignment Process (CAP) for those
that did not reopen their contracts in 2017.
In addition to the CAP reopeners, GLWA has negotiated water model contracts with the city
of Inkster and the city of Gibraltar. Meetings with Dearborn, Grosse Ile and Trenton have
also been held to discuss getting these member partners on model contracts.
What is the CAP?

As part of the 2017 customer outreach meetings, member communities asked GLWA to
implement strategies to achieve goals of water charge stability and equity. As part of this
strategy, members asked for alignment of the model contract reopener to a common
schedule to minimize the annual charge volatility created by changing contract demands
which come as a result of the contract amendments.

The CAP involves all model contract customers that did not have a scheduled reopener in
2017 and requests that those member communities reopen their model contracts in 2018
(“2018 reopeners”) regardless of their current reopener schedule. As part of the 2018
reopener meetings, the contract reopener schedule within each customer contract is
amended to change the next regularly scheduled reopener date to 2022 and every 4 years
thereafter.

Page 6

 The CAP concept was presented by GLWA at the October 10th and October 26th Water
Charges Workgroup meetings and was approved by the member communities at the
December 20, 2017 One Water Partnership meeting.
CAP Progress

Between March 8, 2018 and October 19, 2018, the team has met with 52 of the 54
scheduled CAP reopeners plus 2 member partners previously on old contracts (Gibraltar
and Inkster). As of October 19th, 47 contract amendments have been drafted and sent to
the customer for its local approval. Of the contracts sent, 41 have been approved by the
member partner’s legislative body. Table 1 shows the progress for each member partner
as part of the CAP.

The deadline for the customers’ legislative approval is January 11, 2019. Once the contract
amendments are approved by the customer and returned to GLWA, the contract will come
before the GLWA Board of Directors for approval.

Re:

Capital Improvement Plan Relative to Financial Plan

Background: The annual update to the Great Lakes Water Authority’s five-year capital
improvement plan and financial plan are underway. In preparing those plans, certain
assumptions are required to effectively proceed with a comprehensive long-term financial
plan.

Biennial Budget

Five-Year Capital
Improvement Plan
Charges

Five-Year
Financial
Plan

Ten-Year
Forecast

Analysis: A key decision point in establishing a financial plan for the capital improvement
plan (CIP) is establishing a realistic factor for the actual spending pace.
 Unforeseen schedule delays

 Timing interdependencies with partners

 Mix of phases of projects in CIP (what percent are concept vs. design vs.
construction; earlier phases = increased likelihood or timing revisions)
Page 11

  Historical performance vs. future performance

 FY 2030 financial plan consideration (under development) to address affordability
and sustainability (new 10-year CIP is a key input)
 Where we are in GLWA’s history (new entity, new staff, capital program
management deployment in CY 2019)
 Magnitude and complexity of GLWA’s CIP as a regional water authority

To better understand this topic, we drew upon two sources of input: 1) GLWA’s engineering
team members and 2) The Foster Group who has prepared and monitored the financing plan,
debt issuance, and capital plan for GLWA and its predecessor regional operations for many
years.
Engineering Team Member Feedback

1. Obtaining buy-in and acceptance of project alternatives within a study or
preliminary design phase of a project.
Example: the final route for the Water Works Park to Northeast water transmission
main ($130 million) is on hold pending acceptance from the City of Detroit. GLWA
has identified a route that carries the least disruption to residents, however the
route has not yet been endorsed. Result is that GLWA is on hold for the design of the
pipeline.

2. Obtaining maintenance agreements, permanent easements and property
acquisitions. These are common for new pipeline projects and require in-depth
conversations and workshops with numerous property and utility owners. We build
time into our planned schedules for these activities; however, there are times when
circumstances are out of our control and delays occur.
Example: Achieving agreement with a county parks department for a new water
transmission main which is designed to be placed in county park property.

3. Opportunities driven by other regional stakeholders which alter priorities,
timelines, and spending. To optimize regional infrastructure investments, GLWA’s
goal is to engage in opportunity projects with other regional stakeholders such as
Michigan Department of Transportation, county road commissions, DTE, ITC, AT&T,
cities, and townships.
4. Rebids and revisions. There are times when projects have to be re-bid due to
proposal irregularities. This causes a delay in a project’s start. If it is engineering
services, then the associated construction contract is delayed which impacts
projected spend rates.

Page 12

 5. Vendor performance. There are times that vendors do not meet project deadlines
even though GLWA issues a notice, writes notices to cure, and in the case of
construction contracts assesses liquidated damages.
6. Operational needs. Designs include specified work limitations and periods and
durations when the construction contractor will be able to take certain systems out
of service to facilitate construction. These limitations are planned in collaboration
with operations management during the design process. However, operational
circumstances are dynamic and change which sometimes prevents system
shutdowns that are required to execute and complete construction.

7. Post-start changes. Approval of construction change directives and change orders
can consume weeks and sometimes months of time when negotiating change
amounts with the contractors and internal GLWA stakeholders. This may delay a
vendor’s progress of work and related CIP spend.

The Foster Group Report (see attached)

Recommendation: Given the above, it is not reasonable to expect that 100% of the fiveyear capital improvement plan will turn into spent dollars. Nor is it appropriate to compile
a financing plan (including the issuance of bonds) that reflects 100% spend rate. For this
reason, a simple financial policy statement is proposed.
Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption: Annually, a projected spend
rate assumption for the financial plan related to the upcoming capital
improvement plan will be established based upon pertinent factors and data
available at that time. Such factors and data will include the mix of projects
and phases in the proposed CIP, interdependency risk, and other measures
provided by the GLWA team members that develop and manage the CIP
projects. That spend rate assumption will be presented to the Audit
Committee no later than December each year after the GLWA Board and
member partners have had the opportunity to review the draft capital
improvement plan.

Proposed Action: Approve the Capital Program Spend Rate Assumption as proposed or
amended.

MEMORANDUM
Review of Draft CIPs
To:

October 24, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for observations regarding our review of the Authority’s Draft FY 2020
Capital Improvement Programs (CIPs). Specifically, you have asked for a review of how the
projected expenditures in the Draft CIPs align with the expenditures that were included in the
financing plans established for the recently executed revenue bond transactions.
Those financing plans are set forth in the official statement disclosures for the transactions.
Herewith some commentary based on our initial review.
First, some background regarding the CIP financing requirements that were utilized for the
bond sales. As we prepared the financing plans, we were aware that the actually achieved
capital expenditure levels in recent years were materially lower than published planning levels.
This fact is not a new occurrence, nor is it atypical of large municipal utility systems.
According to my records, the average “CIP expenditure achievement” ratio for the predecessor
DWSD in its final 29 full years of existence was approximately 70%. (See attached exhibit
page 1). The performance level shows some peaks and valleys, but overall the trend is
consistent. The achievement of the Sewer CIP is a bit higher than that for Water (75% vs.
63%). These ratios are not inconsistent with my experience with other large municipal utility
systems.
These general results have continued for the first two years of GLWA’s existence. According
to the most recently published Construction Work-in-Progress Report the actual expenditure
levels during FY 2017 and FY 2018 were 37% and 36%, respectively. Once again, the Sewer
performance was slightly higher than the Water performance in each of those years. It was with
this recognition in mind that the FY 2018 GLWA Budget anticipated a “financing level” of
80% of the published CIPs.
As the FY 2019 Budget was being prepared, it was apparent that the early years of the CIPs
included reduced projected expenditure levels. The financing plan for the FY 2019 Budget
assumed full achievement of the published CIP.

Page 14

 Review of Draft CIPs

October 24, 2018
Page 2

There are negative consequences of financing capital expenditures that do not end up being
achieved, particularly for municipal utilities that rely heavily on issuance of tax-exempt debt
to finance capital improvements. The ability to realize investment earnings on Bond
Construction Funds is restricted, and the earnings rate is always lower than the borrowing rate.
In recent years the difference between these two interest rates has been significant.
Maintaining larger than needed balances in these Funds is a net income losing strategy. There
are also potential tax law compliance issues when borrowed monies are not spent within the
originally anticipated schedule. Negative consequences also emerge in this scenario when
project expenditures are revenue financed, as rates and charges must be set at levels
that produce unspent reserve balances. These instances often result in customer and
stakeholder concerns.
As we prepared the financing plans for the recent bond transactions, we recognized the
prudence of establishing a realistic expectation of capital expenditures to finance, and modified
the CIP financing requirements accordingly. In summary, our approach for the capital
financing plans for the bond sales included:
•
•
•

No changes to the FY 2019 projected expenditures;
A “financing level” of 80% of the total expenditures between FY 2020 and FY 2023;
A phased ramp up of FY 2020 through FY 2023 expenditures, particularly for the Water
CIP.

This approach is illustrated on the first 7 lines of each section of the attached exhibit page 2,
and resulted in the CIP financing expenditure plan figures on Line 6 for Water and Line 16 for
Sewer. In the bond official statements, we acknowledged that the CIP expenditure schedule
for purposes of the bond financing plan was different from the formally approved, published
CIP. See below from the official statements.
“The Fiscal Year 2019 Water and Wastewater Capital Improvement Plan (“CIP”) was approved
by the GLWA Board on June 20, 2018. The CIP is dynamic and requires continual review and
modification during the course of each year. GLWA has initiated efforts to prepare the Fiscal
Year 2020-2024 CIP, and the CIP expenditure schedule shown in the following table reflects the
initial planning levels established as part of those update efforts.”

As noted in the disclosure language, we expected that the FY 2020 CIP would reflect the
moderated level of projected expenditures.
We have reviewed the Draft FY 2020 CIP and compared the financing requirements to those
included in the bond financing plans. See the last three lines in each section of exhibit page 2.
General observations:
•

The Draft FY 2020 CIP (Water and Sewer combined) is ~ $275 million higher than the
target established for the bond financing plan.

October 24, 2018
Page 3

In order to align the Draft CIP with the bond financing plan, significant planned project
deferrals into years 6 through 10 would be required to move this $275 million outside
the short-term financing window - or . . .
A "capital financing level” assumption on the order of 75% to 80% would be
appropriate for policy consideration.
The Draft FY 20 CIP assumes rapid project delivery performance. The plan indicates
Water expenditures will quadruple and Sewer expenditures will double compared to
what was realized during FY 2018.

Exhibit page 3 provides a graphical comparison of the figures shown on exhibit page 2.
We recognize that the Authority’s infrastructure plans include projects that are essential to
maintaining and improving quality of service and achieving strategic objectives. This
discussion is not intended to question the intent of the overall plans or individual projects.
However, we do think it would be prudent to consider policy approaches that result in capital
financing plans that reflect the challenges of implementing such plans, as evidenced by recent
experience. We trust that this discussion provides thoughtful topics for policy consideration
and we are available to present these observations and discuss this matter at your convenience.

* Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) via a Water
and Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of this monthly report.
Wholesale Water Billing Basis: Beginning with FY 2016, wholesale water charges were
restructured to create a more stable revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to
project customer volumes which accounts for 40% of the monthly charges and 60% of the annual
customer revenue requirement as a monthly fixed charge.
Table 1 - Wholesale Water Billings shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and
revenues. As of July 31, 2018, the billed usage was at 110.30% of budget and billed
revenue at 105.85% of budget. Billings and usage from the City of Flint are
included as they were assumed in the FY 2019 Budget.
Wholesale Water Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Chart 1 - Wholesale Water Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to billings for the same calendar months to depict net cashflow
from water charges for that time period.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

** Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department via a Water and

Report” section of the monthly report.
Wholesale Sewer Billing Basis: Beginning in FY 2015, the “sewer rate simplification” initiative
was applied which provides for a stable revenue stream and predictability for our member
partners. Wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee based upon the annual
revenue requirement.
Table 2 - Wholesale Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue.
Consistent with expectations as a result of sewer rate simplification, billed
revenue is at 100.00% of budget through July 31, 2018.
Wholesale Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration

Retail Revenues, Receivables, & Collections
for the Month Ended July 31, 2018
Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections: Pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement
between the City of Detroit and the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), the Detroit Water &
Sewerage Department (DWSD) serves as GLWA’s agent for billing activities for the City of Detroit
retail customer class. All water and sewer service collections from DWSD customers are
deposited in a trust account and are administered in accordance with the GLWA Master Bond
Ordinance.
The Monthly Retail Revenues, Receivables, & Collections Report includes the following.
1. FY 2019 DWSD Retail Water Revenue Billings and Collections
2. FY 2019 DWSD Retail Sewer Revenue Billings and Collections
3. DWSD Retail Water & Sewer System Accounts Receivable Aging Report
Note: Wholesale customer revenues are billed by the Great Lakes Water Authority.

DWSD Retail Water Billings and Collections
Retail Billing Basis: DWSD bills retail customers monthly. Customers are billed throughout the
month in cycles based on a meter reading schedule beginning with residential accounts and
ending with commercial and industrial customers.
Table 1 - DWSD Retail Billings shows the FY 2019 water usage and billed revenue
which are provided by DWSD staff. As of July 31, 2018, the DWSD usage was at
111.75% of the budget and billed revenue was at 108.26% of budget.
DWSD Retail Water Collections: The collections represent payments made by DWSD retail
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Chart 1 - Retail Water Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to billings for the same calendar months to depict net cashflow
from water charges for that time period.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

DWSD Retail Sewer Billings and Collections

Retail billing basis: DWSD bills retail customers monthly. Customers are billed throughout the
month in cycles based on a meter reading schedule beginning with residential accounts and
ending with commercial and industrial customers.
Table 2 - DWSD Retail Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue
which are provided by DWSD staff. As of July 30, 2018, the DWSD usage was at
113.12% of the budget and billed revenue was at 101.56% of budget.
DWSD Retail Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by DWSD retail
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Chart 2 – DWSD Retail Sewer Collections shows collections by month for the past
12 months compared to billings for the same calendar months to depict net
cashflow from water charges for that time period.
