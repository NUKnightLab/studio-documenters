USAGE

ON

COUNTY

WHEREAS, use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), including drones, has exponentially increased
and is becoming more common in both commercial and private contexts; and
WHEREAS, increased UAS use has given rise to emerging conflicts and challenges requiring additional
guidance as to responsible and lawful operation thereof; and
WHEREAS, given their ability to carry and smuggle drugs, weapons or other contraband, UAS usage is
increasingly presenting safety concerns for the operations of jails and prisons nationally, including Cook
County Jail; and
WHEREAS, UAS can also be used to surreptitiously take photographs and video footage, which can
create a privacy, safety or security threat at other county property such as county courthouses and health
system facilities;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
58, Offenses and Miscellaneous Offenses, Article II, Offenses Involving Property Rights Sec. 58-48 of
the Cook County Code, is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 58-48. Limitation of Unmanned Aerial System Usage on County Property.

(a) The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

Agency shall mean any County agency that is the authorized custodian of County property.
Unmanned Aerial System or UAS shall mean an unmanned aerial vehicle or drone that is operated
without the possibility of direct human intervention from within the aircraft.
Property shall mean any land, building or facility owned or leased by Cook County.
(a) No person shall, at any time, fly any form of UAS on County property unless expressly
authorized by the Agency that is the custodian of said property. Any person violating the provisions of
this Section shall be subject to a fine of $2,500.00 for each offense and shall be adjudicated pursuant to
Chapter 2, Administration, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, of this Code.
(b) Confiscation; seizure. Whenever an Agency or any of its duly authorized representatives shall

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

discover any UAS used in violation of this section on County property, they are hereby authorized and
empowered forthwith to confiscate; seize and take possession of such UAS and it shall thereupon be
deemed to be forfeited to the County of Cook.
(c) Destruction; redemption. If it is determined at an administrative hearing, by a preponderance of
evidence, that the seized UAS was not operated in violation of this section, such UAS may be claimed by
its owner without charge within 7 days of such determination. In the event that the UAS remains
unclaimed after such period, the Agency shall cause the seized UAS to be destroyed.
(d) Operations Authorized by the State of Illinois - Exception. Notwithstanding the prohibitions set
forth in this section, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the use of an unmanned aerial
system (UAS) by a law enforcement agency in accordance with Section 15 of the Freedom from Drone
Surveillance Act, codified at 725 ILCS 167/1, et seq., or its successor provision.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO REINTRODUCE THE VACANCY FRAUD ACT
WHEREAS, throughout Cook County there are over 1,900 vacant properties registered; and
WHEREAS, vacant buildings represent a public nuisance that can result in public health and safety
issues in our communities and place a financial strain on local government agencies; and
WHEREAS, a leading cause of high vacancies in communities are weak real estate markets, and today
property values in Cook County are still lower than 2007 values; and
WHEREAS, in addition to a weak real estate market, in some instances landlords may purposefully
allow buildings to remain vacant by not actively seeking tenants for their buildings in order to qualify for
specific financial incentives; and
WHEREAS, when property tax exemptions and financial incentives are obtained fraudulently for vacant
property, this halts economic development, contributes to further blight in these communities, and
significantly reduces the tax base in taxing districts; and
WHEREAS, during the 100th General Assembly the Vacancy Fraud Act received bipartisan support;
and
WHEREAS, the Vacancy Fraud Act allows for taxing bodies to file a vacancy fraud complaint with the
county board of review, and if found to be fraudulently obtained, owners would be required to pay back
what is owed plus penalties; and
WHEREAS, the Vacancy Fraud Act would discourage owners from allowing property to sit vacant and

Summary: This contract extension and increase will allow for continuation of unarmed security services
to be provided by G4S. This is to ensure the safety of residents and employees of the Cook County
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. The company’s services are necessary to maintain the appropriate
staff to resident ratio (which varies according to the activity and time of day) when security staffing
levels drop due to unexpected absences, terminations, and resignations. G4S employees are required to
comply with the same educational and training requirements as for regular JTDC staff. G4S security
services include night watch, escorted movement and control, direct residential supervision, and
emergency staffing on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week basis.

Additional time is required to complete and finalize the related Request for Proposal (RFP) process, and
an efficient transition to a new vendor. In accordance with a prior federal court order authorizing the
former Transitional Administrator to enter into contracts, this contract was previously awarded a Sole
Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
