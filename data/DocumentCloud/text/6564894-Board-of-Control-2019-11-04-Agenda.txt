 Nan Baker asked for confirmation that payment for services will be backdated to January 1, 2019 and
future services will cover a 3 month period; asked for further clarification on the dates when services were
provided and what period of time still needs to be paid for; asked what will happen with support services
after contract expiration and will future services be bid; asked how the department would address the
possibility that Hyland products could not be used going forward if that is the outcome of the pending
court case and what position would the County be in to negotiate with Northwoods Consulting Partners,
Inc.; asked if the ERP Project has stalled since July and if any negotiations were attempted with the vendor;
and asked how another delay would impact the ERP project.
Trevor McAleer asked if any vendor can provide these support services or must they be certified by Hyland
Software before they can provide services; asked how many vendors are certified as resellers; asked if
there was any feedback from other vendors who were contacted for quotes on this service as the
department is also requesting an RFP exemption; asked what portion of the $237,584.47 is paid to Hyland
Software by its’ third-party reseller, Northwoods Consulting Partners, Inc.; expressed his concern about
investing an additional $237,584.47 while there are still potential legal issues with the court case and
asked what would occur if the County can no longer use Hyland Software products due to the outcome of
that case; stated that the County appears to be caught between the court case which may not be settled
for years and causing delays in the ERP project; asked if either Northwoods Consulting Partners, Inc. or
Hyland Software have been providing services up to 7/1/2019; asked if Hyland Software agrees that the
County no longer owes any more money for services already provided; asked if the $75,000.00 in
outstanding invoices for the Agenda Manager component have been paid; asked if a contract was in place
with Hyland Software to pay the $75,000.00 in outstanding invoices and whether the funds are still
available and will be paid from the same contract; asked for confirmation that no maintenance or support
has been performed from July through present.
Dale Miller asked for confirmation that this service is necessary in order for the ERP Project to move
forward; commented that the OnBase product was a long-running, well-respected product that existed
before the issues arose in the County and that the outcome of the court case will unlikely prohibit the
County from using the product.

for business success.

The Sheriff’s Department is requesting an alternate procurement approval for prisoner board and care
services from Wood County and Geauga County. The request is to establish a not-to-exceed Purchase
Order to both vendors through December 31, 2021 with an amount not-to-exceed $245,000.00 each for
both Wood and Geauga County.
Inmates have been moved to both Wood and Geauga county jails due to the over populated Cuyahoga
County jail. Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department has received invoices substantially higher than those
in the past due to these circumstances. Previously these invoices were payment out with a contract
number created by the Cuyahoga County Fiscal Department using encumbered funds. Now that the
amounts are increasing substantially Board of Control approval is required.
The need for this service is mandated pursuant to ORC 341.12. The alternate procurement would allow
for timely payments to be made to the vendors for this service, as well as to remain compliant with
Accounts Payables and Board of Control policies and procedures.
The amount of $245,000.00 each was established from research done on past invoices and the increase
of inmate population.
This alternate procurement would allow for a Purchase Order to be in place not-to-exceed $245,000.00
and multiple invoices can be paid from it for the services to both Counties. The invoices would be
processed in BuySpeed, providing the necessary procurement documentation, but would not require
additional board of control approval. Payments will continue to follow the established County
procurement procedures.
Process Under Alternate Procurement:
1. Purchase Order will be created in Buyspeed (no additional approval needed).
2. Funds will be encumbered under the Purchase Order for both Wood and Geauga Counties.
3. The invoice is provided to the Sheriff’s Department Fiscal Office.
4. Sheriff’s Fiscal staff enters the invoice and procurement documents into BuySpeed.
5. A payment voucher will be created and processed for payment.
