Report from Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Ronald Wyatt, Chief Quality Officer, provided an overview of the metrics. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
Board Chair Hammock inquired whether there are other measures that should be added for the Board’s
benefit, or whether the metrics as presented are considered to be complete. Additionally, he
recommended that the metrics as presented be split amongst three (3) pages, for better visibility. Dr.
Wyatt responded that staff are working on another dashboard with different indicators; when that work is
complete, he plans to share that with the Committee.
During the discussion of the Utilization metrics, Director Richardson-Lowry stated that it would be good
to have a discussion, particularly by the 2nd quarter of next year, where Dr. Wyatt would present and give
details around some of the incremental changes that have been made towards improvement, and those
changes anticipated being made in the future; additionally, she is interested in hearing about some of the
areas where improvement is a challenge. She also sees this as an area impacted by cultural competency
and social determinants, so she is interested in hearing his perspective on what the organization can do
there.

Report from Chief Quality Officer (continued)
Director Suleiman Gonzalez noted that cultural competence comes up in different ways and in different

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility with the baseline data for standard population.
SIR > 1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted, conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that
fewer HAIs were observed that predicted.

Getting to Zero Illinois (gtzillinois.hiv)
GOAL & VISION
We want to make sure that the HIV epidemic is no longer able to sustain itself by
achieving both HIV prevention and access to care goals.
We want to see:
1. Zero new HIV transmissions
2. Zero people living with HIV who are not receiving treatment
Through increasing access and uptake of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis),
retaining more people living with HIV (PLWH) in care and the continued funding
of ongoing supportive services, we can get to zero in Illinois by 2030.

Cook County Health supports and is a partner in the GTZ
Illinois initiative.

Patient Satisfaction Summary
• Low hospitalization rates despite high complexity of
patients supports the need for PCMH with wrap
around services.
• Most measures have continued to improve
• We will continue to work on wait times, patient flow.
• Standardized patient satisfaction surveys implemented
late 2018 across all CCHIP sites

 Retention and Viral Suppression Summary
• 82% viral suppression; good but could be better
• Retention rates meeting HRSA goals, short of new NHAS goals
• Retention activities need to be comprehensive, creative,
innovative.
• Opportunities to explore and address disparities in viral
suppression
• Opportunities to make CountyCare the model health plan for
HIV/viral hepatitis /STIs by adopting and reporting HRSA
measures
• Systemizing best practices across all HIV treatment sites
• Optimizing linkage and re-engagement for Cermak discharges
