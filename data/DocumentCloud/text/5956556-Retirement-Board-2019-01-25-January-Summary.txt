MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM YOUR RETIREMENT BOARD

The FABF Board of Trustees and staff have had a very productive 2018. We have worked diligently
to enhance communication with Fund participants and improve customer service. Some recent
examples of our communication efforts include a revised Summary of Benefits (the “Summary”) that
has recently been provided to all Fund participants. The new Summary outlines the benefits provided
to all members and includes recent legislative changes to the Pension Code that impact participants’
benefits. The Fund also launched a new website in 2018 to provide updated information to our
participants in a user friendly manner. Lastly, the Pre-Retirement Seminar was revised to include
more focused presentations with all presentation materials now available on the Fund’s website to
allow easy access by all participants.
As we’ve outlined to participants, in 2018 the Board continued its thorough review of Fund policies
and procedures and updated numerous policies during this process. This will continue to be an
ongoing process and we will continue to update participants on our progress. Additionally, the Board
drafted and adopted a Rules of Order Manual to govern the administration of Board meetings which
may assist future trustees in becoming effective Board members.
The Board also authorized a review of the Fund’s data security and related internal controls to ensure
that the Fund’s systems meet or exceed industry standards. Consistent with that review, the Board
authorized new election procedures which were successfully implemented with the last election.
These changes resulted in a reduction in the number of spoiled ballots by over 90% and streamlined
the process conducted by the Fund’s independent election auditor.
Lastly, we are pleased to report that the Fund welcomed three new staff members in 2018. Our Chief
Investment Officer, Ms. Lorna Scott was selected by the Board from a pool of over seventy
candidates from across the country. The Chief Investment Officer role is critical in maintaining
proper controls and management of the Fund’s investments. Ms. Scott has already enhanced
investment reporting and has automated critical processes while solidifying internal controls. In
addition to Ms. Scott, two administrative staff members were hired by the Fund. Ms. Sarah Burke and
Ms. Lucy Medina have assisted in bolstering the Fund’s level of customer service. The Fund prides

 itself in maintaining a goal of having an actual person answer all phone calls during normal business
hours. We wish all three of our new employees a long and prosperous career at the Fund.
As we look toward 2019 and the future, it is the goal of the Trustees and the staff of the Fund to
continue to provide the highest quality of customer service to our members while meeting our
fiduciary duties. As always, I am open to any ideas or suggestions from our participants and
encourage you to reach out to myself or one of my fellow Trustees.

Fund Secretary,

Captain Anthony Martin
