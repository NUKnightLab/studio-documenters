2013 Chicago Infrastructure Trust Annual Report
October 16, 2014

This annual report for the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the ?Trust?) has been prepared in
accordance with Section 11.2 of the Trust?s Bylaws.

The Trust?s purpose is to assist the people of the City of Chicago, the City, and its sister agencies
in providing alternative ?nancing and project delivery options for transformative infrastructure
projects.

In 2013, key milestones for the Trust included the following:

The adoption of all internal policies required by the Trust?s Bylaws.

The implementation of a detailed Contracting Manual that provides a transparent,
comprehensive guide to doing business with the Trust.

0 The approval and negotiation of the Trust?s ?rst project, Retro?t One, in which the Trust
facilitated the design and ?nancing of energy upgrades in 60 public buildings in the City
of Chicago, with the cost savings from such upgrades being used to repay the loans
advanced by the private sector to fund such upgrades.

0 Introduced a new public ?nance tool in the form of an Energy Services Agreement
The ESA allows the City of Chicago to participate in infrastructure ?nancing
that remains off-credit and off-balance sheet, thereby maintaining the City?s credit ratings
and borrowing capacity. The ESA is also replicable for a wide variety of public
?nancings.

The Trust received an unquali?ed audit opinion for 2012 and 2013. The Trust?s audited
?nancial statements for 2012 and 2013 are attached.

Respectfully submitted,
Chicago Infrastructure Trust
