So, to date, CDF has closed

11

11 projects since -- starting in July of 2008,

12

the most recent being the Instituto Health

13

Sciences Career Academy.

14

Of those, nine of the projects are

15

substantially complete, and the buildings are

16

operational, including Instituto Career Academy.

17

They're fully functional at this point.

18

Nearing completion, we have the

19

Radio Flyer headquarters expansion for R&D

20

purposes, and then we have the Kroc Community

21

Center, a/k/a Salvation Army Project, which is

22

still midway through construction at this point.

23
24

So we've actually organized a tour
of some of the projects that have been recently

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 4
1

completed or are still under construction for the

2

Governing Board and the Advisory Board.

3

proposed date is Wednesday, November 16th.

4

to get sort of out of the thick of budget season

5

but before Thanksgiving, slotted in there.

6

The
Trying

So we have three sites on the tour:

7

The PCC Community Wellness Center in the Austin

8

neighborhood, that's a health clinic; Testa Produce,

9

which if you haven't seen it, is really a stunning

10

project with a big 250 foot windmill out in front

11

of it, LEED Platinum freezer/cooler warehouse; and

12

then the Salvation Army project, which is pretty

13

far along, 160,000 square foot community center

14

down in the West Pullman neighborhood.

15

So all board members, Governing and

16

Advisory, are, of course, welcome to attend.

17

will be provided.

18

9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

The proposed time range is from

So invitations will be sent around
to the aldermen -ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

I went on that

22

tour the last time we were out there, and it is

23

very enlightening and fantastic to see how the

24

money's being put to use and how it's affecting the

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 5
1

community.

So I would suggest that everyone try

2

to join, even if it's not for the entire time.

3

couple of the sites would be great.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

5

MS. HOLT:

6

On November 16th?

I was going to say, isn't that our

budget close date, the 16th of November, maybe?

7

MR. SMITH:

8

MS. HOLT:

9

MS. SCOTT:

That's an ish.

10

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

11

MS. SCOTT:

Ish.

12

MR. SMITH:

If you think that's likely, we

13

can certainly move it.

14
15

MS. HOLT:

Is it?
Ish.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

MR. SMITH:

candidate.

19

up one --

Would that be better if we moved it

MS. SCOTT:

21

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

24

Yeah, maybe; maybe not.

The 15th was another decent

20

23

That's an ish?

I'll have to defer to the

A

No, no.
No, no, no.

Don't move --

don't go up.
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

I think we need to

be behind the budget, frankly.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 6

MR. SMITH:

Okay.

2

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

So anything prior

3

to that.

So should we move it to December, and

4

then we know we'll be clear of budget?

5

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

6

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

7

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

8

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

9

No.

Go later in November.
Later in November?

Um-hmm.
That's close to

Thanksgiving.

10

MS. HOLT:

The following week is Thanksgiving.

11

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

12

MR. SMITH:

13

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, one day.

Right.
He's doing everything.

Would the beginning of

15

Thanksgiving week be okay for folks?

16

give you time to --

17
18

MS. HOLT:

Sure.

MS. SCOTT:

20

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

21

MR. SMITH:

23
24

That's the 21st through the

23rd?

19

22

Would that

Sure.

Okay.

That's better.
We can shoot for that time

range.
ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

Because then things will

just -- be pretty much settled by then.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 7
1
2

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:
out --

3

MR. SMITH:

4

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

5
6

So you'll send

Yes.
-- an invitation

inviting everyone the 21st through the 23rd.
MR. SMITH:

Certainly, yep.

7

So breaking down those 11 projects

8

that CDF has closed on so far, seven of those are

9

community facilities; in other words, nonprofit-

10

sponsored, educational, service, training,

11

community amenity type projects, and then four

12

industrial projects.

13

So within the community facility

14

category, there's -- the majority have been

15

schools, educational facilities, and then we've

16

also had a job training center, a health clinic,

17

and a community center.

18

Approved and in closing, we have an

19

additional industrial project in the form of Truong

20

Enterprises that's moving along well, getting close

21

to closing.

22
23
24

And then today we have on the agenda
a grocery project.

Yay.

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

Yay.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 8
1

MR. SMITH:

CDF's been trying hard for

2

grocery for a long time, and we're very hopeful

3

on this one.

4
5

And then a healthcare proj- -another healthcare project, another health clinic.

6

So as far as status overall --

7

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

8

MR. SMITH:

9

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

Can I ask a question?

Yeah, sure.
Is this the goal of the

10

Development Fund, is there -- is there goals of

11

what percentage should be industrial and what

12

percentage should be --

13

MR. SMITH:

14

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

15
16

Sure.
-- the categories health

center, community service?
MR. SMITH:

When CDF initially got under way,

17

yeah, there was a -- there was a goal, essentially,

18

to shoot for a third, a third, a third, with some

19

flex in that.

20

come along, and so the Board's definitely been

21

flexible in terms of reallocating within those

22

three buckets.

But the deals come along as they

23

So far, it's not veered from its

24

mission of doing those three types of projects,

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 9
1

though.

2

So you can do lots of other types

3

of activities with New Markets Tax Credits, but

4

so far there's been enough, at least in the three

5

categories, to keep going with that.

6

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

7

MS. SCOTT:

8

pipeline looking like?

9

MR. SMITH:

Thank you.

On that point, what is the

The pipeline is holding pretty

10

steady.

11

facility projects coming along.

12

category in New Markets Tax Credits in general,

13

frankly, because these deals are hard to do, and

14

nonprofits tend to be a bit more patient than

15

industrial businesses.

16

MS. SCOTT:

17
18

There continues to be a lot of community
That's been a big

And have less other debt to

compete with the lien structure.
MR. SMITH:

Right, yeah.

Exactly, yeah,

19

the type of debt that flows best through New

20

Markets structure is usually soft debt as opposed

21

to true bank debt.

22

And, again, nonprofits, community

23

facilities, are very compatible with that.

24

continue to see a number of large community

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

So we

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 10
1

facility projects come along.

2

There are a couple grocery deals in

3

the pipeline kind of farther out, but -- yeah.

4

And we're trying to do a push with industrial to

5

reengage with the department now that it's been

6

reorganized to reinform them about New Markets Tax

7

Credits, show off the four deals that CDF has done

8

so far, try to use that as a marketing piece.

9

But, yeah, community facilities continue to dominate.

10
11

MS. SCOTT:

20 stacked up in community development?

12
13

So of the pipeline, we have like

MR. SMITH:

We have like 20 projects, of

which --

14

MS. SCOTT:

And how many --

15

MR. SMITH:

-- I think it's like 16 are

16

community facilities.

17

MS. SCOTT:

Okay.

Are we getting good

18

commercial projects, commercial developments?

19

they coming in, or is it just really hard to bring

20

them?

21

MR. SMITH:

22

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

23
24

Well, we have -We've got one on

the -MR. SMITH:

Are

-- one today.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 11

MS. SCOTT:

2

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

3
4
5

Right, right.
Right, that's a

good one.
MR. SMITH:

Right.

Yeah, we occasionally

encounter them, but they're much rarer.

6

MS. SCOTT:

Okay.

7

MR. SMITH:

So jumping to status of overall

8
9

allocations.
So CDF's received $173 million in

10

total allocation authority to date; closed on

11

$131 million of that.

12

is a $9½ million transaction that's currently in

13

the closing process.

14

The Truong Enterprises deal

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

And that's not

15

part of the 131.

16

MR. SMITH:

Correct.

17

MS. SCOTT:

And that's Truong?

18

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

19

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

20

MR. SMITH:

That's over and above.

Um-hmm.

Total allocation being considered

21

today is $14½ million between two transactions.

22

if today's deals are approved, approved and closed

23

at their full proposed amounts, then we'll have

24

$18 million left that's undeployed.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

So

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 12
1
2
3

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

And when will we

find out about our allocation?
MR. SMITH:

The official dates that the CDFI

4

fund published is January 2012.

5

to slip off of their published dates, though, so it

6

could be February; it could be March.

7

actually put January in writing, which is rare;

8

they usually don't.

9
10
11
12
13

They've been known

But they've

So, yeah, CDF put in its application
in late July for the 2011 round.
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

And how much did

we ask for again?
MR. SMITH:

14

It was $111 million.

And in order to be eligible in this

15

round, CDF needs to have closed certain minimum

16

percentages of its prior allocations.

17

'09 allocation, 30 percent needs to be closed as of

18

October 14.

19

So for the

CDF's at 47 percent on that threshold.
For the 2010 allocations, CDF needs

20

to have 20 percent closed, and it's got 28

21

percent's already closed.

So --

22

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

Good job.

23

MR. SMITH:

-- it's eligible.

24

MS. SCOTT:

That's great.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 13
1
2
3

MR. SMITH:

For competitiveness reasons, it

would be nice to have more closed, however.
Theoretically, CDFI fund does not

4

take into account how much you've closed in terms

5

of whether you get a new award or not, but they

6

do look at -- they may look at how much you have

7

closed in terms of how much they think you need

8

for the next round.

9

So CDF is striving to get some

10

additional credits closed in the next month or two,

11

since that's likely when the treasury's making the

12

sizing decisions.

13

So related to that, an update on

14

Truong Enterprises.

So the targeted closing is the

15

second week of October; however, Chase Bank, the

16

investor, has a closing condition currently that

17

there needs to be a no further remediation letter

18

received from the State of Illinois in draft form

19

before they're ready to close.

20

If they do that, the time frame on

21

the draft NFR is likely going to push the closing

22

into November or December at least in terms of --

23

that would be the trigger for Chase to allow a

24

mortgage to be recorded.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 14
1

So Chase is currently considering

2

waiving that requirement, and we're very hopeful

3

they will, since the site is not seriously

4

contaminated, it's pretty basic urban Chicago

5

type material.

6

MS. HOLT:

7

MR. SMITH:

8
9

When was the NFR requested?
They filed their remediation

action plan last Friday.
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

I was going to

10

say, when are we going to find out if they're

11

actually going to waive that or not?

12

MR. SMITH:

Today, hopefully.

13

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

14

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

15

MS. SCOTT:

And if they don't waive it, will

16

they close in escrow?

17

MR. SMITH:

Oh, today.

So if they don't waive it, then,

18

yeah, the plan would be to do, essentially, a dry

19

closing.

20

So sign off all the documents.
What would also make sense, though,

21

for CDF, in all likelihood, is to accept what's

22

known as a prefunding, because that's the statistic

23

that treasury looks at when they are evaluating

24

award sizes is how much allocation -- how much

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 15
1

qualified equity investment you've received, not

2

necessarily how much you've deployed.

3

So CDF last engaged in prefunding in

4

October -- or, sorry, August of 2010 with PCC

5

Community Wellness transaction where it needed to

6

close qualified equity investment by July of 2010

7

to stay eligible for the 2010 application round,

8

but the PCC deal was not ready to fully close until

9

August 2010.

10

So to deal with that timing issue,

11

CDF took in a qualified equity investment, held it

12

for about a month and a half, and then pushed it

13

down to the project.

14

So in a typical New Markets

15

investment, CDF's subsidiary receives the capital,

16

and then makes the qualified low-income community

17

investment loan on the same day, essentially in the

18

same flow of funding events.

19

And so all the documentation,

20

including the loan documents and the investment

21

documents, are fully signed up before the money

22

flows.

23
24

In a prefunding scenario, CDF
receives the qualified equity investment without

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 16
1

simultaneously funding the loan.

In the New

2

Markets regulations, CDF would, in turn, then have

3

12 months to fully deploy that capital in order

4

to avoid a tax credit recapture for the investor.

5

There's also possibly an additional

6

six-month cure period that the investor would have

7

available, but there -- it's based on some IRS

8

private letter rulings, but that's not something

9

anyone wants to count on when they close the

10

initial qualified equity investment.

11

So, as I mentioned, prefunding would

12

likely improve CDF's chances of getting a larger

13

2011 allocation.

14

CDF were to sign up the Truong deal completely and

15

take in the prefunding but not fund the loan is

16

that if -- by nine months after the qualified

17

equity investment, the investor starts to get very

18

nervous about finding a place to put the capital.

19

So it's possible Chase could choose to unwind the

20

investment at nine months.

21

And so the risk, of course, if

Much more likely they would just

22

work with CDF to find an alternate place to put the

23

capital.

24

the investment.

But legally speaking, Chase could unwind

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 17
1

If that was the case, Chase could

2

also pass on the recapture costs to CDF.

3

would be five percent of the qualified equity

4

investment amount, or about half a million dollars.

5

So that

So the Truong transaction's

6

progressing well.

7

the draft NFR will never show up.

8

the only condition that we're waiting on here.

9

So it's a very managed risk as far as what happens

10

There's not a lot of worry that
That's really

if we have a delay in the project.

11

And then Chase, of course, Plan A

12

would be to find other transactions with CDF.

13

Chase has done now eight deals with CDF, so there's

14

a decent working relationship and lots of deal flow

15

in Chicago.

16

the capital into something else that's New Markets

17

qualified instead of unwinding the investment.

18

And

So certainly the plan would be to push

So the terms that are under

19

discussion, if we have to go the prefunding route

20

with Chase, are they would fund up to $9½ million.

21

We would do it by October 31st.

22

probably have their withdrawal right -- starting in

23

March 2012.

24

but that would probably be the point that they

They would

That would be subject to negotiation,

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 18
1

would start to ask to be able to unwind the

2

investment if things were going horribly.

3

Truong would cover the legal fees

4

for all the parties at the time of the initial

5

closing, essentially increasing their amount of

6

commitment to the transaction.

7

CDF would only use the proceeds of

8

the Chase investment to fund the Truong deal.

9

an alternate deal had to be identified because

If

10

Truong was going sideways, it would come back to

11

this Board for review before CDF would agree to

12

fund it.

13

And, you know, the goal would be

14

to close on all transaction documents to limit the

15

uncertainty, not just taking in capital without

16

an exit strategy.

17

So no action is needed necessarily

18

from the Board to achieve the prefunding scenario

19

since all the steps that are part of the scenario

20

were authorized last time, but we wanted to lay

21

that out there since there are certainly risks and

22

considerations attached to it.

23
24

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:
on ifs.

You spent a lot of time

The reality is, could you -- well, not the

reality.

Could you explain a little bit about the

economic impact of a successful deal here?

MR. SMITH:

As far as if the -Jobs.

Yeah, sure.

Um-hmm.

total?

2

MR. SMITH:

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

4
5

I believe it's 45 or 50 right now.
And how long have they been

in business?
MR. SMITH:

I believe it is since -- I

don't -- off the top of my head, I don't know.

7

I believe it's since 2000, but perhaps earlier.

But we can certainly provide that.

Well, you seem like you

10

have a lot of second-guessing.

11

is -- in reality, this deal should go through.

12

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

Is this -- this

Oh, yeah.

I mean, really

13

the only -- the only condition that is holding

14

us up is receipt of the draft no further

remediation letter.

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

We voted on this

last month.

18

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

19

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

Yeah, last month.

20

My question is this no further -- or

21

the NFR, so if they require it and we get one draft

22

form from the state by November, how does that

23

affect a possible prefunding?

24

MR. SMITH:

So let's walk down the scenario.

condition --

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

4

MR. SMITH:

Right.

-- which is -- at this point, we

5

think it's likely they will waive it and we won't

6

have to go through all this.

7

waive this closing condition, we would close on all

8

the documents by 10/31, receive the prefunding of

9

$9½ million, and then as soon as the NFR shows up,

10

we could fund the loan.

11

12

If they decide not to

At that point, we have a

So, really, the -- all of the

13

withdrawal or unwind scenarios are if there's a

14

catastrophic delay with the --

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 22

MR. SMITH:

2

Great.

So the first transaction up for

3

review and proposed approval today is the Oakwood

4

Shores Terrace project.

5

So this is a mixed-used deal, CDF's

6

first participation in this type of transaction.

7

It's within the Madden/Wells CHA transformation

8

area.

9

And the activity that would be

10

funded is the construction of a two-story medical

11

office component within a mixed-use building that

12

has mixed-income housing sitting on top of it.

13

So the building is -- the portion

14

that CDF would propose to fund is -- 21,000 square

15

feet of that is preleased to a health clinic

16

operated by Mercy Hospital.

17

space is not yet spoken for, but it's quite

18

possible that Mercy would take that space as

19

well once it's in place and wants to expand its

20

operations.

The residential component has

48 total units that has its own separate funding

compliance reasons for that as well; you can't

commingle Section 42 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

basis with New Markets financing.

13

14

So there's a

So the three components in the

15

building are CHA replacement units:

project of Madden/Wells.

20

MS. SCOTT:

Question.

21

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

22

MS. SCOTT:

So the medical part is going to

23

be carved out as a separate financing from the

24

residential housing.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 25
1

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

2

MS. SCOTT:

And that they have kind of a

3

prohibition on residential housing in the New

4

Markets Tax Credit area.

5

MR. SMITH:

Correct.

6

MS. SCOTT:

So there's going to be -- even

7

though they're part of the same construction

8

project, they're two separate ownership structures?

9

MR. SMITH:

Yep, yep.

Complete vertical

10

subdivision of the building and two separate

11

construction contracts.

12

For the lower floors, Granite

13

Development is the owner on the construction

14

contract, and that would be the portion that

15

CDF would fund.

16

And then for the upper floors, TCB

17

is the owner on the construction contract.

Same

18

contractor, but they are completely bifurcating

19

their activity.

20

MS. SCOTT:

Same developer?

21

MR. SMITH:

I mean, Granite and TCB are

22

actually partners on the upper floor piece.

23

lower floor piece that CDF is funding, TCB does

24

not have any kind of ownership interest.

MS. SCOTT:

And that separation's sufficient

for New Markets Tax Credit?

3

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

Yeah, it's a layered cake, for

sure.

MR. SMITH:

MR. SMITH:

No.

Additional details on the

piece, this is, again, the New Markets component.

15

So this is just the lower floor

$10.7 million project cost.

The

16

allocation that CDF would propose to use for the

17

deal is up to $8½ million, generating about $2.4

18

million of New Markets equity.

19

The New Markets investor is JPMorgan

20

Chase, who's also the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

21

buyer and the senior lender for the transaction.

22

So they're providing $6.2 million of senior debt,

23

including monetization of a TIF note from the City

24

of Chicago.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 27
1

And then the CHA is providing a gap

2

financing loan of about $750,000 to round out the

3

funding stack for the commercial component.

4

MS. SCOTT:

All of which, I assume, gets

5

Chase their CRA credit from the whole project,

6

right?

7
8

MR. SMITH:

It's an important CRA deal for

them --

9

MS. SCOTT:

Yeah.

10

MR. SMITH:

-- yeah.

11

MS. HOLT:

12

And what was the TIF share, did

you say?

13

MR. SMITH:

The City's commitment's up to

14

$2.1 million.

15

around a million two at closing against the TIF

16

component specifically.

17
18

Chase would be making a loan of

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

What is the total project

cost?

19

MR. SMITH:

The upper floor portion is

20

about $13 million, and that's additive to this

$10.7.

So almost a $24 million project, all told.

consider giving CDF the flexibility to just do a

needed for this transaction?
MR. SMITH:

It's not specifically needed for

this transaction.

maximize its competitiveness for the 2011 round, it

could consider taking in a prefunding for this deal.

It's really if CDF wants to

And what's the

down side?
MR. SMITH:

Same down sides as we went

through before, except in this scenario we wouldn't

have loan documents closed.

taking in the funding and then waiting to close the

21

So kind of more similar to the

What's the closing schedule on

this one?

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 31
1

MR. SMITH:

There's a number of different

2

coordination points with HUD, mainly.

There's an

3

evidentiary process.

4

the bulk of the transaction documents when they're

5

about 95 percent complete.

6

on it, and then closing can happen.

So HUD has to actually review

They need to sign off

7

We're probably talking about January

8

of 2012 as sort of a -- I wouldn't say a best case,

9

but a good case closing scenario.

10

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

In this picturesque display

11

here, where is this store going to be located?

12

Because this is not the whole site.

13

you have it like that's the whole site, and then

14

there's not.

15

located?

In my mind,

So where is Aldi's going to be

16

MR. JASSO:

I think that's the Roseland site.

17

MR. SMITH:

That's on the next item.

18

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

I know it.

19

where is the Aldi's at.

20

You're calling it Roseland Plaza.

21

plaza is Aldi's?

22
23
24

I want to know

So why is that part there?

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

Where at in this

We're still on the

Oakwood Shores.
ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

Oh, I thought we was on

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 32

Roseland.

2

MR. SMITH:

No, no.

3

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

4

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

Oh, I done jumped the gun.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

I did too.

We're still at -- just a

8

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

9

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

10

MR. SMITH:

No.

So sorry.
That's all right.

So the prefunding resolution is

11

actually after Roseland in the agenda, but this

12

would be the project that would be most likely

13

linked to it.

14

So I just wanted to be clear --

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

15

this funding option?

16

MS. HOLT:

Any questions with

I guess my only concern is with

17

the other proposal, we're talking about a closing

18

that was scheduled that's been delayed because of a

19

new lender demand.

20

months out, probably six months out realistically --

21

MR. SMITH:

22

MS. HOLT:

And this one, we're a good five

Right.
-- for closing.

It seems a little

23

odd to me to be prefunding something when we're not

24

even close to funding, whereas, in the other case,

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 33
1

we're prefunding because we've got a little bit of

2

a glitch in the closing cycle due to a lender --

3

MR. SMITH:

Right.

Yeah, it's less of an

4

obvious move for CDF to pursue.

5

what the resolution would do is delegate the

6

authority to make that decision to Commissioner

7

Mooney, who's president of CDF, and also to Mike

8

Jasso, assuming Mike gets appointed today as vice

9

president/secretary-treasurer, which is also on the

10

Really, the --

agenda.

11

It would not be mandating that that

12

happens.

13

to those individuals, and they could continue to

14

evaluate the risks as we get closer to closing.

15
16

So basically we'd be moving the discretion

MS. SCOTT:

And you want to do prefunding in

order to show more demand on the program --

17

MR. SMITH:

Right.

18

MR. JASSO:

It's a strategic move.

19

MR. SMITH:

Right.

20

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

21

allocations.

22

MR. SMITH:

23

MS. SANCHEZ:

24

For our future

Yeah.
And as far as the housing

portion of this deal, it's been waiting for this

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 34
1

transaction.

2

done for like a year.

3

go through the process of approving all of the

4

evidentiary documents, which include all of the

5

closing documents for the New Markets Tax Credit

6

portion of this, the other side of the deal has

7

basically been sitting and waiting for this side of

8

the deal to be done.

9

So the housing side of it has been
So even though HUD has to

So, you know, we would -- we wish

10

they had come to us a little sooner, we could have

11

processed this a little sooner.

12

while, I think, to get it together on the commercial

13

side.

14

complete.

15

slower of the two.

It took them a

But the other side of this is very much

16

So it's really this side that's been

And now we're at a point where this

17

is ready to go, we just have to actually get to the

18

process of creating all the documents.

19

it's a six-week process to get through HUD to get

20

them to see our documents and the closing documents

21

of the housing transaction, although the housing

22

transaction at this point has been done for a very

23

long time.

24

MR. SMITH:

And then

One other caveat the Board could

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 35
1

choose to add would be only allowing prefunding of

2

this deal if the Truong deal has fully closed.

3

in other words, limiting the total amount of

4

prefunding that might be in place at any given

5

point to just one transaction's worth rather than

6

two.

7

MS. SANCHEZ:

So,

And also Chase is the lender

8

on both of those transactions, so if something

9

happened with the Truong, it could roll over to the

10

Oakwood Shores Terrace deal.

11

MR. SMITH:

12

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

13

Right.

questions?

14

(No response.)

15
16

We will now move to the Roseland
Plaza transaction.

17
18
19

Any further

Chairman, you have a question
already?
MR. SMITH:

So we have here a rendering of

20

the Roseland Plaza transaction.

I'll just point

21

it out.

22

east/west, and then this is Michigan Avenue heading

23

north/south (indicating).

24

here (indicating).

So this is 115th Street here running

Aldi would be located

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 36
1

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

2

MR. SMITH:

3

On the corner?

On the corner, yep.

Along

Michigan.

4

So this is a project that's been

5

in process with CDF as well as the Housing and

6

Economic Development for a couple years now.

7

Overall, it's a 90,000 square foot

8

shopping center project in the Roseland neighborhood

9

at the southwest corner of 115th and Michigan.

10

It's very challenging to get retail

11

financed at this point.

Preleasing is challenging

12

for land -- for developers, and lenders are being

13

extremely conservative about how much money they'll

14

advance against a project, depending on how much is

15

preleased, what the credit quality of the previous

16

tenants are; so extremely tricky.

17

This project has had a commitment

18

from Aldi for quite a while now to be its anchor

19

tenant; however, it does not have extensive other

20

preleasing, but good momentum on lining up some

21

other leases.

22

There's also some land acquisition

23

challenges.

There's some privately owned sites

24

within this overall project site that are still not

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 37
1

yet owned by the developer.

The City's actually

2

engaged in condemnation on behalf of the project

3

right now.

4

need to be phased out into at least three phases.

5

So right now the project's divided

So that's also causing the project to

6

into phase 1A, which is just the Aldi plus the

7

parking lot plus site access plus stormwater.

8
9
10

Phase 1B would likely be another
slug of inline retail space of smaller tenants
connecting to the Aldi.

11
12

And then phase 2 would be drugstore
and a couple other tenants.

13

So at this point, the only piece

14

that's really financeable is phase 1A, which would

15

be the Aldi component.

16

vertical pop out of the ground on this site is

17

likely to have a substantial impact on the

18

preleasing for subsequent tenants.

But also having something

19

MS. SCOTT:

Aldi plus strip retail.

20

MR. SMITH:

This phase would just be Aldi.

21

MS. SCOTT:

Just Aldi, not the --

22

MR. SMITH:

Yeah, yeah.

And then the

23

preleasing could hopefully get spurred on by that

24

activity.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 38
1

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

And why do they need

2

assistance on this particular store and not on any

3

of the other ones that they have?

4

MR. SMITH:

Oh, this -- in this case, the New

5

Markets assistance is going to the developer to

6

deal with their financing gaps.

7

not actually part of the financing structure.

8

They're just a tenant like they normally would be.

9

It's not -- Aldi's

So as far as community benefits of

10

this transaction, this site is classified as a food

11

desert by the USDA.

12

earlier in 2011, a nationwide study, that shows

13

census tracts that USDA thinks have limited grocery

14

access and also have substantial populations in

15

them that traditionally have challenged access to

16

healthy food.

17

It's a study that came out

If you look at Chicago, actually,

18

there's very few census tracts that the USDA

19

classifies as food deserts.

20

tracts that the City believes are food deserts.

21

There's also other metrics, like The Reinvestment

22

Fund's food access survey, that also show a lot

23

more areas of Chicago having food challenges.

24

There's a lot of

The

those tracts.

2

Aldi's lease is ten years of base

3

term.

Aldi would have 19 years of extensions that

4

they could just exercise with no negotiation needed.

5

The trade radius of the store

6

includes about 12,000 residents of food desert

7

census tract, so a significant population would be

8

impacted by this within a one-mile radius.

9

The building, as proposed, is a

10

LEED facility.

11

extraordinarily long time.

12

the development of this project would create

13

momentum for future phases through additional

14

leasing activity being spurred on.

15

The site has been blighted for an
And, as I mentioned,

So one other wrinkle in this

16

transaction, or nuance, is that the Aldi store is

17

only about $3.9 million, including the parking

18

and access.

19

practical New Markets transaction on a stand-alone

20

basis.

21

that small just because of the opportunity costs,

22

that they're spending time -- about the same amount

23

of time on that deal as they would on a much larger

24

deal.

That's a little too small to do a

Most investors would not touch a transaction

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 40
1

So this project also includes a

2

second layer, which is a takeout financing facility

3

or a permanent loan against a store that the

4

developer recently completed in another property at

5

79th and Perry in the West Chatham neighborhood.

6

So the developer purchased this

7

existing shopping center in late 2007, and then

8

over the course of a couple years put a significant

9

amount of the developer's own equity into this

10

building to improve it, re-tenant it.

11

So the major tenants at this point,

12

Save-A-Lot, moved in earlier in 2011, and then

13

Forman Mills is the other major tenant; they just

14

opened.

15

So what this would involve, PNC Bank

16

is the proposed New Markets investor.

17

also be a senior lender on the 79th and Perry

18

facility.

19

They would

So they provide a senior loan of

20

$5.9 million -- or, sorry, $5.4 million.

21

Chicago Department Fund would come in with a small

22

second permanent loan behind PNC on this facility.

23

MS. HOLT:

24

MR. SMITH:

And

Of how much?
That would be about $2.3.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 41
1
2
3

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

So it's $2.3 for

Chatham and $3.9 for Roseland?
MR. SMITH:

Right.

So together, those two

4

facilities total a $6.2 million New Markets

5

transaction, which is a much more practical scale.

6

But it also frees up equity that the developer

7

currently has in the 79th and Perry facility so

8

they continue to plow ahead at Roseland Plaza.

9
10
11

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

So we get two

grocery stores.
MR. SMITH:

So we get two grocery stores,

12

essentially.

13

this would be a permanent financing facility; it

14

would help stabilize that facility and let the

15

developer reinvest that equity elsewhere.

16
17
18
19
20

The Save-A-Lot is already open, but

MS. HOLT:

And how much equity are they

leaving in the Chatham property?
MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

Any?

It's under a million.

I believe it's about half a million.
MS. HOLT:

And -- okay.

And is all the rest

21

of the equity going back into the Roseland Plaza,

22

or is it going someplace else?

23
24

MR. SMITH:

So the developer would clear

about a million four from the permanent financing

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 42
1

of the facility at Chatham, and they would reinvest

2

all of that equity into the Roseland site

3

immediately at closing.

4

So, overall, this combined structure

5

generates about $1.7 million of New Markets Tax

6

Credit equity.

7

79th and Perry.

8

would be the junior lender at 79th and Perry.

9

then CDF would be the senior lender at Roseland

10

PNC would be the senior lender at
They would be -- and then CDF
And

Plaza.

11

This transaction's also a TIF deal.

12

The City is currently in redevelopment agreement

13

drafting mode on a $4 million total TIF commitment.

14

That $4 million is only phased out if the developer

15

does the entire 90,000 square foot project.

16

Phase 1A would receive $600,000 of

17

TIF, which is also flowing into the New Markets

18

structure.

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

21

MR. SMITH:

22

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

MR. SMITH:

24

So on Roseland, what is the

Aldi's going to pay?
-- Aldi's paying?

I believe it's $10 a square foot

on that.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

And then what about the

Save-A-Lot, their rent?

MR. SMITH:

4

top of my head what their rent is.

5

provide that later today.

MS. HOLT:

I can certainly

Is that the first time we've used

PNC?
MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

Yeah, PNC's ramping up

their presence in the New Market world.

10

MS. SCOTT:

They're ramping up their presence

11

out here generally --

12

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

13

MS. SCOTT:

-- in everything.

14

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

15

MS. HOLT:

16

MS. SCOTT:

That's good to see.

17

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

That too.

Okay.

It's nice.

CDF would then

18

have relationships with four investors.

19

also a way to broaden that pool.

20
21

MS. SCOTT:

Absolutely.

That's

Since of the four,

Chase is a massive percent of them.

22

MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

23

MS. SCOTT:

It's nice to get some other ones

24

in here and create some competition here for

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 44

projects.

2

MR. SMITH:

Yep.

3

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

So, again, could I see the

4

number of jobs at each -- each store, the actual

5

lease, how it ramps up, on both of these sites?

6

MR. JASSO:

7

ALDERMAN TUNNEY:

8

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

9

Yes.

MR. SMITH:

I don't know off the top of my

head, I apologize.

12

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

13

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

14

We should have the

jobs for Save-A-Lot since it opened, do we not?

10
11

For both of them?

That's fine.

And are they new jobs

created or existing jobs?

15

MR. SMITH:

The Save-A-Lot was a newly opened

16

store.

17

I think they're generally about 15 employees, but

18

we can confirm that number.

19

They do not tend to employ a lot of people.

own comfort, we're all okay with taking out an

Do we get a

(Chorus of ayes.)
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

15

Anyone opposed?

(No response.)

16

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

17

MR. SMITH:

Next?

So we have a resolution on

18

granting authority to prefund the stand-alone

19

resolution that, as I mentioned before, will be

20

tied to the Mercy/Oakwood transaction conceptually.

21

So this resolution would grant

22

the -- or delegate the authority to Commissioner

23

Mooney and the vice president/secretary-treasurer,

24

which, if you confirm him today, would be Mike

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 48
1

Jasso, to go ahead and execute that prefunding if

2

they believe that the risks associated with it are

3

adequately mitigated and that it's competitively

4

desirable to CDF to do that.

5
6
7
8
9

MS. SCOTT:

And it relates only to that

project or is it a blanket authorization?
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

This is a blanket

authorization.
MR. SMITH:

Yeah.

So this -- it's -- unlike

10

the Truong situation, there would not be a full dry

11

closing of the transaction.

12

accepting the prefunded capital with the

13

anticipation of closing the Mercy/Oakwood deal.

14

So it's a little bit less -- you

It would just be

know, there's less certainty embedded in it.

16

more similar to what CDF did in the PCC Wellness

17

transaction back in August of 2010.

18
19
20

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

It's

Any further

questions?
MS. HOLT:

That -- I'm sorry, that answer

21

didn't -- you asked whether it was blanket, Lois.

22

And is it blanket or not blanket?

23

MS. SCOTT:

It's blanket.

24

MR. SMITH:

It's un- -- yeah, it's blanket.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 49
1

It's not --

2

MS. SCOTT:

But it only relates to --

3

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

4

MS. SCOTT:

-- Oakwood.

5

MR. SMITH:

Well --

6

MS. SCOTT:

This project.

7

MS. HOLT:

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

9

MS. SCOTT:

10

authorization --

We're defining the project.

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

12

MS. HOLT:

It is.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

15

MS. SCOTT:

17

It is.

It's not saying it's for

Oakwood.

14

16

It is --

But it's not just granting

11

13

No.

No.

It's saying it's that also, but

it's also for future projects restricted.
ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

I agree.

My only

18

issue is Chairman Mooney had wanted that, but since

19

he's not here to talk about it, and so that's my

20

only issue.

21

MR. SMITH:

Sure.

22

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

23

should be restrictive.

24

can't table.

But I do think it

That's something that we

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 50
1

MR. SMITH:

Well, so if CDF received the

2

prefunded QEI, at that point the only other

3

transaction it would have authorization from the

4

Board to fund would be Mercy/Oakwood, is that --

5
6

MS. SCOTT:

At this point.

But if we have a

blanket authorization for all of them --

7

MR. JASSO:

No, I think that's -- it's not

8

blanket for all transactions; it's blanket --

9

I mean, it's open for Roseland, the -- kind of

10

the --

11

MR. SMITH:

12

be used for Roseland.

13

would because the prefunding would come from Chase,

14

and PNC's the lender on Roseland.

15

Theoretically, the capital could
It's very unlikely that it

ACTING CHAIRPERSON NEELY:

Why don't we

16

restrict it just until we can have Chairman Mooney

17

come in.

18

And so I'd like to entertain a

19

motion to grant the option to prefund for the

20

Oakwood transaction --

21

ALDERMAN AUSTIN:

22

MS. SCOTT:

So moved.

We need discussion first, because

23

I think -- I think what you're trying to do is

24

get this deal closed, and so you need some

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 51
1

authorization by this Board today to let it get

2

closed.

3

if this one doesn't close, I'm going to lose out on

4

$9½ million worth of New Market Tax Credits, and we

5

don't want to let this go away.

6

And Chase is sitting there saying, Well,

MR. SMITH:

For Oakwood, it would be a

7

situation where CDF would be requesting prefunding

8

from Chase for competitiveness reasons, trying

9

to --

10

MS. SCOTT:

Right.

11

MR. SMITH:

-- look better for the 2011 round.

12

MS. SCOTT:

Right.

13

MR. SMITH:

If Chase agreed to that and the

14

Board agreed to it and the commissioner thought it

15

was prudent, Chase would fund up to 8½ million into

16

a CDF subsidiary in anticipation of later closing

17

the Mercy/Oakwood deal, but there would be no loan

18

documents closed at the time of the prefunding.

19

MS. SCOTT:

And if that deal never closes --

20

MR. SMITH:

Then --

21

MS. SCOTT:

-- this document would authorize

22

that -- that prefunding to be applied to other

23

projects?

24

MR. SMITH:

No.

Urlaub Bowen & Associates, Inc. 312-781-9586

 CDF MEETING 10/3/2011
Page 52
1

MS. SCOTT:

No?

2

MR. SMITH:

It just authorizes the capital

3

coming into the CDF entity.

And so then this Board

4

would have the opportunity to vote on any

5

subsequent employment options --

MS. SCOTT:

Okay.
