VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #6)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #6.
A.

Dr. Shannon provided an overview of the Strategic Plan Update, which included information on the following
subjects:

Strategic Planning Objectives
Mission and Vision
Leverage Focus Areas in Impact 2020

Appendix

Following the presentation of the information, Director Richardson-Lowry stated that, from experience, because it
can be an arduous process, she encourages the Directors to read the materials in advance of the meetings when
possible; it might help with the questions that inevitably surface. Director Munar stated that, in the timeline, he
would like to encourage the administration to think about a place to engage partners.
Chair Hammock stated that, by Ordinance, this should be a 5-year plan. The first one was for 5 years, but when he
and Dr. Shannon started down this path, he was insistent that, in his experience, 5-year plans spend most of their
time on the bookshelf, and are rarely implemented with any seriousness. Because he and Dr. Shannon did not want
to do that, they cut it at 3 years for the current Strategic Plan, because that is about as far forward as one can see; it
allows for the setting of tactical targets and goals to meet, and makes the whole conversation more likely to occur.
He and Dr. Shannon want to do that again with the upcoming strategic plan, and they want to make it something that
works.

Legislative Update

The Cook County Board Committee on Finance conducted Department Review hearings on the FY2019 budget
the week of October 22, 2018. The hearing on FY19 Budget took place on Thursday, October 25, 2018.
Dr. Shannon presented and responded to questions from Commissioners. Chairman Hammock participated in
the hearing as well as members of the Leadership team. In addition, Director Gugenheim attended the hearing.

On October 5, 2018, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) filed emergency rules to implement PA 100-
1029, which eliminates ?philosophical or moral reluctance" as reasons that a healthcare employee can decline a
flu shot. The emergency rules align state administrative code with PA 100?1029 flu shot legislation) and
are effective September 18, 2018. IDPH states that the emergency rules ?will provide health care settings the
ability to implement vaccination programs consistent with the statute for the 2018-19 influenza season.?

On October 12, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) published draft rules (see pages
18242 18284) concerning the implementation of integrated Health Homes (IHHs). IHHs are a new, fully?
integrated form of care coordination for Medicaid beneficiaries. Starting in November, managed care plans will
start to conduct outreach to their members in the top IHH tiers to assist them in choosing an IHH.

The Department of Public Health published an Maternal Morbidity and Mortality Report. The
report summarized findings from reviews of maternal deaths in 2015, and offered recommendations to address
maternal mortality, including:
0 Expanding Medicaid eligibility for women beyond the 60 day postpartum period, to one year after
delivery.
0 Ensuring insurance coverage of case management and outreach for postpartum high-risk women for
one year after delivery.
0 Creating or expanding home visiting programs to target high-risk mothers.
0 Increasing access to behavioral health services for pregnant and postpartum women.
0 Unbundling insurance payments of postpartum visit services from labor and delivery.

The House Health Care Availability and Access Committee will hold a second hearing on October 30, 2018 at
10am to discuss the high rates of infant and maternal mortality among African Americans in Illinois. CCH
submitted written comments and Dr. Terry Mason presented oral testimony at the first committee meeting that
took place in September.

The 2018/19 ACA Marketplace open enrollment period will start November 1, 2018 and end December 15, 2018.
Similar to last year, there is minimal federal funding for Illinois organizations to provide proactive assistance with
Marketplace outreach and enrollment efforts,,and little to no paid marketing to inform customers about the
open enrollment.

The Illinois General Assembly Fall Veto Session is scheduled for November 13?15 and November 27-29.

On September 26, 2018 the House cleared the c0nference report for the FY 2019 Labor-HHS-Education
appropriations bill, packaged together with the FY 2019 Department of Defense appropriations bill as the third
?minibus? (H.R. 6157, as amended). The bill also included a continuing resolution (C.R.) to keep the remaining
federal agencies and programs running at 2018 levels after the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, 2018
through December 7,2018. The final roll call vote was 361-61. The President signed the bill into law on
September 28, 2018.

 On September 28, 2018 Speaker Paul Ryan brought the Senate?passed opioid package, the SUPPORT for
Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6), to the House floor. The Senate had approved the measure and also
incorporated a provision authored by Senators Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Richard Durbin Ben Cardin 
and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) which lifts the Medicaid IMD exclusion for all substance use disorders. Previous
versions of the bill had only applied to inpatient opioid and cocaine treatment. On October 3, 2018 the Senate
agreed to the House amendment and sent the final bill to the President, who is expected to sign it.

H.R. 6, as passed, contains a handful of provisions that may be of particular interest to Cook County Health:

0 Section 1001 requires states to suspend, rather than terminate Medicaid for youth in
custody/detention.

0 Sections 1017 and 1018 promote Medicaid housing related services and supports for beneficiaries with
substance use disorders.

0 Section 5032 requires HHS to convene a stakeholder group to produce a report of best practices for
states to consider in health care related transitions for inmates.

0 Section 5052 provides a state option to lift the Medicaid IMD exclusion for non-elderly adults for
substance use treatment (up to 30 days). Does not interfere with section 1115 waivers.

a The US. Department of Homeland Security published its proposed changes to its ?public charge? rules for
immigrants in the Federal Register on October 10, 2018. There is concern the new rules could have a chilling
effect on immigrants accessing public services that they or their children would be otherwise eligible for in fear
of losing legal immigration status. There is also risk of significant increases in uncompensated care in public
hospitals, as many immigrants may forego coverage so as not to jeopardize their immigration status. The
comment period closes December 10, 2018. Cook County Health will host a press conference with President
Preckwinkle and our Congressional delegation on Monday, October 29th to express concern about the proposed
rule.

0 On October 11, 2018 CMS announced that prices for benchmark plans on the ACA exchange will drop by 1.5
percent on average for next yea r, signaling that the market may be stabilizing. Healthcaregov will have 23 more
insurers offering plans in 2019 and 29 more are expanding the areas where they will be offering plans. Only 39
percent counties will have just one insurer on the exchange next year, down from more than 50 percent of
counties last year. HHS officials took credit for the improvements despite repeatedly describing the ACA as a
failure.

0 The House is in recess until after the November 6th midterm elections; the Senate is in recess until November 13,
2018.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.
