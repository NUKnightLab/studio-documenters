Purpose:

The applicant, the Chicago Park District, proposes to ground lease the parcel
generally bounded by a line approximately 50 feet south of the south line of East
LSth Stree! a line approximately 150 feet west of the west line of the shoreline
of Burnham Harbor; a line approximately 525 feet north of the north line of
McCormick Place (East); and a line approximately 11.5 feet east of the east line of
South Lake Shore Drive (exclusive of exit ramps) to the Lucas Museum of
Narrative Art, a California not for profit corporation, for the development of a
public sculptural museum. The museum, which will only be located on the
ground lease parcel, and newly established parkland and green space, which will
be located around the boundaries of the ground lease parcel, will replace the
existing, approximately 1,500 space surface parking lot that is currently on the
site. The museum will include an approximately 59,000 square foot plaza which
will be available for public use during museum hours. The museum will have
exhibition areas, theaters, educational classrooms and lecture halls, archival
space, an elevated restaurant, a circular observation deck, and approximately
192 enclosed at-grade parking spaces. ln addition, the project will add
approximately 200,000 square feet of newly available green space and parkland
along the lakefront, including an eco park, dune field, event prairie and museum
garden and entry court. Finally, a pedestrian bridge connecting the museum to
Waldron Garage may be part of the project
