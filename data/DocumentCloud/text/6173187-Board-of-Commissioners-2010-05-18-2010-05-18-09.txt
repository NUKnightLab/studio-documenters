ITEM NO. A5

May 12, 2010

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO CHICAGO HOUSING
AUTHORITY’S MOVING TO WORK AGREEMENT
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners,
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve Amendment No. 4 to the Amended and
Restated Moving To Work Agreement dated June 26, 2008 (hereafter, the “Restated Agreement”),
between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Chicago Housing
Authority (CHA), and authorize the Chief Executive Officer’s execution of the amendment.

FUNDING
No CHA Funding is applicable to this request.
EXPLANATION
On June 26, 2008, CHA executed the Restated Agreement which superseded the original MTW
Agreement, “Memorandum of Approval, Resident Protection Agreement, Moving To Work
Agreement,” dated February 6, 2000. The Restated Agreement extends CHA’s participation in the
MTW Demonstration to the end of FY2018. CHA’s continued participation in the MTW Program is
contingent upon adherence to the requirements set out in the Restated Agreement, which included
submission of the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan – Plan for Transformation Year 11 to HUD on
October 16, 2009.
Amendment No. 4 reads as follows:
Replace Paragraphs 20f and 20g of Attachment D with the following text:
20f.

The Mixed-Finance Resident Ombudsman must produce notes reflecting all of the
issues raised at each semi-annual meeting. The notes are to be forwarded to the
Central Advisory Council, CHA’s Chief Executive Officer/President, and CHA’s
Board Chairperson. The notes are also to be posted to CHA’s website within thirty
days after receipt of notes from the court reporter or sixty days from the date of the
last meeting.

20g.

The CHA must draft a written response to each of the issues raised in the meeting
notes and must transmit the response to the Mixed-Finance Ombudsman, the Central
Advisory Committee and the Board Chairperson as well as publish the response on its
Website within 30 days of receiving the meeting notes from the court reporter or sixty
days from the date of the last meeting;

 Except as provided in this Amendment No. 4, every term and condition contained in the Restated
Agreement, as amended by previous amendments shall continue to apply with the same force and
effect as if it were fully set forth herein.
Included with this Board Letter is Amendment No. 4 to the Restated Agreement. Based upon the
foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to approve Amendment No. 4 to the Restated Agreement
and grant authorization to the Chief Executive Officer to execute this amendment on behalf of CHA.
