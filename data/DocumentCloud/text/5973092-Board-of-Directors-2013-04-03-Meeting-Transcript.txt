Hi.

Thank you.

At this time we'd like to move on to
organizational matters.

The first item there is the approval

8

of the minutes from our January 10th, 2013 meeting.

MR. BELL:

So moved.

CHAIRMAN POPE:

16

Motion by James.

Seconded.
All in favor?
Aye.
The ayes have it.

Also we have several resolutions

17

that have been presented to us including the

18

Freedom of Information Act Officer and Certified

19

Public Accountants, all the way down to the Annual

20

Report.

21

members and others, to review those.

If we can just take a moment, Board

22

I think of special interest is the

23

annual report.

Among other things, this is

24

required through our legislation.

 4
1
2

And I want to thank Steve for
summarizing these milestones.
So if we have no questions or

10
11

(A chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?

12

(No response.)

13

The ayes have it.

14

Moving on to Item C, that is the

15

2013 Board of Directors' schedule.

16

MR. BEITLER:

17
18

Since we're missing two,

why don't we do it by e-mail?
CHAIRMAN POPE:

Okay.

We will hold

19

this matter for now, but just for the record, we

20

have been in conversation with one another to

21

establish a calendar for the remaining of this year

22

2013 and moving on to 2014.

23
24

Our efforts are to get standing
meetings quarterly as we've talked about in the

 5
1

past, but with two of the other members not being

2

here, we're not going to take a vote on it.

3

information is available, and we'll look to take

4

action on that at the next meeting.

5

Item Number 3 is the CEO's first 43

6

days.

7

enlighten us, please.

So at this point, Stephen, if you'd like to

8
9

That

MR. BEITLER:

Sure.

So I've been on the

job for a whopping 43 days at this point.

10

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Let the record show that

11

we're joined by David Hoffman, another Board

12

member.

13

MR. BEITLER:

Basically I've been

14

working on many things that you can already see on

15

the agenda.

16

as we go through the agenda, I won't discuss them

17

again.

18

Since we'll be discussing these today

In addition, I've over the last 43

19

days been attempting to hire interns, and there are

20

five associates with us here today from Booth

21

School of Business at the University of Chicago who

22

will be assisting the Trust going forward for this

23

next quarter, and there are actually two sections

24

of Kellogg class where the students will also be

 6
1

assisting the Trust.

2

moment obviously.

3

They're not here at the

We've also been involved in working

4

on finance activities, so with the hiring of an

5

accounting firm, we'll now be able to go full bore

6

and report on those for the next Board meeting.

7

Also been involved with a lot of

8

legal activities, particularly with the assistance

9

of David Winters at the City and Kirkland & Ellis

10

through their kind efforts, and you've seen a lot

11

of those results and some of the policies in

12

particular.

13

I've also spent a lot of time

14

meeting -- So I've literally had I believe it's

15

fair to say hundreds of meetings over the last 43

16

days, many with the City, many with not-for-profit

17

groups, many with investment bankers and private

18

equity firms.

19

I also attended one infrastructure

20

conference where I got to hear Lois Scott talking

21

about the Midway project which was interesting, and

22

then we've spent a lot of time looking at best

23

practices which Adam Helman who is here today will

24

talk to us a little bit about, working with World

 7
1

Business Chicago, working on the web which we will

2

have a relaunched web site which we'll discuss at

3

the next Board meeting, various administrative

4

matters and also on grant guides which Matt Schmitz

5

who has been working with us will talk to us a

6

little bit about in terms of different types of

7

grants we might apply for to act sort of as

8

leverage for the deals that we do in the future.

9

So that's more or less what I've

10

been working on.

11

moment now to introduce the various volunteer staff

12

and interns who are working with the Trust.

13

I just would appreciate taking a

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I think that would be

14

wonderful.

15

Stephen, for looking in Chicago for a lot of the

16

home-grown talent.

17

the universities and colleges that we have here in

18

Chicago and try to keep it as local as possible, so

19

to tap into some of the local resources is

20

appreciated.

21

I want to comment and thank you,

We certainly pride ourselves on

MR. BEITLER:

We'll be doing that more.

22

We had to start someplace, so we started with two

23

schools, but we'll be expanding further.

24

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Very good.

 8
1

MR. BEITLER:

2

MR. HELMAN:

So first is Adam Helman.
Hello.

3

Helman.

4

Steve on our procurement strategy, on our

5

procurement manual and our best practices so far.

6

I'm a volunteer.

My name is Adam

MR. HOFFMAN:

I've been working with

Welcome.

I'm David

7

Hoffman.

8

just tell us a little bit about your background?

9

Really appreciate everything.

MR. HELMAN:

Sure.

Can you

I am a native of

10

Chicago.

Went to business school at Northwestern,

11

worked in advertising and then worked at Coca-Cola

12

for about 15 years in a combination of marketing

13

and strategy jobs.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

15

MR. BEITLER:

Matt.

16

MR. SCHMITZ:

Hi.

My name is Matthew

17

Schmitz.

Also a native of Chicago, West Beverly.

18

I'm a recent graduate of University of Illinois

19

down in Urbana Champaign in urban planning.

20

And basically what I've been working

21

on as Steve mentioned is I've been developing a

22

manual to serve as a guide for government funding

23

opportunities.

24

Basically so far we have a master

 9
1

guide that aligns with the Trust strategies that we

2

will eventually digitally publish and just an

3

example of how a typical grant entry would look

4

with your basic information, related promotional

5

materials and also recent success stories.

6

Thank you.

7

CHAIRMAN POPE:

8

MR. BEITLER:

9
10

yourselves.
MR. MORRIS:

Richard Morris from the

University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

13
14

I'd like everyone from the

U of C just if you would stand and introduce

11
12

Thank you.

MR. ATRI:

Daniel Atri from the

University of Chicago School of Business.

15

MR. KARAM:

Hi.

I'm Wadi Karam.

I'm

16

from the University of Chicago Booth School of

17

Business.

18

MS. CASTRO:

19

University of Chicago.

20
21
22
23
24

Hi.

MS. CARVALHO:

I'm Maira Castro from

Hi.

Anna Carvalho from

University of Chicago.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Quick question.

Everybody

students at Booth?
(A chorus of yeses.)

 10
1

Are people from different countries?

2

(A chorus of yeses.)

3

What countries?

4

your experience might end up being relevant.

5

MS. CARVALHO:

Because I think

So six years experience

6

as a strategy consultant from Rio De Janeiro,

7

Brazil.

8

MS. CASTRO:

9

I have experience as a consultant.

10

MR. KARAM:

I'm from Paulo, Brazil, and

I'm from Mexico, and I have

11

four years of experience in family health

12

specializing in energy infrastructure.

13

MR. ATRI:

I'm Daniel.

I'm from Mexico.

14

I have three years of experience in consulting and

15

two years of experience of project development.

16
17

MR. MORSE:
from California.

18
19
20

I'm Richard Morse recently

MR. HOFFMAN:

We consider that another

MR. BEITLER:

I think it's interesting

country.

21

to point out that in terms of infrastructure

22

experience among the students basically that

23

experience principally lay with people who don't

24

live in the United States initially but who do live

 11
1

here now and go on to school at Booth, so we're

2

leveraging that experience.

3

CHAIRMAN POPE:

4
5

Wonderful.

Let the record show that we're
joined by Jorge Ramirez.

Welcome, Jorge.

6

MR. RAMIREZ:

Thank you.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

I had mentioned to Diana,

8

Alderman, that -- I know I missed the section on

9

resolutions, but I had some comments and questions

10

when it's an appropriate time to go back.

11

apologize for asking for that.

12
13

CHAIRMAN POPE:

MR. HOFFMAN:

15

CHAIRMAN POPE:

19

Thank you very much.
We'll go back to Item

Number 2, the approval of the resolutions.

17
18

We'll let it slide this

time.

14

16

I

David, some questions or comments
for the CEO?
MR. HOFFMAN:

I do.

First of all, our

20

first meeting with you as CEO, and I know you gave

21

an introduction I'm sure before I got here, and I

22

walked in in the middle of it.

23
24

So welcome.
we all are.

I'm thrilled.

I know

It instantly and dramatically changes

 12
1

who we are and what we're able to do, so just

2

thrilled.

3

And the interns is only one example

4

but a great example of, you know, something

5

tremendous you brought to this.

6

efforts of everyone who is volunteering.

7

Appreciate all the

Quick question for Kirkland, for

8

Scott on conflict of interest policy.

9

had worked on that.

You and I

I wanted to let you know that

10

having reviewed it I'm comfortable with and believe

11

that it's appropriate and has the right terms.

12

These things are always I think --

13

You need to always be looking back at them in light

14

of experience, so I think that over the months as

15

situations come up we have the ability to tweak it

16

if necessary, and no conflict of interest policy is

17

perfect, but I'm satisfied.

18

I just want to hear from you.

We

19

haven't really talked about it.

20

on board and this represented a work product you

21

were comfortable with.

22

MR. FALK:

Make sure you were

It does, David.

As you know,

23

for 501(3)(c) organizations which we've applied and

24

qualify as, the IRS publishes conflict of interest

 13
1

template policies.

2

goes beyond that.

3

This meets those standards and

So it is -- It supplements the basic

4

policy, so it meets all IRS guidelines and does --

5

And it takes it sort of an ethical step further to

6

a level which I think is appropriate for a body

7

with a relationship with the City of Chicago

8

government as we have, so I'm very comfortable that

9

this is as it is now in appropriate form.

10

As you say, it's got to be a living,

11

breathing document, and it may well evolve.

12

issues come up, obviously the good thing about

13

having a nimble board like this is we're able to

14

adjust quickly if we need to.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16
17
18

If

We're getting older.

David, did you have a chance to
review this?
MR. WINTERS:

Absolutely.

I shared

19

whatever comments I had with Kirkland & Ellis.

20

We're fine with it.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, I assume --

22

MR. BEITLER:

Just to be clear, Kirkland

23

& Ellis and the City represented by David Winters

24

have reviewed all of the resolutions and agreed

 14
1

with all the resolutions.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

So the Board members know,

3

because I know we've had some prior discussion

4

about this, I'm comfortable as well, so I

5

appreciate that and don't have any further

6

comments.

7

on the record.

8
9
10

I just wanted to make sure we put that

One of the ones before -- Was there
any discussion about the Washington, Pittman and
McKeever group and bringing them in?

11

MR. BEITLER:

No, there was not.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you give a real quick

13

explanation for why we're bringing them in, what

14

your anticipation is of the scope, cost, that sort

15

of thing?

16

MR. BEITLER:

Well, we will actually

17

wind up bringing in I believe two accounting firms.

18

This firm is the first to do accounting let's say,

19

so normal accounting as opposed to auditing, and

20

then there will be a second firm that gets selected

21

for purposes of auditing which we'll consult with

22

the first firm Washington, Pittman and McKeever, to

23

help select an auditor.

24

But this firm was selected to

 15
1

basically assist the Trust in doing its accounting,

2

so chart of accounts, complying with the chart of

3

accounts, filing tax returns, you know, filing

4

expense reports for staff, working with the

5

treasurer to make sure that the executive director

6

is doing what he's supposed to be doing from a

7

financial standpoint, also providing the levels of

8

authority that are necessary so that we can do

9

forms correctly, right, so that I don't have to

10

sign off on a form for myself.

11

two levels of review essentially -- the treasurer

12

and the accounting firm and then eventually an

13

audit firm.

14
15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

Kind of -- There's

They're not pro

bono, I assume?
MR. BEITLER:

They are not pro bono.

We

17

are paying them.

18

and materials basis with them because we're kind of

19

a penny ante account, so the agreement is just to

20

do time and materials at the moment.

21
22
23
24

We are working on a strictly time

MR. HOFFMAN:

How were they chosen?

Was

there some process?
MR. BEITLER:

Well, we did go through a

process, but we did not go through an RFQ process.

 16
1

We went through a process where we canvassed most

2

of the larger accounting firms in the city looking

3

for smaller accounting firms.

4

good way to do this because it's not like there's a

5

list you can go to somewhere that says these are

6

small accounting firms, blagh, blagh, blagh, blagh.

7

So I canvassed the larger accounting

And there's not a

8

firms to try to find smaller accounting firms to

9

interview and then selected this particular

10

accounting firm and then conferred with the

11

treasurer and the chairman and asked for their

12

concurrence and then came to the Board with a

13

resolution.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And I'm comfortable with

15

the -- I mean the process you're describing is

16

basically a highly discretionary process where

17

there's the process you just described but it's not

18

as formalized or procedural as other procurement

19

processes we might see.

20

given who we are and where we are in the time

21

frame.

22

I think that's appropriate

I would suggest though that we

23

should probably put just as a practical matter some

24

reasonable time limit on it for sort of a refresh,

 17
1

either 6 or 12 months, because I think that odds

2

are going forward, I think you're going to have

3

good thoughts on this as well, my guess is in the

4

future we'll want to use a different, more

5

formalized process.

6

MR. BEITLER:

So here would be my

7

response.

One, we have an engagement letter.

8

for one year.

9

engagement letter and has agreed it's a good

It's

Again, the treasurer has seen the

10

engagement letter, so the attorneys have seen the

11

engagement letter, also agreed that it's an

12

appropriate engagement letter, so that would meet

13

your requirement of one-year time frame.

14

one-year engagement.

It's a

15

I think what we will find, however,

16

is that doing everything competitively is going to

17

be easier said than done.

18

is that business life is just changing in certain

19

respects.

20

now offered as software as a service, and it's just

21

largely impossible to do competitive bids for

22

software as a service because there's nobody to

23

whom to submit a competitive bid.

24

services, and so basically if we want to say do a

Part of the problem is

So certain services, for example, are

It's on line

 18
1

payroll service -- You know, Quick Books, for

2

example, it's $30 a month.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me short circuit this.

4

Even governments, and we're not a government, even

5

governments choose professional services firms,

6

accounting firms and law firms without the same

7

kind of competitive process.

8

that process.

I'm not describing

9

MR. BEITLER:

Got you.

Okay.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

I just think that going

11

forward following some process that describes --

12

That is -- Describes the process at a Board meeting

13

or otherwise, talks about the type of other firms

14

that were considered so that there's some

15

explanation for how they were chosen I think would

16

be great.

17

We're a start-up basically.

18
19
20

I think this is just fine for now.

MR. BEITLER:

And I kind of needed an

accountant.
MR. HOFFMAN:

None of this is intended

21

to slow anything down because the fact that we're

22

moving more quickly now is really appreciated by me

23

and I know everyone else.

24

MR. BEITLER:

Point taken.

 19
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2
3

Thank you.

Did you guys talk about the
investment policy at all?

4

MR. BEITLER:

No, we didn't really --

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can you give a

6

60-second -- I read it.

7

but if you could on the record sort of give a

8

60-second explanation why you in your experience

9

think it's appropriate, I think it would be

10

helpful.

11
12
13
14
15

I was comfortable with it,

MR. BEITLER:

To have an investment

MR. HOFFMAN:

This particular -- I

policy?

assume that you -MR. BEITLER:

This particular investment

16

policy is actually kind of unusual, but the thing

17

that makes it unusual is not the type of investing

18

with one exception.

19

make investments in the projects which it manages

20

on behalf of the City or the Trust.

21

So the Trust has to be able to

So as the Trust does projects and

22

presumably earns fees or gets money through those

23

projects, it needs to be able to reinvest that

24

money into the future projects.

In an organization

 20
1

of this type -- Now, I've never run an organization

2

of this type before.

3

typically or for-profit start-ups.

4

not-for-profit start-up, but in a not-for-profit

5

start-up, typically you would have an extremely

6

conservative investment policy and would preclude

7

the ability to make an investment in an

8

infrastructure project of the type that we were

9

just discussing.

10

They've been much larger
This is a

However, the purpose of the Trust is

11

to make investments in infrastructure projects of

12

this type, so the policy is unusual in that it's

13

perfectly appropriate for the Trust but it allows

14

us to make infrastructure investments in projects

15

that we will manage or manage for the City, and a

16

start-up of this type would ordinarily not be

17

making those investments.

18

to the functioning and the mission of the Trust

19

that we do that.

20

However, it's critical

Other than that, there is I would

21

say no difference in the investment policy from any

22

other investment policy.

23
24

MR. BELL:
David.

Let me comment on that,

 21
1

David, you recall we had the

2

$2,000,000 in fee money.

3

important for us to have a policy around how we

4

would use that money and restrict how that money

5

could be actually used in terms of investment, and

6

I think the policy tries to capture that.

7

I think it would be

Once again, this is the first

8

writing of it.

I think, again, as we learn more

9

and we understand more, the possibility of that

10

being modified to accommodate what that knowledge

11

turns out to be and whether we would want to be

12

aggressive, we would come back to the Board and

13

look at where that needs to be modified.

14

starting out I think that we can afford to have

15

something for now on how we would use that initial

16

piece of it.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

But

My reaction in reading it

18

was consistent what you just said, James, and what

19

Steve said which was that it looks very

20

conservative in terms of the financial instruments

21

that the Trust is allowed to invest in, and then

22

there's this other element which is what we do, and

23

that's what I heard you say.

24

MR. BEITLER:

Yeah.

 22
1

CHAIRMAN POPE:

2

MR. SILVERS:

3

Damon.

I'm Damon Silvers.

I'm an

advisory member of the Board.

4

I want to add to what other people

5

have said, that this is I think a very

6

appropriately constructed policy.

7

sort of questions I had about it but I think maybe

8

in the line of just, you know, areas you might want

9

to look at with that conservative piece in mind.

10

There are two

One is the provision for investing

11

in mutual funds.

12

that really makes sense because it's possible to

13

invest in mutual funds that could circumvent your

14

prohibition.

15

investing anything in a mutual fund other than a

16

money market mutual fund which is separately

17

listed.

18

You might want to look at whether

It's not clear to me why you would be

The other point -- Again -- And this

19

may be a point where the staff understands this

20

better than I do, but there's a list for

21

firm-specific investments and commercial paper that

22

are A-rated.

23

that rather than go through a diversified money

24

market, but if you did, you might want to consider

I'm not sure why you'd want to do

 23
1

a higher rating threshold.

2

A is not risk free.

You might want

3

to look at triple A.

The question is whether or

4

not there's triple A paper available in the market.

5

Your staff would know better than I.

6

MS. FERGUSON:

Just for clarification,

7

long-term bond ratings are in the triple A, double

8

A vernacular.

9

paper is actually A1.

10
11
12

The rating scale for commercial

MR. SILVERS:

As long as you're at the

top of the scale, that's fine.
MS. FERGUSON:

Yes.

That's my concern.
Commercial paper

13

rating scale A1 P1 is the highest rating, so I

14

think what's -- I think your point is well taken,

15

but it is at an appropriately high threshold, and

16

it's what we would have used in the corporate

17

sector, so it's perfectly comfortable I think from

18

a risk standpoint.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Comments from Diana or

20

Steve about the money market point -- I'm sorry --

21

I mean the mutual fund point.

22

MR. BEITLER:

I think it's an

23

interesting comment.

We'll have to review it.

The

24

Trust really doesn't have any money to invest right

 24
1

now.

2
3

MR. HOFFMAN:

It all is hypothetical,

MR. BEITLER:

We'll be careful about it

isn't it?

4
5

when it starts raining, and I think we will

6

continue to review the investment policy as we go

7

forward.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

MR. BELL:

10

I assume that --

Let me comment on that.

I think, David, that what was talked

11

about there is cash on hand.

12

bank account with no interest.

13

way that for income purposes you really want to

14

utilize that cash for the reasons organized, where

15

would you park it and get something for return

16

where the instrument is highly rated and has a

17

reasonable yield.

18

reason to be in a money market fund other than

19

parking cash --

20

It's sitting in a
You have to have a

I mean there would be no other

MR. HOFFMAN:

My understanding, Steve

21

and Diana, would be that to the extent that you,

22

Steve, think that an appropriate investment in a

23

mutual fund is right that you'd be consulting with

24

Diana or at least you'd be making the decision and

 25
1

Diana would know about it, so that together if

2

either of you had a concern regarding what Damon

3

raised that that would get flushed out.

4

right?

5
6

MS. FERGUSON:

MR. BELL:

CHAIRMAN POPE:
as much as possible?

11
12

I need to make one comment of

all these resolutions.

9
10

I think it's a

great point you raised.

7
8

Yeah.

Is that

MR. BELL:

James, can you speak up

It's difficult to hear you.
Is this better?

Can you

hear me now?

13

CHAIRMAN POPE:

14

MR. BELL:

Yes.

Thank you.

I think the one point we want

15

to make is that we're in the infancy stages of our

16

organization, and we're looking at a lot of things

17

that we need to have in place for governance

18

purposes.

19

And since we don't have a lot of

20

experience in them and we haven't really started

21

operating fully, you know, a lot of what we've done

22

in terms of these policies probably don't have --

23

Don't reflect what reality we will be, you know, a

24

year downstream, but we felt it was important to

 26
1

start getting some of these things in place, and

2

they will be in documents.

3

them as we know more and understand more.

4

think today we need to start off with some sort of

5

framework that governs how we operate.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

We will have to change
But I

I compliment Steve and

7

everyone else for taking the initiative.

8

great to receive this document.

9

to put in place as we've discussed our own

10
11

You know, we need

infrastructure.
The only other comment I have on the

12

other resolutions is the procurement and

13

confidentiality policy.

14

initial concern about part of that one.

15

turn to it here.

16

It's

I do have some at least
Let me

It's C.

I'm interested in comments either

17

from Steve Beitler or Scott Falk or David on this,

18

and it's the issue of when we can close a meeting

19

and what can be confidential.

20

As we all know, we -- There's an

21

executive ordinance that says we have to operate in

22

accordance with the Open Meetings Act.

23

question that as a practical matter to engage in

24

the kind of discussions with potential financial

There's no

 27
1

partners, bidders and so on that there's a need for

2

confidentiality of those discussions because

3

otherwise you just can't have them.

4

How those two things mesh is there's

5

a way to do that.

6

see any explicit reference to the Open Meetings Act

7

and since that's something that we have to follow

8

and reading the language it felt so highly

9

discretionary about when we can close something for

10

what I think is generally a legitimate purpose but

11

I was concerned about the -- Whether it was really

12

consistent with the OMA procedures that I wanted to

13

ask about it.

14

But reading this, since I didn't

I gotta tell you my initial reaction

15

was I did not have a comfort level with this one

16

and thought that maybe it just needs a little bit

17

of extra editing here and language relating to the

18

Open Meetings Act.

19

have gone down this road in a way that I hadn't

20

thought about it.

21

I wanted to ask because you may

MR. BEITLER:

Let me start off and then

22

I will defer lawyers to lawyers.

Basically to

23

start off, there is a reference to Open Meetings

24

Act, to the Open Meetings Act in one of the other

 28
1

policies, which my opinion was as a non-attorney

2

that that was adequate for purposes that you're

3

describing in terms of covering us from the

4

perspective of whether or not we need to comply

5

with the Open Meetings Act.

6

think we need to comply with the Open Meetings Act.

So nobody doesn't

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

8

MR. BEITLER:

So in terms of this

9

particular policy, basically I think it's obvious

10

to everybody that we can't conduct procurements in

11

public because there's sensitive information

12

involved with a procurement that must remain

13

private if the public is to get the best deal that

14

it is entitled to, so -- And then there are issues

15

around intellectual property and proprietary

16

information that belong to corporations or others

17

that also we have to respect the requirements as

18

you know for that information.

19

As we're conducting procurement,

20

it's important to keep the Board informed of those

21

procurements.

22

because we don't have the procurement manual

23

written yet.

24

manual fully written in concert with this, there

At this point it's unfortunate

So if you were to have a procurement

 29
1

would be a lot more procedure that would be spelled

2

out, and there would be a lot more concrete

3

information in terms of the interaction with the

4

Board and the staff and the people that are

5

involved with the procurement and so on, so we're

6

in the process of developing that, and I suspect

7

that we will be really in the process of developing

8

that for the next two years because we'll do the

9

procurement manual and then we'll go uh-oh, that

10

doesn't even work.

I have an experience with that

11

today.

12

member of the public today.

We have an unsolicited proposal from a

13

So in the procurement manual draft

14

that we've written so far which is just the table

15

of contents and which we will go over here shortly,

16

basically -- And the research that we're doing --

17

We didn't actually have a section for unsolicited

18

proposals from the public who are not providing

19

financing.

20

proposals for firms that are providing financing

21

but not somebody -- So, you know, here we are.

22

manual isn't even published yet and there's already

23

a change that we are going to have to make, so I

24

suspect we will encounter many changes that we have

We have something for unsolicited

The

 30
1

to make.

2

I don't know yet how the interaction

3

between the Board and a procurement and when it's

4

time to talk about it publicly, when it's time to

5

not talk about it publicly will actually play out.

6

We're going to find out starting today and so --

7

MR. BELL:

Steve?

8

MR. BEITLER:

9

MR. BELL:

Yes, sir.

You know, just in responding

10

to David's point, I think it is appropriate to add

11

a sentence in the purpose of this policy that

12

basically says the decision to go in closed session

13

will be consistent with the Open Meetings Act.

14

There's no problem putting it in there and making

15

that clear.

16
17

It's in the first

MR. HOFFMAN:

Did we get a different

paragraph.

18
19

MR. BEITLER:

version e-mail?

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

It's in the last line.

21

MR. BEITLER:

Yeah, there was an updated

22
23
24

e-mail.

It was in the updated.
MS. FERGUSON:

of the opening paragraph.

It's in the last sentence

 31
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

The one in the book in

2

front of us is different than the one that was

3

e-mailed to us.

4

MR. BELL:

Okay.

5

CHAIRMAN POPE:

6

of the first paragraph.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8

I'm sorry.

9

something.

10
11

So it is in there?

Yes, the last sentence

To short circuit this --

Scott Falk, you wanted to say

MR. FALK:

I just wanted to help

complete the resuscitation of your comfort level.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13

MR. FALK:

Yes.

So in addition to that

14

sentence at the end of the opening paragraph,

15

there's also -- Sort of the money sentence is in

16

2.1.1 which cross references to the provisions of

17

the bylaws that require our compliance with the

18

Open Meetings Act, so Article 5 of the bylaws is

19

the Open Meetings Act.

20

Sections 5.1.2 which is referenced

21

at the end of 2.1.1 is, in fact, a reference to our

22

obligation to comply with the Open Meetings Act

23

except as permitted under Section 2 of the Open

24

Meetings Act, so that cross reference in 5 to 5.1.2

 32
1

is intended to convey that we can only make

2

exceptions to the Open Meetings Act as allowed by

3

that Section 5.1.2 which, in turn, is constrained

4

by the flexibility in Section 2 of the Open

5

Meetings Act to closed meetings when appropriate.

6

So the language in Section 2.1.1 of

7

this investment -- Of the procurement

8

confidentiality policy tracks the language in

9

Section 2 of the Open Meetings Act.

It gives

10

flexibility to the Board to close meetings under

11

circumstances where the Board determines in its

12

reasonable discretion that it would not be in the

13

best interest of the Trust to allow that discussion

14

to occur.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Got it.

So, in other

16

words, the reference to Section 5.7.1.2 and the

17

other reference to Section 5.1 says that we have to

18

act in accordance with the Open Meetings Act.

19

MR. FALK:

Correct.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

So with that understanding

21

which I did not have -- I just read the numbers.

22

know I need to memorize our bylaws.

23

to-do list.

24

a reader -- I would consider -- I don't think it

I think that's fine.

I

It's on my

I do think that

 33
1

matters for our going forward, but I would consider

2

editing that to make this more transparent about

3

that point because I wouldn't want a future reader

4

of this who's not as versed in exactly what the

5

sections mean to come to the wrong conclusion, and

6

I think a reader of this could come to the wrong

7

conclusion which is that it's just fully

8

discretionary for us.

9

I agree with you, Steve, that seeing

10

how this goes is exactly the right approach with an

11

eye toward the Open Meetings Act and what makes

12

sense as a practical matter and we're just -- You

13

know, the fact that we're going to see how it goes

14

is exactly right.

15

There's going to be a sensitivity regarding that,

16

and I would want anyone watching this and reading

17

this to know that part of the clear intent here is

18

to follow the Open Meetings Act.

19

MR. FALK:

I think that's going to be a --

We can go back and look at

20

that.

I would just point out that as a matter of

21

drafting economy in all of these policies we

22

reference to the bylaws section that inspires the

23

policy, so there are -- So all these policies are

24

integrated part and parcel with the bylaws.

You

 34
1

can't really read them separate and apart from the

2

obligations under the bylaws.

3

references are appropriate, we can certainly look

4

at that.

If more explicit

5

MR. BEITLER:

Got it.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm comfortable.

7

Thank

you.

8

CHAIRMAN POPE:

9

MR. SILVERS:

Damon.

Just, again, a piece of

10

advice to the Board.

11

issue here is the possible perception that this is

12

other than what it really is which is a vital

13

measure to protect the public.

14

might want to -- This conversation has drawn that

15

out; that you must have something like this in

16

order for the procurement process not to be

17

compromised.

18

It seems to me that the real

All right.

So you

You might want to put a sentence in

19

that makes clear that that is, indeed, the purpose.

20

I understand the reason why counsel would advise in

21

drafting economy, but it might be possible to craft

22

a single sentence that doesn't -- That just

23

clarifies the purpose here.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree.

I think that

 35
1

would be a very helpful point.

2

If I could ask Steve and Scott when

3

we have the next Board meeting to give us an edited

4

version.

5

now, but I think it would be improved with those

6

suggestions.

I think this is perfectly appropriate for

7

MR. BEITLER:

We'll do that.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you very much.

9

Other than that, thank you for

10

indulging my diversion here on the resolutions, and

11

I think the other policies are fine.

12

Thank you.

13

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Since we were joined by

14

the additional Board members, I'd just like to

15

backtrack here for a moment and ask for your

16

concurrence, Jorge and David, on Item A, the

17

approval of the minutes.

18

So it can be recorded as such if

19

there's no questions or objections.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

CHAIRMAN POPE:

22
23
24

I approve.
No objections.

Also, the resolutions, again, if
there are no objections -MS. FERGUSON:

I'll move approval.

 36
1

CHAIRMAN POPE:

2

Thank you.

All in favor?

3

(A chorus of ayes.)

4

Opposed?

5

(No response.)

6

The ayes have it.

7

We did want to address Item C as

8

well since all the Board members are here.

9

know if, Stephen, you'd like to address that.

10

That's with respect to our schedule for the

11

remaining portion of 2013 as well as 2014.

12

MR. BEITLER:

Okay.

I don't

So these are new

13

schedules for 2013 and 2014.

14

Board meeting on January 10th, today on April 3rd,

15

proposed for July 11th and October 11th.

16

You can see the old

Now there are two Board members at

17

least that cannot make those dates, so I'd like to

18

know if we can go to Tuesday the 9th or October the

19

8th or we need to go into the next week, in which

20

case I'd keep it on the Thursday and go to the 19th

21

or the 18th.

22

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Again we're talking

23

about October 11th which does not work for at least

24

two Board members so moving that to another date?

 37
1

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

2

the -- Let's say the 18th.

3

date for everyone?

4
5

MR. BELL:

10

Give me the dates, Steve.

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I

Right now the schedule

calls for October 11th as our meeting.

8
9

Is that an appropriate

don't have them.

6
7

So moving that to

MR. BEITLER:

We would move that to

October 18 and July 11 and we would move that to
July 18.

11

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Again, the current

12

schedule calls for July 11th of this year which is

13

a Thursday.

14

one week later to the 18th.

The proposal per Steve is to move to

15

MS. FERGUSON:

16

MR. BEITLER:

17

I cannot do the 18th.
Okay.

that week or --

18

MS. FERGUSON:

19

MR. BEITLER:

20

CHAIRMAN POPE:

21

Yeah.
So the 17th.
I would prefer not a

Wednesday.

22

MR. BEITLER:

23

MS. FERGUSON:

24

Are you available

July.

I'm sorry.

No, the 17th of October.
I thought we were in

 38
1
2

MR. BEITLER:
sorry.

I'm sorry.

July.

I'm

Are you available the 16th?

3

MS. FERGUSON:

4

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.
Yeah, we're not going to

5

do Wednesdays because those are City Council

6

meetings.

7

CHAIRMAN POPE:

The proposal is to move

8

the July 11th scheduled date which is a Thursday to

9

the 9th?

10

MR. BEITLER:

11

CHAIRMAN POPE:

12
13

The 16th.
I'm sorry.

The 16th

which is a Tuesday.
MR. BELL:

I can't do the 16th.

14

Steve, what I would recommend is we

15

take this off line and let's just work it a little

16

harder and then be prepared to come in in the last

17

meeting because I think we'll spend a lot of time

18

trying to find dates.

19
20
21

MR. BEITLER:

I'm sure we will.

We'll

continue to do it off line.
MR. BELL:

And maybe it would be better

22

if we sent you -- If all the Board members sent the

23

available dates they had in the month that we want

24

to hold the meeting and then maybe we can find

 39
1

something that matches.

2

MS. FERGUSON:

3

avoid Wednesdays; right?

Right.

We're trying to

4

MR. BEITLER:

Not Wednesdays.

5

MS. FERGUSON:

That's fine.

6

you dates.

7
8

MR. BEITLER:
right.

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Perfect.

All

Stephen, we were on Item

3 at this point.

11
12

All right.

Thank you.

9
10

We'll send

We've introduced the volunteers and
interns and talking with in the news.

13

MR. BEITLER:

So in the books there is a

14

series of articles that were graciously prepared by

15

Culloton Strategies going back since the beginning

16

of the Trust that you can take a look at if you

17

care to.

18

and I'd just like to point out for anybody that

19

cares to look, on the 16th of March there was a

20

lead editorial in the Economist that mentions the

21

Trust, and that's pretty nice.

22

peruse these articles as you care to, and they're

23

available for you.

24

There are some very interesting articles,

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Basically you can

Great.

 40
1

MS. FERGUSON:

Steve, will you continue

2

to keep the Board apprised of news media as it

3

comes up?

4

MR. BEITLER:

5

MS. FERGUSON:

6
7
8

Yes.
So that will be a regular

part of our -MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

start distributing it on a more regular basis.

9

MS. FERGUSON:

10

CHAIRMAN POPE:

11
12
13
14
15

I will actually

Great.

Thank you.

Moving on to Item Number

4, the procurement manual, best practices.
MR. BEITLER:

I'd like to ask Adam

Helman to address the Board.
MR. HELMAN:

Okay.

Thank you.

So what you have here is really a

16

draft right now of what we've been doing to create

17

a table of contents for the manual.

18

see in these two columns on your left, you see the

19

table of contents, and then on the right we've

20

sourced where we've been pulling our best practices

21

from for procurement, and we've been looking at

22

difference sources that have a lot of experience

23

and a lot of success in the track record in the

24

area of public and private partnerships.

So what you

We've

 41
1

looked at Canada and particularly Ontario, the

2

State of Virginia, the Virginia Department of

3

Transportation as well as Texas, the State of Texas

4

and the Texas Facilities Commission.

5

So starting from the top,

6

definitions of project elements and then some

7

potential terms that we'd like to ultimately define

8

as best practices, project selection and some of

9

our influences there, and there's a wealth of

10

really strong strategic work that's been done for

11

the City and by some of the departments and

12

agencies over the last few years, and we've really

13

been looking at priorities identified there to help

14

us really identify our project list.

15

Then some standard areas around

16

developing conflict of interest and then creating

17

announcements to publicize projects or

18

opportunities, the selection process, and as Steve

19

just mentioned earlier, we have a new entrant in

20

that now where we've got an unsolicited idea coming

21

up from a citizen and working that in.

22

Our evaluation strategy, how we will

23

negotiate contracts, rights and obligations and

24

then how we work through awarding contracts, how we

 42
1

would handle protests and then ultimately design

2

construction and project acceptance as projects get

3

turned over from concessionaires or project owners

4

to the City when they're substantially completed.

5

MR. BEITLER:

Now I'd like to point out

6

we have a long way to go in the preparation of

7

this, and there are a lot of people that we will be

8

needing to consult with in order to bring this

9

manual to fruition, but we will be working

10

diligently on it with the City as well as many

11

other entities.

12

We have chosen places where they

13

have best practices and have conducted excellent

14

procurements as sort of role models, if you will,

15

and Canada in particular is -- At Infrastructure

16

Ontario and in British Columbia are two locations

17

where that's the case.

18

United States, Virginia and Puerto Rico are two

19

places where they've done this exceedingly well.

20

Interestingly, in the

And so we are looking at the places

21

that have a reputation for doing this well and have

22

a significant amount of published materials that to

23

some degree we can either rip off, which I use

24

politely and appropriately, I mean we'll borrow

 43
1

with permission but, or expand upon for purposes of

2

use in our environment, specifically in the City of

3

Chicago.

4

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I know I'm stating the

5

obvious, but as was mentioned in the procurement

6

and confidentiality policies, our adherence to the

7

City's MBE/WBE program which is -- I just want to

8

make sure --

9
10

MR. BEITLER:

I think it's in here

somewhere.

11

CHAIRMAN POPE:

12

MR. BEITLER:

It is.

Yes, we will adhere to

13

that from the spirit of it as well as the legality

14

of it, so --

15

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I think you mentioned,

16

Stephen, too your meeting with various

17

representatives including the City, Park District,

18

CPS given some of the initial projects that have

19

been proposed.

20

those entities would be helpful.

21

Obviously the procurement leads in

MR. BEITLER:

So, yes, we will be

22

meeting with all of them, and also Jamie Rhea who

23

is the head of procurement for the City will have

24

significant input in this to make sure that we are

 44
1

doing everything correctly from a regulatory

2

standpoint, so -- As well as David Winters to make

3

sure we're doing everything correctly from a legal

4

standpoint as well as the Kirkland attorney and so

5

on.

6

I think the list is just potentially

7

so long in terms of people that we'll get a chop on

8

this that --

9

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I just want to I guess

10

remind us that for our annual reports or any kind

11

of reporting we'll include these type of

12

procurement numbers, not just dollar amounts but

13

participation.

14

necessary as part of the transparency to show what

15

we're doing to meet those various goals that are in

16

place.

17

I think that's very helpful and

MR. BEITLER:

Measurement is a very

18

important part.

19

measurement numbers should be yet.

20

help on that, so I will look to you and others to

21

provide me guidance for that.

22
23
24

I'm not exactly sure what all the

CHAIRMAN POPE:

I will need

Wonderful.

Any questions by the Board?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

 45
1

CHAIRMAN POPE:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

David.

Adam, have you or Steve

3

looked at -- First of all, really appreciate that

4

you have someone, Steve, who's diving in on this

5

topic, I think had some experience diving in on

6

this particular policy topic.

7

numbing.

8

know what is best practices, so I think it's a

9

great idea that you got someone who's focused on

10

It can be mind

There's a lot out there, and it's hard to

it.

11

I hadn't seen your resume, Adam, so

12

I appreciate how much experience you bring to this

13

from the corporate world.

14

Have you -- I know they do a lot of

15

Victoria in Australia.

16

that you've looked at as well?

17

MR. HELMAN:

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is that one of the places

Yes.
And Europe as well.

As

19

Rory said, I think that's right.

20

sounds like you're sweeping widely and looking at

21

these places.

22

Although it

One document I would encourage you

23

to look at that, you know, we're -- You're looking

24

to governmental sources, and you're also looking to

 46
1

public/private partnership sources.

2

MR. HELMAN:

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.
When I was a member of the

4

Illinois Reform Commission in 2009 -- And this was

5

an effort to make recommendations to the State on

6

ethics and anti-corruption measures, and one of the

7

six topics we examined and held public hearings on

8

was procurement, and we issued a report that had a

9

variety of findings and recommendations and

10

discussed what experts around the country we had

11

tapped into and what we had found were best

12

practices and obviously a different context

13

because -- Not relating to the kind of specific

14

projects that is our goal, but I would look at that

15

because I think that one context is public/private

16

partnerships, and look around the world for best

17

practices, and another context is that it's

18

happening in Illinois and Chicago, and we have some

19

experience in trying to put in best practices to

20

guard against the kind of manipulation that has

21

happened in the past.

22

I'm highly confident that we're

23

going to put in place the right procedures and that

24

that's not going to be a -- That we're going to be

 47
1

able to manage that process in a good fashion, but

2

I would take a look at that as well.

3

I'd be happy to have other on line

4

discussions with you if you think that would be

5

helpful.

6

product.

7
8

Otherwise, I look forward to reading the

MR. HELMAN:
for the input.

9

Great.

Thanks very much

Absolutely.

MR. BEITLER:

Just to be clear in terms

10

of reading the product, it's going to be an

11

iterative product.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Clearly.

And nor should

13

there be an attempt to only say final, wrapped in a

14

bow.

15

MR. BEITLER:

16

read it more than once.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

CHAIRMAN POPE:

19

22
23
24

Absolutely.
Any other questions,

comments?

20
21

We will be asking you to

(No response.)
Moving on to the next item, the PACE
discussion -- Property Assessed Clean Energy.
MR. BEITLER:

So I don't have an

intention of going through all the materials that

 48
1

are in the book today about PACE.

2

there as a guide for going forward in terms of

3

familiarization for everyone.

4

They're simply

Staff believes that this is an

5

excellent next project.

6

City and are continuing to discuss it with the

7

City.

8
9

We discussed it with the

There seems to be a lot of
opportunity.

There are some issues around PACE

10

because of the fact that it is a property assessed

11

capability.

12

Basically the federal -- Freddie

13

Mae -- Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac have some issues

14

around lien structure and who's first, who's second

15

and so forth in the structure.

16

do this for commercial property and for

17

non-conforming mortgages but have to hold off on

18

residential until legislation is passed in the

19

State legislature.

20

So right now we can

We will look toward creating a

21

program that residential could be done when it's

22

available to do so in this state, but meanwhile

23

we're talking with Chris Meister at the Illinois

24

Finance Authority, and the Trust and the IFA are

 49
1

looking at proceeding jointly on this for the

2

purpose of the Trust proceeding in the City of

3

Chicago and the IFA proceeding in the rest of the

4

State but with the same program.

5

So it's kind of interesting from

6

that perspective particularly for me that it could

7

be a joint program and would have the State and the

8

City behind it, and it could be a very good program

9

for the businesses and the residents of the City

10

when we get everything ironed out and are able to

11

do it for commercial and residential properties.

12

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Stephen, in the

13

information you provided it does show that there's

14

enabling legislation within Illinois, and you

15

reference the work that the State's doing.

16

idea in terms of timetable when they hope to be on

17

line?

18

MR. BEITLER:

I don't know.

Any

It's one of

19

the things that Chris Meister and I will be

20

investigating going forward, and I'll get an answer

21

for you on that question.

22

I believe that Lou Lang has

23

legislation pending at this point, and I haven't

24

read the specific legislation yet.

Although I'm

 50
1

aware of it.

2

order to see about going forward and getting

3

that -- Whatever the City does to get legislation

4

moved on which is part of my future education, but

5

I think it's an excellent program.

6

I have to coordinate with the City in

We are very lucky in that PFM which

7

has provided one of the exhibits in the book is

8

probably the leading firm having done the programs

9

in California and Florida on this particular

10

program, and so we're extremely lucky to be working

11

with PFM already and have them available as a

12

resource for this purpose.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Just to be clear, the

14

legislation that exists in Illinois allows for this

15

kind of program to be used for commercial

16

properties currently?

17

change?

There's no legislative

You could do it --

18

MR. BEITLER:

Let me restate that.

I

19

don't know if there is legislation that exists to

20

allow for commercial or nonconforming.

21

My understanding at this point is

22

simply that commercial and nonconforming are

23

eligible.

24

implementing legislation to make them eligible.

I don't think there's such a thing as

 51
1

Just under the current laws they are eligible.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I guess my point is that

3

if the Infrastructure Trust and IFA went forward

4

with the program you're describing --

5

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, and the City.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

And the City.

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- does there need to be

9
10

State legislation to make that program effective
for commercial properties?

11
12

MR. BEITLER:
at this point.

13
14

MR. HOFFMAN:

MR. MORSCH:

CHAIRMAN POPE:

21

For the record, Tom, can

you introduce yourself for the court reporter?

19
20

No, that -- If you want me

to jump in.

17
18

I'm seeing Tom, your

advisor there, is --

15
16

I can't answer 100 percent

MR. MORSCH:

My name is Tom Morsch with

PFM.
There is -- The State law does allow

22

for deductions of -- What this is is energy

23

improvement projects financed via deduction on your

24

property tax bill.

So just like you have a

 52
1

deduction for your school district, your park

2

district, et cetera, there's another line on the

3

property tax that says energy improvement, so you

4

get that in your home and you pay your tax bill.

5

It pays that bill as well.

6

comfort to financers that your probability of

7

payment is better and drives down the financing

8

cost.

9

Obviously that gives

Where it sits in terms of a lien is

10

this topic of current legislation in Illinois.

11

bankers do not -- Are not very kind of prone to

12

liking people ahead of their mortgage lien and,

13

therefore, there's some resistance from the banking

14

community for residential loans which are packaged

15

and sold to Freddie Mae and Ginnie Mae, et cetera,

16

so that's the issue there.

17

The

But currently the State does have a

18

statute that allows for that deduction.

19

would be instructed by the City to do that

20

deduction, and that can be done today.

21

financeable it is is the topic that we're all

22

working on, and that's where the Trust would come

23

into play.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

The County

How

So assuming for the

 53
1

sake of argument the General Assembly does nothing,

2

this still could go forward as the way you describe

3

it.

4

or feasible is another question.

5

MR. MORSCH:

Whether it ends up being practically effective

Right.

Certainly for

6

commercial and nonconforming which are not loans

7

that are packaged up and sold in the secondary

8

market, that would certainly -- And I see our great

9

labor guy here getting some further advice which

10

would be great.

11

Jump in.

MR. SILVERS:

I think it might be

12

clarifying to note that the problem that you're

13

hearing about is not actually -- It's not a

14

statutory problem.

15

won't -- The GSEs and the banks as private

16

parties -- I'm sorry.

17

Freddie Mac.

18

parties will not agree, as prior lien holders will

19

not agree to the property owner of one of their

20

loans entering into a PACE arrangement currently in

21

the State of Illinois.

22

problem.

23
24

It's the problem that the GSEs

The GSEs are Fannie Mae and

The GSEs and the banks as private

It is a private party

Now I gather that they're trying to
negotiate a legislative solution that will give

 54
1

them comfort but you've got this much -- You've got

2

this other large space in commercial and

3

nonconforming loans that -- Where -- And are

4

non-syndicated.

5

the GSEs, to Fannie and Freddie, where you can do

6

it now, and I would just say that this is something

7

that the labor movement has looked at nationally,

8

the PACE program, and that we're very interested in

9

and I think is something that has a lot of promise.

10

The loans have not been sold to

And the challenge has been -- I

11

think this goes right to the potential role for

12

this institution, the Trust.

13

been to some degree the problem that -- They're

14

cost of capital issues, that it's a new idea and

15

that some of the people who have been involved in

16

trying to put these projects together have not been

17

able to access capital at an appropriate cost given

18

the fact that what you actually have is a tax, is a

19

tax obligation.

20

The challenge has

This institution may be able to help

21

solve that problem.

22

come upon something that's really quite promising

23

and deserves to be, you know, developed.

24

I think the staff has really

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, are these -- The

 55
1

two documents that we were given, the one from PFM

2

and the one from some institute of Johnson

3

Controls, are those public documents?

4

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

The second document

5

is actually from a -- Sort of the PACE

6

organization.

7
8
9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Institute for Building

Efficiency?
MR. BEITLER:

Yeah.

They publish -- I

10

think Johnson Controls sponsors the document

11

through this PACE organization.

12

with the City and our attorneys and the State and

13

the PACE Institute as well as PFM, and we'll

14

eventually come up with a structure hopefully that

15

is appropriate for everybody, makes everybody

16

happy, you know, meets all of whatever the

17

regulatory wicketts are and then whatever the

18

processes are that we need to abide by for the

19

State and the City to go through the legislative

20

process which is something I have to learn.

21

understand it federally but I'm learning locally.

We are working

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Ten minutes.

23

MR. BEITLER:

Ten minutes.

24

know is nothing takes ten minutes.

I

One thing I

 56
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

I was interested in

2

hearing from the City to -- Even if in a

3

preliminary way.

4

whether the City has any views on this, has made

5

any decisions.

6

sure if Lois is still here, but I can't tell

7

whether this is a Trust-driven idea, a City-driven

8

idea, joint, whether the City thinks -- Is on board

9

already, is just trying to decide.

10

MR. WINTERS:

Trying to decide.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Got it.

I just -- I don't have a sense of

I see David and Lois -- I'm not

12

Have there been any significant

13

internal discussions or, you know, meeting for

14

progress on this prior to our bringing this up as a

15

potential --

16

MR. WINTERS:

Not that I'm aware of.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Good.

18

So the City's in

the midst of figuring it out.

19

Not to spend more than a couple

20

minutes on this, but the PFM document was very

21

good, helpful.

22

options.

23
24

At the end you had four funding

If we're talking, Steve, if we're
talking about the -- Steve and Tom, if we're

 57
1

talking about the potential implementation of this

2

idea assuming everyone gets on board, which one of

3

these buckets are we in?

4

defined funding.

5

funding.

6

taxable bonds?

7

described here?
That's a good question,

Dave.
MR. HOFFMAN:
answer.

No need for any further

I feel great now.

12
13

Is it

Is it a different bucket that's not

MR. MORSCH:

10
11

I assume that's not open market

Is this City/County funded?

8
9

Are we in -- There's

MR. BEITLER:

David, we haven't

MR. MORSCH:

You know, obviously

really --

14
15

depending on the level of government sponsorship,

16

and I use that in a very broad statement, will help

17

kind of drive the cost of capital issue that was

18

identified earlier.

19

There is a real opportunity here

20

when you're making loans which effectively this is.

21

It's like any other loan program that a bank would

22

do -- Is that when you make loans you're able to

23

make a lot of loans and, therefore, you diversify a

24

portfolio.

Therefore, you spread risk, and,

 58
1

therefore, you drive down interest costs over time.

2

So there is a real opportunity to

3

potentially create a program like that, especially

4

with, you know, like finance authority which also

5

has access to capital and has access and credit

6

that it could bring to the table to potentially

7

enhance this transaction.

8

What's kind of also interesting

9

about it I think it allows for -- Alderman, you

10

might like this because it allows for projects

11

throughout the City.

12

to a geography, and it is not defined to a

13

commercial district or whatever.

14

something that would be applicable in each and

15

every neighborhood of the City and I think really

16

merits I think everybody's attention here.

17
18

You know, this is not defined

MR. HOFFMAN:

It's really

That's fine.

I'll look

forward to hearing more about it in the future.

19

As reading these four options, it

20

looked like -- As we try to assess what the risk

21

would be to the public, one of my take-aways was it

22

depends on what -- Which of the four buckets you're

23

in.

24

MR. MORSCH:

Sure.

 59
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

It sounds like we don't

2

really know where we are with that yet, so I'll

3

just be -- Part of the way I'll be approaching it

4

is I'll be asking questions about, well, what would

5

the potential risk to the public be, and it sounds

6

like it depends, so I look forward to hearing more

7

about it.

8
9

MR. BEITLER:
out.

We've tried to spell it

We'll address those as we go.

10

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Can I just remind

11

everyone, for the ease of the court reporter, if

12

you're going to speak, just remind us of your name

13

so that she can accurately record that.

14

With that, Marysue.

15

MS. BARRETT:

Marysue Barrett.

16

Question for Tom.

17

studies here, in California and in Florida, did

18

they turn to a legislative fix to get over this

19

lien subordination problem?

20
21

MR. MORSCH:

24

In California they

did, yeah, and they have that legislative.

22
23

Yes.

The PFM case

MS. BARRETT:

And in Florida, was it

needed?
MR. MORSCH:

I don't believe so.

I

 60
1

don't believe so.

And it's directly -- I mean it's

2

really kind of an ease of implementation issue.

3

MS. BARRETT:

4

MR. MORSCH:

Sure.
Otherwise, you have to kind

5

of craft a solution that drives down interest costs

6

given the lien situation, so that's really what's

7

happening.

8

MS. BARRETT:

9

MR. MORSCH:

Thanks.
Again, these programs are

10

about a year old.

There's beginning to be a track

11

record to them, performance record to them.

12

There's beginning to be more market awareness about

13

them, and there's beginning to be kind of a

14

collection of best practices I think that we could

15

bring to the table here for the Trust.

16

CHAIRMAN POPE:

17

questions regarding the PACE program?

18
19
20

(No response.)
All right.

Stephen.

22

MR. BEITLER:

24

Then moving on to the

Retrofit Chicago update.

21

23

Any other comments or

Steve Beitler.

Basically, again, if you look in the
book at that section, it's just one page, so we've

 61
1

received responses to the RFQ from 13 firms.

2

13 firms are listed here.

3

The

Since receiving those responses

4

we've actually had and continue to have meetings

5

with those firms in preparation for presumably

6

producing an RFP, so the City and the Trust have

7

been involved in those meetings.

8

This is sort of where we get to the

9

discussion that we were having earlier in terms of

10

ensuring that the public gets the best deal and the

11

confidentiality of the RFQ and RFP process, and so

12

that's the extent of the information at this point

13

that we can address publicly.

14

From a process standpoint -- And,

15

again, I don't quite understand yet.

As we go

16

through this, we'll have a better understanding of

17

when our sort of, if you will, the fire breaks

18

where information can be released for a point in

19

the process where we're done.

20

points in this process, we will release the

21

information that's appropriate to release to not in

22

any way impact an ongoing procurement.

23

moment this is an ongoing procurement, and we would

24

discuss that in executive session after we finish

As we come to those

At the

 62
1

the public portion of the meeting.

2

CHAIRMAN POPE:

And, Stephen, that was

3

brought up at the last meeting, kind of the

4

timetable here.

5

today or in the next few weeks to this RFQ, what

6

opportunity do they have at this point or is the

7

window closed?

8
9

If a firm wishes to respond say

MR. MORSCH:

I think consistent with

what --

10

CHAIRMAN POPE:

11

MR. MORSCH:

12

Tom.

-- the Board indicated --

Tom Morsch with PFM.

13

-- in the past that we would always

14

consider, you know, proposals as long as they met

15

the basic requirements that are set forth regarding

16

the City and compliance with the economic

17

disclosure statements and other requirements.

18

They simply won't be as ahead of the

19

process as other parties but that's -- We don't

20

want to close that door.

21

CHAIRMAN POPE:

22

MR. BEITLER:

23
24

Very good.

And we will hear more from

Tom later.
CHAIRMAN POPE:

David.

 63
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

In terms of what -- In

2

terms of the public discussion, I know that when we

3

talked about the point of the RFQ before we put it

4

out there, there were two points.

5

sort of more a procurement standpoint, start

6

hearing from specific financial partners about what

7

they would propose and what their interest level

8

was and start to have a discussion with those who

9

are interested but also as a -- More like an RFI to

10

get informed ourselves as to what feedback we were

11

hearing.

12

One was to, from

Without getting into anything that

13

would be more appropriate at the confidential

14

discussion that's sort of partner specific -- And I

15

don't know whether you'll say no.

16

everything to be said in this needs to be discussed

17

confidentially, but to the extent that there can be

18

information discussed publicly about lessons we've

19

learned or feedback we've received from having

20

these discussions -- And I'm looking at Tom in

21

particular but it could be anyone.

22

things that we've heard that have changed our mind

23

on anything about -- Or that have validated that

24

we're on the right track and this is a project

I think

Are there

 64
1

that's likely to receive significant interest and

2

is likely to work?

3

MR. BEITLER:

4

Steve Beitler.

I think really that at this point

5

the purpose of the RFQ was a request for

6

qualification, and there's information in those

7

RFQs that are basically at this point confidential

8

and should not be made known to the other parties

9

that responded to the RFQ, so that unfortunately it

10

isn't an RFI and, therefore, that we should discuss

11

it in executive session and not really discuss it

12

publicly.

13

Frankly, I'm not sure that I

14

understand enough at this point to make those

15

distinctions.

16

to go through with the Board at some point, all the

17

information after the fact and maybe have a

18

postmortem and say, hey, in my opinion, meaning in

19

your opinion, I would have done this differently or

20

I would have done this differently.

21

that differently might have been that we would have

22

had to write the RFQ a little bit differently

23

upfront in order to be able to be responsive to the

24

way you're asking the question at the moment, so I

It would be an interesting exercise

Part of doing

 65
1

have a hard time separating information at the

2

moment between the bid and some of the lessons

3

learned.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me try again.

I'll

5

try to -- More sort of a macro level because I

6

appreciate what you just said, and it makes perfect

7

sense what you said.

8

from the Board perspective was also to seek

9

information and one of the -- And this is -- I'm

10

asking these questions in part to try to provide

11

some information to the public that's appropriate,

12

that's consistent with keeping confidential, what

13

you just said, information gleaned from specific

14

partners.

I do think part of the intent

15

Here's the question.

One thing that

16

the public could potentially conclude from the fact

17

that there were 13 people who responded, entities

18

that responded, was that there's some interest.

19

could have been zero or it could have been one.

20

So, one, is it proper, therefore, to at least

21

conclude in the very general sense that this RFQ

22

appears to be on the right track in terms of

23

receiving some significant interest; that whether a

24

deal will be reached obviously depends on the

It

 66
1

process but that there should be -- There should

2

not be significant pessimism about this because we

3

received significant responses?

4

sort of very general --

5

MR. BEITLER:

Anyway, is that

I would characterize it

6

like this I think:

The Trust is new, and so this

7

is a new experience for the Trust.

8

much older obviously organization and has been

9

doing procurement for a long time.

The City is a

Actually, the

10

City is a very experienced -- One of the most

11

experienced organizations in the United States in

12

terms of doing public/private partnership deals

13

since about 1981 or thereabouts, 1991 or

14

thereabouts.

15

However, the City has not really

16

done a P3 type deal for what we are discussing here

17

in terms of the specific subject of retrofit, you

18

know, putting in new light bulbs or replacing water

19

plants and so on, pumping stations.

20

So one of the things that the RFQ

21

gets to is how to conduct business.

The banks and

22

other financial organizations that have responded

23

to the RFQ have basically suggested that they have

24

more or less let's say standard mechanisms by which

 67
1

they conduct business, and they would like to

2

conduct business within the framework of those

3

standard mechanisms and then get specific about

4

what the standard mechanism is for them.

5

The City -- And I don't want to

6

presume to speak for the City but will just briefly

7

say that the City and the Trust now have to learn

8

what are the standard mechanisms for them.

9

we've talked through all of that and tried to

Until

10

figure that out individually and together, it's

11

kind of hard to answer that question.

12

There's a symbiotic relationship

13

here also.

14

without the City and vice versa.

15

The Trust can't answer that question

Basically we're working through it

16

and don't really have a good answer to that

17

question and I also --

18

MR. BELL:

Let me try, David.

19

CHAIRMAN POPE:

20

MR. BELL:

James.

David, the good news is we

21

got significant response.

You know, we had 13

22

companies that responded, but I think it's fair to

23

say that the RFQ as written will be -- Will need to

24

be modified to some extent.

In some cases, it may

 68
1

be to a large extent.

2

figure that out if we have discussions with them.

3

It just depends, and we will

But we have to work our way through

4

that piece of it, David.

5

there that the way the RFP is currently written

6

will have to change to some degree before the

7

market is going to be receptive to the retrofit

8

project.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Clearly the response

That's very helpful.

I

10

see Tom raising his hand.

11

Mr. Chairman, it would be great to hear from him

12

too.

13

CHAIRMAN POPE:

14

MR. MORSCH:

If you don't mind,

Tom.

We'll talk about some of

15

the details in executive session, but for the more

16

public part, I guess your question was about -- I

17

would echo James' comments.

18

good, and the parties are engaged in active

19

discussions and will be with us, and we are moving

20

forthwith with a very determined and deliberate

21

schedule to get to a point of making

22

recommendations back to you at the Trust on how and

23

whether to proceed, so I think that's encouraging.

24

I would agree with James.

Thirteen responses is

 69
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

CHAIRMAN POPE:

3

MS. BARRETT:

4

Thank you.
Marysue.

Marysue Barrett.

I also want to connect the

5

discussion about Retrofit Chicago responses back to

6

our earlier review of the table of contents of the

7

procurement manual.

8
9

We heard several comments about how
this is going to need to be a living document as we

10

learn from each experience, but once the

11

procurement manual is sketched out -- I think

12

another perspective that's very important for this

13

group is its value as far as, you know, squeezing

14

maximum benefit at lowest cost of standardization.

15

We don't have that today.

16

we've got, but we'll learn from this, improve the

17

procurement manual, and that will have economic

18

benefits both to the public and to the operations

19

in the future that I think is going to be very

20

valuable and it will make this -- You know, we'll

21

have answers to some of these questions from

22

experience in the future.

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

We're working with what

To amplify that, I also

think that it will answer some of the questions

 70
1

from a Board interaction standpoint and a public

2

interaction standpoint.

3

the procurement manual.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

5

CHAIRMAN POPE:

6

We'll spell those out in

Thank you.

regarding Retrofit Chicago?

7

(No response.)

8
9

Any other comments

All right.

Moving on to the next

item, Opportunity for Public Comment.

10

MR. BEITLER:

Mr. Chairman, if we may,

11

one individual Allan Mellis has submitted an

12

unsolicited project which was very interesting, and

13

so I would ask that you ask him to discuss his

14

project.

15

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Allan, could you come to

16

the front and, first of all, introduce yourself and

17

provide a brief summary of your proposal?

18

MR. MELLIS:

Mr. Chairman and members of

19

the Committee, my name is Allan Mellis, and I've

20

been a Lincoln Park community leader for over 35

21

years.

22

planning and development for the Forest Preserve

23

District of Cook County where I first met Alderman

24

Pope and a 30-year IBM employee.

I am retired, the former director of

Also, I was the

 71
1

former president of the Friends of the Fullerton El

2

and a member of the CTA Brown Line Task Force.

3

I do feel comfortable being in this

4

room since both my sons graduated from the Illinois

5

Math and Science Academy, so thank you.

6

For a long time I've had the idea of

7

a monorail that would connect the Roosevelt CTA

8

Superstation, the Red, Green and Orange Lines, with

9

the lakefront amenities of the Field Museum, Shedd

10

Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Northerly Island and

11

Soldier Field, and you have very much home drawn

12

map in your handout of that route.

13

Three events have encouraged me to

14

come here today to suggest this potential

15

infrastructure project.

16

a natural environmentally sensitive restoration of

17

Northerly Island but with the requirement that many

18

people get there by driving their automobiles to

19

enjoy nature.

20
21
22

One, seeing the plans for

Two, the call for big ideas from the
Chicago Tourism Group to Chicago.
And, three, the expansion of the

23

Charter One Pavilion at Northerly Island that was

24

presented at the last Chicago Planning Commission

 72
1

hearing.

2

I testified in favor of the proposal

3

but was concerned about access.

4

promoters echoed my concerns about access.

5

The Charter One

I am submitting a brief outline of

6

my ideas in the hope that the Infrastructure Trust

7

Committee will consider this project.

8

financial interest in this suggestion.

9

I have no

I just hope that it will provide an

10

environmentally friendly access to our lakefront

11

attractions and bring more tourists and residents

12

to the area.

13

A successful implementation of this

14

project will hopefully lead to other projects like

15

a monorail connecting the CTA Grand Avenue Subway

16

Stations with Navy Pier.

17

Thank you for your consideration.

18

know this is something new and I know I've only

19

been to the first meeting but I hope that you do

20

solicit -- I have no financial interest.

21

gone and done any kind of studies like everyone

22

here does.

23
24

I

I haven't

I'm not an expert in this.
I just think it's a good idea.

I've

been talking to people for a long time, and maybe

 73
1

this group is one that can get this going along

2

with maybe the new tourism group that was formed.

3

Thank you very much.

4

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Allan, a quick question.

5

So your proposal assumes that the public way would

6

just be utilized for this monorail?

7

MR. MELLIS:

8

CHAIRMAN POPE:

9

Yes.
And strictly electric

powered?

10

MR. MELLIS:

I believe it is, yeah.

I

11

mean it would be environmentally friendly.

That's

12

why I added -- There's a couple of things that were

13

from the Monorail Society which I have no idea what

14

they are -- They're on the web -- that answered

15

some of those questions.

16

CHAIRMAN POPE:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

questions, but I would thank you.

19

praise and encouragement for bringing this forward

20

to us.

21

I don't have any
I would give you

You know more about this than I do.

22

MR. MELLIS:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

Any questions?

Not much.
I don't have any way of

assessing it, but I think that from a broader

 74
1

standpoint the -- And Steve and I have discussed

2

this, and I know Steve feels exactly the same way,

3

is very strongly on board on this -- The idea that

4

we are -- Can serve as a vehicle to encourage these

5

kinds of proposals to come forward whether from

6

experts or members of the general public which is

7

really important both because we -- Neither we nor

8

our experts will have a monopoly on the best ideas,

9

so you never know where the best idea is going to

10

come from.

11

And also just from the value of

12

participatory -- Of being a participatory

13

institution.

14

important as well, so we've talked about in the

15

future there may be some easy mechanism through the

16

web site for citizens to propose things.

17

Citizens can participate is really

It will be up to Steve and the staff

18

to sort of assess whether they're good or bad and

19

then to talk with the City about them.

20

So I thank you for coming.

Thank

21

you for presenting this to us, and I hope that we

22

see more of these from members of the public.

23

MR. MELLIS:

Thank you for listening.

24

CHAIRMAN POPE:

Thank you, Allan.

 75
1

Appreciate it.

2

MR. BEITLER:

So if I may.

3

CHAIRMAN POPE:

4

MR. BEITLER:

Please.

On behalf of the Board, I

5

will ensure that we respond to Mr. Mellis and

6

coordinate his idea which will be the first time we

7

are going to go through a process to do this and

8

see how it works and get back to him to -- With a

9

response eventually.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

As we've discussed and

11

James and I and others I think have discussed at

12

length, you know, we are not part of the City

13

government, but, on the other hand, obviously the

14

point is to be doing infrastructure projects that

15

relate to the City of Chicago government.

16

Knowing the City's views initial,

17

and they may change, but knowing the City's views

18

is obviously a critical important early step.

19

know, nothing's monolithic, and so if you think

20

that there's a great idea on something and you're

21

getting resistance from the City, I would, you

22

know, encourage you to continue pushing with them

23

seeing if they can be persuaded, and maybe they're

24

right, maybe they're not.

You

 76
1

I think that dynamic, public trust

2

and City dynamic of discussion, will end up being,

3

could end up being one of the great engines of

4

innovation for us, so I would want to encourage it

5

as much as possible.

6

MR. BEITLER:

I think I should say at

7

this point that the City has been nothing but

8

supportive and extraordinarily helpful in my

9

whopping 43 days on the job so far and nothing but

10
11

encouraging.
I think that the City is getting

12

used to the idea that we've become more active in

13

figuring out for itself how to interact with a

14

trust that is more active, but I don't think

15

there's anything negative about that.

16

that's all a positive, and I think that we're in

17

the process, the Trust and the City, of figuring

18

out how to interact with each other, and we'll

19

continue to develop that and now have a case study.

20

Again, the procedures that we develop will

21

formalize a lot of that.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

CHAIRMAN POPE:

24

I think

Thank you.
Steve, certainly feel

free to use me and my position as we've met and

 77
1

spoken many times.

2

communication.

3

We can facilitate some

MR. BEITLER:

I think the City

4

Council -- When I say the City, I certainly -- And

5

I guess I'm not sure again what's proper, but

6

meaning the City and the City Council as partners.

7

CHAIRMAN POPE:

8
9

Any other public comment?
(No response.)

At this point we are going to

10

executive session and we're going to utilize this

11

room, so we're going to ask members of the public

12

to please excuse us.
