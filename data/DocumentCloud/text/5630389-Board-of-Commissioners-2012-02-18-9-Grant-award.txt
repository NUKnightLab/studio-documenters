BACKGROUND AND EXPLANATION
In January 2010, the CHA was awarded a two year $250,000 award from ICJIA through the Edward
Byrne Recovery Act Grant Program. The purpose of the funding was to implement community based
youth violence prevention through Gang Resistance Education and Training (“G.R.E.A.T.”) and the
Youth Courts. The Altgeld-Riverdale Consortium (ARC) Partnership created a community partnership
and increased resident awareness of violence prevention at community schools. In 2012, CHA was
invited to apply for leftover ICJIA – Byrne Recovery Act Grant Program funds to continue and enhance
the ARC Partnership Program. On December 11, 2012, the CHA received official written notice of an
award of $282,200 from the ICJIA through the Edward Byrne Recovery Act Grant Program. CHA was
required to provide matching funds of $94,067 (mostly in-kind). CHA was invited a second time to
apply for leftover ICJIA – Byrne Recovery Act Grant Program funds to continue the enhanced work
accomplished in 2013 through the ARC Partnership Program. A grant application was submitted listing
CHA's subgrantees, the services that will be provided and their proposed budgets. On December 10,
2013, the CHA received official written notice of a third award of $335,051 from the ICJIA through the
Edward Byrne Recovery Act Grant Program. CHA is required to provide matching funds of $111,684
(mostly in-kind).

programming during the 2014 academic school year and over the summer.
The Community Justice for Youth Institute (CJYI) Peace Circles: - a structured dialogue process
that allows every participant an opportunity to speak and that encourages attentive listening and truth
telling to resolve conflicts, to provide victims with opportunities to directly address those that have
harmed them, and to involve the community in the process of strengthening relationships and
promoting offender accountability. Both youth and adult community stakeholders will participate in
Circle Keeper training programs, led by CJYI staff.
Roseland CeaseFire Project: - will leverage its work in the 5th Police District and analyze crime hot
