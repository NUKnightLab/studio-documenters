Analysis

Action

• Department is at
compliance
• Limited data for LSH
due to staffing
shortages and
reduced outpatient
visits

• Continue to
emphasize the
patient experience
with staff.
• Implement measures
to improve survey
response rate

Questions

Purpose /Goal
• Ensure that IP and OP
OT/PT/LSH staff
document appropriately to
meet regulatory and
reimbursement.
• 90% or greater on all items
measured

Items Measured
1. G-Code included on evaluation
2. G-Code included on 10th visit,
when applicable (N/A for LSH
ever)
3. Code included on re-evaluation
4. G-Code included on discharge
5. G-Code improvement noted with
Rx
6. Power Bill with Correct G-Codes

Analysis

Action

• Department has not consistently
met benchmark
• Certain services have limited
follow up visits so item doesn’t
apply.
• Few patients have 10 visits.
Therefore, a miss has a
disproportional effect

• Implemented training
for newly assigned staff
