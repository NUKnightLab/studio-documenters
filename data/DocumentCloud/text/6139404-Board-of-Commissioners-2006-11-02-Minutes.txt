Ordinance to include specific minority and women participation goals in construction contracts; and
WHEREAS, the affinnative action program for construction projects set goals of 30% minority owned
participation and I 0% women owned participation on all County construction projects in order to remedy
ongoing discrimination and the effects of past discrimination against women and members of minority
groups, so as not to be a passive participant in such discrimination; and
WHEREAS, this program as it relates to construction projects was declared unconstitutional in Builders
Association of Greater Chicago v. Cook County, 123 F.Supp.2d 1087 (N.D. Ill. 2000), and a pennanent

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006
Section 34-288. Findings of Discrimination. The President and the Board of Commi ssioners of the
County of Cook, after considering (i) evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater
Chicago v. City of Chicago, 298 F.Supp.2d 725 (N.D. Ill. 2003) and Northern Contracting, Inc. v. lllinois
Department of Transportation, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19868 (N.D. 111. Sept. 8, 2005); (ii) County
statistical evidence of continuing discrimination against Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and women in the
County's contracting awards; (iii) the Report title, " Review of Compelling Evidence of Discrimination
Against Minority-and Women-Owned Business Enterprise in the Chicago Area Construction Industry and
Recommendations for Narrowly Tailored Remedies for Cook County, Illinois;" as well as (iv) anecdotal
evidence of discrimination against minorities and women in the County's construction marketplace; and
(v) receiving and considering written reports, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence
supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative action program in County construction contracting:
(a) The County of Cook seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all prime Contractors
and subcontractors to participate in County construction contracting opportunities;
(b) Since the County's affirmative action program as it relates to construction projects was declared
unconstitutional in 2000, the County has witnessed a drastic reduction in MJWBE construction prime
contract and subcontract participation;
(c) The County has engaged in committee hearings in which the County has heard anecdotal evidence of
discrimination in the construction industry, has commissioned a study on the levels of M/WBE
participation in County contracts, has reviewed the Report prepared indicating evidence of discrimination
in County construction contracts and has considered the evidence in relevant case law;
(d) In the absence of M/WBE participation goals the County has witnessed a drastic decline in M/WBE
participation in its construction contract below the availability of such finns and thus would be a passive
participant in a discriminatory marketplace without the use of such M/WBE goals;
(e) The County has a compelling interest in preventing discrimination; and
(f) The County desires to reaffinn its commitment to full and fair opportunities for all finns to participate
in its construction contracts.
Section 34-289. Public Purpose. It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this
Interim Ordinance is to take steps to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority- and WomenOwned Business Enterprises in the County's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the
County's construction contracts. The County is committed to a policy of preventing discrimination in the
award of or participation in construction contracts and has recommended appropriate affinnative action
steps to be taken to eliminate any such discrimination.
Section 34-290. Applicability. This Ordinance shall apply to all construction contracts funded in whole
or in part by County fund s, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any contract with
respect to which a goal for Minority-Owned Business Enterprise or Women-Owned Business Enterprise
participation is inconsistent with or prohibited by state or federal law shall be exempt ftom the goals
included in this Ordinance.
Section 34-291. Severability. If any section, subsection, clause or provision of this Ordinance is held to
be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Ordinance shall not be affected by
such invalidity.

Section 34-295. Program eligibility.
(a) Only businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a MBE or WBE may participate in the
Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b) Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified as a
MB Eor WBE.
( I) The firm' s ownership by a Social ly and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro Jonna ownership of the finn as reflected in ownership
documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and
profits commens urate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantia l. If Expertise is relied upon as part
of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise
must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas criti cal to the finn's
operations, indispensable to the finn's potential success, specific to the type of work the finn perfonns
and documented in the finn 's records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a
commensurate finan cial investment in the firm.
(c) Only a fim1 that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s)
may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(I) A firm must not be subject to any formal or infonnal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions
through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other fom1al or infom1al devices
that prevent the Socia lly and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of
any non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the
firm, including the making of obligations or the di spersing of fund s.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owncr(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the finn and to make day-to-day as well as longterm decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

11

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEM BER 2, 2006

(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the tinn to persons who are not Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged. Such d elegations of authority must be revocabl e, and the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and tire any such person. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise control over the finn's operations, work,
management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding
of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the firm's
operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disad vantaged owner(s) must have the ability to
intelligently and critically evaluate infonnation presented by other participants in the tinn's activities and
to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.
(5) If federa l, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of tinn, then the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law,
County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not req uire that the owner posses the license or
credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a fac tor, but is not dispositive, in
detennining whether the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the finn.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in o utside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs o f the tinn to manage and control its day to day acti vities.
(d) Only an independent tinn may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another finn. Recognition of an applicant as a separate
entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a finn is independent
and non-Affiliated. In detennining whether an applicant is an independent business, the Director will:
( I) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Finns in such areas as personnel, fac ilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Finns or persons associated
with non-Certified Finns compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Finns to determine whether a pattern
of excl usive or primary dealings with non-Certified Finn compromises the applicant's independence.
(4 ) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with
normal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified only for specifi c types of work in which the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm' s operations and
work.
(f) The County shall certify the el igibility of Joint Ventures invol ving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified
Finns.
(g) In lieu of conducti ng its own certificati ons, the Director by rule may accept fonnal certifications by
other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the Director detennines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.

12

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified Finn to notify the Director of any change in its circumstances
affecting its continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the finn's decertification.
U) The Director shall decertify a finn that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k) The Director may move to decertify a Certified Finn that repeatedly fai ls to respond to requests for
quotations from bidders/proposers who timely solicit participation on a contract, attend relevant pre-bid
conferences, honor quotations in good faith, or otherwise comply with Program requirements.
(I) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County.
The challenged finn shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.
(m) A finn that has been denied certification or recerti fi cation or has been decertified may protest the
denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(n) A firm fou nd to be inel ig ible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the effective date
of the final decision.
(o) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Finn as
provided by rule. The presumption that the challenged finn is eligible shall remain in effect until the
County renders a final decision.

Section 34-296. Annual Aspirational Goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County construction contracts
and subcontracts shall be 24% for MBEs and 4% for WBEs.

Section 34-297. Project Specific Goals.
The Director, in consultation with the User Department shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perfom1 the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
d ate.

Section 34-298. Counting MBE and WBE Participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is perfom1ed by the MBEs or WBEs own forces
shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work
of the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and
equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor' s
Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical , consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifica lly required for the perfonnance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customari ly charged for similar services.
(c) When a MBE or WBE perfonns as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar
value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's
contract that is perfonned by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk,
shall be counted.

13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

(d) Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be
counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is perfonning a Commercially Useful Function, the
County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE
or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and
other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determin ing
quality and quantity, ordering the material , installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. )fa MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work ofa contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be perfonning a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certi fied Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for simi lar services.

(f) If a firm ceases to be a certified during its perfonnance on a contract, the dollar value of work
perfonncd under a contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In detennining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amo unt has been paid to the MBE or WBE.

Section 34-299. Contract Pre- Award Compliance Procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Uti lization Plan detailing all subcontractors
from which the Contracto r solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been
establi shed, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Util ization Plan shall be
due at the time set out in the solicitation documents.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor req uires that the
MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the Director will determine whether
the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the
Director will consider, at a minimum. the Contractor' s efforts to:
(I) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MB Es and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the
contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information
about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to
the solicitation. The C ontractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MB Es and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking
out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even
when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the
Contractor"s respons ibility to make a port ion of the work available to MB Es and WBEs and to select
those portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availabi lity MB Es and WBEs to facil itate
their participation.

14

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a
description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for
subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may
not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation
of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in findi ng and using MBEs and
WBEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's fai lure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as
long as such costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perfonn the work of a contract
with its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility 10 make Good Faith Efforts on a ll
subcontractable scopes of work.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obta ining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compl iance, available minority/women community
organi zations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(e) In detennining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the perfonnance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fa il s to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.

(t) A sig ned letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or
services lo be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due
as spec ified in the solicitation documents.
(g) The Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and
the letters of intent from MB Es and WBEs. The Director may request clarification in writing of items
listed in the Utilization Plan, provi ded such clarification shall not include the o pportun ity to augment
listed participation or Good Faith Efforts .
(h) If the Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have
been ach ieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the Director and
User Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(i) If the Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the Director shall
communicate this find ing to the User Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.

Section 34-300. Contract Administration Procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific
Goals become covenants ofp erfonnance by the Contractors in favor of the County.

15

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

(b) The Contractor shall provide a listi ng of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the
contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to
the County or as otherwi se directed by the County. The Director and the User Department shall monitor
subcontractor partic ipation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely
access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax returns and
records and books of account, to detennine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and
WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE perfonning any portion of the contract. This
provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the
Contractor's record s by any officer or o ffi cial of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in
the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this Ordinance and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause tennination of the
executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or s ubj ect the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions.
( I) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE o r WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan s hall be made to the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and
shall clearly and full y set forth the basis fo r the request. A Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department approve such substitution in
writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the Director,
Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the s ubstitution.
(2) The facts s upporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utili zation Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The
Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has
been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the M BE o r WBE can be substituted only where
an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonabl e price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of perfonnance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.
(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
( v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where
agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the s ubcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontracto r's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The County's final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis
of any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Util ization Plan. The Contractor may
seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project
Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute
with a non-Certi fi ed Fim1.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE s ubcontractor listed in the Utilization
Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to ful fi ll the Utilization Plan. The Contractor
may seek the assistance of the Offi ce of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE
subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, th e Contractor
may substitute wi th a non-Certified Finn.

16

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDrNGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in
the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Director to modify the Utilization Plan
and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WB Es have a fair opportunity to bid on the
new scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they ari se, to
establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.

(f) Prior to contract closeout, the Director shall eval uate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted
goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, tenninations and changes to the contract's scope of
work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not
made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or
violation of this Ordinance, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.

Section 34-301. Sanctions and Penalties.
(a) The following violations of this Ordinance may res ult in a breach of contract:

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 2, 2006

Reason:

These vendors provide services to nonviolent, adult criminal offenders deemed elig ible for
participation in the drug treatment court program. Contract services will include substance
abuse assessment, random drug screening, group and individual counseling, residential
treatment, health education and aftercare services. Services are combined with close court
supervision to help participants return to the community as self-sufficient, productive citizens.
The majority of the proposed vendors have been providing contract services to the program
since 1999. A II vendors were selected for their experience in drug intervention services and
for the locations of the service sites. The amendment is due to the decreased amount of the
original contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $550,000.00. Contract period: January I, 2007 through December 3 1, 2007.
(532-272 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 fund s.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to amend and renew the requested contracts. The motion carried unanimously.

Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance, responded that the changes would not
affect the County 's bond rating.
Commissioner Hansen inquired about the contents ofGASB Statement No. IO.
Jeff Sirkin, representing ARM Tech, a subsidiary of Aon Corporation, responded that the reference to
GASB Statement No. I 0 in the Actuarial Analysis was standard language to assure that federal guidel ines
were followed in preparing the report.
Mr. G laser stated that he could not quote from memory the exact specifics of GASB Statement No. I 0,
but that it had to have been released some years ago because the most recent GASB statements number in
the fifties.
Commissioner Hansen observed that the Actuarial Analysis contains a footnote referring to GASB
Statement No. I 0, but he is not familiar with the statement and this prompted his line of inquiry regarding
what GASB Statement No. I 0 is.
A representative of Commissioner Hansen' s staff then provided the Committee with a copy of GASB
Statement No. I0.

days after the above collection procedures have been fo llowed will be deemed
uncollectable and shall be reviewed by the Sheriff's Office for submission to the
Cook Countv Board of Commissioners for the Board' s approval to write-off the
uncollected fees as bad debt. On an annual basis. the aggregate of all past due
accounts of$100 or less wi ll be examined to detcnnine if any individual debtor

7)
All past due fees greater than $100 but less than $500 that remain
uncollected after completion of steps one through five above will be forwarded to
a licensed collection agency for collection action, with said agency billing
reasonable and customary fees to the County for its services upon collection.
pursuant to a contract approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
provided that the collection agency shall perfom1 no legal services nor hold itself
out as an attorney when engaging in collection activities pursuant to this
paragraph. If the agency determines an account is uncollectable. such account
shall be reviewed by the C hief Financial Officer of the Sheriff' s Office for
possible secondary placement with another collection agency pursuant to a

submission to the Cook Countv Board of Commissioners for the Board's
approval to write-off the uncollected fees as bad debt.

Vice Chairman Goslin asked if a representati ve from the State's Attorney's Office could provide an
explanation of the proposed amendment.
Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy C hiet~ Civil Action Bureau, State's Attorney's O ffice, stated the follow ing: the
new language essentially clarifies the Sheriff's procedures in attempting to collect deli nquent fees. and it
clarifies the Board's role in ultimately detennining whether or not to write-off bad debt in all cases.
Finally, it clarifies the State's Attorney's role in collecting bad debt and also provides the various stages
at which different escalati ng procedures wi ll kick in. The State's Attorney's Office assisted in draft ing
the amendment and determined that it is consistent with other policies within the County and with current
law in this area.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON COOK COUNTY TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC
HEARING ON THE FINDINGS CONTAINED IN THE HEA LTH POLICY
REPORT BY NORTHWESTERN UN IVERSITY R EGARDING THE COOK
COUNTY HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
WHEREAS, the Institute o f Health Care Studies at Northwestern University, after a six
month analys is, released a report detailing the challenges confronting the Cook County
Bureau of Health Services; and
WHEREAS, according to the report, the Cook County health care system is fa cing an
impending crisis, and it will require the leadership, creativity, and the attention of the
broader community to overcome the challenges ahead; and
WHEREAS, decreases in reimbursements from the state Medicaid program, increases in
the number of the uninsured , an o ver-emphasis on patronage and politics, and perpetual
budget problems require the Cook County Bureau of Health Services to refocus its
priorities.
NOW, THEREFORE, B E IT RESOLVED, that the Health and Hospitals Committee
and the Finance Committee shall jointly hold a public hearing on the findings indicated in
the Health Policy Report authored by Northwestern Uni versity within 30 days of passage.
NOTE: This item was also referred to the Committee on Finance.
(Sec Comm. No. 281392).
*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 09/07/06.
Chainn an Butler asked for leave of the body so that the Committee would hear from presenters of the
Health Policy Report, followed by the registered public speakers.
Dr. Whitney W. Addington, President, Otho S. A. Sprague Memorial Institute, began by stating that the
Sprague Memorial Institute is a 95 year old not-for-profit philanthropic charitable organization. When
the opportunity arose to fund the study fo r Cook County, it was carefull y co nsidered and agreed to go
ahead with the study. Dr. Addington fu rther stated that the Sprague Memorial Institute is very pleased
with the results of the report, which is the product of Patricia Terrell and Kevin Weiss.
Dr. Addington stated that the report will detail the crisis that the system is facing. The hospi ta l
desperately needs professional input. In the report one of the first things called for is an independent
·'Blue Ribbon Commi ssion•· that contains c ivic leaders and others to help the County fa ce the challenges
that lie ahead.
Patricia R. Terrell, Principal , Health Management Associates, explained the process of the report to the
commissioners. She stated that there were several review groups made up of local leaders in Chicago
which met to g o over the report and brought back comments, and also a national group of health policy
and public hospital individuals were brought in to review the report and give feedback. During the course
of creating the report she stated that they met with most of the commissioners.

156

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEM BER 2, 2006

In regards to the key find ings Ms. Terrell stated that they were asked to do the report because Terrence
Conway, Principal, Health Management Associates and she for the past fo ur years have been involved in
public systems througho ut the country. Further, Ms. Terrell stated that Cook County is the best public
system in the country, b ut that it has challenges that could knock it off that pedestal. Other communities
have started looking at bringing in other healthcare providers to fig ure out how to meet the challenges o f
double-dig it inflation.
Ms. Terrell stated that there are huge challenges facing the Cook County Bureau of Health Services. In
conclusion, Ms. Terrell stated that the purpose of the report was to point out major strategic priorities for
the County Board, the Bureau of Health Services and even more important for the civic community. The
issue of the Cook County Bureau of Health services is a civic communi ty problem, not just a County
Board problem or just a Bureau of Health Services problem.
Terrence Conway, Principal, Health Management Associates, stated the following: A number o f other
Counties have begun addressing the financing and are ahead of the game; but they still face a challenge.
Mr. Conway stated that there needs to be explicit planning and creative financing because this is a civic
problem. There needs to be an approach to h uman resources where you can bring in individuals who are
the best at certain things, for example, internally in fi nances and infom1ation systems. The Cook County
Bureau of Health is fi nding out that they are behi nd in billing and a number o f other things; so the
individuals who are in charge need to be the best.
Further, Mr. Conway stated that the public health system is the only place in town for specialty care.
President Steele stated: In addition to the Health Policy Report by orthwestem University, s he has
called into place a transition team of approximately 60 individuals and many who brokeoff into a Bureau
o f Health Committee and were charged with looking at operations, finances and looking at how our
people serve our patients. The transition team did an in depth study, which she believes Northwestern
University was not able to obtain a lot of infonnation for their repo rt. Each department head in the
Bureau of Health Services was notified that such a committee was in place and that they were to
cooperate. The transiti on team came back with short and long term recommendatio ns; and of course, the
operational aspect of the report certainly points o ut that the Bureau of Health Services can do better and
should do better. The Bureau does not capture the revenues that the Bureau can capture. In conclusion
President Steele stated that she gave the complete report of the transition team at her meeting of
September 28, 2006, which included much more then she stated at this time.

WRITTEN STATEMENT ONLY

John Kohlhepp - Representing Byron Hobbs, President of Local 20 of the Service Employees
International Union

Chairman Butler stated that he has been elevated by most o f the speakers at today's meeting. What is
happening is that this mantra that the hospital is poorly run and that most of the workers are from the 8th
Ward has s pread all over the system; ifthe County is going to change what is going on in this County as it
relates to the Bureau of Health Services, everyone must stop knocking it and start lifting it up.
Chairman Butler read a statement from a letter from the State's Attorney·s Office: "'The budget shortfall
has been caused in large part by lower-than-projected revenues and issues related to the healthcare
service.'· Chairman Butler stated that this statement might be true, but he would have expected from the
State's Attorney"s Omce what his department can do relative to the 10% across the board budget cut or
what the Sherifr s Office might do, because they all said that they can't do it and they arc not go ing to do
it. Further, Chainnan Butler stated that the Bureau of Health Services does not have a court order
standing behind it, so they are the easy pick. In conclusion Chairman Butler stated that thi s issue needs to
be addressed.

Chairman Butler recessed the meeting until October 4, 2006 at 10:00 A.M.

*Approved at the Real Estate Subcommittee 10/25/06.
Vice Chaim1an Goslin asked the Secretary to the Board to read the notice into the record.
Kiran V. Patel, P.E., Engineer V, Highway Department, stated that two outside license-certified
appraisers were hired. The first appraiser reported the compensation value of the above-mentioned
property as being $59,300.00. The second appraiser reported the compensation value of the abovementioned property as being $92,000.00.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced concern regarding the second appraisal.
Mr. Patel replied that the first appraisal didn ' t assign any value of compensation for the paved road. The
second apprai sal's cost was completed six months later and included the paved road.
Commissioner Maldo nado noted that the County has an ordinance in effect requiring two license-certified
appraisals for sale of properties owned by the County. Further, he inquired as to why a review appraisal
was required.
Mr. Patel replied that the Highway Department is following the Illinois Department o f Transportation's
procedures. These procedures stipulate that when a property has been apprai sed and the second appraisal
yields a higher value of compensation, then it would require a review appraisal. The review appraiser
would be sent out to review the property and assess the compensated value difference.
Commissioner Gom1an asked who is acquiring the property.
Mr. Patel stated the Co ok County Highway Department is purchasing the property; and that the
jurisdiction of the property will be transferred to the Village of Northbrook.
Vice Chainnan Goslin stated the Village of Northbrook would like to acquire the property with a spotless
title.

Commissioner Corman, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of Communication
No. 280252. The motion ca rried.

A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING DIREC T AIR SERV IC E FROM WASHINGTON, DC TO
BEIJING, C HI NA AND THE UNITED AIRLINES' APPLICATION FOR NEW ROUTE
AUTHOR ITY FROM THE U.S. DE PARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT) control s international aviation routes and
just recently requested domestic air carriers to submit proposa ls to service a new U.S. - China route.
United Airlines has applied to provide the first daily, non-stop service between Washington, DC and
Be ijing, two of the most important capital cities in the world; and
WHEREAS, Washington, DC is the largest U.S. metro politan area without service to China. The
Washington metropolitan region is the nation· s fourth largest and the fastest-growing. A Beijing fl ight
through Dulles International Airport would serve almost 30% o f the total U.S. - China travel market and
fi ll a key gap in air service to China from the East Coast beyond New York. Twenty-eight leading world
capitals includi ng London, Paris, Tokyo, Moscow and Delhi connect directly to Beijing; and
WHEREAS. United 's proposal to launch the first and only nonsto p service between these two critical
capital c ities will not o nly fill an inexcusable air service gap, but it will also bridge a critical geopol itical
divide, affording new opportunities for face-to-face contact, improved trade and better diplomatic
relations; and
WHEREAS, United will make use o f scarce U.S. - China air rights and o ile r direct service to Beijing
with the largest aircraft in operation, the B747-4 00, thereby providing at least 20% more available seats
on every flight than any other U.S. airl ine; and
WHEREAS, United has demonstrated a comm itment to serving China for more than two decades, and
has invested in developing an unparalleled network of convenient China serv ice from U.S. and
international travelers - today connecting both Ch icago and San r:rancisco to China's two most important
markets - Beij ing and Shanghai; and
WHEREAS, increasing access to China for maj or American economic centers and particularly Illinoisbased manu facturing companies wi ll improve the national economy and Cook County's economy as well:
and
WHEREAS, as home to United Airlines and its 16,000-strong workforce, northeastern Illinois has
bene fited greatly fro m United 's comm itment to o ur region and the support it provides to our economy.
This Capital-to-Capital air route is important to the success of United and will help maintain the strength
and vibrancy of the company both here and around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of C ommissioners of Cook County docs
hereby strongly urge the U.S. Department of Transportation to select United Airlines fo r this important
