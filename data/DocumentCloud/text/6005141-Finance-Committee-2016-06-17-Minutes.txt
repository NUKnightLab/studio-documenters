III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, May 20, 2016
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved to accept the
minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of May 20, 2016. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Charles Jones, Director of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration.
Mr. Jones provided information regarding those contracts that are approved pending review by Contract Compliance.
He stated that those contracts do not move forward until they are found to be responsive to the County’s Ordinance
regarding minority and women-owned business enterprise goals. For those contracts approved as pending review by
Contract Compliance, the Board Secretary will not provide the stamped Board approval for processing and execution
of the contract until the letter from Contract Compliance is received confirming the vendor’s responsiveness to the
County’s Ordinance.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 10, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract. This vendor has carried the
patent for the INOmax delivery system for nitrous oxide; that patent was recently renewed for twenty-five (25) years,
so they are the only provider of this particular product.
With regard to request number 13, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract, because the vendor is the
owner/proprietor of the Lawson ERP system used here; this contract allows for the provision of maintenance
continuation for the Supply Chain and Finance Departments.
With regard to request number 14, Mr. Jones stated that this is a sole source contract for maintenance and support of
existing equipment in the pharmacy.
With regard to request number 15, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, noted that this is a sole source
contract because this vendor is the only provider of this particular product.
Director Richardson-Lowry commented regarding contract extensions. She stated that, since her arrival to the Board,
she has noticed that there seems to be a pattern, both in terms of procurement of specific items, as well as some of the
facility components, of the need for contract extensions. In her fiduciary capacity, when she sees a pattern repeated,
month over end, it tends to indicate either a planning opportunity loss, or a situation of not charting out the scheduled
close date of a contract and listing and obtaining alternative services in a manner which avoids extensions. Once the
Board and leadership are past the strategic planning activities and some of the summertime objectives, she would like
to respectfully see a report on leadership’s strategy to avoid some of the extensions or lengthy cost extensions which
have, on occasion, had a tendency to drive up cost.
With regard to the subject of Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) and local hires goals,
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that there is a need for full disclosure for these contracts; that information needs to
be included in the document so it is part of the record. Dr. Shannon stated that, as it relates to the process, as the
Committee goes through these requests, some of them are approved in the Finance Committee and at the Board level
pending completion of review by Contract Compliance. He did not think that the final information for all requests is
known until after not only the Finance Committee, but after the full Board has voted on it. This is something that can
be compiled on a quarterly or semi-annual basis, if that is acceptable. Director Richardson-Lowry responded
affirmatively.
Chairman Estrada stated that he is still working out the details, but another piece of information that will be
incorporated in the requests over the next couple of months will relate to timing and budget - understanding how much
time has elapsed during the year, how much has been spent on a specific line item, and how much this contract
represents for the overall budget.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval of
request numbers 1 through 15, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 IV. Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A. Report from Supply Chain Management (Attachment #2)
• Report of procurement and non-procurement matters for FY2016 – 2nd Quarter
• Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Jones presented the two (2) reports for the Committee’s information.
In response to a question from Director Wiese regarding the progress that has been made with purchases of
replacement equipment at Stroger Hospital, Dr. Shannon stated that, at a high level, the administration is happy
with the progress made over the last 18 months with the amount spent. He noted that the Directors will see in the
strategic plan a tactic that includes an overall assessment of capital equipment across the organization, and the
development of a multi-year plan for replacing obsolete equipment.
With regard to the Report on Procurement Matters, Director Richardson-Lowry made a request similar to the one
made earlier regarding M/WBE and local hires goals; she stated that, if the administration can also provide that
additional information for these contracts on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis, the Committee will have a
better sense of the levels of engagement in the diversity of its vendors.

V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer
• Report
• Metrics
• Financial Statements through May 2016
