Item No. 5

AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH CHA’S LANGUAGE ACCESS POLICY
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
The Office of Diversity is recommending to establish the CHA’s Language Access Policy to standardize
services provided to CHA applicants, CHA and non-CHA residents who are Limited English Proficiency
(LEP) households in the City of Chicago. In accordance with federal, state and local law, CHA will take
reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to its programs by LEP households. Meaningful access
is free language assistance that does not impose an undue financial burden. The Office of Diversity
will work with internal Language Access Liaisons on the implementation of the Language Access
Policy to increase the quality and reliability of services provided to LEP households and whenever
possible align CHA’s processes with the City’s Language Access Plan(s). Therefore, we seek approval
to implement the CHA’s Language Access Policy, which includes, but is not limited to the following:
1. Laws prohibiting national origin discrimination as it affects persons with LEP
a. Title VI of the Civic Rights Act of 1964
b. Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act
c. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
d. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968
2. HUD’s definition of LEP persons
3. HUD’s Four Factor Analysis requirements
4. HUD’s recommended language assistance to LEP persons
The Chief Administrative Officer, the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of Diversity
completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of this initiative and recommend
the approval of this item accordingly.
CORPORATE GOAL
Expand services to more residents, targeted to their needs, and at critical milestones in their lives.
PROCUREMENT INFORMATION
CHA is currently under contract with Multilingual Connections for in-person interpretation and
document translation services. Globo Language Solutions provides telephonic interpretation
services. CHA plans to execute an 8-month extension with these vendors (due to expire on April
2015) until December 2015.
CHA is collaborating with the City of Chicago’s Office of New Americans and plans to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement for translation and interpretation services. The procurement timeline
for this item is currently in progress.

 GENERAL BACKGROUND
Regulation under Title VI of the Civic Rights Act and Section 188 of the Workforce Investment Act,

assistance to LEP persons. HUD’s Recommendations for Language Assistance, include:

Access Policy to standardize and streamline the translation and interpretations services provided to
LEP persons.
