WHEREAS, County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section

WHEREAS, while other taxing districts within Cook County have consistently increased their property
tax levy on an annual basis, Cook County has not increased its property tax levy since 1996 and the levy
has remained constant at $720 million; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to streamline County government and prevent further economic hardship on
County residents, the Cook County Board of Commissioners implemented budgetary cuts in the 2007
fiscal year with an on average seventeen percent (17%) countywide budgetary reduction; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has a structural deficit and due to County Board approved appropriations and
contractual obligations, the Board of Cook County Commissioners acknowledged the need for additional
revenue and increased County revenue in a manner that would afford adequate funding to maintain
essential services; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule county, County of Cook is authorized by 55 ILCS 5/5-1006 to impose a tax
upon all persons in Cook County engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to address its fiscal responsibilities, effective July 1, 2008, Cook County

one percent (1%) excluding vital goods such as groceries and medicines as well as vehicles and other
titled property; and

WHEREAS, in addition, on April 7, 2009, a number of Townships had a question regarding Cook
County’s increased sales tax, those Townships voiced their concern and though such referenda is advisory

acknowledged and heard; and

public safety and the health system, causing layoffs in offices that include the Sheriff, State’s Attorney,
Public Defender, Chief Judge, Clerk of the Circuit Court and the Cook County Health & Hospitals
System; and
WHEREAS, a reduction in the increased portion of the Home Rule County Retailers’ Occupation Tax is
proposed at a quarter percent (.25%).

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
submitted is the proposed Cook County Green Construction Ordinance that would require all Cook
County contractors working on public construction contracts, budgeted at $2 million or more, to use
cleaner diesel fuel and pollution controls on their vehicles and equipment. I will introduce this ordinance
at the April 15 Board meeting and refer it to the Construction Committee.
Diesel pollution is known to cause lung cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, and premature
death. Our efforts to help clean up diesel pollution will improve the County’s air quality, protect the
health of the residents of Cook County, and, ultimately, reduce the burden of health care on our public
health system.
The Green Construction Ordinance will have a modest impact on construction costs. For most green
construction projects, the total costs of using cleaner fuels and pollution controls has cost less than 1% of
the total project cost.
Air pollution continues to be a serious problem in Cook County. This ordinance will help the County
meet federal air quality standards, which the County continues to violate.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY GREEN CONSTRUCTION ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 30 Environment, Article
IX Green Construction, Sections 30-950 through 30-955 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as
follows:

1224

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
ARTICLE IX. GREEN CONSTRUCTION
Sec. 30-950.

Board of Commissioners findings.

(a)
Diesel exhaust particle pollution poses a clear and present health risk to the people of
Cook County. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified diesel exhaust as a
likely human carcinogen, and has identified diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust organic gases as
toxic air pollutants. Diesel exhaust is also a prime contributor to airborne fine particle pollution that is
linked to premature death and other serious cardiovascular and pulmonary problems such as heart attacks,
abnormal heart rhythms, atherosclerosis, stroke, asthma attacks, permanent respiratory damage and
retardation of lung growth in children.

(b)
pollution.

Cook County is a US EPA designated non-attainment area for fine particulate matter

(c)
The health impacts from diesel emissions particularly affect children, the elderly, and
people with weakened immune systems.
(d)
Particularly high concentrations of diesel emissions often occur in heavily traveled
transportation corridors, intermodal yards, bus depots, and construction sites; these diesel “hot spots”
often are found in densely populated, urban areas, disproportionately impacting ethnic minorities and
people of lower economic status.
(e)
Diesel engine crankcases also are a source of emissions that can seep into the cabin and
expose vehicle drivers and passengers to harmful diesel emissions.
(f)

Diesel exhaust also contains black carbon emissions, which contribute to global climate

(g)
problems.

Reduction of diesel emissions can help address these human health and environmental

change.

(h)
The United States Environmental Protection Agency has enacted requirements over the
past few years requiring the substantial reduction of emissions from new diesel engines in both heavyduty highway vehicles and land-based non-road equipment. However, these regulations do not apply to
any of the over 11 million existing diesel engines in the United States, most of which emit substantially
more pollution and often remain in service for 10 to 30 years, depending on the type of engine and
equipment.
(i)
Practical, cost-effective measures to substantially reduce diesel particulate emissions are
available today, and can be applied to many existing diesel engines. The same technology that limits
diesel pollution from new diesel engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines or applied in new
replacement engines to reduce diesel emissions by 85% or better.
(j)
Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to minimize the public health risks from
exposure to diesel particulate emissions as expeditiously as practicable.
Sec. 30-951.

Definitions.

CARB means the California Air Resources Board.

County and as far as Lake and DuPage Counties are being sent to Stroger Hospital of Cook County for

RESOLUTIONS
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
submitted is a proposed Resolution urging President Obama, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, and
the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to make changes in the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)
Program that would expand the pool of qualified DBE firms eligible for federal stimulus monies. I will
introduce this resolution at the April 15 Board meeting for approval.
Following is a summary of the requested changes in the DBE program:
Raise the personal net worth (PNW) limitation from $750,000 to $2 million
PNW dates back to 1989 with SBA and 1999 with U.S. DOT;
PNW has NEVER been increased;
PNW limit does not account for differences in cost of living between large urban areas
and smaller rural areas;
Artificially low PNW makes it harder to get bonding and limits access to lines of credit
for DBE firms; and
Brings PNW in line with Cook County’s Minority and Women Business Enterprise
(M/WBE) in Construction Ordinance.
Eliminate the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) size cap ($20.41 million)
and follow the SBA size standards ($33.5 million)
U.S. DOT size cap has only been raised twice in 10 years;
Artificially low size cap makes it harder to get bonding and limits access to lines of credit
for DBE firms;
U.S. DOT size cap does not account for differences in construction costs between large
urban areas and smaller rural areas; and
Brings size cap in line with Cook County’s M/WBE Ordinance.
Adopt the model disparity study methodology of the Transportation Research Board of the
National Academy of Sciences
Provides clear guidelines for recipients of federal transportation money on conducting
disparity studies; and
Reduces the cost of conducting a disparity study.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
URGING CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE POOL OF
QUALIFIED DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE FIRMS
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL STIMULUS MONIES
WHEREAS, Women Construction Owners & Executives (WCOE), Hispanic American Construction
Industry Association (HACIA), Federation of Women Contractors (FWC), Black Contractors United
(BCU), Association of Asian Construction Enterprises (AACE), Chicago Minority Business Development
Center (CMBDC), and Women’s Business Development Center (WBDC) all have at the top of their
national legislative agenda improvements to the United States Department of Transportation’s (U.S.
DOT) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program; and
WHEREAS, these improvements will enable recipients of federal stimulus monies to be prepared with a
strong pool of qualified DBE firms to perform the work that is being funded; and
WHEREAS, since 1989, the DBE program has imposed a $750,000 personal net worth limitation on any
qualifying owners seeking DBE certification; and
WHEREAS, this $750,000 personal net worth limitation has never been increased; and
WHEREAS, the present DBE program in 49 C.F.R § 26.65 imposes the U.S. Small Business
Administration’s (SBA) size standards on the gross revenues of any firm seeking DBE certification but
also imposes an absolute size cap, currently $20.41 million, even if the SBA size standard is higher; and
WHEREAS, bonding capacity and ability to secure lines of credit are directly tied to both a DBE owner’s
personal net worth as well as the DBE firm’s gross revenues; and
WHEREAS, these artificially low limits on personal net worth and gross revenues are particularly
challenging for DBE firms in Cook County, Illinois due to a higher cost of living and higher construction
costs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook and the City of Chicago, Illinois have established personal net worth
limitations of $2 million for their Minority and Women Business Enterprise (M/WBE) programs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook and the City of Chicago, Illinois have established gross revenue caps
consistent with SBA gross revenue size standards for construction firms and do not impose any additional
size cap; and
WHEREAS, the current SBA size standard for construction is $33.5 million; and
WHEREAS, recipients of federal transportation money must have a DBE program and must develop
statistical and anecdotal evidence to show the extent of discrimination against women and minorities in
the construction industry; and
WHEREAS, the DBE program presently provides no guidelines for the methodology that should be used
for these disparity studies; and
WHEREAS, the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences is in the process of
developing a model disparity study methodology; and

1235

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
WHEREAS, such a model disparity study methodology would greatly benefit recipients of federal
transportation money by providing clear guidelines for these disparity studies.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation,
and the United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to increase the
personal net worth limitation in the DBE program to $2 million; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the
United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to remove the size cap on
DBE gross receipts and follow the SBA size standards; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we, the President and Members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, do hereby urge President Barack Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the
United States Department of Transportation Secretary to take immediate action to adopt the
Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences’ model disparity study
methodology; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be sent to President Barack
Obama, the Illinois Congressional delegation, and the United States Department of Transportation
Secretary.

PROPOSED SECOND SUBSTITUTE ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74
Taxation, Sec. 74-70 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:

1300

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a Designation / Assessment Class

Class 8a.
Real estate that is used primarily for commercial purposes, which
real estate would qualify for a class 8 designation pursuant to Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64,
except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive
does not comply with the definition of abandoned property provided for in Sec.74-62(b), can
receive a designation as a class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has
complied with all of the requirements necessary to receive a class 8 designation per Sec. 7462 thru Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the definition of abandonment provided for in Sec. 7462(b), but only when the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or
ordinance in support of such designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

applicant has obtained from the municipality in which the real
estate is located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if
the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to
abate a portion of the local government’s sales tax generated by the
commercial enterprise located on such real estate and such
abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the
applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive;

b.

applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that due to national and regional
economic conditions beyond its control the commercial enterprise
has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40% in the year it makes application for this incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the commercial
enterprise in the prior three years;

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
ongoing commercial enterprise is not economically viable and as
such it will cease operations within sixty-days of the submission of
an eligibility application for class 8a designation to the Cook
County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become vacant
and unused for an extended period of time of at least twenty-four
months; and

d.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a class 8a property will allow the commercial
enterprise to be economically viable and thereby continue its
operations so that the commercial enterprise can continue to
occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended period of
time.

1301

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
(2)

(3)

(4)

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that commercial enterprise has undergone a significant
reduction in net operating income of at least 40% in the year it
makes application for the incentive as compared to the average net
operating income of the commercial enterprise in the prior three
years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is necessary
for the ongoing commercial enterprise to continue its operations
and that without such designation the commercial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to become vacant
and unused;

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a class
8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and

d.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the application made to the Cook County
Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

a finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a
designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing
commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that without
such designation the commercial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to become vacant and
unused;

b.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to support
designation of the property as a class 8a property;

c.

a statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the
class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and

d.

a statement by the municipality that it will abate a portion of its
sales tax for the property during the term of the class 8a.

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value
provided for in Section 74-64 (11), however the term of the incentive will
be limited to five years only and such class 8a designation shall not be
renewed.
1302

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 15, 2009
(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8a designation an eligibility
application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following
has occurred: application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all
required municipal and county ordinances and resolutions are provided to
the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines that
the real estate which is the subject of the application for a class 8a
designation would qualify for designation as a class 8 property but for the
inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Sec.7462(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to
determine eligibility for the benefits provided under class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a class 8a designation, the
Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting
documentation provided with such application to the Cook County Board
of Commissioners or its designee for consideration as to whether the
County Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a class
8a designation absent abandonment.

(9)

Real estate receiving a class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall not be eligible for a class 8a designation for any year prior
to the assessment year for which an application for the designation is made
to the Cook County Assessor.

(10)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may adopt rules
consistent with this section that may be needed to ensure proper review of
information, data and documents submitted in support of a request to the
County Board for a resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8a
designation as provided for in this section.

(11)

Applicants for a class 8a designation of property can only make such an
application for the following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,
2012, 2013 and the Cook County Assessor shall not designate any real
estate as class 8a property for assessment year 2018 or thereafter.

(12)

Real estate that receives a designation as a class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment, if
the commercial enterprise located on the property ceases operations and the
subject real estate becomes vacant an unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment

Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a Designation / Assessment Class

Class 8a.
Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial
purposes, which real estate would qualify for a class 8 designation pursuant to Sec. 7462 thru Sec. 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to
application for the incentive does not comply with the definition of abandoned property
provided for in Sec.74-62(b), can receive a designation as a class 8a property so long as
the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to
receive a class 8 designation per Sec. 74-62 thru Sec. 74-64, except for meeting the
definition of abandonment provided for in Sec. 74-62(b), but only when the Cook
County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such
designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

an applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained
from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a
portion of the local government’s sales tax generated by the
industrial or commercial enterprise located on such real estate
and such abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for
which the applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive;

b.

applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that due to national and regional
economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in
net operating income of at least 40% in the year it makes
application for this incentive as compared to the average net
operating income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in
the prior three years;

(3)

c.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not
economically viable and as such it will cease operations within
sixty-days of the submission of an eligibility application for class
8a designation to the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the
property will become vacant and unused for an extended period
of time of at least twenty-four months; and

d.

applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a class 8a property will allow the industrial or
commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby
continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial
enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate
for an extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has
undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40% in the year it makes application for the incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years;

b.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that class 8a designation of the property is necessary
for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue
its operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing
the property to become vacant and unused;

c.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a
class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and

d.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the application made to the Cook
County Assessor requesting designation as a class 8a property
absent an abandonment requirement.

designation as a class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide
to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:

provided for in Section 74-64 (11), however the term of the incentive

subject real estate receiving the class 8a designation pursuant to
the provisions of this section is sold or the applicant transfers

report and its analysis to the Board, and in addition, present any potential remedies
provided to County government, through its Environmental Control Committee, no later
than December 1st, 2008.
*Referred to the Environmental Control Committee on 10/01/08.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked the Director of the Environmental Control Department, Mr. Kevin N.
Givens, whether he had reviewed the proposed resolution and whether the County of Cook has any
jurisdiction to review these issues.
Mr. Givens responded that regarding the sites located in Suburban Cook County “yes;” however,
regarding the two sites located in the City of Chicago “no.”
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked whether these companies comply with federal law.
Mr. Givens answered yes the facilities listed either have Title V permits, where these facilities can emit
over 100 tons of air pollution, or a permit allowing the facilities to pollute between 25 and 100 tons per
year. The companies listed in the ordinance are in compliance with the federal and state regulation
guidelines for air permitting.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked for a recommendation from Mr. Givens.
Mr. Givens responded that the County of Cook should continue to review the progress of the facilities as
to compliance with local air pollution regulations as established by the Cook County Environmental
Control Ordinance and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency statutes as it pertains to air pollution
emission control in Suburban Cook County. From an operational standpoint the Department of
Environmental Control is very restrictive in terms of conducting additional inspection activities due to
staff deficiencies.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in
accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2009 from
STEPHEN A. MARTIN, JR., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) respectfully requests the Board of
Commissioners approve the proposed amendment to the Cook County Board of Health Ordinance.
This proposed amendment serves two purposes. First, it clarifies the authority of the Cook County
Department of Public Health to require certain types of state-licensed providers within the
department's jurisdiction to participate in the electronic submission of syndromic surveillance data. This
data is extremely useful to the efforts of the Department in communicable disease control and has the
potential to alert us to an outbreak in its very early stages, when intervention may be most effective.
Many health providers currently participate in this program on a voluntary basis and we would like to
pursue participation arrangements with more providers to improve our efforts in this very exciting
program.
The second purpose of the proposed amendment is to memorialize authorizations, many of which have
been extended to the Department by the Board through Board Resolutions in the past regarding various
types of routine memoranda of agreement the Department periodically needs to enter into. These
agreements are typically programmatic in nature and do not involve the establishment of fees, except to
the extent that fees have been separately approved by the Board and set forth in the schedule found at
Chapter 32 Fees of the Cook County Code.
