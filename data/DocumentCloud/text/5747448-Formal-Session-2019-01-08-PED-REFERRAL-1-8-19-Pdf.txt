EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 2019-1

   
 

TO: ALL BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS, AGENCY
HEADS, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, AND THE CITY CLERK

SUBJECT: MORATORIUM ON APPLICATIONS FOR PERMITS 
LICENSES FOR NEW OR EXPANDED JUNKYARDS, SCRAP TIRE
PROCESSING AND RECYCLING FACILITIES, SCRAP TIRE STORAGE
FACILITIES, MAJOR AND MINOR MOTOR VEHICLE REPAIR, AND
USED CAR SALES LOTS

DATE: JANUARY 2, 2019

In recent years, the City of Detroit has seen an increase in the establishment and/or
expansion of junkyards, scrap tire processing and recycling facilities, scrap tire storage facilities,
minor and major motor vehicle repair and used car sales lots. Under Chapter 61 of the 1984
Detroit City Code, ?Zoning,? the term ?junkyard? includes junk dealers, scrap iron and metal
processors, and automobile dismantling and wrecking yards. Regulation and enforcement of
these businesses has been a challenge for the City of Detroit due to an overconcentration of such
uses and lack of compliance with zoning, property maintenance, and licensing standards, in
addition to evidence of criminal activity furthered or condoned by some of these operations.
Many businesses are currently operating without bene?t of a permit, a certi?cate of compliance,
or a business license. Once permitted, some of these uses have illegally intensi?ed the services
offered such as presenting more used cars for sale than allowed, or providing more intense vehicle
repair activities than allowed. At the same time, such uses that have been abandoned can leave
vacant, blighted buildings and contaminated land on commercial corridors. Finally, these uses can
present deleterious effects on neighboring residential districts, resulting in excessive blight, traf?c,
noise, crime and environmental concerns requiring excessive enforcement resources, due to more
frequent neighborhood complaints and aesthetic issues.

The City has determined that an examination of the applicable provisions in the City Code,
Detroit Zoning Ordinance and the Detroit Master Plan of Policies is required to evaluate the current
regulatory scheme pertaining to junkyards, scrap tire processing and recycling facilities, scrap tire
storage facilities, major and minor motor vehicle repair, and used car sales lots. The review will
identify appropriate measures and potential new regulations to limit overconcentration, increase
compliance with property maintenance, zoning, and licensing standards, decrease crime, and
curtail illegal business operations.

Therefore, it is ordered that as of April 1, 2019, no City department may accept any

3 application for a permit or license to establish or expand a junkyard, scrap tire processing and
recycling facility, scrap tire storage facility, minor or major motor vehicle repair, or used car sales
lot for a period of twelve (12) months-to give the City the opportunity to review its City Code,
Zoning Ordinance and Master Plan of Policies, to implement a compliance strategy, and to deveIOp

The DBRA subsequently adopted a resolution (Exhibit B) approving the termination of the
Plan and authorizing the submission of a copy of its resolution to request that City Council
adopt a resolution terminating the Plan.

The DBRA, as authorized by City Council, sent a notification of termination of the Plan
(Exhibit C) in accordance with Section 

Authority's Request
The Authority is respectfully requesting the following action from the City Council:

RE: Notice of Intent to Terminate Brown?eld Plan for the Tireman and Epworth Redevelopment Project

Mr. Wild and Mr. Wise:

Per Act 381 of 1996 Section 14 this letter is to inform you that the Detroit City Council has authorized this notice to
inform you that termination of the Brownfield Plan for the Tireman and Epworth Redevelopment Project (the "Plan?) will be
considered in no less than thirty days.

On September 5, 2007 the DBRA adopted and on October 23, 2007 the Detroit City Council approved the Plan.

It is our understanding that as Developer of the project identified in the Plan, you have failed to submit sufficient eligible costs
for the Plan. Because sufficient eligible costs have failed to be submitted, the Brown?eld Plan will be terminated for the subject
project per Act 381 of 1996 Section 14 (8).

While you are welcome to speak at any public meeting of City Council regarding the proposed termination, the following public
meetings have been tentatively scheduled at the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, 13th Floor, Detroit,
MI 48226 regarding the termination of the Plan where, should you desire, you will also have an opportunity to be heard:

. Thursday January 10, 2018 at 10:00 AM Detroit City Council Planning 8: Economic Development Standing Committee
a? Tuesday, January 15, 2018 at 10:00 AM Detroit City Council of the Whole Meeting

In no event would any termination be effective until at least 30 days after the date of this notice.

Sincerely,

In the Planning and Development Standing Committee, Council member Scott Benson requested
that the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) work jointly with the Detroit Economic Growth
Corporation (DEGC) to produce a report on the ?nancial impact tax abatements in general have
on both the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) ?old? and the Detroit Public Community School

District ?new.?1

In its report of December 2018, based on the City ?5 current tax abatement policy criteria and the
provisions in State law, the DEGC determined:

0 Tax incentives in the City of Detroit are unlikely to negatively affect the Detroit
Public Schools Community District?s operating funds.

0 A majority of the projects would not go forward without an abatement, given the
City?s ?but for?2 determination criteria

0 Despite the fact that tax abatements result in a reduced tax bill on a future

investment, which is realized by the developer, primarily, tax revenue for the
3 schools increases.

To demonstrate its point of increased school revenue with tax abatement projects, the DEGC
used the Ford Corktown Project as an example. Ford requested four different incentives to
support the project, Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Act, Commercial Rehabilitation Act,
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone, and Renaissance Zone abatements.

 

Detroit Bublic Schools (DPS) ?old? refers to the "old" Detroit Public Schools (DPS), which will remain in
existence {only for the purposes of levying mills to pay off debt. The Detroit Public Community School District
"new" was established to continue all rights, functions, and responsibilities of educating children, with the exception
of paying 'off old operating debt. PA 193 of 2016, MCL 12252-12262

2 ?But for?ia is a reference to denote that the project would not go forward, without the incentive.

Final Net Revenue Increase to DPS (A have Existing) $3,196,872 $117,819
(Final Net Percentage Increase to DPS (Above Existing} 5907. 0% 301.4%

 

Prior to Ford?s approximately $738 million investment in the Ford Corktown Project,3 without
any major investment, DPS was projected to levy and relalize $54,120 in operating millage
revenue and $39,085 in debt millage revenue. Given the aforementioned $38 million investment,
those ?gures would increase to $4,705,272 in operating millage revenue and $3,398,252 in debt
millage revenue. Given the fact that the subject property was functionally and literally obsolete
and there had been no investment or any viable commercial activity on the site for over 30 years,
it is arguable that without any City incentives, the project and the investment would not occur.
Therefore assuming the gross impact of the investment by Ford, if Ford did not obtain the
abatement on the DPS operating millage revenue, the school district would receive $4.7 million.
Upon appling the abatement of $1.5 million, leaves a net revenue of $3.35 million. Despite the
abatement, this increases the revenue potential on the site of the project by $3.196 million
(5907%), based on the new investment over the ?rst ?ve years

The impact of the Ford Cigktown Project to DPS over the nroiet?s next 30 years, which
includes the implemenatation of the Renaissance Zone that is fully reimbursed by statute?1 by the
State of Michigan, is illustrated by the following chart below:

Please let us know is we can be of any further assistance.

 

3 The Ford Corktown project will include development of a total of 1.2 million gross square feet of of?ce, retail,
parking, and residential space across ?ve sites within the Corktown neighborhood. These properties are projected
to provide a workplace for 5,000 workers. The aggregated total investment for this project is estimated at $738
million.

4 PA 376 of 1996, MCL 125.2692 Sec. 12. (2): Except as otherwise provided in subsection (6), this state shall
reimburse local school districts each year for all tax revenue lost as the result of the exemption of property under this
act from taxes levied under section 1211 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451, MCL 380.1211, based on the
property's taxable value in that year.

RE: Request for a Zoning Overlay Map of Post Release Restrictions on Housing

As part of my efforts to increase returning citizens? access to housing, I would like to focus on

residents who are geographically limited in housing because of the type of crime they were
convicted of, Le. crimes that result in a lifetime registration on the sex offender list.

As an initial step in creating adequate policy to serve this population, I am requesting the
addressed departments to work together to create zoning overlay maps to identify what areas this
population is allowed to live in based on the type of crime involved.

Please feel free to contact my office for any additional information needed.

Board of Zoning Appeals

Coleman A. Young Municipal Center
2 Woodward Ave., Suite 212

Detroit, MI 48226

Dear Members of the Board of Zoning Appeals,

It has come to my attention that the BZA recently granted a sign variance for advertising on the
Broderick Tower and the covering of the whales.

I am disappointed with this decision to remove public art and replace it with advertisement. I am a
proponent of preserving and supporting public art, which enhances our public spaces and enriches the
lives of our residents. The sign legislation is still in development, and I am advocating for legislation
that balances advertising with promotion of public art. I believe this decision to grant the sign
variance on the Broderick, which places additional prominent advertisements downtown at the
expense of the existing mural, is premature in light of the pending sign legislation.

I strongly urge you to reconsider your vote in order to preserve this important public art.
Sincerely,

Re: BSEED Case #116?17, 13042 Van Dyke
Dear Council President Brenda Jones and City Council Members:

I am writing on behalf of the children and residents of the McNiChols/Van Dyke community. The reason
for my letter to the Detroit City Council is to Council void the NO vote of Zoning Board of
Appeals board member Emmanuel Calzada. further, we request that our case be remanded to the
Board of Zoning Appeals and our community appeal be heard to reverse the decision of the BSEED, CaSe
#116-17, to establish a Medical Marihuana Caregiver Center (MMCC) which is within 300 feet of the
Fletcher-Almont Community Fruit Garden created in 2013.

We are requesting this action because on Tuesday, November 20, 2018, we appeared before the Zoning
Board of Appeals to appeal .a decision by the BSEED which granted approval of a Medical Marijuana
Caregiver Center at 13042 Van Dyke. Mr. 'Calzada arrived late to the meeting and only heard a few minutes
of my over hour testimony which addressed the six questions (attached) given to me to determine if we
have been ?aggrieved? and thereby have standing to present our community appeal. His decision and
subsequent vote to deny us standing was not just, fair or based on facts since he did not hear my entire
testimony.

In addition, we are requesting that our community appeal be grandfathered in underthe zoning ordinance
as of November 2017 and that our appeal be heard since we Were given insufficient time to prepare our
case. On Monday, November 19, 201.8 at 1:02pm, I received a recent opinion {attached} issued by Wayne
County Circuit Court stating person or organizations who ?le administrative appeals {including community
appeals] will be required to show that they have been "aggrieved" in order to have standing to be heard.
We were given less than 24 hours to review the six questions as noted above and prepare a response for
the Tuesday, November 20, 2018 10:45 am. hearing. We had insuf?cient time to seek legal counsel as
stated in the City of Detroit Board of Zoning Appeals Notice regarding administrative Appeals dated
Noyember 19, 2018-.

Finally, question five out of six questions given was to determine if we were aggrieved. The question was
as follows: ?what proof do you have that you have suffered these special damages and harm?? The
language of the law is impossible to comply with as written. The MMCC is not open and therefore actual
proof is impossible to obtain. However, potential special damages and harm we can prove. lwould be
willing to show how we would potentially be harmed and suffer special damages if this MMCC is allowed
to open. We are requesting that the questions be revised to give community appeals a fair and just
opportunity to be heard, We believe that the broad nature of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance dated

Detroit, MI 48224-

Page 2

October 14, 2.018, Sec.61-4-72, pro'vides for a more democratic and jUst right of persons and organizations
to appeal decisions.

In summary, the establishment of a MMCC at 13042? Van Dyke will negatively impact our work with
children, seniors and residents of the McNichols/Van Dyke community. The MMCC would hinder the
communities plans for positive economic development. Again, we request that our appeal he heard by
the Board of Zoning Appeals so that a fair and ju$t decision would be made regarding the establishment
,of the MMCC in our community.

Sincerely,
