Ms. DeSantis raised concerns about Banyan Investments, the Developers of the St.

rehabilitation of a larger number of single-family homes than what Banyan had originally
approached the City with. Banyan has admitted to having difficulty rehabbing the large
volume of houses they’ve been asked to complete by the City. Banyan and the City are
working together to resolve the remaining unrenovated homes in a timely manner. Mr.
Walters asked Ms. DeSantis and the Board to consider Banyan’s large number of quality
renovations completed to date and the impact that the additional rehabilitations requested
by the City had had on Banyan’s ability to complete projects in a timely manner.
PUBLIC COMMENT
