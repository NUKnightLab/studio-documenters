Attachment B: Grantee?s Workplan

a. Background: The City of Detroit operates a bi-weekly (every-other?week) curbside recycling collection
system using two different contracted haulers to offer opt-in recycling collection to all eligible single-family
households within itsjurisdiction. The city is divided into two service districts, with each hauler managing
collection within its assigned district. Curbside recycling service is available to all residential properties in
Detroit with four (4) units or less, and city staff estimate that approximately 61,000 of the approximately 207,000
curbside recycling eligible households presently have a cart for curbside recycling. The city's curbside recycling
program collected approximately 4, I 88.64 tons of recyclables in 2018. Households must opt-in to participate in
the curbside recycling program, and those that do so are offered one 64-gallon recycling cart that they can set out
for every-other'week collection. The City of Detroit contracts with two local organizations, Green Living Science
(GLS) and the Michigan Environmental Council (MEC), to provide education and outreach services about
Detroit?s curbside recycling program, and the City?s of?ce of Sustainability also supports recycling education and
outreach efforts. As part of those efforts, Green Living Science and the Michigan Environmental Council conduct
workshops to educate citizens on proper recycling protocol. To become eligible to receive a recycling cart at no-
cost, citizens can either attend one of the recycling workshops hosted by GLS or MEC, or they can choose to play
an interactive online game that teaches them about the city?s program. Residents who forgo qualifying for a free
cart are required to pay a one-time fee of $25 in order to receive a recycling cart.

Properties with more than four (4) residential units are not eligible for curbside recycling services, and at present
there is no formal city-sponsored or operated program to help these properties secure recycling services. These
properties can contract with the designated hauler that services their portion of the city to receive waste collection
services, and the City of Detroit also offers waste collection services using city staff and vehicles. At present it is
projected that I66 multifamily properties secure waste collection directly from the city and that 2,529 multifamily
units secure waste collection through one of the city?s contracted haulers. Data about the number of individual
residential units (households) at these multifamily properties is not presently available. These properties will be
targeted for recycling collection during Phase 1 of the city?s plan to implement a commercial and multifamily
recycling program in the second half of 2019 as described in the Project Description.

b. Project Description: The City of Detroit is planning to implement a signi?cant expansion of its public
recycling efforts between September I, 2019 and August 3 l, 2020. City staff have prepared and submitted a
request for funding to the state of Michigan?s Recycling Infrastructure Grant Program in support of this
expansion, and grant funding from The Recycling Partnership is intended to compliment any award of funding
from the state. Grant funding from The Recycling Partnership will be speci?cally allocated to support the
expansion of the City?s existing curbside recycling program and to support the initiation of a new multifamily
recycling program.



As a part of curbside recycling portion of this project, Detroit will proactively seek to signi?cantly expand the
number of curbside-eligible households opting to participate. To support this expansion the city will collaborate
with its contracted service providers (haulers) to purchme and distribute up to 16,401 recycling carts that are 64
gallon in volume in order to allow additional households to access curbside recycling service.

For the multifamily portion of the project, the city will implement Phne of its new multifamily recycling
program with the goal of bringing recycling services to at least forty percent of the multifamily properties
currently receiving waste collection from either the city or one of the two designated haulers serving the city. As
part of this project, the city and its contracted haulers will provide multifamily pmperties with outdoor receptacles
for recycling collection as well as in-unit bins that residents can use to collect and store their recyclables inside
their homes. The outdoor receptacles will be either 400-gallon side-load containers or 64 gallon carts, and the in-
unit bins will be l8 gallon or smaller. The exact number of the different sized indoort?in-unit and outdoor
receptacles to be purchased will be determined based on which multifamily properties choose to participate in the
multifamily recycling program as well as how individual multifamily households and property managers respond
to the availability of different sizes and types of in-unit bins. To the degree pOSSibie, one goal of Phase I will be
to determine which types and sizes of in-unit bins are the most desirable and effective when it comes to
facilitating resident participation and proper preparation of recyclables.

The project will also include the implementation of ajurisdiction-wide education and outreach campaign to
support the curbside and multifamily recycling programs. Education and outreach will be delivered in
collaboration with city staff and the two non-pro?t organizations that the City of Detroit contracts with for
recycling educational services, and outreach efforts will be planned and coordinated with support from The
Recycling Partnership.

c. Measurement Plan: The Grantee will implement a system for tracking the effectiveness of its curbside and
multifamily recycling efforts.

For curbside recycling, the Grantee will track the total number of households eligible to receive curbside
recycling service along with the number of households actually opting-in to utilize said service in the two
different servicejurisdictions. The Grantee will track the number of households added to curbside recycling
service each month. The Grantee will also implement a system for tracking tonnage data for the amounts
of municipal solid waste and recyclables collected from curbside recycling eligible households, and the Grantee
will also work with The Partnership to evaluate contamination rates of the materials recovered by its curbside
recycling program as resources allow. When reporting information about the households that have been added to
its curbside recycling program, the Grantee will carefully track and report the number of households that have
taken the steps necessary to qualify for no-cost distribution of a recycling cart versus those who have been
required to pay to receive a curbside recycling cart.

10

RECYCLINGPARTNERSHIPDRG

The Grantee will implement a system to track the number of multifamily properties participating in the
multifamily recycling program as well as the number of residential units at each participating property. It is
understood that recyclables from multifamily properties may be collected at the same time as recyclables from
other non-residential [commercial properties, but at the very least efforts will be made to accurately estimate the
amount of recyclables originating from multifamily residential sources. If multifamily recycling tonnage is
determined by estimation, the Grantee will share details of how the estimates are derived.

Reports will be provided to The Partnership as outlined in section I. Reporting and Additional Post-Award
Requirements, as set out in Attachment A, and every effort will be made to track the tonnage of materials
collected by the curbside recycling program separately from materials collected by the multifamily recycling

program.

d. Public Outreach Plan: The Grantee will work closely with The Partnership to develop and implement an
effective education and outreach campaign in support of Grantee?s curbside and multifamily recycling programs
utilizing the approach outlined in Paragraph of Attachment A.

As part of implementing this campaign, the Grantee and its contracted education and outreach providers will
collaborate with The Recycling Partnership to build a detailed scape of work around education and outreach, and
this scope of work will include a plan for how to allocate Partnership grant funds allotted for education and
outreach. A mutually agreed amount of grant funding may be allotted for direct ?nancial support of the
contracted service providers as long as The Partnership agrees that an adequate amount of funding has been
allocated towards direct-to-resident program promotion and outreach.

Educational efforts will focus on engaging long-term recyclers as well as new participants to keep the recycling
stream clean and ensure that residents are infonned of what is acceptable and not acceptable in the curbside and
multifamily recycling program. A heavy emphasis of this campaign will be around the recruitment of new opt-in
curbside and multifamily customers and about how to properly prepare materials for recycling. This educational
program is intended to complement any previous educational pieces that have already been sent to Detroit
residents. The educational effort will target all single family r? curbside recycling eligible households in the
Detroit servicejurisdiction as well :5 the multifamily units targeted for recycling implementation, and will utilize
most if not all of these supporting tools:

0 Direct to resident informational mailers or utility bill inserts for all curbside households,

I Public activation event to drive citizen engagement in recycling,

0 Social media boosting,

- Paid advertisements,

- The implementation of anti-contamination strategies to reinforce correct recycling behavior. and

I Other strategies determined effective by Detroit and The Recycling Partnership.

EMERGENCY KEY BOX SYSTEMS (KNOX BOX)

LPD was asked by Council President Pro Tem Shef?eld to determine the feasibility of creating
an ordinance to require an emergency key box system for senior buildings and other multifamily
gated communities for the purpose of providing a secure means of access to the police, ?re, or
other emergency service personnel in case of an emergency.

Perhaps, the most recognizable brand name for emergency key boxes in the country is the Knox
Box, which is made by an Arizona-based company called Knox Company?. The company has
been around for more than 40 years. It is a steel lock box that can store building entrance keys,
access cards, emergency contact numbers or ?oor layout documents that can be mounted on the
outside entrance of a building. The boxes can withstand extreme weather conditions; and have an
anti-theft re-locking mechanism with a drill resistant hard-plate lock protector. There are
different models available depending on the needs of the owner. A vault can hold one, two, ten,
or ?fty keys/key cards. There are commercial and residential versions that come with add-ons
such as dual locks, tamper alarms, electronic key systems, elevator key boxes, pad
locks, electric door and gate switches.

The Knox Company?s lock boxes are used by over 14,000 ?re departments, law enforcement
agencies, and governmental entities nationwide. Many cities have mandated that a Knox Box be
mounted outside of certain buildings front doors to gain quick access into buildings during
emergency situations. The lock box circumvents forced entry by emergency personnel,
preventing potential property damage and reducing the time taken to provide emergency

assistance.

 

1 



Each city that has enacted an ordinance requiring an installation of these systems has established
its own set of standards. Some of these requirements include mandating that a combination of
any of the following types of buildings must have a lock box on?site:

Any building with an elevator

Any commercial building that is more than 1 story

A building that has hazardous materials

A residential building with 3 or more rental units

Commercial or industrial structures that have a ?re alarm and/or sprinkler systems that

are secured in a manner that restricts access during emergencies or are protected by

automatic alarm/suppression systems

6. Multifamily residential structures that have restricted access through locked doors and
have a common corridor for access to living units

7. Governmental structures and nursing care facilities with gated entrances

8. Gated communities are required to have a Knox Switch to disconnect the electric charge

to an electric fence.



Some cities have also speci?ed that a Knox Box at a residential building can only contain keys to
the portions of the building that are not leased to residents, such as common areas, hallways,
basements, utility rooms, automatic sprinkler control rooms, etcetera.

Many of the cities that has surfaced in investigstion have similar ordinances that typically
assigned their lock biox implementation strategy to their local ?re department. Some require
building owners to purchase the boxes from the local ?re departments or the companies that sell
the Knox Box. The governmental agencies that have access to the lock boxes must register with
the Knox Company through their website. Fire departments hold copies of the master keys within
a city or ?re zone. Other agencies that need emergency access to a building can also have copies
of the master key.

After the department is registered, the Knox Company will assign a system identi?cation number
and a restricted lock code. Knox will also send authorization forms preprinted with the
department name, system ID, and brochures explaining the Knox system.

The website offers ?ordinance support? to help cities create an ordinance that ?ts the needs of its
constituentsz. The implementing agency must assign a Knox program coordinator to represent
either one department or multiple departments within a city. Many cities require approval from
the local ?re department for a building owner to purchase a Knox Box.

The Fire Code for the State of Georgia and many other states require some buildings to have key
boxes in pre-approved locations. Milton, Georgia has created an ordinance3 that mandates lock
boxes to be af?xed to the front entrance or another location determined by the ?re marshal for
certain types of buildings. The Fire Marshal, in Milton, Georgia and other cities with similar
ordinances, has the authority to determine the type of lock box system; implement rules and

 

2 

3 Article IV: Key Lockbox System, Section 22-90 to 22-91 of Milton, Municipal Code;
ARTIVKFI,


 

regulations, including requiring any structure to have a lock box; and, handles all requests and
inquiries regarding the boxes. Newly constructed buildings, that are subject to the ordinance, are
required to have a functional lock box before an occupancy permit can be issued. All other pre-
existing buildings have one year from the effective date of the ordinance to install a lock box
system. The owner of the property must have an operational lock box that contains a key at all
times. A violation of this code could result in a maximum ?ne of $1,000 upon conviction.

To prevent theft or forced entry of a Knox Box, ?re departments have to lock each Knox Box for
the owner after installation and add or remove keys by appointment. Once the ?re department
locks the box, the building owner can no longer access the keys or the items inside the lock box
without the ?re department.

As mentioned before, the fire department has a master key that can open every lock box within
the city. This can raise fears about thieves possibly gaining access to the keys inside the lock
box, ultimately, allowing them access to any building in the city that uses a lock box to store
emergency keys. Those fears became a reality in Seattle, WA4, when the city had to spend
$500,000 to re-key lock boxes after a burglar somehow gained possession of one of the master
keys. Furthermore, Austin, TX5 will have to pay $1.8 million6 to replace lock boxes after a thief
used a master key to rob multiple medical facilities, including $31,000 from a hospital cashier?s
of?ce in 2018. The law enforcement agencies investigsting these events could not ?gure out how
the thieves in either case got their hands on a master key.

Criminals can also remove the lock box from its mount with powerful blunt force, take it and
break it open, thereby getting access to one building, as opposed to the whole city. This occurred
in Seattle, WA7. Thieves broke into several commercial buildings, stealing $750,000 worth of
computer servers with the businesses? trade and people?s private information on it. Recess-
mounted key lock boxes are supposed to protect against physical attacks better than other types
of mounts, but the threat is still a possibility. Another worry is that a skilled hacker could
theoretically make a copy of the master keys, although there aren?t any current examples of
criminal hackers accomplishing this for the speci?c purpose of breaking into a building. The old
adage that if it could happen, sooner or later it will happen probably applies here.

The aforementioned situations reveal the monetary and property risks of requiring a key lock box
outside of a large number of buildings that can be opened with just one master key. The security
of a city?s buildings that are using a lock box system is as strong as the precautions taken to

prevent lost or stolen keys. Phoenix, A29 encountered this problem. The city made 1,350 master
key copies for emergency personnel over the years since implementing the program in 1999.
About 850, or 63% of the total master key copies were missing in a 2014 audit. The Fire
Department still had to re-secure the lock boxes at a cost of about $50,000. Phoenix responded to
the discovery by implementing new key controls, such as creating fewer key copies and keeping
a record of whoever is in possession of a key at any time for any reason. An electronic
master key system is available, which may reduce the opportunity for theft or misplacement of a
key, conversely, it may also increase the risk of hackers electronically gaining access to the lock
box.

In conclusion, it is feasible to enact an ordinance to mandate key lock boxes outside of certain
types of buildings. However, any consideration of such policy should minimize the risk of theft

or negligence that could lead to safety concerns or property loss for citizens.
