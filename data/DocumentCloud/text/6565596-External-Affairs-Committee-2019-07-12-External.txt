Present: Please see the attached attendance record.
Commissioner Matt Lundy, Chair of the External Affairs Committee, convened the meeting at
8:30 a.m.
Meeting Minutes
A motion was made by Chief Valarie McCall to approve the minutes of the External Affairs
Committee meeting held on January 18, 2019. The motion was seconded by Mr. Mike Foley.
The motion passed by voice vote.
Committee Updates
The External Affairs Committee received summaries of topics discussed at the following advisory
council meetings:
•

Business Advisory Council (BAC)
A summary of the meeting topics was included in the External Affairs Committee meeting
packet.

•

Community Advisory Council (CAC)
Ms. Barb Clint mentioned that NOACA staff presented CAC with information on the
following: NOACA’s position on the proposed fees for transportation infrastructure, SFY
2019 4th quarter project planning review (PPR), SFY 2021-2024 TIP development update,
and the new 208 Plan draft development.
Ms. Clint mentioned that CAC discussed educating others on the disparity of the funding
distribution and received a report on the Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative
(TLCI) workshop. She noted that the workshop attendees discussed the following:
Alignment between Cleveland’s program and NOACA’s process; helping sponsors who
do not have the funds for engineering or the local match; and sponsors possibly applying
for funding through the foundations.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that CAC members had some concerns about the previous TLCI
process. She noted that CAC would like communities to have input into project
applications submitted to NOACA. She said one of the suggestions mentioned at the TLCI
workshop is to have the applicant host a public meeting/hearing for their project.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA is planning to modify the TLCI application process and
submit it to the Board for review.

 Commissioner Lundy commented that people in the communities need to be educated on
the distribution of gas tax funds.
•

Rural Advisory Council (RAC)
Commissioner Lundy read a meeting summary from Ms. Jeanene Kress, Chair of RAC.
In the summary, Ms. Kress provided an overview of RAC’s responsibilities and recapped
the previous RAC meeting, which included presentations on the following: NOACA’s
position on the proposed fees for transportation infrastructure; SFY 2019 4th quarter
project planning review (PPR); SFY 2021–2024 TIP development update – potential
projects for NOACA controlled funds; and the new 208 Plan draft development.
Commissioner Lundy stated that some townships in Lorain County are still trying to figure
out the value of NOACA. He noted that township trustees have had discussions about
transit and feel it does not benefit their residents. Commissioner Lundy mentioned that
RAC was not in favor of developing a Rural Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO)
and believe NOACA is doing a good job.

Public Involvement
No public comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci introduced Ms. Danielle Render, Director of External Engagement and Public
Affairs at NOACA. Ms. Gallucci discussed Ms. Render’s education and experience.
Ms. Gallucci reported on the following:
•

The SFY 2020-2021 State Transportation Budget was approved on April 3, 2019. The
budget includes a 10.5 cent gas tax increase, making the gas tax 38.5 cents. The
resolution passed by the NOACA Board was meaningful to the process because it helped
to inform and guide legislators.

•

NOACA’s Meet and Greet was held on March 8, 2019. The event was well received and
it contributed to the gas tax discussion.

•

NOACA Transportation Day will be held at Cleveland State University (CSU) Maxine
Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs on May 3, 2019, 9:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. Elected
officials and city managers in the region will be invited to help NOACA advance regional
cohesion. Mr. Jack Marchbanks, ODOT Director, will speak during the morning session.
In the afternoon, there will be breakout sessions and participants will discuss the U.S.
Census and how to help the region get more federal funds.

•

The Van Aken District will receive the National APA Planning Award, which will be given
out at an event in San Francisco on April 15, 2019. NOACA committed $5.4 million to the
Van Aken project.

•

NOACA will be doing stakeholder / community outreach for the Great Lakes Hyperloop
System feasibility study and the 208 Clean Water Quality Plan.

•

The 2019 Ohio Conference on Freight will be held at Westin Cleveland Downtown on
August 7-9, 2019.

 Chair’s Report
Commissioner Lundy expressed his thanks to the NOACA Board for sending the gas tax
resolution to Columbus and to Governor Mike DeWine for developing the gas tax increase
proposal.
ACTION ITEMS
No action items were presented at this meeting.
PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Update on Ohio’s Motor Fuel User Fee Increase
Ms. Beverly Burtzlaff provided an update on Ohio’s motor fuel user fee increase. She highlighted
several items in the transportation bill, including the gasoline user fee increase of 10.5 cents; a
diesel fuel increase of 19 cents; transit funding that will be increased to $70 million; and the
ODOT/local split of 55% - 45%. She noted that the bill does not include indexing to inflation.
Ms. Burtzlaff mentioned that the NOACA region will receive an additional $46.3 million annually
from the gas tax increase, bringing the total amount to $119.7 million. She said staff will continue
to work with the Committee to advocate for an equitable return of state transportation dollars to
Northeast Ohio, for prioritization of maintenance over new capacity, and for a long-term dedicated
funding source for public transit.
Councilman Dale Miller asked if the ODOT / local split that was changed from 60%-40% to 55%45% applies only to the new gas tax funds or all gas tax funds. Ms. Burtzlaff said she believed
the split would apply only to new dollars. Ms. Gallucci stated that with the original formula, debt
service was taken off the top, thereby providing ODOT 70% and local governments 30% of the
funds. She said there is no debt against the new money yet and noted there was some discussion
about putting some language in the new bill regarding debt service.
Mr. Tom Jordan asked if the legislature ever explained why counties receive equal funding shares.
Ms. Burtzlaff said no good explanation was given. She talked about the inequity of the distribution
formulas.
Commissioner Lundy stated that he would like to make sure the $70 million pledged for transit
actually ends up in the budget that must be completed by June 30th. He suggested that NOACA
send a resolution to the state legislature requesting a commitment of that amount. Ms. Gallucci
stated that staff will prepare a resolution for the Board meeting in June.
Hyperloop Stakeholder Engagement Meetings
Ms. Render stated that the Great Lakes Hyperloop System consulting team is progressing with
the technical feasibility design. Ms. Render reviewed the process; provided background on the
consulting team, Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS); explained the
outreach that will be done; and reviewed the Hyperloop Corridor, Alternative Analysis Feasibility
Study, goals for the public stakeholder process, audience = communications (key stakeholders,
outreach audiences, content marketing/branding, communications / notifications), and outreach
activities (creating an atmosphere for gathering and using non-traditional, creative, grassroots
approaches).
Chief McCall asked if a stakeholder meeting was held in Cleveland on April 11th.
said yes.

Ms. Render

 Chief McCall suggested that NOACA staff hold a couple more local meetings, preferably in the
evening so more people can attend them. She also suggested that staff hold a meeting at the
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA).
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) meeting was held on April 11th
and was attended by NOACA’s partners, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT). She mentioned that NOACA is planning to hold more
stakeholder meetings, including one for the public.
Commissioner Lundy asked about the timeline of the Hyperloop project. Ms. Sarli stated that the
feasibility study will be completed this summer. Commissioner Lundy asked if there has been
any discussion on the timeline of the actual project.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the feasibility study was originally supposed to be completed this spring,
but was moved to the summer because of public outreach. She noted that staff wanted to make
sure there are alternatives and other information to share with the public. She also noted that
efforts are being made to add Pittsburgh to the Hyperloop route, which may push out the timeline,
as well.
Ms. Gallucci announced that Dr. Alex Metcalf will provide an update on the Great Lakes Hyperloop
feasibility study at the Planning and Programming Committee meeting. Ms. Gallucci invited
External Affairs Committee members to that meeting.
External Engagement and Affairs Model
Ms. Render provided an overview of the 2019 focus areas for the Committee and reviewed the
following: External Affairs operating model; tools of engagement (key messages and brand
identity); NOACA’s approach (vision, goals and priorities, focus areas, and impact); areas of
effectiveness; governance and compliance (four plans/policies); engagement platforms (agencywide calendar of events and cross marketing promotions, events and messaging); social media
(purpose driven messaging); content marketing (smartphone use, 3M Connect, and photo clicks);
and web analytics.
Councilman Matt Zone stated that he would like NOACA to be more effective in social media and
get more involved in the Vision Zero concept, which is a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities
and severe injuries. He said the region cannot have equitable mobility transportation unless it is
safe. He said he would like to make a presentation later in the year to the full NOACA Board
about the work being done related to this initiative. He mentioned several stakeholders who have
been working with the City of Cleveland on having zero fatalities in this region. He said he would
like to see the following: NOACA’s External Engagement and Public Affairs Division educating
people; NOACA forming an internal working group; and NOACA taking a more active role.
Chief McCall stated that the presentation given by Ms. Render was very good, informative and
clear. Chief McCall suggested that NOACA take the same messaging and communicate it to
Board members and their alternates. She said she liked the idea of NOACA being more
interactive with the communities.
Commissioner Lundy stated that as the Committee tries to promote NOACA, especially when it
comes to branding, it would be helpful if staff could break it down into safe roads, getting people
to work, and putting people to work. He said it is critical for this region to have a safe transportation
system. Commissioner Lundy stated that he would like to know the public’s perception of the
NOACA brand.

 External Affairs Committee – NOACA Dialogue Series
Ms. Render reviewed the goals of NOACA’s dialogue series. She discussed creating a podcast,
explained how it would be used and the purpose of it; reviewed steps to develop the content
marketing; and talked about the tools to use to market, promote and generate brand awareness.
Ms. Render stated that the initial cost to set up a podcast with a monthly network is $12,000,
which could be paid with sponsorships. She stated that the next steps would involve the External
Affairs Committee assisting staff with naming the podcast series, reviewing sponsorship
proposals, creating a list of topics and discussion items, and reviewing a list of proposed podcast
hosts.
Chief McCall stated that the podcast is a good way to promote the NOACA brand to the public.
She expressed some concern about seeking sponsors for support. She said she would like
NOACA to try and do the work internally to ensure there are no compatibility issues between the
sponsor and NOACA from a policy perspective. She suggested that NOACA staff look at internal
funding to pay for the dialogue series.
Commissioner Lundy suggested that NOACA take a look at sponsorship policies created by other
agencies. Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA uses a policy for its Annual Meeting. She noted that
a request for proposal (RFP) is prepared and released to the public so everyone has an
opportunity to be a sponsor. Ms. Gallucci stated that staff was not looking to spend any funds on
a podcast. However, it is the Board’s prerogative to make budget changes.
Commissioner Lundy suggested that staff look at getting other government agencies to be
sponsors, such as ODOT. Ms. Nancy Griffith commented that NOACA and ODOT may not always
be on the same side of an issue.
Ms. Gallucci stated that it makes sense for NOACA to move forward with the podcast without
sponsors. She said NOACA would have freedom and would be responsible and accountable for
the content.
Ms. Clint asked how close NOACA is to selecting podcast hosts. Ms. Render said plans are
preliminary, but welcomed suggestions from the Committee.
Chief McCall asked staff to be mindful of potential issues that could develop with using hosts.
She suggested that NOACA use staff, Board members and their alternates.
Councilman Zone stated that a podcast could be an effective tool to reach out to local communities
and a great way for people, who cannot attend NOACA meetings, to get information.
Ms. Gallucci stated that if a budget is created for the podcast, it will need to be approved by the
Board.

Previous presentations have been made to the External Affairs Committee regarding public involvement
and strategy to gain exposure, comments, and discussions from decision makers and communities

The plan has been used as a resource guide to help NOACA identify stakeholders and convey the
principles of selecting types of groups for engagement.
The next step will be implementing the strategic planning process to ensure there is a framework for allowing
input during the public involvement process. NOACA will update the committee on the type of approaches
and engagement tools that will be used to create on-going communications to support a well-planned effort
for public participation.
