Revenue Cycle Update

Metrics Report
Patient Financial Proposed Policies
Revenue Cycle Organizational Chart

The following representatives from MedAssets presented an update on the revenue cycle project: Robert Wright;
Gretchen Ryan; Albert De La Cruz and Victor Zamora. The information presented included a metrics report, a
revenue cycle organizational chart and patient ?nancial proposed policies.

Metrics Report

Ms. Ryan and Mr. Wright provided an update of progress made in revenue cycle activities. Mr. Wright informed
the Committee that by ?scal year end, the average cash receipts will have improved by $15 million; this exceeds
eXpectations. He added that the underpinning structure needed to sustain this revenue growth is still a work in
progress.

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the amount was inclusive of any fees that are paid to MedAssets. MedAssets?
fee structure was explained by David Small, Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System. The $15 million estimate is not inclusive of fees.

Patient Financial Proposed Policies

Mr. De La Cruz presented information on the proposed patient ?nancial policies; he stated that these are based
upon ?best practices? components from several other institutions, including Parkland Health and Hospital System in
Dallas, and are tied to the federal indigent poverty levels.

The Committee discussed the proposal in detail. There were questions relating to the proposed policy?s lack of a
sliding fee scale. Mr. Wright stated that these proposals were not intended to limit access; rather they are intended
to establish guidelines. Director O?Donnell stated that she would like to see different options presented on basic
principles of charity care policy.

Director O?Donnell inquired regarding the issue of identity requirements as they relate to the proposed policy
changes. The current policy was provided at the request of Director Golden; information was provided by
MedAssets of the options available for reimbursement for emergency care for undocumented patients. Concerns
were raised on how policy changes could impact a patient?s choice of whether or not to seek medical care.

Questions were raised on communication issues with regard to policy changes; Mr. De La Cruz stated that these
changes would be communicated to the public within at least thirty days prior to implementation. Director Ramirez
stated that public input should be sought prior to the determination of policy change.

On the subject of patient access policies, Mr. Zamora stated that starting on Monday, November pre-
registration and insurance veri?cation will be implemented. Mr. Wright explained further: they will begin to screen
patients scheduled for elective services (de?ned as non?emergent or urgent) for insurance verification. If the
patient is self-pay or uninsured, the patient will be required to submit certain documentation in order to determine
eligibility for any available federal or state programs. If the patient is ineligible for such programs, there will be a
financial counselor who will present options for alternative means of paying for the elective service. Mr. Wright
stated that the inducement is to gain compliance with documentation required to achieve eligibility.

In response to a question from Director O?Donnell concerning the ability of in-house staff to be able to .carry out
the policy changes, Mr. Small stated that the twenty in-house staff will be augmented by seventy individuals from
MedAssets. Director Mu?oz requested a roster of how all of the in-house and MedAssets staff will be deployed; he
stated that ultimately these services should be staffed in-house.

Revenue Cycle Organizational Chart

Ms. Ryan referenced three charts distributed for review: one chart describes how it is currently organized from a
revenue cycle perspective; the second chart shows the Parkland model; and the third chart is the organization
recommended for the System by MedAssets.

Questions were raised with regard to the reporting chain relating to the interim revenue cycle of?cer. Additionally,
Chairman Carvalho inquired why revenue and purchasing did not report to the Chief Financial Of?cer. Directors
Golden and O?Donnell agreed that revenue should be under the Chief Financial Of?cer, as it is the largest part of
?nance.

Director Mu?oz asked whether the System has ever had a revenue cycle of?cer prior to MedAssets? involvement.
Mr. Small replied in the negative.

Director O?Donnell asked for clari?cation of what was being requested with the presentation of the proposal. Mr.
Small responded that the draft was being presented for their comments, recommendations and questions.

Ms. Ryan concluded the presentation by stating that the next presentation for the Finance Committee at an
upcoming meeting will be on the ?nancial counseling re-design plan; expanded revenue cycle metrics will also be
provided.

At the request of Chairman Carvalho, Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System, provided an update to the Committee on the status of the ongoing disconnects with the County
purchasing department on procurement issues. There have been dif?culties with processing of Board-approved
items; they are also running into issues of getting payment on items. Chairman Carvalho gave as an example the
Access to Care contract approved by the Board months ago; he wondered why this contract has not yet been
?nalized.

Ms. Duffy stated that there are ongoing communications with County purchasing; they are trying to ascertain where
the disconnect is occurring. She provided information on timefrarnes experienced for certain actions; it was stated
that it could take four to six months to get a purchase order out for a new contract. She stated that she is working
on having fail-safes in place, by using a checklist which would be checked at each step of the process. She added
that she: would provide a copy of the checklist at the next Committee meeting so the Directors can review the
process .

Ms. Duffy stated that she would prepare a report detailing the status of each of the contracts since she has been in
the position. Director Mu?oz requested that a sample of large contracts, such as the Access to Care contract, be
provided with the timeline of where they are in the process.

Chairman Carvalho asked what would happen to contracts whose paperwork is not processed prior to the end of the
?scal year.

Ms. Duffy stated that she would ?nd out and report back to the Committee.

Mr. Small responded to Chairman Carvalho?s question, stating that the County typically holds open for roughly two
months past ?scal year end in order for business to be concluded.
