Summary: The Preserves is bidding out a contract for row crop production at select sites which were
historically used for agricultural purposes prior to acquisition by the Preserves, and as such, do not exist
in an ecologically natural state. Farmers will have use of the property for seeding one or more of the
following row crops: wheat, oats, soybeans, and/or corn. This practice allows the Preserves to generate
revenue, while at the same time preventing invasive plant species from taking over fallow land. It is the
Preserve’s intention to restore fallow land wherever possible and these farming practices are a good
method to keep these lands in a more manageable condition until a restoration project can take place on
the site. The contract term for row crop farming is a period of one (1) year, with four (4) one-year
renewal options to be exercised by the General Superintendent or his/her designee, which gives the
Preserves the option to discontinue farming practices in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.
Jeffery Heinsohn was the highest responsible bidder for row crop site #3, Janura Preserve, for a total
potential revenue generation over the next five (5) years of $71,412.00. Jeffery Heinsohn was the sole
bidder for this site.

education, recreation and volunteer programs. In addition, programming needs often require shuttle bus
transportation between program sites and parking areas. Four (4) bus companies are being awarded a
contract because one (1) company cannot provide all of the services needed by the Preserves
programming and volunteer teams, due to scheduling, program needs, type of bus, etc. The Forest
Preserve put out an RFP for bus transportation services in November 2017 and received seven (7)
proposals and these four (4) were chosen for their pricing and ability to provide required services.

Summary: Additional time and funding is required to complete the site improvements and nature play
project at Dan Ryan Woods. The initial phase of site improvements were completed in 2016. A second
phase of remaining site improvements, including the nature play area, was on hold during the state Open
Space Land Acquisition & Development (OSLAD) grant suspension. This second phase of site
improvements was bid twice, and awarded by the Board on 12/12/2017. During the gap between the two
Dan Ryan Woods contracts, Amec was assigned management of other new time sensitive projects,
including picnic shelter repairs and picnic grove access and drainage improvements, as well as continuing
to resolve issues with a few projects that have suffered prolonged delays. With original PM/OR funds
now exhausted, additional are needed to manage the second phase of work at Dan Ryan Woods. This
new $1.1 million construction contract includes unique outdoor recreation features that warrant additional
oversight. The increase amount represents 6% of the contract value.
The Amec team has been involved in this project from its inception and has unique knowledge of the
contract documents and prior phases of construction. Their continued involvement during the
construction is critical to its success.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS

Department:

Law Enforcement Department

Request: Authority to Retire, Donate, and Reimburse Veterinary Expenditures for Canine Officers
Summary: The Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) has and maintains several
canines trained as cadaver-search dogs within the Law Enforcement Department. The Preserves
requests authority to retire and transfer ownership of any dog nine (9) years or older, any dog unable to
perform the routine duties for medical or other reasons, or any dog that exceeds the recommended
maximum number of handlers to the canine’s current or a former handler, or any other organization or
individual qualified to care for dogs that have heightened training for law enforcement purposes.
Consistent with the recently enacted Illinois Public Act 099-0817, the Police Dog Retirement Act,
canines that no longer are fit for public service will be offered to their existing handlers first prior to being
considered for donation to any other capable individual or organization.
To facilitate care of these canine officers, the Preserves also seeks approval to set aside up to $3,500 in
funds for reimbursement of fifty percent (50%) of any expenditures by the recipient of the donated canine
for veterinary care (excluding food, water, vitamins, and nutritional supplements) for each canine officer
over the lifetime of the canine.
