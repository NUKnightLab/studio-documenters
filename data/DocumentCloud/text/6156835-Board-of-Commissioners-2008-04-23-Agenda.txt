support and assistance with this endeavor; and
WHEREAS, Stanley A. Molis, Director of the Department for Management of Information Systems for
Cook County, and his staff provided key coordination for this undertaking; and

Sec. 2-6. Building construction.
ITEM #10 cont’d
(a)
In this section the term "Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)"
means a green building rating system promulgated by the United States Green Building Council
(USGBC) that provides specific principles and practices, some mandatory but the majority discretionary,
that may be applied during the design, construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be
awarded points from reaching present standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building, as such rating system exists on November 7, 2002.
(b)
The County does hereby order the Department of Capital Planning and Policy to take the
steps necessary to assure that all newly constructed buildings and all buildings scheduled for capital
improvement are designed, built, and operated in accordance with the standards and requirements of the
LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, and does further order that each new building must
meet the requirements for LEED certification.

The USGBC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green Building Rating
System every three years; and Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED when
beginning a new building construction permit project or renovation.
(d)
With specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category, because achieving
increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code standards is the surest way of realizing
significant operational cost savings, all buildings shall set a goal to obtain a total of at least eight points in
this category.
(e)
The County also orders that LEED Existing Building rating system be used during
retrofit projects of its current standing structures and does further order that each retrofitted building shall
meet the requirements for LEED certification for existing buildings.

TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT PUBLIC INFORMATION ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, a total of $800 million in property tax revenue was captured by tax increment finance (TIF)
districts in Cook County in 2006, including over $500 million in the City of Chicago alone; and
WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts (TIFs) off the tax rolls effectively
narrows the tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would otherwise need to be, leading to
higher tax bills for all property taxpayers in the County; and
WHEREAS, County tax bills identify those properties located in TIF districts, but do not indicate how
much in taxes from each property is distributed to the TIF district; and
WHEREAS, some parcels, including 77 West Wacker Drive in Chicago, the headquarters of United
Airlines, pay 100 percent of their property taxes to the TIF district in which they are located, even though
the amounts shown on the tax bill suggest that taxing districts such as the local school district, County,
and Forest Preserve District are receiving the revenue; and
WHEREAS, the Civic Federation issued a call in November 2007 for greater transparency in TIF
program finances; and
WHEREAS, the County Clerk has initiated an effort to provide the public with more information about
TIFs and has already produced user-friendly versions of the annual TIF distribution report and a web page
devoted to TIFs; and

Department of Revenue to conduct “a study to determine the feasibility for each county to include, on the
property tax bills for each taxpayer in that county, information concerning any tax increment financing
project that affects the taxpayer,” and to submit the study to the Governor and General Assembly by April
1, 2008; and

The Clerk and Treasurer, in conjunction with the County’s Department for Management

The Clerk and Treasurer are requested to submit to the Finance Committee of the Board
reports on or before January 1 and July 1 of each year describing progress on the changes to tax bills
described in (d)(1) and (d)(2) above and any obstacles to completion of these changes by the intended

(f)
The Clerk and Treasurer shall determine if and when the changes described in (d)(1) and

WHEREAS, keeping the growth in property value in TIF districts off the tax rolls effectively narrows the
tax base and forces tax rates to be higher than they would otherwise need to be, leading to higher tax bills
for all property taxpayers in the County; and

WHEREAS, the establishment of a TIF district in a municipality in Cook County requires the approval
of a joint review board, on which the County holds only one seat, meaning that the County alone cannot
stop the creation of a TIF district to which it may be opposed; and
WHEREAS, certain other units of government which collect property taxes from the area contained
within a proposed TIF district, such as the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, are not members of
the joint review board and are therefore excluded from the decision-making process; and
WHEREAS, because the establishment of TIF districts restricts the future tax base, and therefore
significantly impacts the County’s budgetary and taxation policies, the Board should play a more active
role in the process governing the creation and modification of Cook County TIF districts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Section 74-45, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 74-45. Approval of proposed tax increment finance (TIF) districts.
(a) Upon receipt of any study or proposal pertaining to the creation, renewal, or extension of
any TIF district, the County’s joint review board representative shall transmit copies of said study or
proposal and date of the relevant joint review board meeting to the Board for referral to the Finance
Committee.
(b) The Board shall inform the County’s joint review board representative of its position on
each TIF proposal by means of a resolution. The County’s joint review board representative shall vote as
instructed by the Board.
(c) If the Board of Commissioners does not approve a resolution directing how the County’s
joint review board representative shall vote on any TIF proposal prior to the meeting of the joint review
board at which such TIF proposal will be considered, the County’s representative shall abstain from
voting.
Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect upon adoption.

Section 74-152, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:

Meeting of April 23, 2008

PROPOSED ORDINANCES continued
ITEM #14 cont’d
ARTICLE IV. RETAILERS' OCCUPATION TAX
Sec. 74-152. Back-to-School tax holiday.
(a)
No tax is imposed under this Act upon the privilege of using, in this State, qualified
merchandise that is purchased at retail from a retailer if the qualified merchandise is purchased during the
holiday period.
(b)

For the purpose of this Section:

Holiday period means the period from 12:01 a.m. on the first Friday in August through midnight
of the Sunday follows 9 days later.
Qualified merchandise means:
(1)

school supplies;

(2)

an article of clothing or footwear that is purchased for a selling price of $200 or
less; and

(3)

a computer that is purchased for a selling price of $3,000 or less.

Clothing or footwear means an article of apparel designed to be worn about the human body. The
term does not include accessories such as jewelry, handbags, purses, briefcases, luggage, wallets,
watches, and similar items that are carried on or about the human body, without regard to whether the
item is worn on the body in a manner that is characteristic of clothing.
Computer means a central processing unit for personal use plus any peripheral sold with it and
any computer software installed in it at the time of purchase. The term "computer” includes desktop
computers, laptop computers, hand-held computers, and personal digital assistants. The term “computer"
does not include any device designed primarily for video game applications. The term "peripheral"
includes any monitor, keyboard, printer, scanner, web/PC camera, microphone, external drive, network
card, internal drive, and additional storage.
School supplies means pens, pencils, erasers, crayons, notebooks, notebook filler paper, legal
pads, composition books, poster paper, scissors, cellophane tape, glue or paste, rulers, protractors,
compasses, calculators, and similar items commonly used by students for school purposes.
(c) For the purpose of this Section, a "purchase" occurs during the tax holiday if the buyer places
an order and pays the purchase price by cash or credit during the tax holiday period regardless of whether
the delivery of the item occurs after the tax holiday period. An item of qualified merchandise that is
placed in a layaway or similar deferred plan during the holiday period is not eligible for the exemption
unless the item is delivered to the purchaser during the period. An item that was placed in a layaway or
similar deferred plan before the holiday period and is then delivered to the purchaser during the holiday
period is eligible for the exemption.
(d) Any discount, coupon, or other credit offered either by the retailer or by a vendor of the
retailer to reduce the final price to the customer must be taken into account in determining the selling
price of the item for the purposes of this holiday. If the price of an item is free or reduced with the
purchase of another item, then the total price of the items may not be averaged in order for both items to
qualify for the holiday. The amount of any rebate may not be considered when determining the selling
price of the item for the purposes of this holiday.

Meeting of April 23, 2008

COMMISSIONERS continued
PROPOSED ORDINANCES continued
ITEM #14 cont’d
(e) Articles that are normally sold as a unit must continue to be sold in that manner; they may not
be priced separately and sold as individual items in order to be subject to the holiday. For example, if a
pair of shoes sells for $220, the pair cannot be split in order to sell each shoe for $110 to qualify for the
holiday. If a uniform is normally priced at $250 on a single price tag, the uniform cannot be split into
separate articles so that any of the components may be sold for less than $200 in order to qualify for the
holiday. Components that are normally priced as separate articles, however, may continue to be sold as
separate articles.
(f) Qualified merchandise that customers purchase during the holiday period with the use of a rain
check qualifies for the holiday regardless of when the rain check was issued. The issuance of a rain
check, however, during the holiday period does not qualify merchandise for the exemption if the
merchandise is actually purchased after the holiday period.
(g) If a customer purchases an item of qualified merchandise during the holiday period but later
exchanges the item for a substantially similar item of a different size, different color, or other feature, then
no additional tax is due even if the exchange is made after the holiday period. If a customer purchases an
item of qualified merchandise during the holiday period, but after the holiday period has ended, the
customer returns the item and receives credit on the purchase of a different item, then the newly
purchased item is subject to the full tax rate. If a customer purchases an item of qualified merchandise
before the holiday period, but during the holiday period, the customer returns the item and receives credit
on the purchase of a different item of qualified merchandise, then the newly purchased item is subject to
the exemption.
Effective date. This Ordinance act takes effect upon becoming law.

CONTRACT RENEWAL
ITEM #30
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend and renew Contract No. 04-42-267 with
Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas, for the purchase of reagents and supplies for a vendor provided
serum protein immuno fixative electrophoreses (spife) analyzer and Cliniscan (Quikscan) 3 densitometer
for the Pathology Department, Division of Immunology.
Reason:

performs up to sixty (60) patient samples in three (3) minutes or less. These tests diagnose
acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, albumn levels, paraproteinemia and other diseases.
The amendment is due to additional reagents and supplies for hemoglobin tests performed on
equipment owned by the hospital.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $114,240.00 ($57,120.00 per year). Contract period: May 1, 2008 through
April 30, 2010. (897-365 Account). Requisition No. 88970358.

Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Cook County, Illinois and Incorporated
Areas. As a condition of its continued eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program, and in
accordance with Section 44 CFR 60.3(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations for the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP), Cook County is amending its current (November 2, 2000 as amended April 3,
2007) Floodplain Ordinance to reflect the following new FIRM effective date of August 19, 2008.

Designated floodway means the channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the
floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and
convey the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due
to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities.
(1) The floodways are designated on the Countywide flood insurance rate map for Cook
County number 17031C panels 64-69, 206 and 207 dated April 16, 2007, panels 15, 20 and

(2) To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway
boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan,
using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine
the exact location of the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted
for the interpretation.
(3) The terms designated floodway and "floodway" are synonymous for purposes of this
chapter.
