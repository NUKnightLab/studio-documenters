C. Disadvantages Business Enterprise (DBEs)

GENERAL COMPLIANCE, 40 CFR, Part 33

The recipient agrees to comply with the requirements of EPA's Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise (DBE) Program for procurement activities under assistance agreements, contained
in 40 CFR, Part 33.

REPORTING, 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart 

The recipient agrees to complete and submit a Utilization Under Federal Grants

and Cooperative Agreements? report (EPA Form 5700-52A) on an annual basis. The current
EPA Form 5700-52A can be found at the EPA Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business

Utilization?s Home Page at 

reporting is required in annual reports. Reporting is required for assistance
agreements where

there are funds budgeted for procuring construction, equipment, services and supplies,
including funds budgeted for direct procurement by the recipient or procurement under
subawards or loans in the ?Other? category with a cumulative total that exceed the threshold
amount of $250,000, including amendments and/or modifications. The recipient must make
reporting a requirement of all sub-awards/loans. All procurement actions are reportable, notjust
that portion which exceeds $250,000.

When completing the annual report, recipients are instructed to check the box titled ?annual" in
section ?13 of the form. For the final report, recipients are instructed to check the box titled
?annual" and the box indicated for the ?last report? of the project in section 13 of the form.
Annual reports are due by October 30th of each year. Final reports are due by October 30th or
90 days after the end of the project period, whichever comes first.

The reporting requirement is based on total procurements. Recipients with expended and/or
budgeted funds for procurement are required to report annually whether the planned
procurements take place during the reporting period or not. If no budgeted procurements take
place during the reporting period, the recipient should check the box in section 58 when
completing the form.

Based on review of the planned budget, this award meets the conditions above and is
subject to the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Program reporting requirements.
However, if the recipient believes this award does not meet these conditions, it must provide a
justification and budget detail within 21 days of the award date clearly demonstrating that,
based on the planned budget, this award is not subject to the DBE reporting requirements to
the Regional or Headquarters point of contact defined in the correspondence condition, if
applicable.

This provision represents an approved deviation from the reporting requirements as
described in 40 CFR, Part 33, Section 33.502; however, the other requirements outlined in 40
CFR Part 33 remain in effect, including the Good Faith Effort requirements as described in 40
CFR Part 33 Subpart C, and Fair Share Objectives negotiation as described in 40 CFR Part 33
Subpart and explained below.

FAIR SHARE OBJECTIVES, 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart 

A recipient must negotiate with the appropriate EPA award official, or his/her designee, fair
share objectives for MBE and WBE participation in procurement under the financial assistance
agreements.

In accordance with 40 CFR, Section 33.411 some recipients may be exempt from the fair share
objectives requirements as described in 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart D. Recipients should work
with their DBE coordinator, if they think their organization may qualify for an exemption.

Accepting the Fair Share Objectives/Goals of Another Recipient

The dollar amount of this assistance agreement, or the total dollar amount of all of the
recipient?s financial assistance agreements in the current federal fiscal year from EPA is
$250,000, or more. The recipient accepts the applicable fair share objectives/goals
negotiated with EPA by the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes Energy as
follows:

MBE: 10%
WBE: 7.50%

By signing this financial assistance agreement, the recipient is accepting the fair share
objectives/goals stated above and attests to the fact that it is purchasing the same or similar
construction, supplies, services and equipment, in the same or similar relevant geographic
buying market as_Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes Energy.

Negotiating Fair Share ObjectivesIGoals, 40 CFR, Section 33.404

The recipient has the option to negotiate its own fair share objectives/goals. If the
recipient wishes to negotiate its own fair share objectives/goals, the recipient agrees
to submit proposed objectives/goals based on an availability analysis, or disparity
study, of qualified MBEs and WBEs in their relevant geographic buying market for construction,
services, supplies and equipment.

The submission of proposed fair share goals with the supporting analysis or disparity study
means that the recipient is not accepting the fair share objectives/goals of another recipient.
The recipient agrees to submit proposed fair share objectives/goals, together with the
supporting availability analysis or disparity study, to the Regional Coordinator within
120 days of its acceptance of the financial assistance award. EPA will respond to the proposed
fair share objective/goals within 30 days of receiving the submission. If proposed fair share
objective/goals are not received within the 120 daytime frame, the recipient may not expend its
EPA funds for procurements until the proposed fair share objective/goals are submitted.

SIX GOOD FAITH EFFORTS, 40 CFR, Part 33, Subpart 

Pursuant to 40 CFR, Section 33.301, the recipient agrees to make the following good faith
efforts whenever procuring construction, equipment, services and supplies under an EPA
financial assistance agreement, and to require that sub-recipients, loan recipients, and prime
contractors also comply. Records documenting compliance with the six good faith efforts shall
be retained:

Ensure DBEs are made aware of contracting opportunities to the fullest extent
practicable through outreach and recruitment activities. For Indian Tribal, State and
Local and Government recipients, this will include placing DBEs on solicitation lists and
soliciting them whenever they are potential sources.

Make information on forthcoming opportunities available to DBEs and arrange time
frames for contracts and establish delivery schedules, where the requirements permit, in
a way that encourages and facilitates participation by DBEs in the competitive process.

This includes, whenever possible, posting solicitations for bids or proposals for a
minimum of 30 calendar days before the bid or proposal closing date.

Consider in the contracting process whether firms competing for large contracts
could subcontract with DBEs. For Indian Tribal, State and local Government recipients,
this will include dividing total requirements when economically feasible into smaller tasks
or quantities to permit maximum participation by DBEs in the competitive process.

Encourage contracting with a consortium of DBEs when a contract is too large for
one of these firms to handle individually.

Use the services and assistance of the SBA and the Minority Business Development
Agency of the Department of Commerce.

If the prime contractor awards subcontracts, require the prime contractor to take the
steps in paragraphs through of this section.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS, 40 CFR, Section 33.302

The recipient agrees to comply with the contract administration provisions of 40 CFR, Section
33.302.

BIDDERS LIST, 40 CFR, Section 33.501(b) and 

Recipients of a Continuing Environmental Program Grant or other annual reporting grant, agree
to create and maintain a bidders list. Recipients of an EPA financial assistance agreement to
capitalize a revolving loan fund also agree to require entities receiving identi?ed loans to create
and maintain a bidders list if the recipient of the loan is subject to, or chooses to follow,
competitive bidding requirements. Please see 40 CFR, Section 33.501 and for specific
requirements and exemptions.

Cooperative Agreements with Cleanup Activities usinq Hazardous Waste Funding - Governmental
En??es

DAVIS BACON PREVAILING WAGE TERM AND CONDITION

The following terms and conditions specify how Cooperative Agreement Recipients (CARS) will assist EPA
in meeting its Davis-Bacon (DB) responsibilities when DB applies to EPA awards of financial assistance
under CERCLA 104(9) and any other statute which makes DB applicable to EPA ?nancial assistance. If a
CAR has questions regarding when DB applies, obtaining the correct DB wage determinations, DB
contract provisions, or DB compliance monitoring, they should contact the regional Brownfields
Coordinator or Project Officer.

1. Applicability of the Davis Bacon Prevailing Wage Requirements

For the purposes of this term and condition, EPA has determined that all construction, alteration and
repair activity involving the remediation of hazardous substances, including excavation and removal of
hazardous substances, construction of caps, barriers, structures which house treatment equipment, and
abatement of contamination in buildings, is subject to DB. If CAR encounters a unique situation at a site
that presents uncertainties regarding DB applicability, the CAR must discuss the situation with EPA before
authorizing work on that site.

2. Obtaining Wade Determinations

 

Unless otherwise instructed by EPA on a project specific basis, the CAR shall use the following

DOL General Wage Classifications for the locality in which the construction activity subject to DB
will take place. CARs must obtain wage determinations for specific localities at



When soliciting competitive contracts or issuing task orders, work assignments or similar
instruments to existing contractors (ordering instruments) for, the excavation and removal
of hazardous substances, construction of caps, barriers, and similar activities that do not
involve construction of buildings CAR shall use the ?Heavy Construction? Classi?cation.

(ii) When soliciting competitive contracts or issuing ordering instruments for the construction
of structures which house treatment equipment, and abatement of contamination in
buildings (other than residential structures less than 4 stories in height) CAR shall use
?Building Construction" classification.

When soliciting competitive contracts or issuing ordering instruments for the abatement of
contamination in residential structures less than 4 stories in height the CAR shall use
?Residential Construction? classi?cation.

Note: CARS must discuss unique situations that may not be covered by the General Wage
Classifications described above with EPA. lf, based on discussions with a CAR, EPA determines
that DB applies to a unique situation the Agency will advise the CAR which General Wage
Classification to use based on the nature of the construction activity at the site.

CARS shall obtain the wage determination for the locality in which a Brown?elds cleanup activity
subject to DB will take place prior to issuing requests for bids, proposals, quotes or other methods for
soliciting contracts (solicitation) for activities subject to DB. These wage determinations shall be
incorporated into solicitations and any subsequent contracts. Prime contracts must contain a provision
requiring that subcontractors follow the wage determination incorporated into the prime contract.

While the solicitation remains open, the CAR shall monitor 
on a weekly basis to ensure that the wage determination contained in the solicitation remains
current. The CAR shall amend the solicitation if DOL issues a modification more than 10 days
prior to the closing date bid opening) for the solicitation. If DOL modifies or supersedes
the applicable wage determination less than 10 days prior to the closing date, the CAR may
request a ?nding from EPA that there is not a reasonable time to notify interested contractors
of the modification of the wage determination. EPA will provide a report of the Agency?s
finding to the CAR.

(ii) If the CAR does not award the contract within 90 days of the closure of the solicitation, any
modi?cations or determination contained in the solicitation shall be effective unless EPA, at
the request of the CAR, obtains an extension of the 90?day period from DOL pursuant to 29
CFR The CAR shall monitor on a weekly basis if it does not
award the contract within 90 days of closure of the solicitation to ensure that wage
determinations contained in the solicitation remain current.

If the CAR carries out Brownfield cleanup activity subject to DB by issuing a task order, work
assignment or similar instrument to an existing contractor (ordering instrument) rather than by
publishing a solicitation, the CAR shall insert the appropriate DOL wage determination from
into the ordering instrument.

CARs shall review all subcontracts subject to DB entered into by prime contractors to verify that
the prime contractor has required its subcontractors to include the applicable wage determinations.

As provided in 29 CFR DOL may issue a revised wage determination applicable to a CAR's

contract after the award of a contract or the issuance of an ordering instrument if DOL determines that
the CAR has failed to incorporate a wage determination or has used a wage determination that clearly
does not apply to the contract or ordering instrument. If this occurs, the CAR shall either terminate the

contract or ordering instrument and issue a revised solicitation or ordering instrument or incorporate
DOL's wage determination retroactive to the beginning of the contract or ordering instrument by
change order. The CAR's contractor must be compensated for any increases in wages resulting from
the use of revised wage determination.

3. Contract and Subcontract Provisions

The CAR shall insert in full in any contract in excess of $2,000 which is entered into for the actual
construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of a public building or public
work, or building or work ?nanced in whole or in part from Federal funds or in accordance with
guarantees of a Federal agency or ?nanced from funds obtained by pledge of any contract of a
Federal agency to make a loan, grant or annual contribution (except where a different meaning is
expressly indicated), and which is subject to DB, the following labor standards provisions.

(1) Minimum wages.

All laborers and mechanics employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid
unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or
rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued
by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act (29 CFR Part the full amount of wages
and bona fide fringe benefits (or cash equivalents thereof) due at time of payment computed
at rates not less than those contained in the applicable wage determination of the Secretary of
Labor which the CAR obtained under the procedures specified in Item 2, above, and made a
part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between
the contractor and such laborers and mechanics.

Contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated for bona ?de fringe benefits under section
of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid
to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of paragraph of this section;
also, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period (but not less
often than quarterly) under plans, funds, or programs which cover the particular weekly
period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period. Such
laborers and mechanics shall be paid the appropriate wage rate and fringe benefits on the
wage determination for the classification of work actually performed, without regard to skill,
except as provided in Laborers or mechanics performing work in more than one
classification may be compensated at the rate specified for each classi?cation for the time
actually worked therein: Provided that the employer's payroll records accurately set forth the
time spent in each classification in which work is performed. The wage determination
(including any additional classi?cation and wage rates conformed under paragraph of
this section) and the Davis-Bacon poster (WH-1321) shall be posted at all times by the
contractor and its subcontractors at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place
where it can be easily seen by the workers. CARS shall require that the contractor and
subcontractors include the name of the CAR employee or official responsible for monitoring
compliance with DB on the poster.

The CAR, on behalf of EPA, shall require that contracts and subcontracts entered into
under this agreement provide that any class of laborers or mechanics, including helpers, which is
not listed in the wage determination and which is to be employed under the contract shall be
classified in conformance with the wage determination. The EPA Award Official shall approve an
additional classification and wage rate and fringe bene?ts therefore only when the following
criteria have been met:

(1) The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a
classification in the wage determination; and

(2) The classi?cation is utilized in the area by the construction industry; and

(3) The proposed wage rate, including any bona ?de fringe bene?ts, bears a reasonable
relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.

If the contractor and the laborers and mechanics to be employed in the classification (if
known), or their representatives, and the CAR agree on the classi?cation and wage rate (including
the amount designated for fringe benefits where appropriate). a report of the action taken shall be
sent by the CAR to the EPA Award Official. The Award Official will transmit the report, to the
Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S.
Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. The Administrator, or an authorized representative,
will approve, modify, or disapprove every additional classi?cation action within 30 days of receipt
and so advise the award of?cial or will notify the award of?cial within the 30-day period that
additional time is necessary.

In the event the contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification
or their representatives, and the CAR do not agree on the proposed classification and wage rate
(including the amount designated for fringe benefits, where appropriate), the award official shall
refer the questions, including the views of all interested parties and the recommendation of the
award official, to the Administrator for determination. The Administrator, or an authorized
representative, will issue a determination within 30 days of receipt and so advise the contracting
officer or will notify the Award Official within the 30-day period that additional time is necessary.

The wage rate (including fringe bene?ts where appropriate) determined pursuant to
paragraphs or (C) of this section, shall be paid to all workers performing work in the
classification under this contract from the ?rst day on which work is performed in the classification.

Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or
mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly rate, the contractor shall
either pay the benefit as stated in the wage determination or shall pay another bona fide fringe
bene?t or an hourly cash equivalent thereof.

(iv) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, the contractor
may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably
anticipated in providing bona ?de fringe benefits under a plan or program, Provided, That the
Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable
standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the
contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan
or program.

(1) Withholding. The CAR, upon written request of the Award Official or an authorized
representative of the Department of Labor, shall withhold or cause to withhold from the
contractor under this contract or any other Federal contract with the same prime contractor, or
any other federally-assisted contract subject to Davis?Bacon prevailing wage requirements,
which is held by the same prime contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances
as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics, including apprentices,
trainees, and helpers, employed by the contractor or any subcontractor the full amount of
wages required by the contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic,
including any apprentice, trainee, or helper, employed or working on the site of the work, all or
part of the wages required by the contract, EPA may, after written notice to the contractor, or
CAR take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment,
advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.

(2) Payrolls and basic records.

Payrolls and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the contractor during the

course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and
mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records shall contain the name, address, and
social security number of each such worker, his or her correct classification, hourly rates of wages
paid (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits or cash
equivalents thereof of the types described in section of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and
weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the
Secretary of Labor has found under 29 CFR that the wages of any laborer or
mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a
plan or program described in section of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall
maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that
the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been
communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs
anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such bene?ts. Contractors employing
apprentices or trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence of the
registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of
the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable
programs.

The contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any contract work is performed a
copy of all payrolls to the CAR who will maintain the records on behalf of EPA. The payrolls
submitted shall set out accurately and completely all of the information required to be maintained
under 29 CFR except that full social security numbers and home addresses shall not
be included on weekly transmittals. Instead the payrolls shall only need to include an individually
identifying number for each employee the last four digits of the employee's social security
number). The required weekly payroll information may be submitted in any form desired. Optional
Form WH -347 is available for this purpose from the Wage and Hour Division website at
or its successor site. The prime contractor is
responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls by all subcontractors. Contractors and
subcontractors shall maintain the full social security number and current address of each covered
worker, and shall provide them upon request to the CAR for transmission to the EPA, if requested
by EPA, the contractor, or the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor for purposes
of an investigation or audit of compliance with prevailing wage requirements. It is not a violation of
this section for a prime contractor to require a subcontractor to provide addresses and social
security numbers to the prime contractor for its own records, without weekly submission to the
CAR.

 

Each payroll submitted to the CAR shall be accompanied by a ?Statement of Compliance,"
signed by the contractor or subcontractor or his or her agent who pays or supervises the payment
of the persons employed under the contract and shall certify the following:

(1) That the payroll for the payroll period contains the information required to be provided
under 5.5 of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 5, the appropriate information is being
maintained under 5.5 of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 5, and that such information is
correct and complete;

(2) That each laborer or mechanic (including each helper, apprentice, and trainee) employed
on the contract during the payroll period has been paid the full weekly wages earned, without
rebate, either directly or indirectly, and that no deductions have been made either directly or
indirectly from the full wages earned, other than permissible deductions as set forth in
Regulations, 29 CFR Part 3;

(3) That each laborer or mechanic has been paid not less than the applicable wage rates and
fringe benefits or cash equivalents for the classi?cation of work performed, as specified in the
applicable wage determination incorporated into the contract.

The weekly submission of a properly executed certi?cation set forth on the reverse side of

Optional Form WH-347 shall satisfy the requirement for submission of the "Statement of
Compliance" required by paragraph of this section.

The falsification of any of the above certifications may subject the contractor or
subcontractor to civil or criminal prosecution under section 1001 of title 18 and section 231 of title
31 of the United States Code.

The contractor or subcontractor shall make the records required under paragraph of
this section available for inspection, copying, or transcription by authorized representatives of the
EPA or the Department of Labor, and shall permit such representatives to interview employees
during working hours on the job. If the contractor or subcontractor fails to submit the required
records or to make them available, EPA may, after written notice to the contractor, CAR, sponsor,
applicant, or owner, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further
payment, advance, or guarantee of funds. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records
upon request or to make such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to
29 CFR 5.12.

(4) Apprentices and Trainees

Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the
work they performed when they are employed pursuant to and individually registered in a bona
fide apprenticeship program registered with the US. Department of Labor, Employment and
Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, or with a
State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, or if a person is employed in his or her first
90 days of probationary employment as an apprentice in such an apprenticeship program, who is
not individually registered in the program, but who has been certified by the Office of
Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services or a State Apprenticeship Agency (where
appropriate) to be eligible for probationary employment as an apprentice. The allowable ratio of
apprentices to journeymen on the job site in any craft classi?cation shall not be greater than the
ratio permitted to the contractor as to the entire work force under the registered program. Any
worker listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered or otherwise employed
as stated above, shall be paid not less than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination
for the classification of work actually performed. In addition, any apprentice performing work on
the job site in excess of the ratio permitted under the registered program shall be paid not less
than the applicable wage rate on the wage determination for the work actually performed. Where
a contractor is performing construction on a project in a locality other than that in which its
program is registered, the ratios and wage rates (expressed in percentages of the journeyman's
hourly rate) specified in the contractor's or subcontractor's registered program shall be observed.
Every apprentice must be paid at not less than the rate specified in the registered program for the
apprentice's level of progress, expressed as a percentage of the journeymen hourly rate specified
in the applicable wage determination. Apprentices shall be paid fringe benefits in accordance with
the provisions of the apprenticeship program. If the apprenticeship program does not specify
fringe benefits, apprentices must be paid the full amount of fringe benefits listed on the wage
determination for the applicable classification. If the Administrator determines that a different
practice prevails for the applicable apprentice classification, fringes shall be paid in accordance
with that determination. In the event the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor
Services, or a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office, withdraws approval of an

incurred under this cooperative agreement for cleaning up the site under CERCLA The
Landowner Liability Protection requirements include:

a. Performing "all appropriate inquiries" into the previous ownership and uses of the property
before acquiring the property.

b. Not being potentially liable or af?liated with any other person who is potentially liable for
response costs at the facility through: any direct or indirect familial relationship, any
contractual, corporate, or ?nancial relationship, or through the result of a reorganized
business entity that was potentially liable.

While not necessary to obtain ILO protection, the CAR must still establish by a preponderance
of the evidence that the act or omission that caused the release or threat of release of
hazardous substances and any resulting damages were caused by a third party with whom
the person does not have an employment, agency, or contractual relationship.

0. Demonstrating that no disposal of hazardous substances occurred at the facility after
acquisition by the landowner (does not speci?cally apply for the CPO protection).

d. Taking "reasonable steps" with respect to hazardous substance releases by stopping any
continuing releases, preventing any threatened future releases, and preventing or limiting
human, environmental, or natural resource exposure to any previously released hazardous
substance.

e. Complying with any land use restrictions established or relied on in connection with the
response action at the site and not impeding the effectiveness or integrity of institutional
controls employed in connection with the response action.

f. Providing full cooperation. assistance, and access to persons that are authorized to
conduct response actions or natural resource restoration at the site from which there has
been a release or threatened release.

g. Complying with information requests and administrative subpoenas (does not specifically
apply for the ILO protection).

h. Providing all legally required notices with respect to the discovery or release of any hazardous
substances at the site (does not specifically apply for the ILO protection).

Notwithstanding the continuing obligations under this agreement, the CAR is subject to the
applicable liability provisions of CERCLA governing its status as a BFPP, CPO, or ILO. CERCLA
requires additional obligations to maintain the liability limitations for BFPP, CPO, and the relevant
provisions for these obligations include 101(35), 101(40), 107(b), 107(q) and 107(r).

CARs that are exempt from CERCLA liability or do not have to meet the requirements for asserting an
af?rmative defense to CERCLA liability must also comply with continuing obligation items

It is understood and agreed that during the initial diSplay, and subsequent renewal periods if applicable, the permittee

the permit. Any street banner not removed within that time period shall be removed by the City without notice to the

If the City removes banners because they are in disrepair, present a threat or harm, or because the permit has expired, it
is understood and agreed that a portion or all of the refundable deposit will be forfeited by the permittee in order to
cover the City?s expense. If the expense of removal exceeds the amount of deposit, it is understood and agreed that the

can be reclaimed by the permittee.

A. Hanging Banner from Utility Poles

Nothing may be attached to a utility or light pole without the permission of the City. The City Council can grant
permission to attach banner to Lighting Department poles. To get permission to hand banners you must petition the
City Council. The petition should identify where you want to hang the banner(s), what the banner(s) will say and how
long the banners will hang.

No banner will be allowed to block the view of traf?c signals or signs. The Public Lighting Department will inspect the
poles before advising the City Council about allowing any banners to be attached. The permission given by the City
Council is good for up to six months. If you want to hang banners for more than six months, you should petition the
City Council for an extension.

The Petitioner is responsible for purchasing, installing and removing the banners and the hardware needed to hang
them.

The Public Lighting Department will supply a copy of its Banner Speci?cations upon request.
