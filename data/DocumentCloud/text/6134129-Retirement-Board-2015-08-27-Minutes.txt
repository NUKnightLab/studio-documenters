The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Discussion concerning the upcoming Trustee Elections. The Board, with a quorum present, is
required to conduct a Petition Sufficiency hearing on Thursday October 1, 2015. After discussion; it
was determined a 9:00 am start for this meeting would accommodate the attendance of a quorum.

•

Reminder that the Police Memorial Foundation, Gold Star Family Reception is Wednesday,
September 16, 2015, at 5:00 pm. All Trustees are invited, and the Fund's staff will be invited.

•

A question has arisen recently from several officers seeking to purchase Cook County time under
214(c), who previously worked for the County in various positions, such as deputy sheriff,
correctional officer, et cetera. As part of the service purchase application, each officer submits
documents indicating his/her employment from the former employer. The Fund also obtains
confirmation that each applicant removed his/her contributions from the Cook County Pension Fund.
Each officer is then placed on agenda for the purchase request. Recently, a few officers have
indicated that they would like to purchase a fraction of their prior service, not the entire employment
period. The practice has been that that whole employment period is purchased, not fractions thereof.
AFTER DISCUSSION AND AGREEMENT AMONGST THE TRUSTEES, THE POLICY IN PLACE
SHALL CONTINUE. APPROVAL AND PAYMENT FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF PRIOR
SERVICE SHALL BE REQUIRED.
•

A reminder that the RFP for the Investment Consultant was posted on the Fund’s website.
Additionally, an ad will be placed in Pensions & Investments.

•

Continuation of discussion from the previous monthly meeting of the Board concerning
communication from the Justice Department and the City of Chicago regarding a hiring
discrimination suit. The question left open from the prior meeting was which Tier would these
individuals be placed; Tier 1 or Tier 2. If these individuals elect to purchase pension credit back to
2008, would they be afforded the opportunity to be a Tier 1 member; or because the actual hire date
will be 2016, are they Tier 2?
THE CONSENSUS OF THE BOARD IS THAT TIER PLACEMENT WOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE HIRE DATE SELECTED AND PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS MADE. IF SELECTED
DATE IS PRIOR TO 01/01/2011, THEY ARE A TIER 1; AFTER THAT DATE WOULD BE TIER 2.
•

The Board’s physician has recommended testing to be completed on certain members in receipt of
disability benefits.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board approve the
recommendation of the Board’s physician to have a FCE performed on Brenda Ware, a disability
recipient.
