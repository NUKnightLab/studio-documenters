Staff Comments:
Staff recommends including a definition of “Open Space” as the term is used in the township
resolution and in the definition of site plan. Within the Sagamore Hills Township Zoning
Resolution in Section 3 Residential District requirements for open space are listed as follows:
5.1 b 2. A minimum of forty (40%) percent of contiguous gross development area shall
remain as undeveloped open space and shall be preserved in its undisturbed state.
5.2 The open space shall be subject to the following conditions:
a. Land in streets, sidewalks, utility easements and right-of-ways, non-buildable areas (to
include storm drainage right-of-ways and wetlands) and land used for recreational purposes
shall not be included in open space to offset a reduction in lot area calculations.
b. Use of open space shall be limited to conservation and similar purposes and left in
perpetuation in an undisturbed state.
A sample definition of Open Space would be along the lines of: Any area of land or water
essentially unimproved and intended to provide light and air. Open space may include, but is not
limited to, dedicated or reserved land for public or private use for recreational facilities or
conservation purposes.
Recommendation: Staff recommends to the Summit County Planning Commission that the
proposed text amendments be APPROVED.
