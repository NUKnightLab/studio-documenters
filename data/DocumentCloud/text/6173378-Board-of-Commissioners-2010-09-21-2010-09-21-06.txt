 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited bids
for general and masonry contractors to perform exterior masonry work at Armour Square Apartments
(IL-033), 3250 S. Wentworth Ave. Masonry and pre-cast concrete panels will be removed and
replaced around the entire circumference of the building. The work is to be completed within sixty
(60) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 0567 on July 15, 2010 for exterior masonry
work at Armour Square Apartments (IL2-033). Work will be performed at 3250 S. Wentworth Ave.
The IFB was advertised on the CHA website and on BuySpeed. The Department of Procurement and
Contracts further directly notified five hundred sixty two (562) contractors of the solicitation’s
release, which included one hundred sixty-seven (167) certified MBE, WBE or DBE firms.
Information on the solicitation was also made available to seventy-three (73) assist agencies.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on July 19, 2010. The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on
July 21, 2010, which clarified that contractors with mason’s licenses as well as a general contractor’s
licenses were eligible to bid on this solicitation. Addendum No. 2 was issued on July 26, 2010 to
respond to Requests for Information, move the bid due date to August 3, 2010, issue two (2)
replacement sections for the Technical Specifications, and distribute a revised version of the BF
pages.
The CHA received and opened two (2) bids on August 3, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. from licensed masonry
contractors certified as WBE businesses.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and the
Capital Construction Department held pre-award survey meetings with both of the contractors that
had submitted bids. Each firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid and its capacity
to perform this work. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to meet the sixty (60) calendar day
timeline to avoid possible complications which could arise if work extended into the cold weather
season.
Based on its submitted bid, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that
B.E.T.O.N. Construction Company (“B.E.T.O.N.”) is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at
$138,800.00. While B.E.T.O.N. has not previously performed work for the CHA as a prime
contractor, it is acting as the masonry sub-contractor for the renovation of the Hoyne Community
Center. B.E.T.O.N. has also done extensive work for the Chicago Public Schools.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to authorize
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with B.E.T.O.N. Construction
Company in the amount of $138,800.00 for exterior masonry work at Armour square Apartments
(IL2-33), 3250 S. Wentworth Ave. Work is to be completed within sixty (60) calendar days of the
date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3
resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
