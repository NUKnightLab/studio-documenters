Information on latest developments regarding medical marijuana was provided in member
packets.
Information provided regarding recent Washington Post article on the release of DEA’s
database on prescription pills manufactured and distributed. Information on Summit
County and other communities also available.
Status report on the opiate lawsuit will be provided in September.

B. Executive Director Report
Jerry Craig presented the following:
o Americorps VISTA worker Isabelle Reicosky is completing her time at the ADM Board and
will attend graduate School at The University of Akron’s School of Social Work.
Mr. Craig extended best wishes as she pursues her education. Christina Bass will carry
forward the work on the Recovery Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC) initiative, and both
will overlap service which will facilitate a seamless hand-off of the ROSC Project.
o New staff Accountant Laura Croston was introduced and provided her background.
o Dr. Aaron Ellington is celebrating five years at the ADM Board. Mr. Craig presented
information on Dr. Ellington’s duties and thanked him for his service.
o The Board’s Community Plan is due for submission to OhioMHAS on August 1st. A copy
will be sent to Board members for review and will require Board approval at the September
Board meeting.
o All agency budgets are complete, with exception of Oriana House, IBH and CHC Addiction
Services, which are pending while the Board works through their respective transitions to
Medicaid for their residential addiction treatment programs. Summaries of all budgets will
be placed in policy manuals.
o Update provided on Affordable Care Act oral arguments in Federal Appeals Court. If the
court upholds the lower court decision, the case is likely to make its way to the Supreme
Court.
o State Budget was approved and signed into law on July 17th. Our system fared well. Focus
of the Governor’s budget agenda is aligning well with the Board’s work. Mr. Craig will
release more information about the budget and the impact as details are reviewed.
o The Auditor of State completed a performance audit of OhioMHAS and released their
report late in June. Mr. Craig reported on specific details and will update the Board
regarding the Board Association’s response and position on a new funding formula.
C.

Chief Clinical Officer Report
Dr. Doug Smith presented several medical moments of note:
o A new MAT treatment-a drug called Nabiximols (available in Europe, not US) combining
low percentage THC and cannabadiol (CBD). Research (worked well) to see if it can be
used as part of MAT to treat individuals who meet criteria for marijuana dependence. May
become important for the Board as we move forward with medical marijuana.
o Autism spectrum – Five country study seems to indicate autism is 80% inheritable, which
may be good in that it can be targeted eventually with newer genetic engineering science.
o Texting among young doesn’t appear to affect literacy or socially adaptable language.
Subjects are able to switch between social and business appropriate language.
o Stigma – Different states are starting to target stigma. Oregon recently established mental
health days for students. Employers are working for better mental health standards for
workforces to reduce stigma.
o Florida public schools – Law has been passed in regard to teaching students about mental
health in schools.
Use of medical marijuana in treatment of autism was questioned. Dr. Smith confirmed that use
is on the list for medical marijuana, but so far not being researched. Suspicion is that it will not
have any benefit.
