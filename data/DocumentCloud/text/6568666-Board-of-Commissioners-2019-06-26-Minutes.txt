HONORING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALBERT LEON MAMPRE
WHEREAS, Albert Leon Mampre, the last living medic from World War II’s Easy Company has died at
the age of 97. Easy Company was part of the 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the
101st Airborne Division. It was made famous by the Stephen Ambrose book and HBO series, “Band of
Brothers”; and
WHEREAS, Al Mampre was awarded a Bronze Star and two (2) Purple Hearts for his service. He survived
two (2) sniper bullets after venturing into an active battle scene to lie down next to a wounded Lieutenant.
Dutch civilians came to their rescue and took them to the relative safety of a Dutch home where they were
treated for their injuries; and
31

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 26, 2019

WHEREAS after his recovery, Mr. Mampre served at regiment headquarters during the Battle of the Bulge
in Bastogne, France. Mr. Mampre became a medic because, as he put it, he was good at “pluggin’ holes,
not makin’ holes.” He reflected that he had learned many of the skills required to be a medic in his training
as a Boy Scout, except for giving shots, which he learned by practicing on oranges. The training was mostly
common sense. “Guy’s got a hole in his chest? Put your hand over it so it doesn’t suck air. Basic stuff”;
and
WHEREAS, Mr. Mampre was among 35,000 paratroopers and glider troops who rained from the sky over
Europe in Operation Market Garden. He recalled taking refuge in a doorway to evade German machine gun
fire. While he waited, the door opened a crack and the woman inside handed him a spoonful of cherries.
He never saw her face or knew who she was; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Mampre was known among his fellow soldiers as funny, kind, humble, and an engaging
storyteller. He never liked the word “hero” and never saw himself as one. He was genuinely selfless.
Everyone loved being around him; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Mampre grew up in Oak Park, the son of immigrants from the Armenian diaspora. His
mother Viola came from Baghdad. His father Nishan came from Turkey. His father repaired rugs and farm
equipment to support his family. Young Al “was always taking care of people.” At 4, he’d alert adults about
the wanderings of a forgetful elderly neighbor who was a Civil War veteran. “The colonel’s running away!”
he’d warn. Later, he had a paper route and sold the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies Home Journal. He
attended Oak Park High School and pursued ministerial studies at Ohio Northern and Hardin-Simmons
University in Texas before enlisting in the army; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Mampre married the former Virginia Joboulian a month after he came home from the
war in 1945. They were childhood friends. She was only seven (7) when they first met at an Armenian
picnic, but reportedly she told her parents that she was going to marry him one day. They were married for
63 years until her death in 2009.
WHEREAS, Mr. Mampre subsequently studied psychology at Pepperdine University in California and
later added anthropology to his studies at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University
of Chicago. He spent his career in management working for International Harvester and operating a family
psychology practice in Evanston where the Mampres raised their daughters Virginia and Susan Mampre
and Elizabeth Celebucke, who died in 2011; and
WHEREAS, in his later years, Mr. Mampre did public speaking and raised money for veterans and police
and fire departments. He traveled for pleasure and wartime anniversaries in Belgium, England, France,
Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. He has twice been called upon to throw out the ceremonial
first pitch, for the White Sox in 2013, and more recently before a game between the Washington Nationals
and Tampa Bay Rays.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the life of Albert Leon Mampre, and herewith
expresses its sincere gratitude for the years of service he gave to this country and to the Citizens of Cook
County, Illinois; and

WHEREAS Judge May changed the course of many children’s lives for the better through his total
involvement in their cases; and

life theme should have been “Have golf clubs, will travel” as he always looked for a golf course wherever

Nevada. He particularly enjoyed his last two (2) trips visiting friends in Belize; and
WHEREAS, Judge May was preceded in death by his wife, Julie, and his parents and siblings. He leaves

HONORING COOK COUNTY LIBRARIANS FOR GOING BEYOND THE BOOK FOR

WHEREAS, library is traditionally known as a collection of books used for reading or study, and/or the

Portuguese, Romanian, German, and Russian, and
WHEREAS, in the 19th century, libraries were acknowledged to be an indispensable part of community
life as promoters of literacy, providers of a wide range of reading for all ages, and centers for community

where children, teens and adults win small prizes to encourage reading during the summer months. Summer
Reading Club takes place for approximately 8-10 weeks (June - August) and starts when the regular school
session ends, and
WHEREAS, libraries offer a variety of weekly themed-programs for all ages and patrons receive points
and prizes for reading a certain number of books or for a certain amount of time. On average, 2.5 million
patrons read 25 million books and attend over 10,000 summer programs offered by 205 Cook County
libraries.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the President and the Cook County Board of
