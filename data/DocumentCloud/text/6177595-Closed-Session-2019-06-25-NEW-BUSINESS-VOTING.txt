CHALLENGE COST SHARE AGREEMENT
Between The
DETROIT, CITY OF

And The
USDA, FOREST SERVICE
EASTERN REGION

This CHALLENGE COST SHARE AGREEMENT is hereby made and entered into by and
between the City of Detroit General Services Department Parks and Recreation Division,
hereinafter referred to as ?Detroit Parks and Rec,? and the USDA, Forest Service, Eastern
Region, hereinafter referred to as the Forest Service,? under the authority: Departrnent of
Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of l992, Pub. L. 102-154.

Background: Detroit Urban Connections is a program of the US. Forest Service, Eastern Region,
Public and Governmental Affairs. The objective of the program is to build understanding in
diverse urban communities about the value of their National Forests to sustainably manage our
national forests and promote conservation across the land. We in the US. Forest Service are
committed to retaining forests and grasslands for present and future generations. Clean water is
one of our most important and valuable forest products. In urban areas, trees and forests reduce
storm water runoff, cool the air, and provide critical refuge for ?sh and wildlife. Forests also
help clean the air we breathe. In rural areas, forests protect municipal water supplies, reduce
?ooding, replenish groundwater aquifers, provide recreation and critical ?sh and wildlife habitat,
and yield ntunerous wood products. By ?ltering pollutants from air and water, storing water and
nutrients, protecting soils, ?ood plains, and streams, and providing aesthetic and other human
needs, forests bring signi?cant bene?ts to our lands, waters, and communities. People depend on
healthy and well-managed forest lands. Over 50 million people depend on northeastern forests,
in part, to protect their water supplies. Forests provide a wide range of goods and services we use
every day while also making up important "green in?'astructure" in our communities, enhancing
our health and our quality of life. We help communities; Slate, local, and tribal governments;
forest industries; and private forest landowners improve conditions in both urban and rural areas
These few examples illustrate the importance of the US. Forest Service to our Nation, now and
in the future. Successfully achieving results desired by the public requires collaboration with a
wide range of partners to complement our own efforts. Working with local and nonpro?t
organizations and others interested in land stewardship helps us maintain the sustainability of our
forests and grasslands while providing a wide variety of societal needs.

agreement will be carried out in accordance with the following provisions and the hereby
incorporated Operating and Financial Plan, attached as Exhibits A B.

H. STATEMENT OF MUTUAL BENEFIT AND INTERESTS:

The U.S. Forest Service is responsible for the long term health and sustainability of the nation?s
forests. This is accomplished through protecting the natural resources, restoring the land to
conserve natural heritage, and providing for peeple now and into the future. Managing natural
resources is a public effort both in rural and urban communities. The U.S. Forest Service is
working toward increased stewardship of natural resources, from backyards to the National
Forests. Forests are critically important to the sapply of clean drinking water in the Northeast and
Midwest portion of the United States. In this part of the country more than 52 million people
depend on surface water supplies that are protected in large part by forested lands. The public is
generally unaware of the threats to their water supplies or the connection between clean water
and the extent and condition of forest lands in source water watersheds. The ?xture security of
water supplies will not be ensured by a focus on water treatment alone. Protecting and managing
forests in source watersheds is an essential part of future strategies for providing clean, safe
drinking water that citizens can afford. Part of the U.S. Forest Service strategic plan is to
provide bene?ts to the public, speci?cally through connecting people to the outdoors.

Detroit Parks and Recreation is a municipality based in the Detroit Metro area that envisions an
ever improving quality of life for people, plants and animals in southeast Michigan. Detroit
Parks and Rec's mission is to connect communities with our parks, programs, and facilities, to
positively impact their health and wellness. Through partnership with the U.S. Forest Service,
Detroit Parks and Rec will be able to provide conservation education experiences and resources
to their target audience, residents in the City of Detroit, increasing their health and wellness
through the many bene?ts that come from engaging with the outdoors.

Both the U.S. Forest Service and Detroit Parks and Rec will bene?t by working together to
provide conservation education experiences to youth in the Detroit area. The U.S. Forest Service
may have improved outreach success and increased number of individuals understanding of
complex natural resource issues. Detroit Parks and Rec will be able to provide enriched
conservation education programming to their audience, further increasing support for
conservation actions in the City of Detroit, and increasing resident?s health and welibeing.

1n Consideration of the above premises, the parties agree as follows:

Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo
(April 11, 1925 - March 25, 1965)
Viola Liuzzo a working?class wife, mother, Wayne State University student, and member of
the NAACP had a long history of helping anyone who was suffering or treated unfairly. She
lived in Detroit, Michigan, with her children, Penny, Mary, Anthony, Tommy, and Sally; and

husband, Anthony Liuzzo.

in March 1965, Mrs. Liuzzo heeded Martin Luther King, Jr.?s plea for help after Bloody Sunday,
the infamous day when black citizens in Alabama were brutally beaten by police as they tried to
march from Selma to Montgomery to register to vote. After arranging with her closest friend,
Sarah Evans, to help care for her children during a brief absence, Mrs. Liuzzo drove to Selma
and participated in the successful "Selma to Montgomery Freedom March" and assisted with
coordination and logistics. However, she never made it home. On March 25, 1965, while
driving back to Selma with a young, fellow activist, Mrs. Liuzzo was assassinated in Lowndes
County, Alabama by members ofthe Ku Klux Klan. She was only 39 years old. Her murder
helped spur passage of the Voters Rights? Act in August 1965. Her decision and her
extraordinary act of human decency and kindness defined her as a wife, mother, friend, and
human being. Her courage has inspired songs, documentaries, books, action, and hope for

generations. Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo we thank you.

The Viola Liuzzo Playground was dedicated to her by the City of Detroit on July 1, 1982 out of
gratitude for her courage and bravery. In 2015, the Viola Liuzzo Park Association formed to
assist in the redesign of the playground and educate the community about Mrs. Liuzzo?s

courage and struggle for civil and human rights.

Dear Council President:

I have been asked to considerjoining a coalition of local units of government in their support of
three sets of employee-plaintiffs who have cases before the United States Supreme Court. The
plaintiffs have asserted that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides protection against
sex discrimination and should extend to members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender
and Queer Community. See attached memo summarizing the cases.

For reasons explained in the memo, I favor the request.

Title VII should extend protection to persons, because, as I see it, discriminating against
a lesbian because of her sexual orientation is discrimination based on sex. Heterosexual men
(who are attracted to women) are not held back because of their desire to have sex with women.
Discriminating against a woman for doing, or wanting to do, what is perfectly acceptable in a
man, is discrimination on the basis of sex, and it should not be allowed. Sexual orientation and
gender identity should be protected classi?cations.

Notwithstanding my personal view of the law, I am hesitant to take a public stance without
laying the matter before your body. As I am sure you have heard me say, the Law Department
should serve the City of Detroit through both the legislative and the executive branch of
government. Therefore, before I take any position on the request from the Public Rights Project,
I wanted to make City Council and the Mayor aware of the issue.

Please let me know, by June 24, your thoughts and whether you believe it would be inappropriate
for me to approve the request for me to sign on as Corporation Counsel. To the extent Council
wishes to support the Public Rights Project, I am sure they would welcome the support, and the
information necessary may be found in the attached.

Sincerely,

Lawrence T. Garcia

 

 

PLANNED LOCAL GOVERNMENT TITLE VII AMICUS BRIEF

A coalition of local jurisdictions, which we anticipate will include the City of Los
Angeles and the County of Santa Clara, with the assistance of the Public Rights
Project, are preparing an amicus brief on behalf of local governments in support of
the employee-plaintiffs in a trio of cases before the United States Supreme Court
concerning whether and how Title ban on sex discrimination prohibits
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

DEADLINE:

The deadline to sign on is July 1 (the day before the brief is due to the printer),
and the brief will be filed in the Supreme Court on July 3. We encourage you to take
steps to secure approval to sign on now. An outline of the brief appears below and a
draft amicus brief will be circulated on June 24. We are happy to discuss the contents
of the brief in more detail with any interested jurisdictions. If your jurisdiction
requires a draft brief before June 24 to obtain approval by July 1, please contact us.

ABOUT THE CASES:

The Supreme Court will consider how Title VII's ban on workplace sex
discrimination protects people from discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation or gender identity in a trio of cases: R. G. (it GR. Harris Funeral Homes
Inc. v. EEOC Aimee Stephens; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda; and Bostock v.
Clayton County (see appendix for more details). The EEOC and many federal courts
have recognized that discrimination is a form of sex discrimination. The
Court will now decide Whether to revoke these non-discrimination protections.

PLANNED BRIEF:

Our amicus brief will share the unique perspective of local governments when it
comes to protecting people in the workplace. The brief will have two
components. First, a section will discuss discrimination against people,
especially in the workplace, and the profound effect of discrimination on 
members? lives, and the community itself. Though LGBT people are most
immediately and severely harmed by this discrimination, the damage resonates
through local governments and the entire community. When people lose
their jobs or sustain other workplace injury because of who they are - and then are
unable to redress that injury in court a local government, which provides the ?rst
safety net and essential services such as job training, social safety net, health care,
housing and the like, carries a signi?cant burden. Our communities function best

 

 

 

 

when all members can support themselves through employment, Without the specter
of discrimination preventing a targeted sector of the community from realizing their
full potential.

Second, a section will detail the experience of local governments that have long
protected people from discrimination in the workplace, and show that these
municipalities? protection of people has bene?tted and strengthened these
communities. Certainly, protecting against these forms of discrimination has not
caused any of the problems cited by the opposing side. To the contrary, we would like
to illustrate for the Court that local governments that do not have these protections,
or are housed in states that do not provide these protections, suffer; we would
appreciate input from such jurisdictions.

APPENDIX: CASE DESCRIPTIONS

1- RG. GR. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC and Aimee Stephens, No. 18-107
(gender identity and expression)

Aimee Stephens worked as a funeral director at RC. G.R. Harris Funeral
Homes. When she informed the funeral home?s owner that she is transgender, the
owner ?red her. The Sixth Circuit ruled in March 2018 that when the funeral
home ?red her for being transgender and departing from sex stereotypes, it
violated Title VII. Aimee was the same capable employee she had always been,
and she was ?red because her employer wanted her to look and act ?like a man.?
That is sex discrimination.

- Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, No. 17-1623 (sexual orientation)

Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor, was ?red from his job because of his sexual
orientation. The trial court rejected his discrimination claim, because then-
existing Second Circuit precedent did not appreciate that sexual-orientation
discrimination is necessarily a form of sex discrimination. In October 2014, Don
died unexpectedly, but the case continues on behalf of his estate. In February
2018, the en banc Second Circuit ruled that discrimination based on sexual
orientation is a form of discrimination based on sex that is prohibited under Title
VII. The court recognized that when a lesbian, gay, or bisexual person is treated
differently because of discomfort or disapproval that they are attracted to people
of the same sex, that is sex discrimination.

Bostock Clayton County, No. 17-1618 (sexual orientation)

Gerald Bostock was ?red from his job as a county child-welfare-services
coordinator when his employer learned he is gay. In May 2018, the Eleventh
Circuit denied his appeal, refusing to reconsider a 1979 decision that excluded
sexual-orientation discrimination from Title ban on sex discrimination.

 

 

Intro
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from ?discrirninat[ing] against

any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42
U.S.C. 

Issue
Does Title Vll?s prohibition against discriminating against an employee based on their sex

encompass discrimination against homosexual or transgendered individuals? Courts have
disagreed on the answer and this issue will be addressed next term by the United States
Supreme Court in a consolidated case. The three cases are discussed below.

Cases

.tllrilzrde Express v. Zardr:

- In 2010, a gay man Was fired from his job as a skydiver instructor because of his
sexual orientation. He has since died, so the case is brought by his estate.

The Second Circuit (the court for NY. CT, and VT) overturned its prior
precedent and held For the ?rst time that ?ring a homosexual individual is a
violation ofTitle VII and is akin to firing him for failing to conform to a ?male
sex stereotype.?

. The Court?s rationale relied on a previous 1989 US Sapreme Court case, Price
i'Vererlrouse Hopkins, in which the Court held that discrimination on the basis
of ?sex stereotypes? was impermissible sex discrimination under Title VII. In the
Price Pieter/rouse case, the female plaintiff was passed over for a promotion
because of her employer?s belief that she should ?walk more femininely, talk
more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and
wearjewelry.?

The Second Circuit in Zarda speci?cally held ?Because one cannot fully define a
person's sexual orientation without identifying his or her sex, sexual orientation
is a function of sex.?

0 In conclusion, the Court held that although sexual orientation discrimination is
?assuredly not the principal evil that Congress was concerned with when it
enacted Title VII [in 1964], statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal
evil to cover reasonably comparable evils.?

- The Seventh Circuit (the court for IL, IN. WI) heard a similar casein Hively v.
[11y Tech. College. and ruled similarly. That case was not appealed to
the Supreme Court.

Batter-k v. [nylon Comrty. Georgia

. A gay man terminated from hisjob as a child welfare services coordinator for the
county sued alleging he was ?red because he was gay.

I The Eleventh Circuit (the court in AL, FL. GA) reaf?rmed its previous holdings that
Title VII does not prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.

a This is direct opposition to the Second Circuit?s ruling in Zen-do.

I Because Boston-k and Zarcla are directly opposite on the same issue, the Supreme
Court has agreed to hear both cases together.

R. G. GR. Harris Funeral Homes, Inc. v. E.E. 0. C.

0

Case arising out of the Detroit metro area.

Aimee Stephens (formerly Anthony) was born male. She originally lived as a
male and began working as a funeral director in 2007 at R.G. G.R. Harris
Funeral Homes.

The funeral home is owned and Operated by Thomas Rost, who owns three
funeral homes in the metro Detroit area and is a devotedly Christian man. The
funeral home is not af?liated with any particular church.

The funeral home requires all male employees to wears suits and ties and female
employees to wear skirts and businessjackets.

In 2013, Aimee indicated to Mr. Rost that she would begin living her life as a
female and she wished to dress as a woman at work. Mr. Rost ?red her shortly
afterwards.

Mr. Rost stated his reason for the termination was ?that the Bible teaches that a
person's sex is an immutable God-given gift? and to allow a man to dress as a
woman at his funeral home would make him complicit ?in supporting the idea
that sex is a changeable social construct rather than an immutable God-given
gift."

The Federal District Court in Detroit dismissed part of the claim indicating that
transgender status is not a protected class under Title VII.

The Sixth Circuit (the court for Ml, OH, TN, KY) reversed the lower court
decisions and held that discrimination against a transgendered person is
discrimination on the basis of sex.

Conclusion
All three cases will be heard together by the Supreme Court in the upcoming term. It would

be a good decision to sign onto the proposed amicus brief by the City of Los Angeles and

support expanding Title Vll?s protections to employees. It is true that Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act does not speci?cally outlaw discrimination based on a person?s sexual

orientation or gender identity. Yet, it is important for courts to recognize that these forms of

discrimination arejust another subset of sex discrimination. A growing number of courts have

come to accept this view- While protecting gay and transgendered employees may been a view

which was inconceivable in 1964 when the Civil Rights Act was passed, it is a view which

has become much more widespread as the issues of the community have become

more visible.
