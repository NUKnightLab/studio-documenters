Summary: These five (5) contiguous properties are located in close proximity to the Village Hall and comprise a
total of less than 18,000 square feet (.4 acres). The properties are either vacant (15-05-307-035-0000,
15-05-307-048-0000 and 15-05-307-057-0000) or as stated in the affidavit or of occupancy form, have an
unoccupied structure (15-05-307-050-0000 and 15-05-307-051-0000). This past year the village demolished the
structure which was on 15-07-307-035-0000 due to its deleterious and unsafe condition. The village plans on using
the property for a public purpose and therefore will file for tax exempt status on all five (5) properties if tax deeds
are obtained. The Village intends to retain ownership of the parcels and therefore will not be applying with a Third
Party.
The Village will retain legal counsel to assist with completion of the application, title search, tax deed petition and
will bear all other costs related to the acquisition of these parcels through the No Cash Bid (NCB) Program and

 agrees to file NCB reports on the status of each parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever
occurs first.

Volume and Property Index Number:

Summary: The City of Oak Forest would like to express its interest in receiving a No Cash Bid for the one (1)
property/PIN below that houses an unoccupied commercial building on the property that has been vacant for over
4 years. The City of Oak Forest has been working on various economic development plans for the region where
this parcel exists. By regaining economic development control of the area, the City can begin to move these plans
along to fruition. The primary land use for this property will be commercial. Due to the lack of a third party
requestor the City cannot provide a specific use or function, but through the use of the City’s Comprehensive Land
Use Plan and economic development planning the city looks to reposition the property in the following manner:
the City is working diligently to redevelop and reinvigorate the Cicero Ave. corridor by investing in its streetscape
and attain development control on dilapidated multi-family/commercial buildings. One major issue along the
commercial corridors of Oak Forest is the smaller parcel commercial properties and lack of space for larger, more
tax-producing users. Oak Forest would like to retain control of this property as step1of the land consolidation with
the neighboring lots to create a larger more buildable lot in the future.
The City of Oak Forest will utilize its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of the parcel. If the City is awarded the subject property, the City will provide an
annual status report on the development of the property for five years or until development is complete or conveyed
for future development, whichever occurs last. The City of Oak Forest will file for tax-exempt status for the
subject properties for as long as the City is in ownership of these properties.

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of La Grange Park

Volume and Property Index Number:
175, 15-33-411-051-0000
Summary: This Request Package contains one PIN. This property is vacant land that is located between our
existing Beach Oak Park and the Indiana Belt Harbor Railroad. The property contains mature trees and thick
underbrush. The District was recently awarded an Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Open Space
Lands Acquisition and Development (OSLAD) grant for redevelopment of our Beach Oak Park. We believe by
acquiring this parcel that we could incorporate the land into our park, expanding the park size in its southwest corner
and improve it aesthetically. A site plan of the proposed improvements is attached.
If acquired, the District will file for tax exempt status and will request to rezone it as park land with the Village of
La Grange Park. The part of the parcel which has railroad tracks is intended to be transferred to the Indiana Harbor
Belt Railroad, a possible Third Party Requestor. We are currently in discussions of their interest in being a Third
Party Requestor. The District will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other costs
associated with acquisition of the parcel. The District agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of
Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance.
