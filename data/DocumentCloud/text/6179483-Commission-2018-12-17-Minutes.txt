the event. Take-aways include: do a showcase rather than
competition because this format draws people from a larger
area; more time (minimum six months out); do Bombay Hall
next year.
2. Commission feedback: adjusted lighting to focus on the
stage; successful part was the children;

communication including phone calls and in-person
meetings
