PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY TO APPOINT A SPECIAL STATE’S
ATTORNEY TO HANDLE THE PROSECUTION OF OFFICER JASON VAN DYKE, PURSUANT TO
55 ILCS 5/3-9008

WHEREAS, pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/3-9008, the Circuit Court or an interested party in a proceeding
may file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties; and
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 sets the proper procedure for the Circuit Court to review such petition;
and
WHEREAS, the 13-month time period between the shooting death of a 17-year-old African American,
Laquan McDonald, and the filing of criminal charges by the Cook County State’s Attorney against the
shooter, Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke has undermined local confidence in the criminal justice
system in Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, the delay in prosecuting Officer Van Dyke has placed the Cook County State’s Attorney
in the position of having to defend the impartiality of the State’s Attorney’s Office in prosecuting
Officer Van Dyke; and,
WHEREAS, with respect to the prosecution of Officer Van Dyke, the utilization of the Chicago Police
Department by the State’s Attorney for its own investigatory purposes places the Cook County State’s
Attorney in the position of prosecuting a member of a government agency that often functions as

 witnesses of the State’s Attorney’s Office; and,
WHEREAS, as a result of its relationship with the Chicago Police Department as outlined in the
foregoing paragraphs, a clear conflict of interest exists for the Office of the Cook County State’s
Attorney in its prosecution of Officer Van Dyke; and,
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Honorable Body requests that the Circuit Court of Cook County or an
interested person immediately file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her
duties pursuant to Section 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 and to appoint a Special State’s Attorney to handle the
prosecution of Jason Van Dyke.
A motion was made by Commissioner Boykin, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, that this Resolution

Nay: Commissioners Daley, Morrison, Murphy and Silvestri (4)
Present: Commissioner Fritchey (1)
