directed to interact with the ZBA and examine the transcripts and evidence and issue findings
of fact and render a decision revealing the grounds thereof.

the property owner and has set this matter for status on December 30, 2003 .

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to suspend the rules so that this
