BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
SELECTION OF THE NEW CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF HUMAN RESOURCES
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
I am pleased to report that effective September 29, 2008, Mr. Joseph Sova accepted the position of Chief
of the Bureau of Human Resources for Cook County. Joe Sova has over 28 years of progressive human
resources experience within diverse multi-site complex organizations and over 10 years of experience
leading human resource functions at the Vice President level. I am pleased to have Mr. Sova on my team;
he will be an asset to the County as we modernize our employment process and incorporate additional
best practices in our human resource policies and procedures.
Mr. Joseph Sova came recommended to me following a national search for a Human Resource Chief
(“HR Chief”) candidate. In April of 2008, I established a Human Resource Committee (“Committee”) to
interview prospective candidates for the position of HR Chief. As you may recall, this Committee
included Maya Bordeaux, Vice President of Human Resources, North Shore University Health System,
Evanston Hospital; Demetrius Carney, Partner, Perkins Coie; Laura Lechowicz Felicione, Special
Counsel, Cook County; Mary Anne Kelly, Vice President of Human Resources, Chicago Metropolitan
Health Care Council; and Burt Odelson, Partner, Odelson and Sterk.

7427

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 1, 2008
In addition to hearing from Compliance Administrator Julia Nowicki at the Committee’s first meeting, the
Committee requested that the County engage an executive recruitment firm to aid in the search for a
permanent HR Chief. At the Committee’s request and upon the Committee’s approval, the County
engaged David Gomez and Associates (“DGA”) to perform the executive recruitment for the County HR
Chief position. Additional meetings occurred with members of the Committee; Julia Nowicki, members
of her staff and DGA to finalize the desired qualifications of a HR candidate as well as the matrix that
would be used to review prospective candidates.
Following these meetings, the job description was completed and DGA initiated the executive recruitment
process. DGA’s executive search process was completed on a national basis, attracted 410 candidates and
had representation from a diverse group of highly qualified candidates from 24 states.
DGA conducted interviews and then presented a slate of ten (10) highly qualified candidates to the
Committee for review; seven candidates were selected by the Committee to be further interviewed. The
Committee conducted interviews of the seven prospective candidates over two days and addressed the
candidates past accomplishments, knowledge of position, experience, management style, ability to
develop staff, interpersonal skills, direction and long range goals.
From the final slate of seven candidates interviewed, the Committee recommended three finalist
candidates for my review. Following additional interviews, I selected Joe Sova from the Committee’s list
of three finalist candidates to serve as the County’s Chief of Human Resources. In addition to the
Committee’s recommendation, Julia Nowicki has reviewed Mr. Sova’s resume and is supportive of my
selection.
Joe Sova’s extensive leadership experience in human resources will be an asset to the current HR team.
Mr. Sova will aid me in moving forward with my policy agenda which includes, modernizing the
County’s Human Resource Bureau, making the employment process more transparent, achieving
substantial compliance as it relates to the Shakman Supplemental Relief Order and incorporating
additional best practices in our human resource policies and procedures.

WHEREAS, governments across the board are continually being asked to do more with less and
Government officials and taxpayers continue to demand that public programs be delivered effectively and

by measuring the delivery of products, services or processes; and
WHEREAS, the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA) and the National Advisory Council
on State and Local Budgeting (NACSLB) recommend all governments use performance measurement as
an important component of long-term strategic planning to identify financial and program results, assess
past program performance and facilitate future program service and delivery; and
WHEREAS, to incorporate performance measures in the budgeting process we must develop indicators
to evaluate and monitor programs and services and integrate them into the budget framework; and

WHEREAS, the Chief Financial Officer in conjunction with the Budget Director and Chief Information
Officer further are already in the process of developing balanced evaluation techniques and performance
measures necessary to convert to a performance-based budget; and

Transmitting a Communication, dated September 26, 2008 from
KEVIN N. GIVENS, Director, Department of Environmental Control
requesting authorization to amend Chapter 32 Fees (Environmental Control) due to an error in a past
amendment. The Cook County Board of Commissioners previously amended Chapter 32 Fees, Section
32-1, Chapter 30, Environment on February 21, 2007 (Ordinance 07-O-16). The proposed amendments
do not involve new fees, rather these amendments offer language corrections and include schedules that
were inadvertently omitted during the codification process.
Specifically, the amendment offered corrects wording at the beginning of Section 30-96(4)c; clarifies
storage tank capacities in Section 30-97(3) that were missing or incorrectly classified; includes Section
30-97(3)c which was missing altogether; includes a category that was missing in Section 30-97(5) for the
air flow rate of devices or apparatus used to control air pollution and corrects language at the beginning of
Section 30-98(1).
Additionally, the amendment offered includes Section 30-600 which should be added to reinstate the
Open Burning Fee Schedule, which was inadvertently omitted during the codification process and Section
30-96(1) should be changed to remove the reference of Open Burning from the Installation Permit Fee
Schedule.

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE
GRANT AWARD ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 11, 2008 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to extend a grant award in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant provides funding for gender-responsive treatment
services provided to nonviolent felony offenders referred to the Criminal Division’s Mental Health
Treatment Court. The Mental Health Treatment Court pilot program was launched in April 2004 to
reduce incarceration of mentally ill, nonviolent felony offenders. The specialty court accomplishes this
by enhancing court supervision and improving the delivery of mental healthcare to such offenders, who
have significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders, some have other health concerns, as well,
such as positive tests for HIV. In its first three years of operation, the Criminal Division’s Mental Health
Treatment Court has received more than 200 referrals, both male and female. Early program results are
encouraging, with recidivism for participants substantially reduced. The grant funds will allow the
participant capacity of the program to increase by an additional 25 offenders, or 75 per year.

7536

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 1, 2008
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on November 20, 2007 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $200,000.00.
The grant requires matching funds only in the form of contributions of time from existing staff. As such,
the grant would have no fiscal impact on Cook County.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding period extension: October 1, 2008 through September 30,
2009.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
