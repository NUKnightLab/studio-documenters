 Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Strategic Plan: Byrne JAG
Activities for Federal Fiscal Years 2016-2019 (DRAFT)
This document integrates the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority’s
(“Authority’s”) core research, policy, and grantmaking activities into a rolling strategic
plan that will be built out and implemented in Federal Fiscal Years 2016-2019. It has four
sections:
I. Strategic Plan, which describes the overall vision for the Authority’s strategic plan;
II. Principles, which identifies foundational purposes that the Authority’s Research and
Grants should serve;
III. Priorities, which uses Illinois’ Byrne JAG to outline the goals the Authority’s work
should achieve; and
IV. Process, which identifies the objectives the Authority will undertake in FFY 2016-19
About the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
The Authority is the State’s criminal justice research and grantmaking agency. Its
mission is to reduce crime and violence and increase public safety by improving criminal
justice outcomes and helping create a more effective criminal justice system through
research, funding, and technical assistance and by coordinating the development of
information systems.
To realize this mission, the Authority has two principal divisions: its Research and
Analysis Unit (Research) and its Federal State Grants Unit (Grants). While all 50 states
and U.S. territories have the equivalents of these units, the Authority has earned
throughout its more than 30-year history a distinct national reputation for using research
to inform funding and programs that strengthen criminal justice policies and practices.
The Authority is governed by a statutorily created 25-member independent oversight
Board composed of state and local public safety officials, community leaders, and policy
experts. With members representing the diverse parts of the State’s criminal justice
system, the Authority’s Board sets agency priorities, tracks the progress of ongoing
programs, and oversees the agency’s grantmaking.
In calendar year 2015, the Authority administered roughly $50 million of state and
federal programs. Two thirds of the Authority’s funding for programs came from the
three major federal formula block grants: the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance
Grant (JAG), the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) fund, and the Victims of Crime
Act (VOCA). Overall, the Authority provides a high return on investment for the State.
For every dollar Illinois spends on the Authority's operations, the agency is able to
administer $10 in programs. As a matter of policy, the Authority’s funding was targeted
at high crime and victimization areas and distributed evenly through the State’s Northern,
Central, and Southern regions.

1

 I. STRATEGIC PLAN
In the summer of 2015, the Authority’s Board Chair created the Strategic Opportunities
Committee (“Committee”) from the agency’s board and gave it the following charge:
The Strategic Opportunities Committee shall work with the Authority’s Board to define
• The Principles that will provide strategic vision and governance to direct the
agency’s grant work;
• The Priorities that focus the agency’s grant work to implement the principles;
• The Process that the agency will use in its grant work to maximize the
effectiveness of the state’s justice system.
The Committee shall work closely with the Authority’s Grants and Research units to
achieve the following objectives:
•

Create a three-year strategic plan for the Authority’s grant work;
• Coordinate the mandated planning for the Authority’s federal block grants
and state grant advisory groups;
• Encourage and coordinate federal and private grant work in addition to its
federal block grants to drive targeted improvements to Illinois justice system
that are informed by the Authority’s principles and priorities.
• Partner with other state agencies and engage in state level initiatives to align
interests.

To create a three-year strategic plan for the Authority, the Committee undertook a rolling
planning process for federal fiscal years 2016-19. Eventually all of the Authority’s major
federal public safety formula block grants will be encompassed in an overall plan,
centered in a set of foundational principles, priorities, and anchored in a dynamic process
involving the Board, Committee, the agency’s staff, and the agency’s grantees.
II. PRINCIPLES
To ground this strategic planning process, the Committee established two sets of
foundational principles for the Authority. The first set of principles is designed to direct
the Authority’s overall work, articulating a vision for the Illinois’ criminal justice system
and the purposes it should serve:
Guiding Principles
1. Legitimacy: Criminal justice practices and policy should provide an equitable justice
system for all Illinois residents by strengthening the trust between citizen and the
justice system and promoting the fair distribution of rights, resources and
opportunities. These practices and policies should intentionally acknowledge gender
bias and disproportionate minority contact and create systemic change to address
these issues.

2

 2. Respect: Criminal justice practices and policy should ensure that victims are treated
with respect in regard to their dignity and privacy, and that their rights are enforced.
3. Due Process: Criminal justice practices and policy should ensure that all individuals
are afforded equal access to fair treatment under the law.
4. Fair and Just: Criminal justice practices and policy should ensure that all individuals
are treated equally and that punishment is proportional to the seriousness of the
offense committed, designed to achieve offender accountability, victim restoration
and public safety, and limited to the amount necessary to achieve the intended
outcomes.
5. Recovery: Support and services should be provided to victims who suffer physical,
emotional or financial harm as the direct result of the offender’s criminal conduct.
These services should be provided whether or not the victims choose to participate in
the criminal justice system.
6. Rehabilitation: The criminal justice system should require and support offender
rehabilitation services to offenders who want them. These services should be
provided in a culturally competent, gender sensitive and trauma informed manner.
7. Strengthen Communities: The criminal justice system should strengthen communities
and their informal capacities to prevent crime and violence.
8. Prevention: The criminal justice system should prevent crime and violence to mitigate
its harmful effects on individuals and communities.
9. Research Informed: Criminal justice policies and practices should be informed by
statistics, research, and community input. Criminal justice data, statistical analyses,
and research should be accessible to all communities.
10. Collaboration: The sectors of criminal justice system and victim service providers
should collaborate to provide efficient, effective and expedient justice. This
collaboration should foster cross-system coordination and information sharing.
11. Efficient: The criminal justice system should avoid unnecessary costs and maximize
its limited resources to achieve its intended outcomes.
While the above Guiding Principles outline a broad vision for the State’s criminal justice
system, the Grantmaking Principles below articulate how the Authority will achieve it:
Grantmaking Principles
1. The Authority should strive to maximize the use of available federal and state funds,
seeking any and all reasonable alternatives to lapsing funds back to the federal or
state government.
2. The Authority's decision to award federal and state funds should have a foundation in
the best available research, evaluation, practice and professional advice.
3. The Authority's decision to award federal and state funds should be considerate of the
balance of resources across the justice system and its potential impact in other areas
of the system.
4. The Authority's federal and state funds should not result in the duplication of efforts
already in place.
5. The Authority's federal and state funds cannot be used to supplant other funds.
6. The Authority's federal and state funds should be allocated (a) to areas
demonstrating need based on an analysis of the nature and extent of the problem(s),
3

 and (b) to programs in areas where there is an opportunity to impact the identified
problem(s).
Also, to the extent permitted by program guidelines, some portion of available federal
and state funds should be used for the following:
1. To encourage collaborative approaches to problem solving, planning and
program implementation;
2. To encourage innovative pilot or demonstration projects;
3. To evaluate funded projects and support an ongoing program of research
designed to further planning and program development; and
4. To build the capacity of those
in the criminal justice system.

Law enforcement;
Prosecution, courts, and indigent defense;
Crime prevention and education;
Corrections and community corrections;
Drug treatment and enforcement;
Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement; and,
Crime victim and witness (other than compensation).

As these program areas effectively encompass all aspects of Illinois’ state and local
criminal justice system, they also touch upon all of the areas in which the Authority
operates, from developing information systems to supporting victim services. As such,
Byrne JAG presents the Authority with the opportunity not only to plan for how it should
direct Byrne JAG funds to support the State’s current justice system, but also to envision
the criminal justice system to which Illinois should aspire.
Another way of describing the Committee’s use of Byrne JAG planning is that it is a
vehicle for the Authority to think about and create objectives for Research, Grants, and
the Board that would help the agency realize its Guiding and Grantmaking Principles.
In this sense, this plan is designed not to begin and end with Byrne JAG activities, but
rather to lead into, inform, and unify the agency’s other planning activities under a shared
strategic vision. Because of the way the federal government distributes its dollars, the
Authority’s administration of its federal block grants and the activities they support can
easily become separated from each other, focusing on particular requirements of the
respective grants, but missing potential comprehensive opportunities to improve public
safety outcomes. This planning process ultimately brings all of the Authority’s planning
together, so that when the agency begins planning for VOCA and VAWA activities—and
thus thinks more deeply about how the agency should use Research and Grants to
improve outcomes for victims of crime, sexual assault, and domestic violence—it will do
so in coordination with the activities and lessons learned from its Byrne JAG planning
and funding.
PROCESS: BYRNE JAG GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
Consistent with the Authority’s Guiding and Grantmaking Principles, the Authority’s
Byrne JAG activities should be structured to accomplish the following overall goal:
The Authority should use research to inform grantmaking which supports programs that
1. “test innovative approaches to emerging problems” and build capacity for
jurisdictions to adopt effective ways in which to control crime and strengthen
public safety, 3 and

 2. provide a critical statewide public safety benefit.

The Committee defined particular goals that Byrne JAG programs should accomplish
under the fund’s seven program areas to ensure that the Authority’s funding is not driven
merely by inputs and outputs, but rather by outcomes.
Law Enforcement
• Goal: To support the development and implementation of policing strategies that
are data-driven, evidence-informed or have promise to reduce serious crime,
especially violent crime, and strengthen partnerships and the trust between
citizens and the justice system.
Prosecution, Court Programs, and Indigent Defense
• Prosecution Goal: To support protect public safety programs that balance the
needs to hold offenders accountable in an equitable manner, ensure the
fundamental rights, liberties and due process of the accused, protect victim’s
constitutional rights, and in so doing help restore the trust between citizens and
the justice system.
• Court Programs Goal: To support problem solving and specialty courts that
balance offender rehabilitation with public safety and in doing so help restore the
trust between citizens and the justice system.
• Indigent Defense Goal: To support, through resources and training, those
mandated to protect the fundamental rights, liberties and due process of the
accused and connecting defendants with community based services when possible
and appropriate.
Prevention and Education
• Goal: To support evidence-informed and promising strategies to reduce crime
and violence, mitigate its harmful effects and in doing so strengthening
communities’ capacities and factual understanding of the causes of crime in order
to prevent crime and violence.
Corrections and Community Corrections
• Goal: To enhance the safety of correctional facilities and communities, support
evidence informed or promising behavioral change programming guided by
proven risk assessment for services in order to reduce reoffending, with an
emphasis on programming that allows offenders to remain in their communities
when appropriate.
Drug Treatment and Enforcement Programs
• Goal: To support evidence-informed and promising efforts that break the cycle of
system involvement for people with mental illness, cognitive disability, and
substance abuse.

6

 Victim and witness programs (other than compensation)
• Goal: To support the needs of victims and witnesses while also respecting and
supporting victims’ rights and choices.
Planning, Evaluation, and Technology Improvement
• Goal: To support planning, research and evaluation that examines key criminal
justice topics and programs and identifies promising and evidence-based
practices for the purposes of informing key stakeholders. To support the
development of a statewide information sharing environment, through the use of
Global standards, that facilities timely, accurate, and efficient exchange of
operational data for criminal justice stakeholders.
PROCESS FOR BYRNE JAG GRANTMAKING, FFY 2015-18
To create a process that will enable the Board to assess whether the Authority achieves
the goals it set for the agency under Byrne JAG, the Committee believed it is essential
first to understand the recent history of how the agency has administered its Byrne JAG
funding, as well as its overall federal and state grantmaking. (To see an overview of the
Authority’s recent grantmaking, see Appendix 1.) While the recent history of the
Authority’s funding makes it clear that Byrne JAG has been used to support important
programs throughout the State, the Committee’s analysis of its recent history pointed to
four areas that needed improvement.
1. In recent years, while the Authority has used researched-informed RFPs for its
other federal funds, the agency has not made sufficient use of research-informed
Request for Proposals (RFPs) for Byrne JAG funding, which is the most effective
way to ensure an open, transparent, and competitive process to award grants.
2. While required matches help encourage grantees to invest their own resources
grant programs, the Authority has no clear policy on grantee matches for its Byrne
JAG initiatives. This lack of a policy has led to inconsistent use of matches, and a
missed opportunity for the Authority to help its grantees build capacity to
administer their program, particularly as federal funding has significantly
decreased in recent years.
3. Few Byrne JAG grants are designed, supported, or evaluated by research. This is
problematic, as the best way to ensure that grant programs promote particular
public safety outcomes is to require them to be based in evidence and have clearly
defined and measureable goals and objectives that can be assessed through
evaluation.
4. Although Byrne JAG is ideally suited to “spur innovation,” most of Illinois’
Byrne JAG programs are based in legacy with insufficient rigorous research
about the effectiveness of the programs and no established policy about how
long funding will last or what kind process the agency will use to transition
programs off of funding. As Byrne JAG funds have decreased significantly in
recent years, these practices inhibit the Authority from demonstrating what is
effective in reducing crime and violence and from supporting new programs to
test different strategies to increase public safety.

7

 To address these areas of needed improvement and to ensure that Research and Grants
realize their overall goals, the Authority identified the following objectives for its work
under Byrne JAG for the next three federal fiscal years:
Year 1 (By October 2016):

To: Strategic Opportunities Committee
From: John Maki, Executive Director
Date: February 18, 2016
Subject: Proposed VOCA and VAWA Strategic Planning Process
Attachments: 2014-16 Victim Service Funding Plan

The purpose of this memo is to outline for the Strategic Opportunity Committee the strategic
process the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (“Authority”) plans to use to
determine how it will administer both the State’s Victims of Crime Act (“VOCA”) and STOP
Violence Against Women Award (“VAWA”) awards for calendar years 2017-19.
Background
VOCA and VAWA are federal public safety formula block grants that all states and territories
receive on an annual basis from the U.S. Office of Justice Program’s Office for Victims of Crime
and the Office on Violence Against Women, respectively. VOCA funding must be used to
support direct services to victims of crime, which are designed to respond to victims’ emotional
and physical needs while assisting them in understanding and participating in the criminal justice
system. VAWA funding is required to promote a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to
improving the effective criminal justice system's response to violent crimes against women and
to the improvement of advocacy and services in cases involving violent crimes against women.
Each state and territory must allocate 25 percent of VAWA funding for law enforcement, 25
percent for prosecutors, 30 percent for victim services (of which at least 10 percent must be
distributed to culturally specific community-based organizations), 5 percent to state and local
courts, and 15 percent for discretionary distribution. VOCA has a minimum requirement of 10%
each for funding domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse and underserved victims (as
defined by the state).

As Illinois’ State Administering Agency, the Authority is charged with distributing these funds
in accordance with the following:
•

The U.S. Office of Justice Programs’ rules and regulations;

•

State law, most importantly the 2014 Illinois Grants Accountability and Transparency
Act (“GATA”), which requires a rigorous use of competitive Request for Proposals
(“RFP’s”) to determine funding;

 •

The Authority’s administrative rules, which allow the agency to administer funding based
on a needs-based analysis conducted by the agency or competitive RFP’s issued by the
agency; and

•

A three-year strategic plan that the agency’s Board creates in coordination with victim
service experts, advocates and providers from across the State. This strategic planning is
a requirement of the Office on Violence Against Women to be eligible for VAWA funds.
Since VAWA and VOCA both fund victim services, the Authority has historically used
VAWA’s mandated planning to guide how it will administer both of these federal block
grants. The current victim service plan is set to run through calendar year 2016.

Proposed Process
As the Authority prepares to engage in strategic planning for victim services in 2017-19, staff
recommend that due to significant changes in funding, the agency use a more robust analysis of
victims needs and services to inform separate plans for VOCA and VAWA.
In 2015, Congress raised the cap of VOCA’s fund, and as a result, the Office of Justice Programs
increased Illinois’ VOCA award increased 437% to $78 million dollars for Federal Fiscal Year
15 (FFY15). Per federal rule, the Authority must administer these funds in three federal fiscal
years, which includes $3.9 million for the agency’s administrative costs. It is uncertain whether
Congress will continue this level of funding in future years. The increase in VOCA funding
presents a critical opportunity for the Authority to work with stakeholders across the State not
only to strengthen the services that are currently provided to victims of crime, but also to identify
and address unmet needs. To ensure that Illinois maximizes the potential of its VOCA and
VAWA funds to improve victim outcomes through research-informed funding, the Authority
recommends a three-pronged planning and funding process: technical assistance and Authority
internal capacity building, expansion of funding under current plan, and strategic planning and
implementation.

I. Technical assistance and Authority internal capacity building.
To make certain that Illinois is positioned not only to strengthen the capacity of current services
for victims and the organizations that deliver them, but also to effectively address victims’ unmet
needs, the Authority plans to draw upon the funds reserved for the agency’s administrative costs
to issue a RFP in early March 2016 for research technical assistance. Specifically, this RFP will
ask for competitive bids from research and policy institutions to conduct a robust needs
assessment to document the types of victimization experienced statewide and the associated
victim service responses to inform Illinois strategic planning and help guide the agency’s
strategic planning process. Authority staff anticipate that the agency will be able procure
technical assistance by May or June.
Under this same prong, the Authority will make the following essential improvements to its
operations through the use of VOCA’s administrative funds:
2

 1. Hire necessary support staff to administer the funds, including a victimologist (a researcher
who specializes in victimization, who will lead the Authority’s research unit work on
VOCA and VAWA activities), legal support, grant monitors, and a grantee auditor.
2. Issue an RFP in February to rewrite InfoNet’s application code. InfoNet is a web-based data
collection system used by over 100 victim service providers statewide and supported by the
Authority. InfoNet’s data has informed victim services strategic planning for nearly two
decades. The system’s utility and efficiency will improve exponentially after its code is
rewritten to incorporate technology advances since it was first implemented in 2001,
increasing utility for existing users and improving data quality and accessibility. The
Authority has already worked with the State’s Chief Information Officer to design an RFP
for InfoNet’s rewrite based on a $250,000 award it has received from the federal Office for
Victims of Crime to support this project. The Authority estimates that the total cost for
InfoNet’s rewrite will be $450,000.
3. Issue an RFP for a new grant-management system, which will enable ICJIA to monitor its
grants effectively, reduce redundant activities and improve the management of over $150
million in federal and state funding for over 200 grantees. The new system will be webbased, allowing the grantees to input program data that will be used to analyze performance
metrics and accelerate ICJIA's ability to communicate internally and externally with grant
stakeholders. It will be designed to integrate seamlessly with the State’s new ERP system.
These steps will ensure that the VOCA funds address the diversity of victim’s needs across
Illinois while also ensuring that the grants are effectively managed.

II. Expansion under Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee 2014-16 Plan
As noted above, the Authority is operating under the current Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee
2014-16 Plan (“2014-16 Plan”). In order to prevent any lapse in core victim services funded
under VOCA, the Authority recently approved renewal funding using the new FFY15 VOCA
funds totaling approximately $15.6 million dollars. The types of victim services funded include
services for child abuse, domestic, elder and sexual violence victims as well as victims of drunk
driving and other violent crimes. Some of these grantees work with special populations such as
rural victims, incarcerated victims or those with disabilities. In addition, many of these grantees
work within the criminal justice system to support victims as their cases progress through the
criminal justice system.
These grants have varied end dates ranging from summer 2016 to spring of 2017. To ensure that
there is no lapse in core victim services, and to responsibly bolster the capacity of currently
funded programs, Authority staff recommends that the agency approve a 25% increase to the
current grantees’ funding levels as identified in the 2014-16 Plan, from $15,062,270 to
$18,827,837. Authority staff further recommends that up to $2 million of the FFY 15 VOCA
funds be made available for a transitional housing for domestic and sexual violence victims RFP.
This figure is an estimated increase from the amount that was allocated to transitional housing in
3

 prior years. The 2014-16 Plan identified transitional housing as an important victim service, but
the Authority was ultimately not able to support the programming due to the previous VOCA
funding level. The goal of this housing program is to help victims beyond the immediate
emergency housing phase. The impact of these services is great as the programming strengthens
families by preventing homelessness and by providing services that increased victim’s
preparedness for living independently and free from violent crime. After this allocation, there
will be a balance of approximately $39 million to fund programs identified through the strategic
planning process.

III. Strategic plan and implementation.
Based on the needs assessment, the Authority will engage the Strategic Opportunities
Committee, with expanded membership to include victim service experts and advocates, to
complete a three-year strategic plan for its VAWA funds, with the goal of issuing RFPs under
the new plan by end of 2016. After the Strategic Opportunities Committee completes planning
for VAWA, it will begin working on the Authority’s three-year plan for Illinois’ VOCA funds,
also with the goal of issuing RFPs under the new plan by the end of 2016. It is anticipated that
these RFPs will address core victim service needs and directed at unserved populations of
victims, emerging victim needs, and innovating practices.

Conclusion
Through its more than 30 year history, the Authority has earned the reputation as one of the
leading state-based centers for victim services and best practices. With the opportunity presented
by the unprecedented increase of VOCA funding, the Authority is committed to continuing this
tradition and using research-driven funding and strategic planning to improve outcomes for
victims and in so doing strengthening the Illinois criminal justice system.

 I. INTRODUCTION
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), authorized by Title IV of the Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and subsequently reauthorized as the Violence
Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 and 2013, provides
financial assistance to states for developing and strengthening effective law enforcement and
prosecution strategies and victim services in cases involving violent crimes against women. To
be eligible, states must develop a plan in accordance with requirements set out in the Act. The
Act specifies that states must allocate at least 25 percent of the VAWA funds it receives to law
enforcement, 25 percent to prosecution, 30 percent to nonprofit, non-governmental victim
services, and at least 5 percent to courts. The remaining 15 percent may be allocated at the state’s
discretion within the parameters of the Act. Funds may not be used to replace dollars already
committed to a service or program.

The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (Authority) is the state agency established to
promote community safety by providing public policy makers, criminal justice professionals, and
others with the information, tools, and technology needed to make effective decisions that
improve the quality of criminal justice in Illinois. The Authority is governed by a 25-member
board of state and local leaders in the criminal justice community, plus experts from the private
sector. In addition, the Authority is supported by 67 full-time and 3 part-time professional staff.
Authorized under the Authority’s power to “apply for, receive, establish priorities for, allocate,
disburse, and spend grant funds,” the Authority is responsible for administering a variety of grant
funds, including 15 federal programs and 15 state programs. The combined budgets for these
programs exceeded $169 million in FFY13. As the state agency charged with administering the
Services*Training*Officers*Prosecutors (STOP) VAWA award in Illinois, the Authority is
responsible for developing the plan for distributing these federal funds.

The current STOP VAWA Implementation Plan will guide the use of the STOP VAWA awards
received by the State of Illinois for a three-year period, 2014 through 2016. The plan will be
introduced for approval by the Authority Board at its June 6, 2014 meeting. The plan is
organized in the format pursuant to the 2013 STOP VAWA reauthorization and explained in the
2014 application.

 II. DESCRIPTION OF PLANNING PROCESS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened meetings to review past priorities and
define new ones for the use of STOP VAWA and Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) funds. The Ad
Hoc Victim Services Committee, comprised of criminal justice and victim services professionals
as well as members of the community (please see appendix A for full membership list), reviewed
crime and victimization trend data, information on current efforts, and data from funded
programs. Participants included the executive directors of the major statewide victim service
associations (including the coalitions against domestic violence and sexual assault) and
individual agencies representing underserved communities, such as Mujeres Latinas en Accion,
Arab American Family Services, and the Center on Halsted, a gay/lesbian/bi/transgender
organization. There are no recognized tribes in Illinois but discussions have begun as to how to
identify and include agencies representing Native Americans living in the state, especially the
metropolitan Chicago area.

The Committee considered:
•

The need for a unified understanding and response across the criminal justice/victim
service system.

•

The need to identify and refine data collection.

•

The need to increase services for linguistically and geographically isolated victim
populations.

•

The need for cross-training and interdisciplinary training.

•

The need to create partnerships to coordinate the effective use of resources.

•

The need to ensure a minimum provision of basic services to all victims of crime and
prioritize funding for direct services.

Based on the above information and mindful of the differences in purposes and allowable
activities between the two funds and in consideration of the information detailed in the following
sections of the plan, the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee developed priority program types
for the use of VAWA funds and funding priorities for the use of VOCA funds. This plan will be
reviewed for approval by the Authority Board at its June 6, 2014, meeting.

 In summary, the Ad Hoc Committee recommended that FFY14-16 VAWA funds are used
principally to continue to support programs that:
•

Increase victim services for linguistically and geographically isolated populations.

•

Support services that improve the justice system’s response to underserved or special
needs groups.

•

Provide support to reduce barriers in criminal justice system for special populations.

•

Support specialized criminal justice victim services.

•

Fund multidisciplinary models and training.

•

Promote multidisciplinary approaches to sexual assault or domestic violence in other
communities that are not currently funded.

•

Increase community-based legal advocacy.

•

Identify, refine and share data and other information among justice system agencies.

The planning process for the Illinois STOP VAWA funds continues throughout the year in
meetings of the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee, the Authority Budget Committee, and
meetings with individual subgrantees as needed. The recommendation made by the Victim
Services Ad Hoc Committee, once approved by the Authority Board, will be utilized in future
funding recommendations made by staff to the Authority Budget Committee for all STOP
VAWA funds, The Budget Committee meets as needed throughout the year to discuss possible
funding recommendations and approve them, deny them, or request additional information from
staff for consideration.

Coordination
In the process of planning the October Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee meetings for the
development of the 2014-2016 S.T.O.P. VAWA Implementation Plan, material was requested
from the Illinois Department of Human Services (DHS) for the Family Violence Prevention and
Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 3

 Services Act program, and from the Illinois Department of Public Health (DPH) for Public
Health Services Act: Rape Prevention Education program. Both agencies were asked to
participate in the VSAHC meetings and present information. Since both agencies indicated that
they were working on plans for the related programs, the VSAHC meetings would occur first and
that the VAWA Implementation Plan would be used as references for the other plans.

•

The unemployment rate was higher in the southern counties of Illinois and, to a lesser degree, the
Northern counties outside Cook and Collar counties.

•

The counties where unemployment rates were higher are more likely to be rural counties with
fewer sources of employment.

•

Those needing services and are unemployed may find it difficult to pay for or get to the services
they need.

The southern counties were most likely to have higher rates of individuals ages 25 years old or
older who did not have at least a high school diploma (or equivalent). These same counties also
have higher concentrations of poverty and unemployment.

•

Those without education may find it more difficult than those with an education to take the steps
necessary to seek services when needed.

•

The number of households where English was not the primary language spoken were concentrated
in Cook County, Collar counties, and the remaining northern counties.

•

There were also several counties in the southern region (particularly southwestern Illinois) where
there were higher concentrations of households where English was not the primary language.

•

Those who do not speak English may have difficulty accessing services

•

Cultural difference may also be barriers to victims seeking services.

*

Linguistically isolated household: A household in which all members 14 years old and older speak a non-English language
and also have difficulty with English.

Counties with higher portions of people 60 and older are spread throughout the state, but several
are concentrated in the southern and western counties.

• The southern part of Illinois is mostly rural, and it may be difficult for the older population to

It should be noted that the Illinois State Police has changed the way they report crime. As a result, it is not
possible to do trend analyses. In 2011, Cook County had the highest rate of reported violent offenses,
twice that of the State as a whole. The other regions reported violent crime rates below the State rate.

• On average, 938 domestic offenses each year were reported to law enforcement for every 100,000
residents in Illinois during 2010 and 2011, the most recent years available. Regional and county
level data should be interpreted with caution because not all jurisdictions are represented in the
data. 1

• Cook County had the highest annual rate of offenses reported statewide at 1,392 per 100,000
population. This is 49 percent higher than the statewide rate.
•

Although Cook County had the highest rate among Illinois’ regions, the four highest counties are
in the Central region and had rates nearly or more than double the statewide rate. These counties
include Sangamon (3,117); Warren (2,208); Macon (1,875); and Champaign (1,786).

Although reporting of domestic offenses is mandated by the Illinois State Police, compliance has not been systematically tested and reasons
for non-compliance are not known. See table on the following page to see which law enforcement agencies are not included AND serve a
population of 20,000 or greater.

•

Between 2008 and 2012, over a quarter million orders of protection (OPs) were issued by Illinois
courts, averaging more than 53,000 each year. A notable increase occurred during this period in both
the volume and rate at which orders are being issued. The sheer number of OPs increased by more
than 16 percent (49,266 in 2008 to 57,403 in 2012), while the rate increased by just over 15 percent.
In 2008, 387 OPs were issued for every 100,000 residents; this number increased to 446 in 2012.

•

Although Cook County comprised the greatest number of OPs issued in 2012 (nearly 40 percent of the
statewide total), the rate of orders issued per population was higher in the Northern, Central and
Southern regions of the state. The Central region had the highest rate of OPs issued in 2012, at 629
orders issued per 100,000 population, followed by the Northern region at 529, the Southern at 512,
and Cook County’s rate was 433 OPs issued for every 100,000 people.

•

Cook County was the only region where a decrease was seen in OPs issued during the period, albeit
only slightly. The number of OPs decreased by just under 2 percent while the rate decreased by 3
percent since 2008. Meanwhile, all other regions of the state experienced substantial increases, most
notably in the Northern region with a rate and volume increase of 43 percent over the last five years.
The Central region was not far behind with a 39 percent increase in rate and 25 percent increase in
volume. Rates of OPs issued in the Southern and Collar county regions increased during the five-year
period by 31 percent and 17 percent respectively.

•

Between 2008 and 2012, more than 200,000 individuals received services from a domestic violence
community service provider in Illinois. Because some clients are served over multiple years, providers
statewide served an average of 53,600 people each year during the period. In 2012, a total of 53,047
clients were served.

•

Although there has been a slight decrease in the number and rate of clients served statewide (4 percent
and 5 percent respectively), the number of clients served from the Central region increased 9 percent
since 2008. Likewise, the rate of clients served compared to the population of the region increased
from 537 clients served per 100,000 residents to 581 clients, an increase of 8 percent. The largest
decrease was found among clients from the Northern region of the state. Both the number and rate of
clients served decreased by more than 9 percent, from 502 per 100,000 residents in 2008 to 454 per
1,000 in 2012.

•

During the five-year period, about 15 percent of clients served by providers were child witnesses to
domestic violence. Although the number of adult clients served by domestic violence service
providers decreased only by 3.5 percent during the period, a 15 percent decrease was seen in the
number of children served. The number of children served by providers decreased from 9,287 in 2008
to 8,393 in 2012.

• Nearly 4,300 Index criminal sexual assault offenses were reported to Illinois law enforcement
agencies in 2011, yielding a rate of 33 victims per 100,000.

• Although nearly half the Index criminal sexual assault offenses reported in 2011 were reported in
Cook County (46 percent of the statewide total), counties in the Central region had the highest rate
of offenses reported statewide at 44 per 100,000 population. This is more than 30 percent higher
than the statewide rate.

•

Between 2008 and 2012, more than 36,700 individuals received services from a sexual assault
community-based service provider in Illinois. Because some clients are served over multiple years,
providers statewide served an average of 10,460 people each year during the period. In 2012, a total of
10,499 clients were served.

•

Although the number and rate of clients served statewide has remained stable during the five- year
period, notable increases occurred in Cook and the Collar counties. In 2008, providers served just over
1,300 Cook County residents compared to about 2,100 in 2012. Similarly, the rate of clients served
per 100,000 population increased from 26 to 40, nearly a 60 percent increase. About 1,400 residents
from collar counties were served in 2008 compared to nearly 1,900 in 2012, increasing the rate from
47 to 60 clients served per 100,000 population by about 30 percent. It should be noted that some of
these increases may be explained by InfoNet data contributors reporting their clients’ county of
residence more often than in prior years. In 2008, 25 percent of the clients’ county of residence was
recorded as “unknown” in InfoNet, whereas that was true for only 15 percent in 2012. Even
considering the improved data completeness during the time period, these increases are worth noting.

•

Although the largest increases were seen among clients served from Cook and the Collar regions, the
highest rates of clients receiving sexual assault services occurred in the Northern and Central regions
of the state. In 2012, more than 143 clients from counties in the Northern region were served per
100,000 population – a rate 75 percent higher than the statewide rate. In the same year, 109 clients
from the Central counties were served per 100,000 population, which was 34 percent higher than the
statewide rate.

•

Over five years, 2008 to 2012, nearly 41,000 cases of child sexual abuse were reported to the Illinois
Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), averaging 8,154 reports each year. The rate of
reported child sexual abuse cases remained stable during this period, with a statewide average of 262
reports for every 100,000 children ages 0-17 in 2012.

•

Although Cook County comprised the greatest number of reported cases in 2012 (33 percent of the
statewide total), higher rates of reported child sexual abuse were seen in the Southern and Central
regions of the state. Both regions had rates more than 50 percent above the statewide rate in 2012 as
well as the entire 5-year period.

•

When child sexual abuse is reported to DCFS, the case is opened and investigated and later deemed
“indicated” if that investigation can confirm that abuse occurred. During the five-year period, 28
percent of reported cases were indicated by DCFS. Although some variation was seen at the county
level, regional variations were minimal ranging between 27 and 29 percent of reports that were later
indicated.

•

The statewide rate of elder abuse cases reported to the Illinois Department on Aging per 100,000
population aged 60 or older remained almost exactly the same during this five-year period,
decreasing only by four from 487 in state fiscal year (SFY) 2008 to 483 in SFY 2012. Yet the
volume of reported cases increased from 10,597 in SFY 2008 to 11,614 in SFY 2012, nearly a 10
percent increase. The stable rate with substantial increase in number is explained by a growing
population of people age 60 and older. Since 2008, this population has increased by more than 10
percent in Illinois, comprising nearly 19 percent of the total population in 2012.

•

Although the Collar region had the lowest rate of reported elder abuse cases statewide, this region
experienced the greatest increase during the period. The rate in SFY 2008 was 250 reports per
100,000 people age 60 or older, increasing to 275 reports in SFY 2012, an increase of more than
10 percent. The Northern region also saw a smaller increase of about 5 percent during the last five
years, while the Central region saw the only notable decrease statewide. Rate of reported cases in
the Central region decreased from 607 to 565 reports per 100,000 population age 60 or older,
about a 7 percent decrease.

•

Although the greatest number of reported cases of elder abuse occurred in Cook County during
SFY 2012, comprising more than one-third of cases statewide, the rate of cases reported in Cook
County was actually about 7 percent lower than the statewide rate. Additionally, the Southern
region had the highest rate of elder abuse during the same year. In SFY 2012, more than 785 cases
of elder abuse were reported per 100,000 people age 60 or older. This is 62 percent higher than the
statewide rate of 483.

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 38

 a. Reduction of Domestic Violence-related Homicides
The Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) releases an annual report gathering
information from media sources concerning domestic violence homicides in Illinois with information
relating to charges filed, convictions and sentencing. The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
will work with ICADV, and other parties, to develop a series of goals and objectives to better understand
victims and the provision of services related to domestic violence homicides.
B. Priority Areas
a. Current Programs Supported with STOP VAWA Funds by Purpose Area
Purpose Area: Specialized Units
Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Multi-Disciplinary Team Response Programs
Four Multi-Disciplinary Team Response Programs (MDT) are being funded in Illinois. Peoria County,
McLean County, and St. Clair County provide services to victims of domestic violence and Kankakee
County provides services to victims of sexual assault.

The MDT programs aim to bridge the gaps in service to victims of both domestic violence and sexual
assault within the criminal justice system in Illinois. Model protocols and model guidelines for responding
to these victims are developed through the work of the MDTs. The programs have established a multidisciplinary approach toward the handling of domestic violence and sexual assault cases. In Peoria and St.
Clair counties, all services are centrally located so victims only need to go to one location to start the
criminal justice processes and receive the needed assistance to move forward on meeting the individual
needs of the victim.

Weekly and monthly meetings are held with the team. The teams are made up of the state’s attorney’s
office, the sheriff’s office, probation, court services, and the victim service center, as well as non-funded
partners in each county. The focus of the meetings are the service provisions available by each partner to
ensure collaboration among the team members.

Sexual assault medical advocacy

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 39

 The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) provides leadership in coordinating Illinois’ efforts to serve
sexual assault survivors. Through the Illinois Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program, the OAG
coordinates adult and adolescent SANE 40-hour educational component training on a statewide basis and
provides two-day Advanced SANE and 40-hour Pediatric SANE trainings to practicing SANEs. The
Illinois SANE coordinator, a registered nurse certified as a SANE through the International Association of
Forensic Nurses, is paid with funds from this grant. With the support of the Crime Victim Services
Division and other divisions within the OAG, the Illinois SANE program has run efficiently for six years.

The mission of the Illinois SANE program is to increase the number of SANEs working in Illinois by
providing high quality, consistent education and support for registered nurses and other professionals
serving sexual assault survivors. By educating nurses, police, prosecutors, advocates, and others,
survivors of sexual assault will be ensured of receiving quality patient care; full, fair and accurate forensic
evaluations; and a multi-disciplinary approach that holds offenders accountable for these heinous crimes.

Domestic violence and sexual assault prosecution
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Prosecution Coordination
Program serves felony sexual assault victims and felony and misdemeanor domestic violence victims.
Through this program, victims of violence against women benefit from services provided by a variety of
personnel, including: domestic violence investigators who provide an essential source of early contact,
education, and service to victims; Resource Center staff who link victims of domestic violence and sexual
assault to resources such as job training, education and employment services; felony review specialists
who have contact with victims of felony sexual assault and domestic violence shortly after they have
reported their victimization; a victim specialist who assists adult victims of felony sexual assault through
the court process; and assistant state’s attorneys assigned to the program who vertically prosecute
offenders of felony sexual assault and felony domestic violence.
Domestic violence law enforcement
The Chicago Police Department (CPD) VAWA funded Law Enforcement Domestic Violence Training
and Data Analysis Program supports a training technician and a Chief Operations Research Analyst
(CORA). The training technician provides domestic violence training to CPD officers at all 25 Chicago
police districts. These trainings are based on data concerning domestic violence activity in the districts.
This information is provided at the request of district command. Trainings are provided to domestic
Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 40

 violence advocates in both governmental and private sectors. All receive training on the Chicago
Response Protocol and specialized training curriculum as needed.

The CORA position maintains a domestic violence statistical database. This data is monitored for
accuracy. All requests for domestic violence statistical data are fulfilled by the CORA. Both quarterly and
annual domestic violence statistical reports are completed and posted on the CPD internet/intranet
websites. The CORA provides monthly reports to the training technician to assist in the preparation of
training curriculum and reaching targeted groups for training.

Purpose Area: Victim Services
Services for underserved areas of victim groups
The Illinois Coalitions Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence subcontract with their member
agencies to perform direct victims services and provide direct service providers with specialized training.
The five Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) programs include a large general
program funding basic advocacy services for victims of domestic violence and specialized programs
serving underserved areas and populations and child victims/witnesses of domestic violence. The four
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) projects fund special services for underserved
populations as well as basic medical and legal advocacy services at coalition member agencies across the
state, including 14 satellite centers and two new centers.
Transitional housing services
The Authority currently funds 9 transitional housing programs for victims of domestic violence and their
children. The 9 programs are funded with a combination of VOCA and VAWA monies. For these
projects, VOCA funds are used to the support salaries of transitional housing case managers or advocates
who provide intensive services to build victim self-sufficiency. Each project also has a VAWA
agreement which funds housing, utilities, and other key services.

Each of the programs establishes its own guidelines for client screening and program participation.
Because of the limited number of housing units funded, the number of victims serviced by this group of
programs remains small. The impact of these services, however, is great, giving victims of domestic

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 41

 violence and their children the opportunity to learn or regain skills and confidence necessary to live lives
free of violence.
Services to female inmates
The Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) uses VAWA funds for its Victim Services to Female
Inmates program. It provides facilitated groups for female inmates who were victims of domestic violence
or sexual assault prior to incarceration. The program is available in all prisons serving adult women and
girls. Staff involved in the program includes mental health professionals (MHP), IDOC and Illinois
Department of Juvenile Justice (IDJJ) administrators, program services staff, and other IDOC and IDJJ
staff. The MHP staff has been trained in Seeking Safety, a program that treats groups of victims for
trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder caused by domestic violence and sexual assault.

Additionally the grant program provides staff with training on, and other topics directly related to,
the effects of domestic violence and sexual assault. Additional training for these staff and staff leading
other victims’ groups under this program has included information on domestic violence, the symptoms of
trauma, and specific techniques for counseling victims, and related topics. The training increases staff
awareness of the need for domestic violence treatment programs. It provides them with the knowledge
and tools needed to start addressing victim recovery issues with the female inmates they encounter during
the normal scope of their work.

Services to victims of domestic violence
The City of Chicago’s Domestic Violence Help Line’s mission is to provide a single point of access to
domestic violence services. To fulfill this mission, the Help Line provides toll-free, 24-hour, confidential,
and multi-lingual assistance to callers and functions as a clearinghouse for domestic violence services and
information in the greater Chicago area. The Help Line provides assistance to victims, concerned family
members and friends, helping professionals such as domestic violence advocates, health care providers,
police officers, faith leaders, prosecutors, employers, and community residents.

The Help Line is staffed by trained and certified domestic violence advocates known as Victim
Information and Referral Advocates (VIRAs) who are employed by the Chicago Metropolitan Battered
Women’s Network. VIRAs are on-site and available to answer calls 24-hours a day, 365 days a year.

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 42

 Spanish speaking VIRAs are always available to answer calls and staff can access the AT&T Language
Line for up to 140 additional languages.

The Help Line receives calls for assistance and information from across Illinois. Callers are provided with
immediate information about their rights and options and when desired, are offered a direct three-way
linkage to community-based domestic violence resources including shelter, counseling, legal advocacy,
and children’s services. The Help Line’s current computer database consists of over 170 different local
domestic violence resources and the VIRA’s are able to navigate these various services to target and link
callers with the most appropriate and accessible program. The Help Line’s database is also capable of
searching for services by zip code so that if desired, victims can receive referral services that are located
in their community area.

c. Documentation of Need, Intent, and Results
See Appendix (D)

d. 20% Sexual Assault Set a Side
In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal fiscal year’s allocated Service Provider funds
to the two coalitions in Illinois; the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) and the Illinois
Coalition Against Domestic violence (ICADV) in equal amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to
their program agencies for service to underserved areas or victim groups. The VSAHC has recommended
that the Authority continue designating the service provider funds in this manner. As we implement the
priorities established by the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee with the 20% sexual assault set aside as
guidance, we will strive for a minimum of a 75/25 split in funding for future programing with all Request
for Proposals under each of the funding areas: Law Enforcement, Prosecution, Discretionary and Courts.
The following charts illustrate the current domestic violence / sexual assault funding relationships:

 C. Grant-making Strategy and Funding Cycle
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority uses two methods in making subgrant awards—
through a request for proposals and via needs-based analysis. Most VAWA designations have been made
in the recent past through needs-based analysis. The ICJIA Research & Analysis Unit partners with the
Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee to identify service needs and gaps in service areas. Staff then works
with selected agencies within those geographical areas to:
1) Give priority to areas of varying geographic size with the greatest showing of need.
2) Consider the population of the geographic area to be served when determining subgrants.
3) Equitably distribute monies on a geographic basis, including non-urban and rural areas of various
geographic sizes.
4) Ensure that the needs of previously underserved populations are identified and addressed.
These grants run on a 12-month basis. Grantees were given an initial three year funding period, but have
been continued as per the recommendation of the Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee at their subsequent
meetings. Grant writing trainings are periodically provided by the agency, and technical assistance is
given through the grant monitor assigned to each grant in the way of desk monitoring and site visits, and
are particular to the federal program. Grants are designated for a single year, and renewed each year upon
analysis of goals and objectives. The parameters and the priorities identified in this plan will be forwarded
to the Authority Budget Committee for the designation of funds.

Programs receiving Violence Against Women Act funds have measurable objectives and grant recipients
are required to submit data reports to the Authority on a monthly or quarterly basis. Standard reports were
developed by the Department of Justice to capture information about the victims served, including
demographic information; primary language; county of residence; disability; relationship of the victim to
the offender; the nature of the victimization; services provided and the community collaboration in which
each program participates. A narrative report is also required describing major accomplishments, barriers
confronting the program, and plans for overcoming these problems. These data reports are reviewed by
Authority staff to determine each program's progress toward its objectives.

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 50

 Each program is assigned a monitor who offers information and technical assistance in accordance with
the federal grant guidelines. Monitors oversee program progress throughout the performance period
through daily desk monitoring, the review of quarterly fiscal and data reports, and annual site visits. All
monitoring activity is reviewed and approved by the Victim Services Programs Administrator, as well as
legal and fiscal staff members of the agency. The information gathered is presented to the Victim Services
Ad Hoc Committee for funding recommendations.

Each VAWA application, Exhibit A, for any governmental unit requesting VAWA funding is asked to
explain the consultation process for their application, including the name of the victim service agency
within their service area consulted. A letter of support is also required from each agency listed.
Responses to this question are reviewed as part of the application process by the monitor.

D. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED VICTIMS
a. State Set A Side for Culturally Specific Communities
As the state administering agency for the S.T.O.P. VAWA funds in Illinois, ICJIA splits the victim
service funds from each award evenly between the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) and
the Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV). To ensure that we meet the mandated 10
percent of the victim service funds for culturally specific and linguistically sensitive programs, each of the
coalitions are mandated to report, through quarterly data reports which show the numbers of victims from
culturally specific underserved populations, to exemplify how this requirement is met.

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 52

 ICADV subcontracted with 17 local domestic violence programs that implemented 19 projects funded by
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The projects addressed the needs of three categories of
underserved survivor groups: rural women, Latinas, and chemically dependent survivors.
These funds also supported 11 Latina services projects in Illinois. Because of these grants, 2,024 new and
1,300 ongoing survivors received services and information available in Spanish. These clients were
provided 9,425 hours of services including counseling and advocacy. In agencies receiving VAWA
funding, Latinos comprise 33 percent of the total client population. This compares very well to 2000
Census figures for the percentage of Latinos in Illinois (12.3 percent) and to our statewide domestic
violence program average, which places Latinos at 19 percent of the total population of clients.
ICASA subcontracts with 13 agencies that use S.T.O.P. VAWA funds to provide services to victims of
sexual assault. Funds have been made available annually to these agencies to implement 14 projects that
target previously unserved or underserved victim populations in Illinois. Services provided by all of the
grantee programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to individual medical and
criminal justice advocacy. The primary focus is to provide crisis counseling and advocacy services.
Additionally, grantees provide on-going counseling, educational programs, and professional training
V. CONCLUSION
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is the state agency established to promote community
safety by providing public policy makers, criminal justice professionals, and others with the information,
tools, and technology needed to make effective decisions that improve the quality of criminal justice in
Illinois. Towards that purpose, the Authority’s Victim Services Ad Hoc Committee recommended that
FFY14-16 VAWA funds be used principally to continue to support programs that:
•

Train criminal justice personnel.

•

Build successful multidisciplinary efforts.

•

Promote multidisciplinary approaches to sexual assault or domestic violence in other
communities.

•

Identify the needs of victim service providers and refines data collection and other
information among criminal justice system agencies.

•

Support services that improve the criminal justice system’s response to underserved or
cultural or linguistically isolated victim populations.

•

Analyze barriers identified by programs to develop solutions and best practices.

Illinois Violence Against Women Implementation Plan

Page 53

 Once approved by the Authority Board, the recommendations made by the Victim Services Ad Hoc
Committee will be utilized in the funding recommendations made by staff for all STOP VAWA funds to
the Authority Budget Committee, which approves every designation made through this program.

Programs receiving Violence Against Women Act funds will continue to focus on the safety of the
victims and the accountability of the offender, and to prioritize culturally specific and linguistically
sensitive services. Programming designations are made from each of the five program areas mandated by
the STOP VAWA guidelines and tracked accordingly. Staff, in consultation with the Victim Services Ad
Hoc Committee, identifies service needs and gaps in service areas, and work with agencies to:

1) Give priority to areas of varying geographic size with the greatest showing of need.
2) Take into consideration the population of the geographic area to be served when determining
subgrants.
3) Equitably distribute monies on a geographic basis, including non-urban and rural areas of various
geographic sizes.
4) Ensure that the needs of previously underserved populations are identified and addressed.
