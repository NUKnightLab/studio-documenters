implement an Integrated Tax Processing System (ITSP). In November, 2015, this Board approved Agenda Item
No. 15-6468, enacting a Hotel Accommodations Tax. The Bureau of Technology, in cooperation with the
Department of Revenue, now seeks Board approval of an amendment to the ITSP contract in order to incorporate
into the ITSP the automatic processing of tax information and revenue generated by the new tax.
This is a Comparable Government Procurement pursuant to Section 34-140 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
Revenue Solutions, Inc. was previously awarded a contract through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP)
process by the State of Rhode Island. Cook County wishes to leverage this procurement effort.
A motion was made by Commissioner Morrison, seconded by Commissioner Steele, that this Contract
Amendment (Technology) be recommended for approval. The motion carried by the following vote:
