The requested action in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable federal,
state and local laws and CHA board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to

Property Summary
Location: Located in Chicago’s Garfield Ridge community area within the 22nd Ward, the
approximately 40-acre site is roughly bounded by the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) to the north,
45th Street to the south, Lavergne Avenue to the west, and Cicero Avenue to the east.
Funding
No capital funding. Project-based vouchers will be included as a source of subsidy when units
are completed.
Background
LeClaire Courts was built in 1950 by the CHA as a 316-unit series of two story row-houses. A
federally-funded expansion of 300 units was completed in 1954 for a total of 616 public housing
units. In 2011, residents of LeClaire were relocated off-site and the 616 units at LeClaire units
were demolished. The site is currently vacant.

 The LeClaire Courts Working Group is comprised of the CHA, the City of Chicago Department of
Planning and Development, former LeClaire Courts residents, community residents and
stakeholders, and City Park District staff members. The Working Group helps to guide the
planning and implementation of the LeClaire revitalization program. The Working Group makes
recommendations to the CHA about developer selection and revitalization activities. The
Working Group will have on-going communication with the Selected Respondent regarding
revitalization activities with a particular focus on the residential redevelopment efforts. Members
of the LeClaire Working Group were included in the procurement process for the developer(s).

On April 27, 2018, CHA issued a request for proposal (RFP) for development team to redevelop
the LeClaire Courts site.
The LeClaire Courts site was split into three zones for the purpose of the RFP. Respondents
could submit on one, two or all three zones.
A pre-proposal meeting was held on May 17, 2018.
Proposals were due on September 5, 2018.
The RFP was advertised in the Chicago Tribune and Crain’s.
Responses were as follows:
o For Zone 1, the following three respondents submitted proposals: LeClaire Partners,
LLC.; Preservation of Affordable Housing (POAH); LeClaire Crossing LLC
o For Zone 2, the following three respondents submitted proposals: POAH; LeClaire
Partners, LLC; and KBK Enterprises.
o For Zone 3, the following two respondents submitted proposals: LeClaire Partners, LLC
and LeClaire Crossing LLC.
Proposals were evaluated by a team of five scoring members and five technical advisors. The
team consisted of CHA Staff from: Development, Property Office, Treasury. External members
represented BPI, LeClaire & Hearst Community.
All four respondents were invited back for oral presentations: LeClaire Partners, LLC.;
POAH; LeClaire Crossing LLC; and KBK Enterprises.

Development Team Information
Only one firm submitted for all three zones, LeClaire Partners, LLC. In light of LeClaire Partners, LLC’s
strong scores on the two residential sites for Zones 1 and 2 (a total of 1,120.5 points compared to
POAH’s 1,114.5) and the fact that LeClaire Partners, LLC was also the high scorer for the Zone 3 makes
them the best candidate for redevelopment of the entire site.
The team consists of Cabrera Capital, headed by Martin Cabrera, and The Habitat Company, LLC, headed
by Daniel Levin. The companies are headquartered in Chicago.
