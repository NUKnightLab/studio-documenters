report. Dianne Willard, CCHHS Compliance Officer, reviewed the information pertaining to Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) issues. The Committee discussed the information.
With regard to the information presented on Reactive Corporate Compliance Issues, Director Gugenheim

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, May 21, 2015
Chairman Velasquez, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to accept the minutes
of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting of May 21, 2015. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. CCHHS Audited Financial Statements, for the year ended November 30, 2014 (Attachment #2)
Pat Kitchen, of McGladrey LLP, provided an overview of the matter presented. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
Mr. Kitchen stated that there was no management letter presented to the Committee in May as a part of the draft
preliminary documents that were reviewed, nor was a management letter submitted with the finalized Audited
Financial Statements. While there were some recommendations communicated to management, nothing rose to
the level of significance that McGladrey’s representatives believed were warranted to be presented in written
form; there was certainly nothing that would rise to the level of a material weakness in internal control or other
matters that would be required to be presented to this Committee. He noted that there are no material significant
changes from the May draft documents that were reviewed and discussed; in terms of the core Audited Financial
Statements, there were no changes from what the Committee reviewed in May.
It was noted that the CCHHS Audited Financial Statements are posted to the CCHHS website immediately after
the meeting has concluded; they are posted under the Governance section, and are attached electronically to the
Agenda with the other backup materials.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding when the Committee will review the work plan for the coming
year’s audit of the financial statements. Mr. Kitchen responded that this has typically been presented in the fall or
winter for the upcoming year.
The Board took action on this item following the adjournment of the closed meeting.
Director Junge, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to receive and file the
CCHHS Audited Financial Statements for the year ended November 30, 2014. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Cook County Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014
(Attachment #3)
Mr. Donald Croswell, of Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLP, provided an overview of the Cook County
Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014. Additionally, he provided
information on technical updates regarding audit requirements for federal awards. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.

Action Items
C.

Cook County Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014
(continued)

Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the deficiency in internal controls reported for the Department of
Public Health / Stroger Hospital grants totaling $5.9 million erroneously recorded as expenditures in the Schedule
of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA); he asked whether this means that System expenditures were
overstated by that amount. Mr. Croswell responded in the affirmative. He stated that those particular grants are
primarily fee-for-service grants, so at the end of the year, the revenues should equal the expenditures received.
Those grants pay for a portion of the entire salary for those employees involved in providing services under those
grants; when they close out those grants there may have been some revenues transferred in from the Corporate
Fund, so the revenue is not equaling expenses. In the reporting structure, they have to report revenues and
expenditures as being equal, so they make transfers, and a lot of times those transfers are transferred to the next
grant, which causes either an overage or underage of those expenditures. It is a timing issue; he stated that the
auditors think there should be a reconciliation of this prior to the auditors coming in to audit this information. In
the last two years, that reconciliation has not occurred at that point in time.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Junge, moved to receive and file the Cook
County Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended November
30, 2014. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
D. Any items listed under Sections IV and V

Closed Meeting Items

B. Report from Director of Internal Audit
C. Discussion of Personnel Matters
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Junge, moved to recess the open meeting
and convene into a closed meeting, pursuant to the following exceptions to the Illinois
Open Meetings Act: 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(1), regarding “the appointment, employment,
compensation, discipline, performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the
public body or legal counsel for the public body, including hearing testimony on a
complaint lodged against an employee of the public body or against legal counsel for
the public body to determine its validity,” and 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(29), regarding
“meetings between internal or external auditors and governmental audit committees,
finance committees, and their equivalents, when the discussion involves internal
control weaknesses, identification of potential fraud risk areas, known or suspected
frauds, and fraud interviews conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards of the United States of America.”
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
Chairman Velasquez declared that the closed meeting was adjourned. The Committee
reconvened into the open meeting.

The key to avoiding costly fines and penalties is
‒ Show the Department of Health & Human Services Office for Civil Rights
(OCR) what was in place to prevent the breach,
‒ Investigate and mitigate the effects of the breach, and
‒ Review the HIPAA compliance program to prevent recurrence.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Perform the audit in accordance with
GAAS, the standards applicable to
financial audits contained in GAS issued
by the Comptroller General of the United
States and OMB Circular A-133.
Form and express an opinion about
whether the schedule of expenditures of
federal awards is prepared, in all material
respects, in conformity with the
applicable financial accounting
framework, and, about whether Cook
County, IL (the County) complied, in
all material respects, with the types of
compliance requirements that could have
a direct and material effect on each of its
major Federal programs.

This information is intended solely for the use of the Board of Commissioners and management of the County and is not
intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Review of Internal Controls

We considered the County’s internal
control over financial reporting as a basis
for determining audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness on the County’s internal
control over financial reporting. Our review
noted three (3) significant deficiencies in
internal control over compliance.

Independence

We are independent of the County in
accordance with the American Institute of

schedule of expenditures of federal awards of the County.
The auditor's report on compliance for the major federal award programs
for the County expresses an unmodified opinion on the major programs’
compliance with the applicable requirements.
No material weaknesses in internal control over major programs noted.
As it relates to the CCHHS, the major program tested was the Special

There were three (3) significant deficiencies in internal control over
major programs noted:

evidence of supervisory review, nor was there documentary evidence
of written policies and procedures for the supervisory review of
financial reports. (Finding 2014-002)
• During our test of 12 Federally-funded contracts, we noted one (1)
contract did not contain evidence of 1) child support verification; 2)

requirements. (Finding 2014-010)
