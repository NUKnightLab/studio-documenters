Proposed Parking
Garage Addition

 

700-CAR PARKING GARAGE

 

 

Current Conditions
 2,952-car garage on 3 supported levels has limited convenience for customers
◦ 653 on ground level are used for valet
◦ 1,000 of 2,299 spots are within 200 feet of the doors
◦ Farthest spot is 500 feet from the doors
◦ 2 elevators service the entire garage
◦ Pedestrian ramp into casino is steep (38-inch delta/7% slope)
 Existing street access is limited
◦ 1 entrance off Temple St. services levels 1, 2, and 3 (4,000 to 8,000 cars daily)
◦ 1 entrance off Elm St. services level 1 only (2,000 to 4,000 cars daily)
 Access to the main casino valet, and all hotel parking, are off Temple St.
 Casino garage is on spread footings, and has limited ability to add levels
 Staggered arrivals and departures
 No controlled access

 Design Considerations
 There is only 1 location available to build a garage that’s adjacent to the casino
 Create a better customer experience with a new garage
◦ Improve parking proximity to casino (all spaces should be within 150 feet of the doors)
◦ Add dedicated ingress and egress opportunities to minimize impact of peak traffic times
 Improve customer experience in current garage
◦ Increasing customers’ ability to move from top to bottom in the new garage will reduce the impact on the ramps and traffic in the existing
garage
◦ Improve access for the existing garage with additional elevators in the new garage
◦ Cut down on the impact of peak traffic days on Temple St.
 Create a grand entrance into the newest part of the casino (20-foot ceilings, no columns, near Radio Bar, on the north end)
 Limit impact on main casino valet operations
 Staggered arrivals and departures
 No controlled access
 Limited sightlines into elevators and limited view from elevators

CONSTRUCTION

TECHNOLOGY

garage
 60’ wide bays (leaves 20’ wide aisle ways)

 Height sensor to minimize oversized vehicles
damaging lights/cameras

 Walls stained complementary colors

 WiFi added to assist with autonomous vehicles

 Traffic-bearing waterproofing over entire roof level

 Sound system

through

April 4, 2019

 KONE elevators (match existing manufacturer)

4

 Design Outcome
 Construct a new, 700-space garage with 7 supported floors
◦ Located north of the valet building, adjacent to the casino on Brooklyn St.
◦ The main entrance will feed into the north end of the casino
◦ Stair tower in northwest corner
• Better accessibility with existing garage
◦ Include the ability to move from top to bottom with use of parked slope sections
◦ Ingress and egress on Elm St. (or through existing garage)
◦ The pedestrian ramp will have a 5% slope (vs. 7% on existing)
◦ Car count signs mounted on exterior for maximum viewing prior to entering garage
◦ No glass enclosed elevators – surveillance cameras recorded in each elevator
◦ Signage includes one logo sign on North face – limited by sightlines and code

 Design Outcome
 The new garage will exist harmoniously with the existing garage
◦ Customers will be able to move from the old garage to the new garage on each level of existing garage
◦ Adding 2 new elevator cores will improve access for both the new and existing garage
◦ Striping to match existing garage
◦ Exterior color to match existing garage
◦ No impact on existing valet operations
 Wayfinding
◦ New deck (and existing garages and lots) to be named by color (to match our branding/color rainbow)
◦ New parking location signage by garage
◦ Interior signage to match existing blue logo signs
