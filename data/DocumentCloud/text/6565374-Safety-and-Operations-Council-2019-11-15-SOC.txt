PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
Project Planning Review (PPR)/Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC):
2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and presented information on the following projects:
•

CUY IR 77 11.21 Major Rehabilitation (PID 105743) - This project involves replacing
pavement on IR-77 from approximately the CSX Bridge to Broadway Avenue (SR-14).
The total cost of this project is $71.2 million. No NOACA funds will be used for this project.

•

CUY IR 77/Miller Rd Interchange (PID 104983) - This project involves completing the
existing partial diamond interchange at IR-77 and Miller Road by adding exit and entrance
ramps, auxiliary lane, left turn lanes, and right turn lanes. The total cost of this project is
$4.9 million. No NOACA funds will be used for this project.

•

CUY IR 90 6.83 Major Rehabilitation (PID 76779) - This project involves replacing
pavement along I-90 from the Hilliard exit ramp bridge to IR-71 in Rocky River, Lakewood
and Cleveland. The total cost of this project is $103 million. No NOACA funds will be
used for this project.

•

CUY IR 271 10.24 Noise Barriers (PID 108655) - This project involves constructing
approximately 3,200 feet of noise barrier along the east side of IR-271. The total cost of
this project is $1.6 million. No NOACA funds will be used for this project.

8338c

 •

GCRTA FFY 2020 Capital Program & 2016, 2017 and 2019 Revisions - Four projects
need to be added to the FY2020 Capital Program and revisions need to be made to five
existing grants. The total cost of this program is $54.5 million. No NOACA funds will be
used for this program.

Mr. May stated that staff will coordinate with the project sponsors accordingly.
Mr. Cross stated that the sponsor should widen one sidewalk to 10 feet and the remaining
sidewalks to 8 feet. He said the road widening extends east and west of the interchange. He
suggested that the sponsor not acquire the absolute minimum amount of right of way so they are
left with only 5-foot sidewalks. He said he hopes the sponsor will not take out the tree lawns to
the east of the interchange along Miller Road to put in lanes, and leaving a little strip of sidewalk
to meet the definition, without providing useable space for people.
Mr. Wong asked if there are sidewalks elsewhere that would lead to a 5-foot sidewalk.
Mr. Cross said he believed there are sidewalks east of the interchange on both sides of Miller
Road; a sidewalk on the west side; and a sidewalk on the north side that ends at the first
intersection. He said he did not believe there was a sidewalk on the south side. He said he was
looking long term in case something is built in the area in the future.
Mr. Wong asked if the speed limit in the area is 35 mph. Mr. Cross said he believed so and noted
that the speed limit is not unusually high, but the heavily used travel lane will dissuade people
from walking in the area, especially those with kids.
In reference to the CUY IR 90 6.83 Major Rehabilitation project, Mr. Joseph Beno stated that the
Hilliard Road bridge will be taken out and rebuilt. He noted that the bridge removal will happen
within the same timeframe of the IR 90 project. He said there has been some discussion about
alternate routes.
SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety
Ms. Kate Moening presented information on SAVE that includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Annual fatalities and serious injuries, 2007-2017
A comprehensive approach using the “6 E’s” of transportation safety
Fatalities and serious injuries by maintenance responsibility, local vs. state
Strategy #1: Collect and analyze data to identify high crash locations
Strategy #2: Support the implementation of proven and low-income infrastructure safety
countermeasures
Strategy #3: Promote safe behaviors that contribute to the reduction of roadway
departure fatalities and injuries
Short-term goals to work toward an annual reduction of 2% each year to 2023
A heat map showing the relative density of “Impaired Driving” for all crashes across the
region, with a number of targeted corridors with a high frequency of FSIs.

Ms. Moening stated that NOACA staff will develop and support key initiatives in partnership with
other organizations to advance safe projects and encourage safer traveler behavior. She
mentioned that the SAVE Plan can be found on NOACA’s website under the Regional Safety
Program. She asked members to contact her at 216-241-2414, Ext. 285, if they have any
questions.

 2017 Safety Priority Lists
Mr. Blayney presented tables on the following for the period of 2013-2017:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Regional safety priority intersections - four or more fatal or serious injury crashes
Regional safety priority intersections with more than 150 crashes
Regional safety priority corridors - five or more fatal or serious injury (FSI) crashes per
mile
Regional safety priority corridors with more than 150 crashes per mile
Regional safety priority corridors - three or more pedestrian and bicycle FSI crashes per
mile
Safety priority locations for the 5-year period ending in 2016 and 2017 on NOACA’s GIS
portal

Mr. Blayney stated that NOACA safety priority locations were developed by evaluating historical
crash performance at intersections along roadway segments. He noted that the primary safety
priority lists consider the number of fatalities and serious injuries that have occurred at
intersections or along one-mile segments of the region’s non-freeway road network.
Mr. Wong asked if NOACA expects the same statistics 10-15 years from now where people are
known to get killed or injured and no one does anything about it.
Mr. Blayney stated that the distribution of fatalities is somewhat random in nature. However, there
is a methodology that could be used to predict expected future crash performance based on past
history. He said NOACA uses a simplified methodology for establishing safety priorities at the
regional level.
Mr. Wong asked if there is anything incumbent on a city or jurisdiction to address the problem that
was identified by NOACA, so it does not become a spot in the future and does not perpetuate
whatever is wrong with the intersection or high crash area.
Mr. Blayney said the intent of identifying the area is to make people aware of the problem location
and consider whether corrective action should be taken to improve the situation.
Evaluate 2018 Safety Performance Targets
Mr. Blayney stated that NOACA’s five safety performance measures include the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of fatalities
Number of serious injuries
Rate of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
Rate of serious injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of non-motorized fatalities and non-motorized serious injuries

Mr. Blayney stated that the measures are based on five-year rolling averages. He mentioned that
NOACA’s Board of Directors adopted ODOT’s targets of 1% reduction for all performance
measures and it was recommended that NOACA adopt ODOT’s 1% reduction in the 5-year rolling
average for all safety performance measures again this year.
Mr. Blayney reviewed the following:

8338c

1-3

 •
•
•
•
•

NOACA targets for CY 2019 (1% reductions)
NOACA annual crash frequencies
NOACA targets for CY 2018 (1% reductions)
SAVE Plan FSI performance measures and goals
YTD fatalities comparison (2019 vs. 2018)

Mr. Blayney stated that staff will track safety performance measures in support of state targets
and report on performance to keep NOACA’s safety stakeholders informed of the region’s
progress toward state goals.
Corridor Recommendations for Signal Timing Optimization Program (STOP)
Mr. Blayney provided background on STOP and reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Screening criteria
28 corridors were evaluated
Selection criteria (operational)
Potential STOP corridors (operational)
Selection criterial (emissions)
Recommended STOP corridors - Bagley Road and Ridge Road (emissions)

Mr. Blayney stated that staff will reach out to jurisdictions identified through the screening process
to confirm interest and willingness to participate in the program. He noted that a request for
proposals (RFP) will be developed and advertised in late September to middle of October to begin
work on the next corridors in spring 2020.
ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan
Mr. Blayney stated that the project team has moved forward with finalizing the ITS Architecture
Report, ITS Architecture website, and ITS Architecture Strategic Plan. He noted that the NOACA
ITS Architecture Steering Committee and DriveOhio’s Autonomous and Connected Vehicle
project staff will have a joint final coordination meeting at NOACA offices on August 28, 2019, to
discuss gathering regional input for the update and plan.
ODOT/OSHP Safety Calendar
Ms. Moening highlighted the following upcoming safety events and workshops

ODOT LTAP Crowdsourcing to Improve Traffic Operations workshop will be held at
NOACA offices on September 19, 2019

Ms. Moening asked SOC members to follow NOACA on social media and ‘like’ its safety posts.
Mr. Cross asked if there is an early childhood program that teaches children about cell phone use
while driving.
Ms. Moening said she was not aware of any cell phone programs for children. She said it was
important to teach safety to adults, since they are the role model for children.
Mr. Beno stated that children who attend Lakewood City Schools receive safety training at an
early age. He said it would be a good idea to include information on cell phone use, as well.
Old Business
Mr. Cross stated that at the previous SOC meeting, there was a discussion about lane widths on
Miles Avenue. Mr. Cross requested that his comment in the May meeting minutes read as follows:
“The center lane width could be reduced from 12 feet to 10 feet and the through
lanes could be narrowed from 12 feet to 11 feet, or even in some cases to 10 feet
depending on the funding source.”
Mr. Cross said there is more flexibility in the approach than what he stated at the last meeting.
New Business
No new business was discussed at this meeting.
Adjournment
Mr. Cross stated that the next SOC meeting will be held at the NOACA offices on November 15,
2019 at 1:00 p.m. There being no further business, the meeting was adjourned at 2:00 p.m.

TO:

NOACA Safety and Operations Council

FROM:

Kathleen Sarli, Director of Planning

DATE:

November 8, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Review (PPR)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
3rd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
Councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

RE:

Quarterly Report on Regional Crash Trends

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety proposes to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying
actions to reduce the most severe crashes that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE
Plan was developed with the vision that traffic deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning,
policies and programs, with a long-term goal of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50%
by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to
set goals and work toward the vision this Plan establishes for the region.
In support of SAVE Plan goals, staff will provide the Council update on current crash trends to inform the
Council on fatal crash performance in comparison with prior years.
The Ohio State Highway Patrol monitors fatal traffic crashes linked within a bi-weekly email newsletter
published by the Ohio Traffic Safety Office. (The comparison map is updated frequently and can be found at
this link.) The fatality comparison for counties within the NOACA region as of November 6, 2019 is
summarized in the table below:

 Presently the region is tracking towards a higher number of fatalities in comparison for 2018. This trend is
also following the trend being observed at the statewide level, with fatalities tracking about 4% higher in
comparison with the same time last year.
NOACA staff track crash performance within emphasis areas identified in the SAVE Plan. The crash
performance by emphasis area for fatalities from 2013 to 2018 is shown in the table below, with a comparison
between 2017 versus 2018 for each area in the far right.

Generally speaking, 2018 saw significant reductions in fatalities when compared with 2017, with 55 fewer
deaths, a decrease of 33%. As might be expected, a comparable reduction also occurred across most
emphasis areas identified in the SAVE Plan, suggested that broad factors that influenced reductions in 2018
also appeared to have a comparable effect within emphasis areas. It should be noted that two important
areas did not experience as significant of declines: Intersection and Pedestrian.
When the crash performance is viewed over a five-year time period and compared versus target annual
reductions of 2% by 2023, the results do not appear as positive. The annual reductions that occurred in 2018
must be sustained over more consecutive years in order observe reductions in emphasis areas.

On review of recent trends annually and over a 5-year period, it appears that more effort is needed across all
emphasis areas in order to meet the targeted reductions set forth in the SAVE Plan, and that a even greater
amount of resources are needed to reverse trends in emphasis areas for Intersection, Roadway Departure,
5 - 12

 and Pedestrian fatal crashes. These are specific emphasis areas that local agencies should be considering
in the planning, design and maintenance of roads under their jurisdiction. Further, project sponsors are
reminded to investigate opportunities to pursue Safety funding through the Highway Safety Improvement
Program in the planning phase of future project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will track safety performance measures in support of state targets and report on performance to keep
NOACA’s safety stakeholders informed of the region’s progress toward state goals.

RE:

Safety Funding Applications for September 30 Funding Cycle

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Ohio Department of Transportation dedicates about $102 million annually for engineering improvements
at high-crash and severe-crash locations – one of the largest state investments in the nation. This funding is
available to ODOT staff and local governments, and it can be used to make improvements on any public
roadway.
ODOT funds a mix of spot safety projects, such as intersection and curve realignment, and systematic safety
treatments, such as edge line rumble stripes and cable barrier, which can be installed across hundreds of
miles. Funding requests typically range from $200,000 to $5 million, though the department will consider
funding requests up to $10 million. Funding is available for all stages of development and typically requires a
minimum 10% local match. Safety improvements, such as upgrading signs, signals, pavement markings and
guardrail are eligible for 100% funding.
ODOT accepts applications twice a year, with deadlines of April 30 and September 30. Applications must be
reviewed by the local District Office before they are submitted to Central Office. The department encourages
project sponsors to coordinate with the local District Office at least 12 weeks in advance of these deadlines –
though more time will likely be necessary for complex projects (e.g. interchange modification, corridor,
TWLTL), which require additional reviews. Early coordination with the local District Office is essential to
developing a realistic timeline for submitting an application.
Applications are reviewed by multi-disciplinary committees in the District and Central Office. The committees
have expertise in safety analysis, roadway design, traffic engineering and highway maintenance. These
committees evaluate investments based on factors such as crash analysis; statewide, regional or local priority;
matching funds; and cost/benefit analysis. The committee reviews about 70 applications per year requesting
more than $150 million.
5 - 17

 Project sponsors are encouraged to examine a full range of options starting with low-cost strategies, such as
new signs, pavement markings and guardrail to mid-cost strategies such as new traffic signals, turn lanes
and road realignments. Higher-cost projects, such as corridor improvements to arterial roads and interchange
reconfigurations, may be considered up to $10 million. Funding can be paired with other sources.
ODOT District 12 communicated to NOACA that two sponsors have applied for Safety funds in the September
30 funding cycle. (ODOT D3 stated they processed no applications in this round.) These projects are briefly
identified as follows, presented in order of total project cost:

RE:

STOP Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Today, there are more than 272,000 traffic signals in the United States. They play an important role in the
transportation network and are a source of significant frustration for the public when not operated efficiently.
As the era of freeway building draws to a close, urban arterials are being called upon to carry more users
than ever before at a time when the users of these facilities are growing more complex (older drivers, more
distractions, larger vehicles, etc.) and the demand for such use continues to outpace transportation supply.
Traffic signal timing efficiency degrades over time as volume patterns and magnitude change, development
occurs, or infrastructure changes. Outdated or poor traffic signal timing accounts for a significant portion of
traffic delay on urban arterials, and traffic signal optimization is one of the most cost effective ways to reduce
emissions, improve mobility, reduce delays and improve corridor safety.
NOACA’s approach to address the issues related to inefficient traffic signal timing was to develop a Signal
Timing Optimization Program (STOP), and in June 2016, the Board of Directors adopted resolution 2016-015,
which approved a consultant firm to develop a pilot STOP project for two corridors.
Subsequent STOP projects in fiscal years 2017, 2018 have been successfully implemented, and the 2019
project is nearing completion. The STOP for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 proposes to continue retiming
regionally-significant corridors to provide significant benefits.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on September 9, 2019 with proposals due on October 8,
2019; six proposals were received. Vendors were scored on three criteria: project approach, experience and
qualifications. After evaluating the proposals, the NOACA review team determined that the firm with the
highest scores was Albeck Gerken, Inc.
The FY2020-FY2021 STOP project consists of Part I and Part II with Part II being “if authorized”.
5 - 19

 Part I consists of two corridors:
1. Bagley Road (from Lindbergh Rd. to Pearl Rd. 3.56 miles, 25 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Berea and Middleburgh Heights.
2. Ridge Road (from Pearl Rd. to Denison Ave., 3.47 miles, 20 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Parma, Brooklyn, and Cleveland.
Part II, if authorized, will consist of a two corridors/grid of similar length and number of intersections, with the
scope to be developed by NOACA, to begin after Part I has been finalized.
This year’s STOP project includes the retiming of the Chester Avenue corridor between East 13th Street to
Euclid Avenue, including Euclid Avenue between Chester and East 123rd Street. In addition, a large number
of signals around University Circle and signals in close proximity to Chester Avenue will also be improved. In
total, more than 66 signals will be updated with this project.
Proposed coordination patterns have been recently implemented, and the consultant is in the process of
making final adjustments, collecting “after” condition travel times, and preparing the final report. Results will
be shared with the Council once the report is reviewed and accepted by NOACA.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the STOP program is provided from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ)
program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Work on corridors identified for Part I of the next STOP contract will begin in spring. The Council will be
updated as the project progresses.

RE:

Safe Routes To School Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Plan, designed to achieve NOACA SAVE Plan goals, was introduced to
the Safety and Operations Council during the November 16, 2018 meeting. This program elevates NOACA
programs and initiatives that support goals in safety, active transportation and air quality, supports
partnerships with state and regional organizations also working to improve transportation safety, and strives
to attract state and federal funding to our region to improve safety and multimodal access.
A school travel plan (STP) is a local planning document outlining infrastructure and non infrastructure actions
to improve safety for students traveling to and from school through active transportation, such as walking or
biking. An STP is a valuable resource to guide local community investment, pursue state, regional and
national funding, identify actions through public input and stakeholder engagement, and develop community
partnerships to achieve goals.
NOACA is in the process of assisting four school districts with the task of creating or updating their School
Travel Plans in 2019. Once finalized and accepted by ODOT, these STP’s will enable local agencies to apply
for funding administered through ODOT to implement recommendations benefitting schools in grades K-8.
Applications for the next round of Ohio Safe Routes to School Infrastructure and Non-Infrastructure funding
opens early next January of 2020 and closes in early March. Next year will be the last year of funding eligibility
for school districts whose plans were completed in 2015, unless these school districts take steps to update
their School Travel Plans. These school districts are Rocky River, Euclid, and Willoughby-Eastlake. Attached
is a map indicating school districts that have plans approved in 2014 or older, which will need to be updated
to meet funding application requirements.
A major change occurring with this round of ODOT Safe Routes To School funding is that communities who
are seeking consultant assistance from ODOT for STP development must submit an application during the
round.
5 - 21

 Local government agencies (cities, villages and counties) are encouraged to partner with their local school
districts to develop and update School Travel Plans and submit applications for Ohio Safe Routes to School
Infrastructure and Non-Infrastructure funding. Local agencies may ask NOACA staff to assist with School
Travel Plan development and SRTS grant applications. NOACA staff will provide assistance based on safety,
education and equity. All applicants are encouraged to requests letters of support from NOACA at least 3
weeks prior to the application deadline.
Potential applicants should plan to participate in an upcoming informational webinar being hosted by ODOT’s
Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP), which is scheduled for Thursday, December 12 from 2:00 to
3:00 pm. To register, visit this link on Ohio LTAP’s web page.
The NOACA Safe Routes to School Assistance program also supports air quality goals through the promotion
and implementation of Schoolpool, a program within the Gohio Commute platform. Schoolpool is a free,
secure service that connects families who want to share the school commute. NOACA has implemented
Schoolpool pilot programs in two schools in Lorain County, with the expansion of the program to more schools
expected in 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The Council will continue to be updated.

ITS Architecture Comprehensive Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
In fiscal year 2018, NOACA entered into an 18-month contract with AECOM to perform a comprehensive
update of the regional Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) architecture and its strategic plan. NOACA
last updated the regional ITS architecture in 2010. The purpose of the ITS architecture is to support
interoperability among ITS systems and jurisdictions, and to ensure that ITS elements of projects proposed
in the region are eligible for federal funding. In conjunction with the update of the regional architecture,
NOACA is also updating the region’s ITS strategic plan. The strategic plan identifies needs for ITS-related
infrastructure improvements and establishes the time frames for their implementation.
A final project coordination meeting was held on August 28 at 10 am at NOACA to present the final results of
the project to the NOACA ITS Steering Committee. At this meeting, DriveOhio also presented information on
ODOT’s planning for connected and autonomous vehicles, as part of ODOT’s effort to develop a statewide
ITS architecture for reference and use throughout the state as technology continues to mature and potential
applications for connected and autonomous vehicles near deployment.
The final versions of the ITS planning documents and resources are available via the internet using the
following hyperlinks:
1. 2019 NOACA ITS Architecture Report: This document supports the integration of regional ITS
systems to allow planning and deployment to occur in an organized and coordinated process.
2. NOACA ITS Architecture Website: This website provides information for intelligent transportation
project systems engineering following USDOT’s Architecture Reference for Cooperative and
Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) framework.
3. User’s Guide for ITS Architecture Website: This brief two-page document serves as a layperson’s
guide to using the architecture website for ITS planning and reference.
5 - 23

 4. Northeast Ohio ITS Strategic Plan: This document establishes the region’s vision for ITS
implementation, identifies regional ITS gaps and needs, and presents feasible ITS projects to
consider for short, medium, and long-term implementation.
5. Drive Ohio CV/AV Fact Sheet: This document was provided to NOACA by DriveOhio to share with
regional ITS stakeholders. It provides a brief summary identified needs for CV/AV technology based
on input from major metropolitan areas around the state and describes what will be in the “Ohio
CV/AV Guidebook”, which is nearing completion. When completed, it will be available on
DriveOhio’s website.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan is provided in the 2019 and 2020 Overall Work
Programs.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 23 requests for funding: 7 planning study requests totaling about $1.1
million in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. All requests
are being evaluated based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the
planning studies and implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.

RE:

ODOT/OSHP Safety Calendar

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Ohio Traffic Safety Office (OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety
campaign messaging to raise public awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging
pushed out via social media and press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message
boards, and often coupled with increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on
their website at this link.
NOACA encourages local public safety partners to be aware of broad safety campaign messaging and to use
campaign materials provided by Traffic Safety Marketing and ODOT to educate and encourage road users in
their jurisdictions to obey traffic laws and practice safer behaviors.
Upcoming events prior to next Safety and Operations Council meetings are as follows:
• November 28 (Thanksgiving): Occupant Protection
• November 30 (OSU-Michigan football game): Impaired Driving
• November 29-December 10 (Pre-Holiday Season): Impaired Driving
• December 11-January 1 (Holiday Season): Impaired Driving
• February 2-3 (Super Bowl Sunday): Impaired Driving
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcoholimpaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)
5 - 31

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing
impact of statewide message campaigns by cross-promoting these messages at the community level.
