importantly, he has been an active member in the community, very generous to all charitable
causes and held at high esteem so, it was no surprise to me that he was elected to be the new
Wayne County Commissioner for the thirteenth district representing Dearborn and Allen Park.

 This is my first opportunity at a full board meeting to introduce him since the election so, if you
join me in welcoming Wayne County Commissioner elect Sam Baydoun.”
