Project Introduction
Palace Sports and Entertainment, LLC (“PSE”) and Henry Ford Health System (“HFHS”) are the
project developers (the “Developers”) for the Plan which entails the construction of a corporate
headquarters and practice facility for the Detroit Pistons National Basketball Association team.
The facility is expected to include approximately 128,000 square feet of office space, locker and
training rooms and a practice facility, all within a single facility (the “Pistons Facility”). The Pistons

 Facility is expected to include ground-floor retail or commercial space for uses that may include
a team store, restaurant and/or bank.
The Plan also includes an approximately 25,000 square foot sports medicine and medical office
building to be constructed, owned and operated by HFHS. The Pistons Facility and the HFHS
Facility will be joined by an approximately 400 space above-grade parking structure. It is
estimated that 120 temporary construction jobs will be created at the overall property and 150
permanent jobs will be created in connection with the Pistons Facility.
Total investment is expected to exceed $83,000,000.00. The Developers are requesting
$19,348,568.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.

Herman Kiefer Development, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the rehabilitation of the vacant former Herman Kiefer Health Department complex, two
vacant former Detroit Public Schools and 510 residential parcels, 503 of which will be acquired
from the Detroit Land Bank Authority and City of Detroit. In total the project includes 84.95 acres
of land and well over 500,000 square feet of existing buildings. The project proposes the reuse
of the Herman Kiefer complex buildings and the former Crosman and Hutchins schools into
commercial uses. Residential homes will be rehabilitated to the extent possible and leased or
sold. Vacant land will be put into productive reuse.
Approximately 810 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 257 temporary construction jobs are
expected to be created as a result of the project. The total investment is estimated to be
approximately $143 million. The Developer is requesting $47,767,473.00 in TIF reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of five-hundred fifteen (515) parcels largely located
west of the John C. Lodge Freeway and south of Clairmount Street. Please see Attachment A
and B of the Plan for a list and map of parcels.

The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the

Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to
be a facility, blighted and/or adjacent to or contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to

Kiefer Health Complex parcels at 1151 Taylor, 1110 Clairmount and 8700 Byron, the Hutchins
School at 1501 Hazelwood and the Crosman School at 9027 John C Lodge have all been declared
facilities pursuant to Part 201 by the MDEQ. The 510 surrounding residential parcels (see
Attachment B in the Plan) have initially been determined blighted per Act 381 via an initial
determination of blight letter from Detroit City Planning Commission staff. Documents supporting
these determinations can be found in Attachments B, G and H of the Plan.

Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out in four (4) phases at the Property are
considered “eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline

 environmental site assessment activities, due care activities, additional response activities,
environmental insurance, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, site preparation,
infrastructure improvements, preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan, a 15% contingency
as well as 5% simple interest after expiration of tax abatements. The eligible activities and
