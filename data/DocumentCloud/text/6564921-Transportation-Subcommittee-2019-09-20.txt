transportation system in the United States to move goods and people in an energy
efficient manner, provide the foundation for improved productivity growth,
strengthen the nation's ability to compete in the global economy and obtain the
optimum yield from the nation's transportation resources.“
Intermodal connectors – those public highways which link the Nation's ports, rail
and truck terminals, airports and passenger transit terminals to the NHS.

Recommendations that result from the evaluation process will proceed through
the committee process ending with the NOACA Board of Directors providing the
final approval of all recommendations

•

After Board concurrence, the information will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA
for further review and action

I-90 WB Intermodal Connector 56T (Tower City)
• Left turn from I-77 WB exit ramp to E 30th is prohibited

5-27

Recommendation: Remove E 30th , Broadway Ave.,
and E14th St. from the Intermodal Connector
Add Prospect Ave., from the I-90 WB exit ramp to
Tower City to the Intermodal Connector

 BACKGROUND
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to
Orange Ave., from a Principal Arterial to a Major Collector.
Step 1:
A principal arterial should have an AADT of 10,000
to 30,000, E 14th only has an AADT of 6,932 and
this small section of 500' of principal arterial
changes to a major connector at US 422.
Step2: Urban major collectors are over underrepresented in Cuyahoga County.
Step 3: E 14th is already on the federal aid system
as a principal arterial.
Recommendation: Revise 500 ft of E14th from a
principal arterial to a major collector

5-27

 BACKGROUND
Add 210 feet of SR 87 – Shaker Boulevard in both directions to
Connector OH 82T from the RTA station at approximately E 130th
Street to the east leg of the Shaker Square Loop which will also
join with Connector OH 84T.
• The Shaker Square GCRTA station is
currently not connected to the Intermodal
Connector
• No functional classification revision is
needed
• This length of Shaker Blvd would be added
to the NHS
• Recommendation: Add approximately 210
ft. to the Intermodal Connector

recommendations to ODOT and FHWA for further review and
approval
