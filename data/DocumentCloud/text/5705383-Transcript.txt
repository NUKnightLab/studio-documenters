CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?
(Chorus of eyes.)
Opposed?
(No response.)

The minutes are approved.

Our second order of business is the
status of our approved and potential transactions
in the CDF pipeline.

TREASURER NEELY: Actually I have a comment
to make.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: GO ahead.

TREASURER NEELY: If we're using titles, my
title should be Treasurer.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Correct, Treasurer
Stephanie Neely. Thank you, Treasurer.

Tony, are you going to run us

through?

MR. SMITH: Yes.

CHAERPERSON RAGUSO: Okay.

MR. SMITH: Okay. So first, a discussion of
the projects that have already been approved by
this body. The first project back in May of 2008,

the Homan Powerhouse High School, the transaction

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

closed in July 2008, and it's currently under
construction.

At this point, Chicago Development
Fund has or, CDF Suballocatee I, which is the
Chicago Development Fund subsidiary that worked on
this transaction, has disbursed all of its loan

proceeds to a construction disbursement account.

Construction is underway. It's
actually nearing completion. The charter school
facility is scheduled to be able to be moved

into August 7th, 2009 which is on target for the
school year upcoming. And they're still on target
to attain green building certification.
And it's a 450 student charter high school in the
North Lawndale neighborhood.

Muntu Performing Arts Center is a
transaction for which 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: So as we did this
morning, do we want to take it project by project
and let the members ask questions, or do we want to
do it on a collective?

MR. SMITH: Sure, we can do questions project
by project. There's no action on Roman, but if

there's questions, I can certainly take them.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Okay. So in regards to
Gary Comer Charter High School, do any of the
members have any questions about the project?

(No response.)

Okay.

MR. SMITH: Muntu Performing Arts Center was
approved by this body in October of 2008 to allow
for a $15 million New Markets Tax Credit allocation
to the project. Just as a refresher, it's a 43,000
square foot facility for dance rehearsal/performance
studio, so for instruction as well.

CDF began the process of attempting
to close that deal in 2008. There's a key issue
right now that's holding up the potential for
closing, and that is the pull out of the one of the
banks that was going to be a lender to the project,
Seaway. So there's approximately a $4.5 million
hole in the budget at this point.

Muntu has advised us that they're
continuing to seek alternate funding sources to
fill the gap. They're also looking at phasing the
project so they can reduce the upfront costs and
get to a feasible transaction and then finish off

the facility later. So we're getting periodic

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

updates, but at this point, there's no closing date
scheduled.

TREASURER NEELY: And there's no activity on
the property.

MR. SMITH: Not as far as we know.

TREASURER NEELY: No, I know there's not.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: What's the total cost of
the entire project?

MR. SMITH: Total cost is 24 million.

TREASURER NEELY: I'm still just very
concerned about this project. It has been a hole in
the ground for the last five years and starting
construction, stopping construction.

I think the last meeting we had I

indicated they had taken down the scaffolding.
This is just it seems like it's going nowhere.

MR. SMITH: Well, technically CDF has an
agreed upon term sheet with Muntu that has an
expiration date of October 2008. So in other words,
the allocation that was set aside for the project
is no longer officially set aside for it.

As far as the deal with Muntu,

however, this Board still has allocation approved,

so the Board can certainly reconsider the allocation

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

Muntu based on the project status.

TREASURER NEELY: Are we not allocating to
other projects waiting for what's going on with
this?

MR. SMITH: We haven't hit that point yet,
but in my personal judgment 

MR. NAREFSKY: We will.

MR. SMITH: we're getting close to that
point.

MR. NAREFSKY: We will.

TREASURER NEELY: And I think that's something
that we're going to have to consider because this
shouldn't take that long.

MR. SMITH: Right. Imperial Zinc is an
October 2008 approval. It's a transaction to
rebuild and expand, add production lines to a zinc
processing facility that manufactures zinc anodes
and alloys. It's on East 103rd Street.

They had a facility destroyed by a
fire back in March of 2008 and were considering
either relocating to a suburban location or
rebuilding in place with an expanded investment and
more potential for high-quality jobs.

And based on a New Markets Tax Credit

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781m9586

 

assistance amount of $6 million of allocation, which
translates to about 1.4 million of net benefit to
the project, Imperial is rebuilding the facility
here in Chicago. We're actually closing tomorrow
on this transaction. So everything's ready to go.
Building permit's secured. Funds are ready to be
released.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: What ward is this?

MR. SMITH: This is Alderman Beale's ward.

Tempel Steel, another October
approval. This one is a casualty of the current
economic climate. The Governing Board approved
a $10 million allocation for Tempel.

Since that time, particularly in the
fourth quarter of 2008, their sales dropped off
drastically, and so their leadership has decided to
drastically scale back the proposed improvement in
the Chicago location.

So at this time, there's not a viable
New Markets transaction to be funded. So at this
point, we would consider the allocation that the
Board approved for Tempel to be back in the general
pot. Tempel's essentially indicated they don't want

to continue structuring a deal.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

Testa Produce, this was also an
October 2008 approval. This is a food distribution
facility, some limited processing activity as well,
located in the Stockyards Industrial area.

The project is currently undergoing
a change in scope. They were going to be a two?
tenant facility with another firm called JAB
Produce. The building was going to attain 
Platinum certification, have a wind turbine and
various other innovative green features attached to
it.

They're keeping the green features,
but their tenant has pulled out due to timing
issues.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: IS that 

MR. SMITH: Yeah. So Testa still intends to
build and occupy the facility as a single tenant
structure in the Stockyards neighborhood. We're
continuing to work with US Bank, which is the lender
to the transaction as well as the equity side of
US Bank who is the equity investor to the deal, to
complete the underwriting and figure out if the
deal can be restructured in a feasible way.

We think the prospects look pretty

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

good. We're looking at July 2009 as a potential
closing date. They have requested at least that
CDF consider additional allocation to close the
financing gap, and we'll get back to a proposed
action on that later in this meeting.

And then an overall discussion of
the fourth round New Markets allocation. Here's
some overall statistics. Currently we have 23
projects in various stages of development and
interaction with CDF.

TREASURER NEELY: FYI.

MR. SMITH: Printing issue. White text on
white paper does not show up. I'll take that into
account 

TREASURER NEELY: When I first saw it, I was
like there isn't any status.

MR. SMITH: We didn't mean to imply that. So
the one closed project is Homan. They're at the
bottom. That number will become two as of tomorrow.
Then we have a couple that are in the closing
process, some of which we're going to discuss today
for approval.

We have several that are in that

have applications in, and we're evaluating

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

feasibility or waiting for credit issues or other
feasibility issues to be addressed satisfactorily.
And then we've had several exciting
discussions with various projects recently,
including some grocery?anchored retailers, that are

working to put together projects, or they're dealing

with site control. They're dealing with other City
assistance such as TIF. Dealing with pre-leasing or
letters of intent from retailers. So the pipeline

remains pretty robust.

Here's the breakdown between the
various areas of emphasis that CDF has for its
program between industrial, grocery~anchored and
community facility. As I mentioned, grocery?anchored
retail, we've had more activity, at least at the
discussion level recently, so we're excited about
that. And then community facility does remain the
area where most interest has been expressed as far
as CDF participation.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: The grocery-anchored
retailers, what locations are there?

MR. SMITH: At this point, the ones we've had
recent discussions with are the South Side, two in

Englewood and one in Bronzeville.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Okay. And the community

rfacilities?

MR. SMITH: Community facilities pretty much 
and it's generally South Side, West Side. Homan is
in Lawndale. The Comer transaction, which we're
going to talk about today, is Greater Grand Crossing.
Christ the King, which is again a project today, is
in Austin.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Well, through the Chair can
I get a breakdown of those, of all the communities
and the ones that are grocers?

MR. SMITH: Sure. We can put a map together.

So summary statistics on the CDF
pipeline. So at this point, when we look at
allocation that's been approved by this Board minus
the Tempel Steel credits, that totals 52 million,

leaving 48 million that's unapproved by the Board

yet.

However, today we have 51.7 million
in proposed approvals in front of this body. So
that exceeds $100 million. CDF can?t finalize more

than $100 million of allocation to its projects in

the aggregate.

So what we're asking for is some

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

discretion to be given to the Board Chair and her
authorized rep, Bill Eager, to adjust the final
allocation amounts for a couple transactions to
match the total 100 million that CDF has and also
to close any financing gaps in the deals. And
we'll talk about that deal by deal as we go through
the consideration for the transactions today.

The credit environment remains
challenging for the transactions that have senior
debt in them, particularly the lenders are very
minute to minute as far as whether they can do
projects or how much debt they can provide. So now
more than ever we're staying very close to the
transactions and making sure that the lenders are
on board because the last thing we want is to
commit credits to a deal and then find out it's not
feasible.

And then, as I mentioned, a couple
promising meetings and discussions recently with
grocery?anchored and industrial projects.

And then CDF launched a website very
recently, Chicagodevelopmentfund.org. It provides
a lot of the same information that was already on

the City website in the New Markets Tax Credit

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

area, but gives a bit more detail about the Roman
project, which is CDF's closed project at this
point. And then you can download the intake
application and get more information about how the
credit works.

And we're planning a rollout of that
website officially with e?mail blasts and other
communication to the industrial retention groups,
elected officials, retail or, Shop Chicago and
all their affiliates. But I'm curious to hear if
this body has any other further suggestions as to
e?mail lists or other groups we ought to contact
about the website.

TREASURER NEELY: I can put a link on my
website.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: That will be great.

MR. SMITH: Great.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Thank you.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And I know that you're
talking about the LIRI groups, but I think you
should probably think about just our delegate
agencies.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Yes.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: The City of Chicago

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

delegate agencies.
MR. SMITH: Thank you.

Okay. And then we have a few
proposed transactions for this body to consider
today, and those were all included in the four
packets that went out last week.

The first is the Gary Comer College
Prep Charter High School. This is this is a
project in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood,
72nd and South Chicago. The applicant is the Comer
Science and Education Foundation who's invested
very heavily in a targeted investment area, including
the Comer Youth Center, which provides after?school
programming and is the home of the South Shore Drill
Team. They have also built, I believe, upwards of
90 scattered site housing units and then various
other investments in the neighborhood.

The project is a 45,000 square foot
charter high school to be operated by the Noble
Network of Charter Schools. It's going to be
adjacent to the Gary Comer Youth Center, and it's
going to be very synergistic with the center.
Dining facilities and athletic facilities in the

youth center will also serve the high school. So

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

it's an efficient use of the community facility
dollars.

The target student population is 530
once all four classes are filled. It?s planning to
be a LEED certified facility that would look to
employ about 36 new faculty and administrative FTE
positions.

So the total project cost is upwards
of 25 $21.5 million. The original request for
allocation that CDF had been working with was 18.5
million. That amount was recommended by the
Advisory Board back in April and would have been
brought to this Board if we had actually met in
April.

But since that time, Gary Comer has
come back through their negotiations over
construction contracts with a $3 million increase
in project costs, partially due to pricing on the
construction, partially due to a 5,000 square foot
expansion of the project. So the current allocation
request and the one that we have proposed for this
body to consider today is $21.5 million in credits.

The New Markets Tax Credit investor

is Northern Trust, and as you know, this would be

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 78l~9586

 

their first New Markets Tax Credit investment,

which is brownie points for GDP in that we 
bringing new banks into the program is something

that the U.S. Treasury is excited about, so it looks
good from CDF's perspective. And Northern Trust's
pricing on the tax credit equity is very competitive.

And then other financing sources, a
loan from Northern Trust on the debt side in addition
to the tax credit equity of about $8 million, and
then the Gary Comer Foundation is providing land
and then also putting in essentially grant money for
the project.

They have to loan it into this
structure because of New Markets Tax Credit
structuring reasons, but it's going to be left 
the benefit is going to be left in the project.

The City has also provided written down land to the
project.

TREASURER NEELY: Why have the Original
allocation requests increased?

MR. SMITH: It's a $3 million increase in
construction costs relative to what they were
originally budgeting for.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And they?ve expanded their

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

operations what, to?-

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: 5,000.

MR. SMITH: A 5,000 square foot expansion as
well.

TREASURER NEELY: So the total project cost
matches their allocation request?

MR. SMITH: There?s actually a couple more
million in project costs tied up in the land, so
we're excluding that. So this is a construction
number, the 21.5.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: And has the alderman been
working along with Gary Comer Center because I know
they're doing quite a bit of new construction over
there, and the local aldermen have been working
with them?

MR. SMITH: Correct. And we have a letter of
support from Alderman Hairston.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Okay.

MR. SMITH: So the current funding strategy
is $13 and a half million to be funded into GDP in
June of 2009 and then the balance between September
and December of 2009. And that structure is
specifically put in place to put in the lower cost

funds first and minimize the construction period

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781*9586

 

interest for the deal.

Chicago Development Fund has a
closing target of June 17th, 2009 that is in
other words, CDF needs to close 50 million in
allocation in the aggregate by June 17th in order
to remain in contention for a 2009 tax credit
allocation. So GDP has been very consistent in
communicating with Comer and the other project
sponsors about that need and trying to drive the
timing of the deals.

So the way the resolution is proposed
is that the additional 3 million in allocation that
they've requested recently is contingent on the
successful closing of the deal by that June 17th,
2009 deadline, just to keep everybody focused.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Any questions for Tony?
(No response.)
Then do I have a motion to consider?
ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Move to pass.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Do I have a second?
TREASURER NEELY: Second.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?
(Chorus of ayes.)

The motion passes.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

Our fourth order of business is a
resolution approving Christ the King College Prep
High School.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Where is this located?
MR. SMITH: This is --
ALDERMAN AUSTIN: 5058 West Jackson.

MR. SMITH: This is another high school

project. GDP has quite a high school niche going
at this point. This is a project sponsored by the
Jesuits. It?s a 100,000 square foot high school

serving 600 students in the Austin community area
at 5058 West Jackson.

It's proposing to use the Cristo Rey
model which is already in use in a school in Pilsen.
Essentially what this does is it allows the students
to get internship placement at firms, and the
earnings from those internship placements are
provided then to the school to write down the cost
of tuition.

So it's extremely reduced cost
tuition for the students. I believe it's I
believe it's $1200 per year is the average tuition
bill for the students. They've obtained a green

building permit, so they're going through a green

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 78l~9586

 



process. The project would create 50 faculty and
administrative positions.

The total project cost is
approximately 33.8 million of which CDF would be
assisting with 17 million in tax credit allocation.
They're coming in alongside LISC, Local Initiatives
Support Corporation, who is proposing to put in 14
million of allocation.

JPMorgan Chase would be the tax
credit investor for both the LISC and the Chicago
Development Fund entities. And then the other
financing source is a substantial contribution of
debt from Park National Bank, approximating $20
million for the deal.

I would characterize this personally
as a semi?philanthropic loan. It's been provided
originally at 0 percent interest. It will be for
this closing provided at something like 1 percent
interest with a long repayment schedule based on
the capital campaign progress of the school.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Does anyone have any
questions on this transaction?
ALDERMAN AUSTIN: What ward is this located?

TREASURER NEELY: 28th.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

?was
4ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Where?

TREASURER NEELY: 28th.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: NO, this is Christ the
King, and I 

TREASURER NEELY: It's not 28th?

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: No. It?s got to be either
29 or 37.

TREASURER NEELY: So Alderman Smith is just
writing a letter?

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Is it Alderman Smith?

MR. SMITH: Right, Ben Smith.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Then you are right.

TREASURER NEELY: It says 28th.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: You're right. It is
right on the border. Sorry, sorry. Yes, the
Treasurer is correct. Thanks for reading.

TREASURER NEELY: No problem. I thought
maybe I was wrong, and he's just 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: NO, no.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: Can I ask, this is a
parochial school?

MR. SMITH: It is, yes.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: Then they're eligible to

participate in this program?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

MR. NAREFSKY: They are. We looked at that
issue quite carefully, and I think, when you look
at the combination of the organization of Christ
the King, it's a 501(c)3 organization. This is not
a Norse diocesan school.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: I was going to say wait
until the archdiocese finds out about it.

MR. NAREFSKY: No, it's more like Providence
St. Mel or the Sacred Heart schools, which are 
you know, they?re organized as 501(c)33. They're
providing both value, the education, but they're
also providing education, in this case, with the
Cristo Rey mission.

And also, the funding coming through
the New Markets program will not be devoted to any
of the sectarian elements in the school building,
chapel, for example. When we thought about it, we
sort of analogized this to tax?exempt bond financing
for schools like Providence St. Mel or Sacred Heart
or other, you know, day schools, not just parochial
schools.

There are a number of independent
schools with some religious mission as part of

their religious values as part of their mission

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781~9586

 

that have received tax?exempt bond financing
benefits either from the City or more regularly
from the State finance agency. And so we sort of
thought that same analogy would work well for the
New Markets program.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And certainly, I don't
have any issue with it; however, I just wanted to
be clear that we're on solid ground here as far
as our 

MR. NAREFSKY: Right, right. No, I appreciate
you raising the question. We really, you know,
thought about that in advance.

MR. SMITH: Two other issues to note with
respect to that. We've confirmed with the school
management they the enrollment is open regardless
of religious affiliation as is the hiring of the
school; and then second, that Sonnenschein, who is
the Chase investor counsel for the deal, is going
to do an establishment clause opinion essentially
saying this is a valid use of New Markets Tax
Credits. And Chicago Development Fund is going to
be an addressee of that opinion, so essentially we
can rely on that, too.

MR. NAREFSKY: Yes, so I think we covered our

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
{312) 781-9586

 

bases.
ALDERMAN LAURINO: Covered our bases.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Any other questions?
(No response.)

And do I have motion to consider the
resolution?

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Move to pass.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: Second.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?

(Chorus of ayes.)

The motion passes.

Our fifth order of business is a
resolution approving the Greater West Town project,
and Madam Chairman, this will sound familiar to you.
This is the project we were at this morning. It's
an exciting project.

So Tony, do you want to walk us
through the details?

MR. SMITH: Sure. This project is called the
Community Career Training Economic Development
Center aka Greater West Town sponsored by the
Greater West Town Community Development Project.

It?s a fairly large facility. It's

an existing building located on North Sacramento.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

think it was a former fan factory or something
like that. And they're proposing to purchase the
building and then do a LEED certified building
rehab to provide a job training and education
facility and business incubator. This is in the
West Town community area, the 27th ward.

So this would provide a substantial
increases to Greater West Town, visibility to serve
a couple different populations. Currently they
have a high school, which provides full?scale high
school education as well as vocational training
for solely for students that have dropped out of
high school previously. And they manage to graduate
70 percent of these students, which we find quite
impressive.

They also provide adult vocational
training to a number of low?income individuals,
particularly with an emphasis on shipping, receiving
and logistics training and then also in high~end
woodworking.

And then the final use here would be
an incubator for wood-oriented businesses, both
opportunities for trainees from the facility to

start their own businesses, but also for other

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

businesses that are looking to locate in Chicago
near the trained labor force to actually to start
out and incubate in this facility.

So it?s kind of a nice blend between
CDF's economic development mission, job creation,
job retention and training in the City of Chicago,
along with the community facility mission where
we're expanding the services available to Chicago's
low-income communities.

30 temporary jobs are predicted
during construction, and then 35 permanent jobs are
projected for Greater West Town employees in the
facility. And then there's, of course, the economic
development benefits to the trainees which is
probably the principal benefit of the project. And
as I mentioned, it's proposed to attain LEED
certification at completion.

It's a $10.2 million project. Here's
an instance where we're proposing a little bit of
flexibility in the allocation that's being approved.
We're asking for up to 10.2 million in allocation
to be allowed for the project by this Board.

The likely allocation given the

current structure that we?re looking at for the

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781v9586

 

deal is 9.2 million, and then a million dollars
would just be directly funded to the project for
various tax structuring reasons.

The New Markets investor again would
be JPMorgan Chase, and then the other sources of
funds are cash that Greater West Town has saved up
for quite some time for this type of project,
$3.1 million in TIF assistance from the City of
Chicago which has gone through CDC. And they're
currently in the redevelopment agreement and
drafting stages.

It will probably come before Council
in June. And then a credit facility from Harris
Bank who is making both a TIP-related loan and an
organization?related loan to Greater West Town.

And then that money is going to flow through the
structure.

TREASURER NEELY: When will we know if it's
going to be the whole 10.2 versus the 9.2?

MR. SMITH: Probably within the month.

TREASURER NEELY: Okay.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Well, I can assure you that
the local alderman is 100 percent supportive of

this. We've had a press conference this morning at

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

this very facility, which I believe was an
outstanding effort on the mayor's part as to have
it there. And we, the alderman that attended the
press conference, are now also a participant in this
particular company because we will be purchasing
some of their goods.
And I move to pass.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Do I have a second?
MR. SAFFOLD: Second.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?
(Chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?
(No response.)
The motion passes. Thank you.
Our next order of business is the
resolution approving the Testa Produce project.
Tony?
MR. SMITH: Well, as I mentioned briefly
earlier, this project originally came before
this body in October 2008, and then there's a
restructuring of the facility due to the loss of
JAB Produce as the second tenant. So they're going
down to an 89,000 square foot footprint.

And US Bank continues to underwrite

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

the debt for the transaction based on both an
appraisal that recently came in for the facility as
well as for based on cash flow of the Testa
company.

Just as an indication of how tough
things are out there right now for people that are
trying to access debt for projects, it's a $20.5
million project with an appraisal that came in at
11.8 million. So the lenders are not looking at
costs to determine how much they can lend, but
looking at appraised value, and that is definitely
limiting what US Bank can do.

So CDF is looking for some flexibility
as we finalize the structuring in underwriting the
transaction to either expand CDF's contribution of
credits from 15 million to as high as 18 million
and/or to bring in a second allocates. We're
hoping to bring in US Bank for a couple million in
credits instead of having to use CDF credits.

But I essentially wanted to present
this and look for flexibility from the Board to
again give the Commissioner/Chair of GDP as well as
her authorized rep, Bill Eager, the flexibility to

adjust the number as we get closer to finalizing

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

the deal.

TREASURER REELY: When we will know what
US Bank's going to do?

MR. SMITH: We had a conference call with
them this morning. They're looking to get second
quarter financials from Testa, and we're probably a
week or two away from getting those. And they need
to go to loan committee.

So we're talking probably two to
three weeks before the debt number gets finalized.
At that point, we'll start pushing on US Bank to
get some more credits out of them.

TREASURER NEELY: So does it tie up our
allocation in a way that we can't get more
allocation for next year because it's technically
not being utilized?

MR. SMITH: It has no bearing on next year.
It's really about where this current allocation we
have in hand is going to be distributed. So it's a
part of that couple of million of credits that
would need to be reconciled between a couple
different deals as the structuring gets finalized.

TREASURER NEELY: Okay.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: And what is it that they

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

produce?

MR. SMITH: It's a produce distribution
facility. They do some light food processing on
the site as well.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Okay.

MR. SAFFOLD: I'm still trying to understand.
You said it was in October you approved 15 for a
building which was going to be close to 200,000
square feet. They downsized it in half. The
appraisal was only 11, but now you want to increase
the allocation 18. I'm having trouble following
that.

MR. SMITH: Well, I guess, first, to refresh
everybody's memory about the New Markets Tax
Credit, the value of the credit itself, for every
dollar of allocation, generally you're going to
raise about 29 to 30 cents of New Markets equity.
So the original approval of 15 million would have
translated into about 4 million of net benefit to
the project.

At that time, it was a $32 million
total project cost project, and there was another
New Markets allocates that was going to contribute

10 million in credits to also assist. And so, as

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

the deal's been restructured and the credit markets
have deteriorated, they can borrow less and less
and less.

So now we're looking at a probable
senior debt from US Bank of about $9 million.
Testa can contribute about 5 million of their own
equity, and then Chicago Developments Fund's tax
credit equity would hope to raise about 5 million.
So we're going to need to scrape a bit to get this
project completed even as it is with the increased
allocation.

MR. NAREFSKY: We're also losing another New
Markets investor along the way.

MR. SMITH: Right, right.

MR. SAFFOLD: What was that, David?

MR. NAREFSKY: We're losing the other 
originally this deal was going to have two New
Markets investors, GDP and another investor.

MR. SAFFOLD: How much was the other one in
for?

MR. SMITH: They were originally in for 10.

MR. SAFFOLD: Ten you said?

TREASURER NEELY: I agree with Gene. It seems

like they're making this project so much smaller,

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

but they're still asking for more. I'm just saying
that --

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: For more and more money.

TREASURER NEELY: Right.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Okay. So this is a LEED
certified project, so they're going to put that wind
power station up there. So the space that they
have decreased is less per square foot than what
they're keeping.

So the tenant space that they were
going to include in this development, which is no
longer a part of the project, it was the smallest
amount per square foot 

MR. SMITH: Right.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: versus the rest of
the building, which is a cold storage facility. So
those costs are significant in comparison to what
they are removing from the project.

TREASURER NEELY: Now, I understand. I'm
still confused as to the dollars just in terms of
the project's scope. And if you?re saying that it's
solely because we're making up another investor who
is pulling out, then 

MR. SMITH: No. It's not primarily due to

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781*9586

 

that. The space has become more expensive per
square foot because the expensive elements have been
retained because they were sort of integral to the
project to get LEED?Platinum status. Cheaper space
has been removed, so you no longer have lease income
from JAB Produce to help pay for the facility and
raise more debt.

And then, simultaneously the project
costs, they've gone down from 32 million to 20
million, so that's a reduction of about a third in
project costs, but the total square footage has gone
down by about 50 percent. So the deal is getting
more expensive per unit of construction.

TREASURER NEELY: Right.

MR. SMITH: And there's really not room for
another allocatee in there.

TREASURER NEELY: Yeah. And I'm confused at
why it's getting more expensive per unit while real
estate costs and construction costs are all
decreasing.

MR. SMITH: Because the most expensive
units or, pieces of the project, such as the wind
turbine, are being retained.

TREASURER NEELY: Okay.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Any other questions on
this one?
(No response.)
Do I have a motion to consider the
resolution?
ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Move to pass to consider
the resolution.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Do I have a second?
MR. SAFFOLD: Second.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?
(Chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?
TREASURER NEELY: Opposed.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Alderman Laurino, you

were 
ALDERMAN LAURINO: I'm fine.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: So the motion passes.
Our next order of business is
approval of CDF's 2008 annual report. Do you walk

us through this, Tony, or is it just we handed it
out, and if anyone 
MR. SMITH: Yeah, we hadn't planned to.
CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Okay.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Where is the report at?

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

MR. NAREFSKY: I think it's right there.
Yeah, it's on the bottom of the pile there.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Okay. SO we need to
record this or file it with the City Council, so
what is our process?

MR. SMITH: Well, the bylaws just say it
needs to be filed with the City Council; is that
correct, David?

MR. NAREFSKY: That's correct.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Filed with whom or where?

MR. NAREFSKY: Well, the bylaws don't say
that.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Whom do we file it with?

MR. NAREFSKY: Well, I was going to suggest
that, since I think that the prior times the City
Council has considered CDF matters it's been
considered by the Joint Committee on Finance and
your committee, that that would seem to be the
logical filing protocol, both committees.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: If there are no objections,
the filing of the report would be in the Joint
Committee of Budget and Government Operations and
the Committee on Finance.

TREASURER NEELY: Second.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?
(Chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?
(No response.)

80 we can since we've passed it
here, we can move it to our next City Council which
is June, I think.

MR. NAREFSKY: Well, it didn't have to pass
City Council's 

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Right.

MR. NAREFSKY: approval. It's the filing.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: File it with 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: And David, you will
handle that?

MR. NAREFSKY: Yeah, we will.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Okay. I just want to
make sure we do it because when I had met with them
last year, Alderman Laurino, there were questions
of why one hadn't been filed yet. So I want to
make sure that 

ALDERMAN LAURINO: Sure. That that actually
does happen.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Yes.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: And then through those

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

committees they will be distributed?

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Yes, matam. Thank you.

Other business?

MR. SMITH: Great. Seventh round allocation
application. This was submitted on April 7th to
the GDP: Fund, and we have official notification
back that the application?s been received. It's
under consideration.

So we touched briefly on the need to
close 50 million in aggregate allocation by June
17th. We appear to be on track to do that, so it is
our understanding the seventh round allocation will
be in consideration and that we'll find out in
October whether CDF is going to be part of the 2009
allocates group.

MR. NAREFSKY: Tony, is it worth talking about
the stimulus contribution towards additional New
Markets 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Yeah.

TREASURER NEELY: Yeah.

MR. Sure. Part of the stimulus bill
was an additional 3 billion in New Markets Tax
Credit authority. And the way that this is being

implemented is a retroactive billion and a half to

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

entities that were in the '08 allocation round.

So the fund -- the CDFI Fund has not
yet announced who the in '08 round will be
retroactively granted credits, but the word on the
street is it's about 30 applicants, including a
couple of familiar local faces and some of the
larger banks that were shut out of the last round.

And then the other billion and a
half has been added to the 2009 round. So that the
total of 5 billion of credits in the '09 round
available, of which 3 and a half was the original
approved congressional amount, and then a billion
and a half is stimulus allocation.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: And do you have any
anticipated numbers of what we would receive?

MR. SMITH: CDF requested 125 million, which
is the max we could ask for. Generally you get less
than you ask for.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Yeah. I think that?s where
we were at before.

MR. SMITH: Right. CDF originally requested
150 million in the '06 round and got 100.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Yeah. Okay.

TREASURER NEELY: David, you had said before

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

that we are coming upon our limit of what we can
allocate because of Muntu may affect that.

MR. NAREFSKY: Well, we only have 100 million
in total.

TREASURER NEELY: Right.

MR. NAREFSKY: And I think you were asking
the question the impact of the uncertainty of Muntu
as the ability to allocate all of the 100 million.
So we are probably coming close to that point
because some of the applications that were described
in the pipeline I think are going to get further
along, and they'll be requesting an allocation.

As we sit here today 

TREASURER NEELY: We're fine.

MR. NAREFSKY: we don't have that tension.

TREASURER NEELY: So at our next meeting,
we'll probably have to make a decision?

MR. NAREFSKY: That sounds right.

MR. SMITH: That's a fair statement.

TREASURER NEELY: Okay.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: Thank you, all the Board
members, for coming today. I appreciate this. This
has been in my short time in this department,

this has been one the best tools that we have in

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781w9586

 

our toolbox to help projects to get financed
projects.

So with these you can see how
wonderful these projects are, especially in
neighborhoods that need it. And the buzz is
catching on about New Markets Tax Credits, so we?re
very excited. We'll be sharing that website with
you so you can get it to your folks and share it.

And that's why this extra stimulus
allocation is excellent because the pipeline is
just starting to really fill up. And we're getting
those grocers that, you know, we have that
allocation towards, so we're excited about that.

So thank you. I appreciate your
time. I know you're all super busy.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Let me ask a question, Madam
Chair. In that first initial, we were having
struggling because we had not really been very
diligent in explaining the process of New Markets
Tax Credits.

Have we done a better job at that
now?

MR. SMITH: I believe we've done a diligent

job from day one, but yes, we're meeting with

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781-9586

 

anybody we hear from, and we?re explaining the

process to anybody that cares to ask, going on site

to meet with industrial businesses, presenting at

industrial retention groups and broker associations.
So yes, absolutely.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Okay. Very good.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And can I just add that,
once again, we have asked the Commissioner to come
to the City Council and give us an update on a
quarterly basis. I think the three committees,
Finance, Economic, Development and your committee,
will meet and hear this. And I can't stress that
you need to tell the City Council over and over and
over again 

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Yes, absolutely.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: because, of course,
there's so many projects out there that's it's hard
to keep up with --

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: SO I believe we're
already in the second quarter, so I need to present
to the Council. So we need can get that committee together.

Will you guys coordinate?

ALDERMAN LAURINO: We'll make those

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312) 781?9586

 

arrangements.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: I just don't want to
miss our mark. I don't want to be nonresponsive to
you guys. And now we have some really great stuff
to report 

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: That's right.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: and then we can get
the information out there.

And Chairman Austin, I think they're
downplaying it. I think, you know, we're really
trying to outreach and get the word out because
this is not an easy subject matter.

You all get it because you've got
the brains for it, but it took them like eight
times sitting down with me going over it with me to
understand how it works. And any time we've asked
them to go out and meet with the community groups,
they're out there, and they're explaining it.

So you know, leveraging your
connections and getting it out, these are the
communities that, you know, we want to 

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And I think the website is
going to be very helpful.

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Very helpful.

 

URLAUB BOWEN ASSOCIATES, INC.
(312} 781-9586

 

ALDERMAN LAURINO: And if we have something
similar to the ABCs of TIF 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: That's what this is.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: we will have 

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: If you have time to get
on it, it would be great.

ALDERMAN LAURINO: I think that will be
helpful in explaining the overall process.

TREASURER NEELY: That's great.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: I know the Treasurer
needs to leave, so do I have a motion to adjourn
the meeting?

TREASURER NEELY: Motion.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: DO I have a second?

ALDERMAN AUSTIN: Second.

CHAIRPERSON RAGUSO: All those in favor?

(Chorus of ayes.)
Opposed?
(No reSponse.)
The meeting is adjourned. Thank you
so much for taking the time to come today.

had.)
