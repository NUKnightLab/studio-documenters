C. Filing a False Complaint
False and frivolous charges refer to cases where the accuser is using an unlawful discrimination or
sexual harassment complaint to accomplish some end other than stopping unlawful discrimination or
sexual harassment. It does not refer to charges made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the
seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false and frivolous charge is a severe offense that
can itself result in disciplinary action.
A. Contracts and Agreements: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations prohibit the District from
discriminating on the basis of handicap, either directly or through contractual or other arrangements.
All contractual, financial, cooperative and nonfinancial agreements entered into by the District must
contain a statement of nondiscrimination. The following language, or equivalent language, is to be
included in all contracts and agreements:
"The Forest Preserve District of Cook County does not discriminate on the basis of handicap in
admission or access to, or treatment or employment in District programs or services."
While the ultimate responsibility for inclusion of this statement in the contract or agreement rests with the
office initiating the contract or agreement, all signatories to District contracts or agreements are to be
aware of the requirements as they review contracts.
B. Public Program/Service Accessibility: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations require that
the District provide its programs, services and activities in an equivalent manner to both able-bodied
and handicapped individuals. Public service or program is defined very broadly to include any
program, activity or service involving public use. An equivalent manner is defined to mean that a
program, viewed in its entirety, is to be accessible to a handicapped person.
1. Advertisement of program or service: Wherever communication or publicity regarding programs
and services is made, each of the District's department heads is encouraged to include a
telephone number of a person who may be contacted to assist handicapped persons.
2. Eligibility: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations require that all printed materials
containing information about programs and services include a statement of nondiscrimination. It
is suggested that all printed material available to the public (that is, brochures, posters, forms,
etc.) include the following, or an equivalent statement:
"The Forest Preserve District of Cook County does not discriminate on the basis of
handicap in admission or access to, or treatment or employment in District programs or
services."
Each of the District's department heads is responsible for ensuring that department programs
and services are accessible in an equivalent manner to handicapped persons.
C. Employment Practices and Agreements: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations require that
all employment practices and procedures such as advertising and recruiting, testing, compensation,
etc., are to be as accessible to handicapped as to nonhandicapped applicants and employees.

December 12, 2017

1. Qualified handicapped applicants and employees: Only qualified handicapped individuals, who with
reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the job, are protected from
discrimination by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794. An
accommodation need not be made if it requires the District to modify essential job requirements;
in such an instance, it would not be discriminatory to deny employment or advancement to the
handicapped person who, despite accommodation, cannot perform essential job functions (i.e., is
not qualified). Reasonable accommodation may be denied if it constitutes an undue hardship to
the District, such as unreasonable financial costs.
2. Essential job functions: All job descriptions should ensure that physical, mental and
communications requirements be job related and accurately reflect job functions. No physical,
mental or communication requirement should tend to screen out handicapped applicants unless
the requirements are essential to the performance or safety of the job. Every effort should be
made to review job descriptions to ensure that they reflect the minimum related requirements.
Unrealistic or unrelated job requirements are to be excluded from job descriptions.
3. Pre-employment interviews: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations prohibit an interviewer
from asking general, nonrelated questions regarding handicaps. An interviewer may ask an
applicant if the applicant has a physical or mental condition which limits or affects the applicant's
ability or safety on the job, or the safety of others on the job is such questions are asked of all
applicants.
Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations stipulate that the District may inquire about
handicaps if:
a. An applicant voluntarily discloses a handicap;
b. It is related to affirmative actions efforts;
c. It is for the purpose of proper job placement; or
d. It is for the purpose of some job accommodation.
4. Medical examinations: Medical examination of handicapped applicants may be requested only:
a. When they are required of all candidates for the job; or
b. When there is an objective question as to medical limitations or the ability to perform a job
safely.
5. Testing: Testing of a handicapped applicant is appropriate when it is required of all applicants.
Occasionally it may be necessary to make some accommodations to a handicapped person.
D. Complaint Procedure: Federal Handicapped Compliance Regulations require that the District adopt
a complaint procedure that incorporates appropriate due process standards and that provides for the
prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging discrimination.
1. Filing: The person alleging a complaint against the District shall file a written statement which
adequately explains the problem. The written complaint may be filed by mail or in person and is
to be filed with the District's Handicapped Compliance Coordinator, who shall be designated by
the General Superintendent.
2. Seeking a resolution: Following receipt of the complaint, the District's Handicapped Compliance
Coordinator will meet with the complainant to discuss the complaint and seek a remedy.
Following the meeting, a written summary of the meeting and the proposed remedy, if any, will
be sent to the complainant by the District's Handicapped Compliance Coordinator.
3. Appeal: The complainant has a right to appeal the resolution proposed by the District's
Handicapped Compliance Coordinator. The appeal is to be filed in the same manner as the initial

Page 12 of 31

BOARD AGENDA

complaint and is to be filed with the Cook County Handicapped Compliance Officer. The Cook
County Handicapped Compliance Officer will then reach a decision to either uphold the original
remedy or present an alternate remedy. The Cook County Handicapped Compliance Officer will
then inform the complainant in writing of the decision.
The appeal meeting and decision will conclude the complaint procedure.
The preceding complaint procedure does not preclude the complainant from pursuing other
remedies, nor is the complaint procedure a prerequisite to pursuing other remedies.

Summary:

The Preserves is letting a contract for row crop production at select sites which were
historically used for agricultural purposes prior to acquisition by the Preserves, and as such, do not exist in
an ecologically natural state. Farmers will have use of the property for seeding one or more of the
following row crops: wheat, oats, soybeans, and/or corn. This practice allows the Preserves to generate
revenue, while at the same time preventing invasive plant species from taking over fallow land. It is the
Preserve’s intention to restore fallow land wherever possible and these farming practices are a good
method to keep these lands in a more manageable condition until a restoration project can take place on
the site. The contract term for row crop farming is a period of one (1) year, with four (4) one-year
renewal options to be exercised by the General Superintendent or his/her designee, which gives the
Preserves the option to discontinue farming practices in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.
Rietveld Brothers was the highest responsible bidder for row crop site #3RC, Sauk Village Addition, for a
total potential revenue generation over the next five (5) years of $14,400.00. Rietveld Brothers was the
sole bidder for this site.

Summary:

BOARD AGENDA

December 12, 2017

The Preserves has identified a parcel of land for acquisition that would add to the Preserves’

current holdings near King’s Grove (the “Property”). The Property, commonly known as 31 Monee Road,
Park Forest, Cook County, Illinois 60466, consists of approximately 1.051± acres. The Property is located
immediately adjacent to land owned by the Preserves and would add, and provide a buffer to, the
District’s holdings in the area.
Through negotiations, The Land Conservancy of Will County, an Illinois Not for Profit Corporation (the
“Donor”), has agreed to donate the Property at no charge to the District. The Property has an estimated
value of $147,390.00 based on the Cook County Assessor’s 2016 property tax assessment. The District
shall pay for any closing costs, including any and all back taxes, associated with the conveyance. Upon
successful completion of due diligence by the District and prior to closing, Donor shall demolish the
existing pool and pool house located on the property, at Donor’s expense. Following the closing, the
District will become vested with fee simple absolute title and the immediate right to possession of the
Property.
Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and all
required documentation as determined by the Preserves’ legal department, to accept the donation of the
Property and authorize funds in an amount not to exceed $60,000 to cover any closing costs and back
taxes associated with the Property.
This land acquisition advances the goals of the Next Century Conservation Plan.
