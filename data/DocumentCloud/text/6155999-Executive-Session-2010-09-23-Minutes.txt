Ms. Hackett addressed the Board with respect to the Investment Consultant search. She reminded the
Trustees that per the instruction of the Board, the search began with the release of a request for
proposal in July. She reviewed the profiles and the assessment of the responses to the request for
proposal. She indicated that the search was conducted in accordance with PA 96-0006 as manager
searches have been since its enactment. Ms. Hackett reviewed the search objectives and the search
process to date. She explained that we received six responses and the intention is for the Board to
select finalists during open session.
The Trustees discussed the selection schedule and any transition schedule in light of potential for
new Board members joining within the next several months. Ms. Hackett explained that the original
schedule called for finalist presentations in October. The Trustees also discussed the duty of the
Board with respect to annuitants, employees and the employer. The Trustees also discussed the
scoring process and whether any particular criteria were weighted greater than any other. Ms.
Hackett explained that all criteria used in the analysis were given equal weight.

 Ms. Hackett explained the criteria, analysis and scoring for each of the respondents; including
organization, general consulting, alternatives consulting, performance, value added resources and
fees. She concluded by recommending the three top managers for further due diligence.
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald and seconded by Trustee Benjamin that, no action being taken,
the Executive Session be adjourned and that the Board return to open session.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
