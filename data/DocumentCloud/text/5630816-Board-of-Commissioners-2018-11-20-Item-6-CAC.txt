Item No. 6

AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A FUNDING AGREEMENT WITH THE CENTRAL
ADVISORY COUNCIL
Presenter:

Mary Howard, Chief Resident Services Officer

Recommendation
The Chief Executive Officer recommends that the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago
Housing Authority (“CHA”) authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a
Funding Agreement with the Central Advisory Council for a one-year term from January 1, 2019
through December 31, 2019 in an amount not to exceed $1,340,530.00.
The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, and Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due
diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Funding
Resident Services Division Budget
Background
A Funding Agreement between CHA and the CAC is required by HUD Regulations 24 CFR
964.150 (Funding Tenant Participation) for funding provided by a housing authority for a dulyelected resident council. The purpose of the CAC, as the elected jurisdiction-wide resident
council for CHA residents, is to act as a vehicle for resident participation and to represent the
interests of the residents of CHA family properties and senior buildings. The role of a resident
council is to improve the quality of life and resident satisfaction, and to participate in self-help
initiatives to create a positive living environment for families living in public housing (24 CFR
964.100). The Funding Agreement will be used to fund tenant participation activities (officer
stipends, operating expenses, etc.) and will also include special programs such as the Section 3
Small Grants Program, which provides small grants for residents in need of business
development assistance.
Resident Councils are required by HUD Regulations CRF 964.130 (Election procedures and
standards) to hold elections at least once every three years. Elections must be administered by
Resident Councils and monitored by the PHA. Resident Councils shall use an independent thirdparty to oversee elections and recall procedures. The most recent election was conducted in
1

 September 2016. Therefore, additional funding has been included in this Board authorization to
be set aside solely to procure an independent third party contractor to conduct Local Advisory
Council and Central Advisory Council elections in accordance with HUD regulation.
