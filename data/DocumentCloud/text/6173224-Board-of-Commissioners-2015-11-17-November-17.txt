(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to exercise the second
one-year option of Contract 11192 with the Chicago Urban League for the business and
entrepreneurship program for CHA residents, in an amount not-to-exceed $200,000. The new
aggregate not-to-exceed contract amount is $1,201,464. As part of CHA’s Section 3 policy and the
2013 Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with HUD regarding Section 3, CHA is required to not
only do business with Section 3 Business Concerns, but has also agreed to provide certain outreach and
development support for resident owned businesses. Under the modified Entrepreneurship Program,
the Chicago Urban League will conduct outreach to market its existing menu of programs to CHA
residents. Residents will be assessed and referred to the most appropriate Urban League program;
those who do not currently meet eligibility for programs will be referred to the Urban League’s
external partners to build individual skills sets necessary to move toward successful entrepreneurism.
A portion of this agreement will be used to cover any fees associated with the Urban League’s
programs and approved external partner programs, including business incubator opportunities, on a
first-come, first-serve basis. However, many of the Urban League’s programs are free of charge to
participants. In total, the Urban League will provide support and training to approximately 100 CHA
residents during the second option year.
Commissioner Washington voted “Nay” on Item 1 only.

(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to exercise the option
year contract with 15 CHA’s hearing officers and presenters for the period of January 1, 2016 –
December 31, 2016, in an aggregate amount not –to exceed $900,000 for the Housing Choice Voucher
(HCV) Informal Hearing Program (IHP). Pursuant to HUD rules and regulations, and the CHA
Administrative Plan, the Authority must offer an informal hearing for certain CHA determinations
relating to the individual circumstance of a participant family. The purpose of the informal hearing is
to consider whether the CHA’s decisions related to the family’s circumstances which affect their HCV
voucher, are in accordance with the law, HUD regulations and CHA policies. The CHA is not
permitted to terminate a family’s assistance until the time allowed for the family to request an informal
hearing has elapsed, and any requested hearing has been completed. The families may contest an
adverse decision in the Circuit Court of Cook County. In mid - 2011 the CHA transitioned the HCV
IHP from its HCV Contract Administrators to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to conduct the
IHP, the OGC procured the services of a legal recruiter to assist the CHA in the recruitment of 15
attorneys as temporary employees to act as HCV hearing officers and presenters. During the summer
of 2012, the OGC revised the IHP and effective October 1, 2012, the 6 hearing officers and presenters
who remained with the IHP were made independent contractors. The OGC once again procured the
services of a legal recruiter to recruit 15 additional independent contractors/ attorneys for a total of 21
attorneys (12 Hearing Officers and 9 Presenters) for a 1-year term (October 1, 2012 through September
9

 30, 2013) with a 1-year option to provide hearing officer and presenter services for the IHP. In 2014
the Board of Commissioners approved a 15-month contract (October 1, 2014 – December 31, 2015)
with a 1-year option to provide hearing officer and presenter services for the IHP with the then current
independent contractors. Currently, there are 11 Hearing Officers and 4 Presenters.

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolution adopted.
Jack Markowski, Chairman of the Real Estate Development committee, then presented his report. Per
Commissioner Markowski, the Real Estate and Development committee met on Wednesday,
November 12 , 2015, at the CHA Corporate Offices located at 60 East Van Buren, 12th Floor Loft in
Chicago. Commissioner Markowski chaired the meeting and present also were Commissioners Cozzi
and Harris. Although Commissioners Johnson, Washington and Hooker were also present they were
not counted toward the quorum since they are not members of the Real Estate Development
10

 committee. After presentation by staff, committee members discussed and voted on the items
appearing on the agenda.
On behalf of the Real Estate Development Committee, Commissioner Markowski then presented an
Omnibus Motion for the approval of Items 11 through 13.
(Item 11)
The resolution for Item 11 approves staff to proceed with the process to create legal entity structure(s)
to own and finance certain properties within CHA’s RAD portfolio. HUD mandates that the role of
owner and Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contract administrator must be separated into two legal
entities. Currently, CHA intends to assume, for all of the portfolio properties converting to RAD, the
role of contract administrator for each of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contracts. As a
result, CHA is required to establish, as necessary, a separate ownership structure for the properties
currently owned by CHA and converting to RAD. If needed, the establishment of separate single
purpose entities would enable CHA to pursue low income housing tax credits and/or other sources of
financing. This approach would also ensure that the same federal, state and local tax exemptions, sales
tax exemption and property tax exemption are available to each of the separate legal structures.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-109
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated November 12, 2015 requesting authorization to create legal entity
structure(s) to own and finance properties within the Rental Assistance Demonstration
(RAD) program portfolio.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes CHA staff to proceed with the legal
entity structuring process, as necessary and appropriate, for the ownership of RAD
properties.

(Item 12)
The resolution for Item 12 authorize the Acting Chief Executive Officer to: submit Rental Assistance
Demonstration (RAD) Financing Plans to HUD and Enter Into RAD Conversion Commitments with
HUD for Kenmore Apartments, Pomeroy Apartments, and Britton Budd Apartments; commit CHA
funds not to exceed $2,000,000 to fund initial rehabilitation work and Deposits to the Replacement
Reserves; Execute Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Contracts under the HUD RAD program and
execute such other documents as may be required. Capital Needs Assessments (CNA) were prepared
for Kenmore Apartments, Pomeroy Apartments, and Britton Budd Apartments to determine the capital
needs of the properties over the 20 year initial term of the proposed HAP contract. Capital
improvements identified as initial needs are financed at closing and are generally expected to be
completed within the first two years after conversion. The CNA also identifies the amount of funding
needed to capitalize a replacement reserve for each property, which is intended to cover all identified
capital needs associated with the CNA over the 20-year HAP contract period. CHA plans to fund
approximately $65,000 from CHA MTW funding to conduct energy-efficiency related rehabilitation
work for Kenmore Apartments, Pomeroy Apartments, and Britton Budd Apartments. This rehab
activity is expected to be completed within 12 months of conversion. CHA plans to fund
approximately $1,935,000 from CHA MTW funding as deposits into the replacement reserves of
Kenmore Apartments, Pomeroy Apartments, and Britton Budd Apartments.

(Item 13)
In June 2015, the CHA solicited responses from firms or teams interested in performing Appraisal
Services. The solicitation was advertised in area newspapers in addition to BuySpeed and the CHA
website. Of the four proposals submitted, three submissions were deemed responsive. Based upon the
evaluation of the written proposals it was determined that Applied Real Estate Analysis Inc. and PF
Appraisals, Inc. be awarded contracts. Proposals were evaluated on several factors including the
firm’s qualifications, experiences and past performance, the responsiveness of the proposed statement
of work, and the quality of the proposed work plan. Each Professional Services Agreement shall have a
not-to-exceed amount of $100,000 with a base term of two years and two one-year option periods.
There is an additional $150,000 allocated for future appraisal services to be issued to the two firms on
a rotating task order basis for the remaining term of each contract.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-111
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 12, 2015
entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO ENTER INTO PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Committee Chair Mark Cozzi then presented the report of the Finance & Personnel Committee
meeting. Per Commissioner Cozzi, the Finance & Personnel committee met on November 12, 2015 at
the CHA Corporate Offices located at 60 E. Van Buren in Chicago. Present at the meeting were
Commissioners Johnson and Markowski. Present also, but not counted for the quorum was
Commissioner Washington and Hooker. After presentation by staff, committee members discussed and
voted on the items appearing on the agenda.
On behalf of the Finance & Personnel Committee, Commissioner Cozzi then presented an Omnibus
Motion for the approval of Items 14 through 19.
(Item 14, 15 and 16)
The resolutions for Item 14, 15 and 16 approves entering into a loan modification with PNC Real
Estate to reduce the interest rate on the PNC Loans for C/S Harrison Courts Limited Partnership;
Lathrop Elderly Limited Partnership and Loomis Courts Limited Partnership; submit FHA loan
modification packages to HUD for approval and execute and deliver such other documents and
perform such other actions as may be necessary to implement the foregoing. Harrison Courts consists
of three apartment buildings located at 2910, 2930 and 2950 W. Harrison Street in Chicago, Illinois.
The seven-story buildings were constructed in 1950. Each building encompasses approximately
30,730 gross square feet and currently contains forty-two (42) apartments for a total of one-hundred
and twenty-four (124) units. The property was completely renovated in 2007 using low income
housing tax credits. Lathrop Elderly is located at 2717 North Leavitt Street in Chicago, Illinois. The
property contains ninety-two (92) units. The property was completely renovated in 2007 using low
income housing tax credits. Loomis Courts consists of two apartment buildings located at 1314 and
1342 West 15th Street in Chicago, Illinois. The seven-story buildings were constructed in 1951. Each
building encompasses approximately 52,180 gross square feet and currently contains sixty-two (62)
apartments for a total of one-hundred and twenty-four (124) units. Currently, Harrison Courts, Lathrop
14

 Elderly and Loomis Courts are in good condition. However, the properties are in need of capital
improvements to prevent deterioration. Since interest rates are currently at historical lows, CHA now
has an opportunity to substantially reduce its debt service requirements and take advantage of freed up
capital to address needed repairs. The CHA solicited term sheets to refinance the properties from eight
lenders and two proposals were received for each property. PNC offered the most advantageous loan
for each property because it had the least costs and the term of the loan would not be extended. The
second proposal offered a lower interest rate, however due to the extension of the maturity, their
proposal was more expensive. The PNC mortgage offered a relatively new FHA program called an
Interest Rate Reduction (IRR”. The IRR program was started by FHA in April 2013 as an alternative
to refinancing under Section 223(a) (7). IRRs provide a way to reduce the interest rate on existing
FHA multifamily mortgage loans thereby significantly improving the property’s cash flow. IRRs can
only be offered by the existing FHA mortgage and offer a streamlined process, the maturity date
remains the same and the principal balance of the loan does not increase. Over the remaining life of
the loan, the PNC mortgage will save the property $1,227,383 for Harrison Courts; $1,312,633 for the
Lathrop property and $1,881,359 for the Loomis Courts property.

(Item 17)
The CHA advertised an RFP on July 2015, to solicit vendors to competitively procure insurance
coverages for the Property Managers’ Insurance Program (PMIP) and the Authority’s Property and
Management Liability coverages, coordinated through the Authority’s Risk Management Department.
The RFP was advertised in area newspapers. Additionally, 71 Assist Agencies and 228 Section 3
Business Concerns received notification of the solicitation. The CHA also directly solicited 34 firms,
posted the solicitation announcement on the CHA website and in the CHA Supplier Portal. Of the
five proposals received all five were deemed responsive. After review by the evaluation committee,
the total points awarded each Respondent resulted in three firms falling within the competitive range
and moving forward with oral presentations. Based upon the evaluations of the written proposal, oral
presentations, and the overall proposed fee, including the Best and Final Offer, it was determined that
Arthur J. Gallagher & Company provide the best overall service and value to CHA. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item 17 approves award of contract to Arthur J. Gallagher & Company, to perform
16

 insurance brokerage and consulting services for a base term of two years, in an amount of $379,270,

The resolution for Item 18 approves and adopts the FY2016 Comprehensive Budget. The FY2016
Comprehensive Budget totaling $1.067 billion includes the following fund categories: MTW Fundtotal revenue for FY2016 is $1.041 billion. The MTW Fund combines the Low-Rent, Capital and
Section 8 programs into a block grant as allowed by HUD under the Amended and Restated MTW
agreement. Total MTW Fund revenues consist of Housing Assistance Subsidy, Capital Grant Funds,
Operating Subsidy, MTW Reserves, Block Grant, Dwelling Rental Income, RAD, Interest Income and
Other Income. Section 8 Fund (Non-MTW) - total revenue for this program is $18.9 million. These
contracts provide appropriations for approximately $9.3 million of Mod Rehab vouchers, $9.1 million
Veteran's Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers, and $467.9 thousand Mainstream vouchers
for housing assistance based on annual contributions contracts from HUD. Hope VI Fund - total

fund balance available for appropriation in FY2016 is equal to the estimated sum of all expenditures to
be made/incurred during FY2016 and any unpaid liabilities at the beginning of FY2016.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION 2015-CHA-116
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated November 12, 2015,

said resolution adopted.
Committee Chair Matthew Brewer then presented his report. Per Commissioner Brewer, the Audit
Committee held a Special Meeting on November 4, 2015, at approximately 1:00 p.m., at the CHA
Corporate Offices, 60 E. Van Buren, 12th Floor Loft. Commissioner Cozzi chaired the meeting and the
following committee members were present: Commissioners Hooker and Johnson and Karen
Caldwell, our general community member. The purpose of the special meeting was to discuss in
closed meeting certain personnel matters; audit and investigatory review matters; and the review of
closed meeting matters with the Internal auditor and inspector general pursuant to the Open Meeting
Act 5 ILCS 120/2 under the following exceptions: (c)(1); (c)(11); (c)(21); and (c)(29). The special
meeting was also called to vote on one matter in Open Session. There being a quorum present,
18

 committee members adjourned to closed session to discuss the matters mentioned above and
subsequently returned to open session. In open session committee members discussed and approved a
recommendation for approval of the proposed 2016 Inspector General and Internal Audit Budgets. No
Board vote is necessary at this time since approval has been granted under Item 18 – Approval of the
2016 Comprehensive Budget.
(Item 20)
Since 2001, CHA has co-sourced with professional firms to assist with its governance, risk mitigation,
and compliance responsibilities by performing duties as an internal audit service provider. Annually,
the CHA Audit Committee approves an audit plan of projects based upon a risk assessment. CHA’s
Director, Audit Management and Compliance, working with the internal audit service provider, issues
engagement scoping memos to stakeholders involved in the audit projects. The internal audit service
provider must understand the overall scope and budget, and develop an audit approach for specific
projects. Upon completion of the audit process, reports are communicated to the Audit Committee.
Accordingly, the CHA advertised a Request For Proposal (RFP) in August 2015 soliciting vendors to
perform internal audit services. The RFP was advertised in area newspapers and was posted on the
CHA website and in the CHA Supplier Portal. Additionally, 71 Assist Agencies and 251 Section 3
Business Concerns received notification of the solicitation. The CHA also directly solicited 403 firms.
Of the four proposals all four were deemed responsive. An Evaluation Committee consisting of three
CHA staff members and two Audit Committee members evaluated the responsive proposals. After the
Evaluation Committee completed its review of the four proposals, the total points awarded each
respondent resulted in two firms falling within the competitive range and moving forward with oral
presentations. Based upon the evaluations of the written proposals, oral presentations, and the overall
proposed fee, including the Best and Final Offer, RSM US LLP received the highest combined number
of points during the evaluation process for the criteria scored and is recommended to provide the best
overall service and value to CHA. The resolution for Item 20 approves award of contract to RSM US
LLP to perform internal audit services for a base term of three-years in an amount not-to-exceed
$3,000,000, and two one-year option periods in an amount not-to-exceed $2,000,000, for a total
amount not-to-exceed $5,000,000.
Commissioner Brewer then submitted a Motion for the approval of Item 20.
Commissioners Brewer and Cozzi abstained from voting on this item.
RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-118
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated NOVEMBER 17, 2015 entitled: AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A

There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolution adopted.
Commissioner Washington then presented a Motion for the approval of Item 21.
(Item 21)
The resolution for Item 21 approves and adopt the CHA’s Minimum Wage Requirement and authorize
the CEO or his designee, and the Deputy Chief of Procurement and Contracts to promulgate and
maintain administrative procedures, practices and forms to implement the Minimum Wage
Requirement. In cooperation with other sister agencies of the City of Chicago and in keeping with
similar initiatives undertaken to support improved conditions and a living wage in Chicago, the CHA
has established the Minimum Wage Requirement to provide that vendors performing work under CHA
contracts shall pay a minimum wage to covered employees performing on covered contracts at a level
of Thirteen Dollars per hour ($13.00/hr.). The Minimum Wage rate is subject to periodic adjustments
tied to inflation, and the Requirement includes various definitions and other terms and provisions
necessary for transparent and efficient administration. The CHA draws authority for adopting a
minimum wage from Illinois law. Under Section 26 of the Illinois Housing Authorities Act, a public
housing authority is permitted to set minimum wage and maximum hour provisions for labor in its
contracts. Section 26 also permits a public housing authority to include contractual provisions
requiring contractors to comply with any conditions which the federal government may have attached
to the project and its funding. The Minimum Wage Requirement substantially mirrors the 2014
Executive Order Number 2014-1 (Minimum Wage Increase) signed by Chicago Mayor Rahm
Emanuel, but incorporates certain terms and distinctions necessary to ensure the proper function and
application of the Requirement in a manner fully consistent with federal laws, rules and regulations
applicable to CHA activities. Due to overlapping state and federal mandates that are applicable to
CHA operations and activities, the CHA Minimum Wage Requirement contains a number of terms and
provisions that address issues that are unique to CHA as a federally funded agency (for example,
certain federal requirements, like Davis-Bacon prevailing wage labor levels, preempt inconsistent state
or local wage ordinances where they may overlap). The Minimum Wage Requirement defers to
federal prevailing wage provisions in any situation where a conflict might arise.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-119
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated November 17, 2015 entitled: “ADOPTION OF THE CHICAGO
HOUSING AUTHORITY’S MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENT”;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
20

 THAT,

the Chicago Housing Authority Minimum Wage Requirement is adopted, and shall
take effect as of December 1, 2015.

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy
Chief for Procurement and Contracts to promulgate and maintain administrative
procedures to implement the Minimum Wage Requirement.

Commissioner Johnson then presented a motion for the approval of Item 22.
(Item 22)
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached amended CHA Procurement
Policy and authorize the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or his designee to implement the policy. The
Office of the General Counsel and the Department of Procurement and Contracts have completed all
necessary due diligence to support the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval of this
item accordingly. The CHA Procurement Policy has been amended in order to align it with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (“HUD”) recent issuance of revised procurement
standards in its Code of Federal Regulations (“CFR”). HUD 2 CFR 200.317-326 now replaces HUD
24 CFR 85.36. The revised procurement standards are generally consistent with the previous standards,
but include a change in dollar thresholds for both Micro-Purchases, which has been increased from
$2,500 to $3,000, and the Simplified Acquisition Threshold, which has been increased from $100,000
to $150,000 and establishes the limit for the use of small purchase procedures.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2015-CHA-120
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board letter dated November 17, 2015 requesting approval of the amended Chicago
Housing Authority Procurement Policy;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
implement the amended Chicago Housing Authority Procurement Policy.

Chairman Hooker then presented commissioners and the public with an overview of his activities
during the month of October.
Eugene Jones, Acting Chief Executive Officer, then presented his monthly report to the
Commissioners.
Chairman Hooker then invited residents and the public at large to address the Board.
There being no further business to come before the Commissioners, upon Motion made and seconded,
the Regular board meeting of November 17, 2015, was adjourned.
