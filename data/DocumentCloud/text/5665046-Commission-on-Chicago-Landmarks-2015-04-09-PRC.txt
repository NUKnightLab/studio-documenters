of 310 N. Green building and revisions to the design of the new construction as part
of the adoptive reuse.

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

310 N. Green:
1. Given the distressed and deteriorated conditions and structural deficiencies of
the east and north elevations of 310 N. Green building the proposed
dismantlement, demolition, repair and reconstruction of these street elevations
conforms with the Commission’s standards and criteria, including the criterion
that “the work will replace the significant historical or architectural feature
where the original feature is deteriorated beyond reasonable methods of
repair, and the replacement feature is in kind”;
2. As proposed, the reconstructed masonry façades shall match the removed
façades in location, size, brick coursing and detailing and any missing
elements shall be replicated to match historic based on physical and
photographic documentation. The existing historic brick, historic cast iron
column covers and angle returns will be removed, salvaged, repaired and
reinstalled. Complete photographic documentation as well as dimensioned
enlarged elevations, brick details of each unique condition (such as corbeling,
etc.) on the façade shall be included with the permit plans. Any replacement
brick and new mortar should match the historic in size, texture, color, finish,
and profiles and material samples shall be submitted with the permit
application;
3. The new sidewalk elevations shall match the existing sidewalk elevations.
Existing and proposed details of the sidewalks shall be included in the permit
plans as well as proposed railing details;
4. As proposed, the 2nd floor window openings will match their historic size and
new fixed windows to mimic double-hung windows will be installed. The
exterior profiles and the upper sash and lower sash offset of the fixed
windows shall match those of a double-hung window and window details

easternmost bay of the Fulton Market façade of 856 W. Fulton building, the
proposed dismantlement, demolition, repair and rebuilding of the sections of
the 2nd and 3rd floor spandrels, masonry piers and parapet wall as show on
plans dated April 7, 2015 is approved. The reconstruction of this portion of
the façade must occur pursuant to a repair permit and prior to any bracing,
demolition or other construction occurring. As proposed, all existing terra
cotta as well as the terra cotta sign band, face brick and limestone shall be
salvaged, repaired and reinstalled. Any replacement masonry and new mortar
should match the historic in size, texture, color, finish, and profiles and
material samples shall be submitted with the permit application;
New Construction:
7. The rooftop addition atop 856 W. Fulton, setback approximately 36’-10” from
Fulton Market and 6’-6” taller than the historic facade is approved as
proposed;

 8. The new canopy at the third floor of the new structure at the northwest corner
of Fulton and Green set back 20’-11” from Fulton and 10’-9” from Green, is
approved as shown on drawings dated March 27, 2015. Enlarged
dimensioned details shall be submitted with the permit plans; and,
9. Compliance with the remaining conditions of approval for the project, other
than specifically listed above, as outlined in the Permit Review Committee’s
decision letter, dated September 12, 2014.
The project is not subject to the provisions of Section 2-120-825 of the Municipal
Code of Chicago governing review of permits for the demolition of 40% or more
of any building or structure either designated as a “Chicago Landmark” or located
in any district designated as a “Chicago Landmark”.
6. 39 S. LaSalle
42nd Ward
New York Life Building
Proposed replacement of storefronts, a new canopy, rooftop alterations, and interior
alterations to historic interior lobby spaces for new hotel.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. The proposed storefront replacement, with butt-glazed vertical mullions, black
spandrel glass base, and stile-and-rail retail doors, are approved as proposed.
In the future, when the remaining 7 existing storefronts are to be replaced,
they will need to match this replacement storefront design to provide a
cohesive appearance;
2. The Option 1 canopy is approved as proposed, as it does not obscure or
damage any original features and is a simple contemporary design. If Option
2 can be revised to not alter the stone spandrel, staff recommends this option
could be approved as well with attachment details submitted to be reviewed
for approval by Historic Preservation staff;
3. The proposed fixed shed-style awnings, located in front of the stone spandrels
to match the locations shown on the historic photos, are approved with
attachments to the end piers and underside of the lintel, and if structurally
necessary with two-three minor attachments at the stone spandrel. All
attachments plates shall be painted to match the color of the stone;
4. The proposed new 6 hotel sign plaques, located at each side of the entries and
at the corner pier, are approved in concept. Attachment details and detailed
drawings shall be reviewed for approval by Historic Preservation staff as part
of the permit application;
5. The 2nd-floor interior clear glass windows at the LaSalle Street lobby may
have opaque mirrored film applied to them as proposed, however additional
and compatible illumination, such as linear fixtures at ledges or standing
fixtures at the stair piers, for this main lobby space shall be provided to ensure
that the illumination levels will not be adversely impacted;
6. Sprinkler layout and installation details shall have as little impact to the
historic marble and ornamental detailing as possible and shall be submitted to
be reviewed by Historic Preservation staff for approval; and;
7. Given the limitations in size and configuration of the historic vestibule, a new
clear glass full-height vestibule partition may be installed in the historic
corridor as shown in “slider door option” drawing dated 3/31/15. Enlarged

 details shall be included in the permit plans and shop drawings shall be
submitted to Historic Preservation staff to be reviewed for approval prior to
order and installation.
7. 2112 N. Sedgwick
43rd Ward
Mid-North District
Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation including new 4-story rear addition to
existing 3-story building, new front porch, stair and canopy, window replacement,
attached garage and other alterations.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. To bring the project into conformance with the adopted standards,
Commission’s guidelines, and avoid an adverse effect, the applicant may
either retain the existing windows or replace them with new double-hung
wood or clad-wood windows to match the historic configuration. Window
and brick mold details shall be submitted;
2. The materials and design of the front porch and stair, proposed to be steel with
glass railings, treads and risers shall be restudied to be more consistent with
the architectural and historic character of the property and the district. The
materials may be wood, metal and possible stone stairs with closed risers and
metal railings with newel posts. The approximately 5 foot width of the single
stair should be increased to be more compatible. Alternatively, since the
proposal does not include the construction of the second stair for the adjacent
row house, the width of the stair could be enlarged to match the width of the
porch landing forming a shared stair, which also would be historically
appropriate. Porch and stair details with dimensions shall be submitted;
3. The proposed steel and glass canopy is approved as proposed. Dimensioned
details shall be submitted;
4. The arrangement of a single door with a side lite and a transom for two entries
(one at grade and one at 2nd floor main entry) is approved. The new entry
doors shall incorporate recessed panels and dimensioned details of the door
and side lite shall be submitted;
5. A fixed glass infill replicating the entry door pattern in the arrangement of the
mullions, but without a door, at the two remaining (one at grade and one at 2nd
floor) entry masonry openings are approved. Dimensioned details shall be
submitted;
6. The size and location of the proposed fourth floor addition is approved as
submitted. The ground-face block side walls of the fourth floor addition
should be changed to a material more compatible to the historic district, such
as brick, dark non-reflective metal panels or Oko Skin planks. Material
sample of the proposed cladding material shall be submitted;
7. The ground-face block walls of the rear addition (beyond the historic common
brick walls to remain) should be integral colored to be consistent with the
color of the existing common brick. Material sample of the proposed cladding
material shall be submitted;
8. A report and drawings by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the
historic facades should be supported, braced and protected, in-situ, during the
demolition of the exterior portions of the building and the interior structure
and the excavation and construction of the new addition as well as during the

 foundation work, shall be included on the permit plans. The report should
include recommended measures and sequencing plan;
9. Masonry cleaning specifications and cut sheet shall be submitted; and,
10. The project requires a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested variance/adjustment
relative to the zoning code requirements.
In addition, the Committee found that the amount of demolition involved with the
project, based upon the submitted information, does not trigger the requirements
of Section 2-120-825 governing the demolition of 40% or more of landmark
buildings.
