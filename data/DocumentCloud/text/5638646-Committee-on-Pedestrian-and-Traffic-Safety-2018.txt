TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS:

East 89th Street and South Cottage Grove Avenue; All Way Stop. Not Recommended.
South Cottage Grove Avenue is designed as a minor arterial roadway with significantly
higher volumes than East 89th Street, a one way eastbound residential street. Stop
signs on streets with higher volumes such as South Cottage Grove tend to increase
rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for
pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. CDOT does not recommend installing an All
Way Stop at this intersection -- (18-02054308) [Or2018?306]

West 64th Place and South Austin Avenue; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches. Not Recommended. South Austin Avenue is a major collector roadway
with significantly higher traffic volumes than West 64th Place, a local roadway. Stop
Signs on streets with higher volumes such as South Austin Avenue tend to increase
rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for
pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All
Way Stop Sign at this intersection -- (18-02280452) [Or2018?387]

West Marquette Road and South Komensky Avenue; Stop Sign, Stopping east and
west traffic on West Marquette Road at South Komensky Avenue. West Marquette
Road is a major collector roadway with significantly higher volumes that South
Komensky Avenue, a one way northbound local street. Stop signs on streets with
higher volumes such as West Marquette Road tend to increase rear-end crashes,
increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Due to the intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at South Pulaski
Road, a stop sign will be unexpected for motorists. Therefore, CDOT does not
recommend an All Way Stop at this intersection. CDOT is currently conducting a traffic
study to investigate potential pedestrian safety improvements at this intersection --
(18-02054336) [Or20?l8?310]

West 55th Street and South Mobile Avenue; Stop Sign, Stopping east and west bound

Street is a major collector roadway with significantly higher volumes than South Mobile
Avenue, a two way local street that intersects West 55th Street at a T-intersection.
Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as West 55th Street tend to increase
rear?end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for
pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at T-
intersections. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend a stop sign at this intersection

TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS SIGNALS 

West 55th Street and South Tripp Avenue; Two Way Stop Sign, Stopping east and
westbound traffic on West 55th Street at South Tripp Avenue. Not Recommended.
West 55th Street is a major collector roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes
that South Tripp Avenue, a One Way northbound local street. Stop signs on streets
with higher volumes such as West 55th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes,
increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Additionally, due to this intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at
West 55th Street and South Keeler Avenue, a Stop Sign at South Tripp Street will be
unexpected for drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop Sign
at this intersection -- (18-02280936) [Or2018?386]

South Princeton Avenue and West 93rd Place; All Way Stop Sign. Not Recommended.
West 93rd Place intersects South Princeton Avenue at a T?intersection and terminates
at a cul-de-sac just southeast of the intersection. Traffic volumes on South Princeton
Avenue are higher than volumes on West 93rd Place, a local residential street. Stop
Signs on streets with higher volumes such as South Princeton Avenue tend to
increase rear?end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of security
for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at
T-intersections. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop Sign at this
intersection -- (18?02284256) [Or2018?348]

West Madison Street and North Carpenter Street; Stop Sign, stopping west and
eastbound traffic on West Madison Street at North Carpenter Street. Not
Recommended. West Madison Street is a minor arterial roadway with significantly
higher traffic volumes than North Carpenter Street, a local roadway. Stop on streets
with higher volumes such as West Madison Street tend to increase rear-end crashes,
increase congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every
vehicle will stop. Stop compliance is particularly low at T?intersections. Additionally,
due to this intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at West Madison Street and
West Morgan Street, a stop sign at North Carpenter Street will be unexpected for
drivers. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop Sign at this
intersection -- (18?02285512) [Or2018?376]

West Jackson Boulevard and South Sangamon Street; Stop Sign, Stopping eastbound
traffic on West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. West Jackson
Boulevard is a major collector roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than
South Sangamon Street a local roadway. Stop Signs on streets with higher volumes
such as West Jackson Boulevard tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Additionally, the 25th Ward has recently funded two curb extensions on the west
leg of West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. These bump-outs should
improve pedestrian safety by narrowing the crossing distance across West Jackson
Boulevard. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop Sign at this
location. The funded curb extensions at this intersection will improve pedestrian
visibility and safety (18-02284195) [Or2018-377]

recommend an All Way Stop Sign at this intersection -- (18-02284639) [Or2018-379]

North Sedgwick Street and West Goethe Street; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping All
Approaches [Or2018?394]

North Mason Avenue and West Washington Boulevard; All Way Stop Sign, Stopping
All Approaches. Not Recommended. West Washington Boulevard is a major collector
roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than North Mason Avenue, a one-way
northbound local roadway. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as West
Washington Boulevard tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and
create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Due to the
intersection's proximity to the traffic signal at North Austin Boulevard, at stop sign will
be unexpected for motorists. Therefore, CDOT does not recommend an All Way Stop
at this intersection -- (18-02064981) [Or2018?325]
