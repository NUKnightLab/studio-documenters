COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY ORDINANCE PROPOSED FILING FEE
INCREASE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Submitting a
Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by Carl R. Hansen, County
Commissioner.
The proposed amendment to the Cook County Law Library Ordinance will
increase the Law Library filing fee from $10.00 to $13.00. An increase in the
price of books has rendered the current $10.00 filing fee inadequate and
believe it is necessary to amend the Cook County Ordinance to utilize the
maximum $13.00 filing fee amount currently allowed by State statute.
It is estimated that said increase would result in an additional nine hundred
thousand dollars ($900,000.00) of revenue per year. Said estimate is based on
the average number of civil case filings in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
which has traditionally hovered around three hundred thousand filings per year.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
THE COOK COUNTY LAW LIBRARY ORDINANCE
(Chapter 8, Section 8-1)

members of the public.
The expense of establishing and maintaining such library shall be borne
by Cook County. To defray such expense, the Clerk of the Circuit Court
of Cook County shall charge and collect a County Law Library fee of
$10.00 $13.00, such fee to be paid at the time of filing the first pleading,
paper or other appearance filed by each party in all civil cases, but no
additional fee shall be required if more than one party is represented in a
single pleading, paper or other appearance.
The Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County shall commence such
charges and collections upon receipt of written notice from the County
Board President that the Cook County Board has acted to establish and
maintain such a law library.
Such fees shall be in addition to all other fees and charges of the Clerk of
the Circuit Court of Cook County, and assessable as costs, and shall be
remitted by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County monthly to the
Cook County Treasurer, and retained by the Treasurer in a special fund
designated as the County Law Library Fund . Disbursements from such
funds shall be by the Cook County Treasurer, on order of the County
Board. The President of the County Board, with the advise and consent
of the County Board, may appoint a Library Committee of not less than 9
members, who, by majority vote, may recommend to the County Board as
to disbursements of such fund and the operation of such library. Such
orders shall be pre-audited and such funds shall be audited by the Cook
County Auditor, and reports thereof rendered to the County Board .
SuGh ff.ees shall not be charged in any criminal or quasi-criminal cases, in
any matter coming to the clerk on change of venue, or in any proceeding
to review the decision of any administrative officer, agency, or body.
