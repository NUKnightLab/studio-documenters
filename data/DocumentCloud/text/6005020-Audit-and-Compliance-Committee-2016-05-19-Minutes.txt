 MCO Contract Features
• Rates typically set by Illinois Department of
Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) or Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
• Credentialing completed by CCHHS
• Claim reconciliation process favors MCO
• Operational requirements embedded in provider
manuals but tied to contract
• Pay for Performance (P4P) varies widely in terms
of reimbursement and effort required

 Challenges for CCHHS
MCO Information Flow
– National players; silos, communication delayed
– Staff that is forward facing often without knowledge, skills
to interface effectively
MCO Infrastructure Requirements
– MCOs downstream plan functions to provider groups and
require specific types of staff related to the administration
of those functions

7

Page 20 of 24

 CCHHS Completed Managed Care Activities
• Hired Director of Managed Care Operations
• Implemented Prior Authorization for
procedures requiring inpatient stay and
outpatient diagnostic testing
• HEDIS (Health Effectiveness Data Information
Set) workgroup formed to support pay for
performance
8

Page 21 of 24

Strategic Planning May 19, 2016

 Short-Term CCHHS Activities
Complete Infrastructure development
– Staffing of managed care department
– Vehicle for direct providers to understand
rules of road for major payers
– Develop new capabilities
• Utilization Management
• Claims payment
• Reporting
9

Page 22 of 24

Strategic Planning May 19, 2016

 Short-Term CCHHS Strategies
Develop systems, processes and tracking to improve performance
–
–
–
–

Increase P4P revenue 25%
Prior authorization for 90% of eligible procedures
Reduce denials for levels of care or lack of medical necessity
Determine additional ways to leverage existing infrastructure to
increase revenue e.g. eConsult, care coordination

Engage physicians

– Support prior authorization/concurrent review/quality activities
– Complete implementation of Care Management Workgroups

Develop wisdom

– Develop common understanding of what is an acceptable contract for
CCHHS
– Carefully consider arrangements that require significant infrastructure
investment without a clear understanding of upside potential
– Determine cost/benefit of pursuing expanded risk contracts

10

Page 23 of 24
Strategic Planning May 19, 2016

 CCHHS Long-Term Strategic
Recommendations
Compete on value

– Be able to demonstrate that CCHHS provides timely, effective
and efficient care in the most appropriate setting; easy to deal
with, responsive and understands managed care

Grow membership

– Support efforts at member retention, be the provider of choice
for the MCO, offer support to minimize transitions for members
impacted by network disruption.

Influence MCO strategy

– Seek membership on advisory councils, committees and serve
as pilot sites for new MCO programs
