INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 12, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
The mission of the Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education (“ROE”) is to be at the forefront
of education, serving the educational needs of Suburban Cook County residents. In cooperation with
other agencies the ROE initiates, refines, and facilitates state mandates and locally initiated
programs. The ROE services and provides leadership to administrators, teachers, students, parents, and
the educational community of 143 school districts.
In July of 2007, faced with a deficit, the new ROE administration moved forward but soon encountered
additional budgetary shortfalls. The ROE attempted to address their reduction in funding and the need for
additional operational dollars through the Illinois Funds: Local Government Short-term Loan Program,
however it was unsuccessful in its efforts to obtain additional funding from the State for its 2008 fiscal
year.
Pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, 5 ILCS 220/1 et. seq. and Article VII, Section 10 of
the Constitution of the State of Illinois, the Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education is
requesting a loan in the amount of $190,000.00 from Cook County to aid in funding ROE operations for
the remainder of its 2008 fiscal year. The Suburban Cook County Regional Office of Education has
committed to repaying the $190,000.00 loan back to Cook County on or before June 30, 2009.
Authorization to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Suburban Cook County Regional
Office of Education and authorize the use of County resources to provide the $190,000.00 loan is hereby
requested. The loan authorized under this Intergovernmental Agreement shall be made available through
funds in the 499-890 Account.

AUTOMATED BOARD AGENDA PROJECT
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 15, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
and
DAVID ORR, Cook County Clerk
President Todd H. Stroger is committed to applying technology to improve performance and create
efficiency in government. The Bureau of Technology’s Vision 2010 Strategic Plan sets forth the
guidelines for improvements.
In keeping with this Vision, the Office of the President and the County Clerk are developing a countywide
web-based Automated Board Agenda (ABA) application to be implemented in partnership with the
Bureau of Technology.
The ABA tool in development will allow authorized users to create and submit automatic transmittals for
inclusion on the County Board Agenda eliminating duplication of efforts and additional traffic on our
email and network systems resulting in a seamless and integrated agenda creation process, with shared
technology, from initiation to final product.
For this to be successful, all elected officials, bureaus and departments of Cook County government that
have business before the County Board must adopt the ABA system for processing agenda items.
Execution of the ABA is scheduled for the beginning of FY 2009 with the December 3, 2008 County
Board Meeting.
We are requesting to present a project overview and discuss technology requirements, training and
implementation at a meeting of the Committee on Information Technology & Automation.

In connection with any mandatory redemption of Notes as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Notes to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier

Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Notes shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the 60th day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if directed by the
Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Notes of such maturities in an amount not exceeding the amount

shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory redemption date.

multiples thereof, and Capital Appreciation Notes shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000
Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of less than all the Notes
of a Series of like maturity, the aggregate principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) thereof
to be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such
Note of such maturity a distinctive number for each $5,000 principal amount or Maturity Amount (as
appropriate) of such Note and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at
$5,000 for each number, shall equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such
Notes to be redeemed. The Notes to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so
selected; provided that only so much of the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each
Note shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so selected.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the Notes or portions of Notes selected
for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof
to be redeemed.
Unless waived by the owner of Notes to be redeemed or as otherwise provided in an Indenture for
Variable Rate Notes, notice of any such redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County
by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior
to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Note or Notes to be redeemed at the
address shown on the Note Register or at such other address as is furnished in writing by such registered
owners to the Trustee.
All notices of redemption shall include at least the information as follows:

(5) the place where such Notes are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption
price, which place of payment shall be the office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Notes are held by the Depository.
On or prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money sufficient to pay the redemption price of all the Notes or portions of Notes which are to be
redeemed on that date.
Notice of redemption having been given as provided therefore, the Notes or portions of Notes so
to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the redemption
price) such Notes or portions of Notes shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Note
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Note to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice.
Such notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Note, either before or after the
event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the
Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance
upon such waiver. Upon surrender of such Notes for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Notes shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date
shall be payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of
any Note, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Note or Notes of the same Stated
Maturity in the amount of the unpaid principal or Maturity Amount.
With respect to any redemption of Notes, unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of
the Notes to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Notes, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Notes will not be redeemed.
If any Note or portion of Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof
for redemption, in the case of Current Interest Notes, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate borne by the Note or portion of Note so called for redemption; in the case of
Variable Rate Notes, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a relevant Indenture; and,
in the case of Capital Appreciation Notes, the Compound Accreted Value at such redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Note, or portion thereof, so called for redemption. All Notes which have been redeemed
shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Notes being redeemed, each check or other transfer
of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by issue and maturity, the
Notes being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other transfer.
SECTION 6.

the Trustee, which is hereby constituted and appointed the Registrar of the County. The County is
authorized to prepare, and the Trustee shall keep custody of, multiple Note blanks executed by the County
for use in the transfer and exchange of Notes.
Subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Notes in Book Entry Form, upon surrender for
transfer of any Note at the office maintained for the purpose by the Trustee, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Trustee and
duly executed by, the registered owner or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing, the County shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, date and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees (a)
in the case of any Capital Appreciation Note, a new fully registered Capital Appreciation Note or Notes of
the same Series and of the same Stated Maturity of Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate
Original Principal Amount or (b) in the case of any Current Interest Note or Variable Rate Note, a new
fully registered Note or Notes of the same tenor, of the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of
Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate principal amount. Subject to the provisions of this
Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any Capital Appreciation Note or Notes may be exchanged at said
office of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like aggregate Original Principal Amount of Capital
Appreciation Note or Notes of the same maturity of other Authorized Denominations; and any fully
registered Current Interest Note or Notes or Variable Rate Note or Notes may be exchanged at said office
of the Trustee or its proper agent for a like aggregate principal amount of such Notes of the same tenor, of
the same interest rate and Stated Maturity, of other Authorized Denominations.
The execution by the County of any fully registered Note shall constitute full and due
authorization of such Note, and the Trustee or its proper agent shall thereby be authorized to authenticate,
date and deliver such Note in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance and of any Indenture.
The person in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Note shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability upon such Note to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.
No service charge shall be made for any transfer or exchange of Notes, but the County or the
Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Notes exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Note or Notes for the outstanding portion of a Note surrendered for redemption.

6386

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
If any Note, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Note of like date, maturity date, interest
rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Notes, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Notes) or principal amount (in the case of other
Notes) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any
mutilated Note, such mutilated Note shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and (b) in the case of any
lost Note or Note destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss or
destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, satisfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Note shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Note, the Trustee shall pay the same without
surrender thereof if there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction or
cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Note, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto.

NOTE FUND CREATED; PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, PREMIUM AND
INTEREST.

There is hereby created the “2008 Sales Tax Anticipation Note Fund” (the “Note Fund”), which
shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on and Maturity Amount of the Notes. The
Note Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated account by the Trustee. Accounts
within the Note Fund may be created by the Trustee as necessary for any series of Notes as specified in a
relevant Note Order or, for Variable Rate Notes, as provided in a relevant Indenture.
Incidental to each distribution by the State to the County of Sales Taxes, the Comptroller of the
County shall conduct an accounting (each, an “Accounting”) to determine the amount of Sales Taxes
necessary to pay the Current Debt Service Requirement and shall immediately transfer a fractional
amount of the interest becoming due on the next succeeding interest payment date on all of the Notes and
also a fractional amount of the principal becoming due or subject to mandatory redemption on the next
succeeding principal maturity or mandatory redemption date of all of the Notes until there shall have been
accumulated and held, in cash and investments, in the Note Fund in or before the month preceding such
maturity date of interest or maturity or mandatory redemption date of principal, an amount sufficient to
pay the Current Debt Service Requirement. It is hereby expressly provided that Sales Taxes not so
transferred to the Trustee for deposit into the Note Fund shall be available to the County for any lawful
corporate purpose and shall not be deemed to have been pledged hereunder to the payment of the Notes.

so advanced.
All moneys appropriated or used by the County for the payment of the principal or redemption
price of, and interest on, or Maturity Amount of, the Notes shall be paid to the Trustee. The Trustee shall
be accountable only for moneys actually so deposited with the Trustee.
The County Treasurer is hereby expressly authorized and directed to do, or cause to be done, all

Note Fund any and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might become a lien or charge upon the

impair the security of the Notes. Nothing herein contained shall require the County to make any
such payment so long as the County in good faith shall contest the validity of said claims.

separate from all other records and accounts of the County, in which complete and correct entries
shall be made of all transactions relating to the Note Moneys and the Note Fund.

demands of all persons. From and after the sale and delivery of any of the Notes by the County,
the Notes shall be incontestable by the County.
F. The County will adopt, make, execute and deliver any and all such further
ordinances, resolutions, instruments and assurances as may be reasonably necessary or proper to
carry out the intention of, or to facilitate the performance of, this Ordinance, and for the better
assuring and confirming unto the registered owners of the Notes of the rights and benefits
provided in this Ordinance.

apply the Sales Taxes as provided herein to the Note Fund. The County covenants and agrees
with the purchasers of the Notes and with the registered owners thereof that so long as any Notes

County and its officers will comply with all present and future applicable laws in order to assure
that the Sales Taxes may be collected and deposited into the Note Fund as provided herein.
H. The Outstanding Notes shall be and forever remain until paid or defeased the

Dated Date to the date of their issuance. The Notes may be sold from time to time as the Chief Financial
Officer shall determine that the proceeds of such sales are needed. Nothing contained in this Ordinance
shall limit the sale of the Notes or any maturity or maturities thereof at a price or prices in excess of the
principal amount thereof. Nothing in this Section shall require the Chief Financial Officer to sell any of
the Notes if in her judgment, aided by the County’s financial advisors, the conditions in the Note markets
shall have deteriorated from the time of adoption hereof or the sale of all or any portion of the Notes shall
for some other reason not be deemed advisable, but the Chief Financial Officer shall have the authority to
sell the Notes in any event so long as the limitations set forth in this Ordinance and the conditions of this
Section shall have been met.
Subsequent to each such sale of the Notes, the Chief Financial Officer shall file in the office of
the County Clerk a Note Order directed to the Corporate Authorities identifying (i) the terms of the sale,
(ii) the amount of the Notes, if any, being sold as Capital Appreciation Notes, Convertible CANs or

Accreted Value of each such Capital Appreciation Note on each compounding date, (ix) the interest rate
or rates on any Current Interest Notes sold, or, in the case of any Series of Variable Rate Notes the
estimated interest rate for such Variable Rate Notes and a description (which shall be in the relevant
Indenture therefore) of the methods of determining the interest rate applicable to such Variable Rate
Notes from time to time and the identity of any remarketing agent retained in connection with the
issuance of Variable Rate Notes, (x) the identity of the Purchasers, (xi) the identify of any Insurer,

execute a note purchase contract for the sale of the Notes to the Purchasers (the “Note Purchase
Contract”) in the form approved by the attorney for the County. The authority granted in this Ordinance

promissory note shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding 18 percent per annum. The President or the
Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to execute and deliver each such reimbursement agreement,
under the seal of the County affixed and attached by the County Clerk.

Financial Officer determines such Note insurance to be desirable in connection with such sale of the
Notes or any portion thereof. The President or Chief Financial Officer is hereby expressly authorized, on

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
The President or the Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to execute and deliver from
time to time one or more agreements with counterparties selected by the Chief Financial Officer, the

moneys, receipts, income, assets or funds of the County available for such purpose or be payable from the
sources pledged to the payment of the Notes, as the Chief Financial Officer may from time to time
determine. Such amounts shall not constitute an indebtedness of the County for which its full faith and
credit is pledged. Nothing contained in this Section shall limit or restrict the authority of the President or
the Chief Financial Officer to enter into similar agreements pursuant to prior or subsequent authorization
of the Corporate Authorities.
SECTION 12.

CREATION OF FUNDS AND APPROPRIATIONS.

A.
Accrued interest, capitalized interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the
Notes shall be deposited into the Note Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Notes.
The Sales Taxes shall either be deposited into the Note Fund as hereinabove provided and be used
solely and only for paying the principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount of the Notes or be used to
reimburse a fund or account from which advances to the Note Fund may have been made to pay principal
of or interest on or Maturity Amount of the Notes prior to receipt of Sales Taxes. Interest income or
investment profit earned in the Note Fund shall be retained in the Note Fund for payment of the principal

hereby expressly continued, and designated as the “Working Cash Fund” (the “Project Fund”). The
Project Fund may further be divided into accounts and designated the “Series ______ Notes Project
Account”(an “Account”). The Project Fund shall be held and maintained as a separate and segregated
account by the Trustee. Moneys in the Project Fund may be withdrawn or may be transferred to the
Project Fund by the County to pay the costs of the Project upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer
or any other employee of the County designated by the Chief Financial Officer.

6399

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Notes to one or more
related Project funds or accounts of the County already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not
relieve the County and such officer of the duty to account for the proceeds as if such Project Fund or
Account were created as herein provided. The County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as it
becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of such Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute other
lawful corporate purpose projects, in order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the
provisions of the Act and to the tax covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest
on Tax Exempt Notes.
C.
The sum necessary, as determined by the Chief Financial Officer, of the principal
proceeds of the Notes shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby created, to be known
as the “Expense Fund” (the “Expense Fund”) and shall be disbursed by the Trustee upon the delivery of
the Notes or be used by the County to pay costs of issuance of the Notes in accordance with normal
County disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the credit of the Expense Fund on the date
which is three months following the date of delivery of the Notes shall be transferred to the County
Treasurer for deposit into such fund or account of the County as the Chief Financial Officer may direct.
D.
The moneys on deposit in the Note Fund may be invested from time to time in Qualified
Investments. Any such investments may be sold from time to time by the Trustee without further
direction from the County as moneys may be needed for the purposes for which the Note Fund has been
created. The moneys on deposit in the Project Fund shall be invested in any lawful investment for County
funds. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall direct the Trustee (which direction may be by
facsimile transmission by the County to the Trustee and confirmed by facsimile transmission by the
Trustee to the County) to sell such investments when necessary to remedy any deficiency in the Note
Fund, the Project Fund or any accounts created therein. All other investment earnings shall be attributed
to the account for which the investment was made.
E. All moneys (not including securities) held by the Trustee subject to the provisions of this
Section may be deposited by it, on demand or time deposit, in its banking department or with such banks,
national banking associations, trust companies, savings banks or savings and loan associations, that are
members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as may be designated by the President or the Chief
Financial Officer. No such moneys shall be deposited with any such financial institution in an amount
exceeding 50 percent of the amount that an officer of such financial institution shall certify to the Trustee
and the Chief Financial Officer as the combined capital and surplus of such financial institution. No such
moneys shall be deposited or remain on deposit with any such financial institution in excess of the
amount insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, unless (a) such financial
institution shall have lodged with the trust department of the Trustee or with a Federal Reserve Bank or
branch or, with the written approval of the Trustee and the Chief Financial Officer, pledged to some other
financial institution for the benefit of the County and the holders of Notes, as collateral security for the
moneys deposited, Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations having a market value (exclusive of
accrued interest) at least equal to 100 percent of the amount of such moneys, and (b) the Trustee shall
have a perfected first lien in the Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations serving as collateral, and such
Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations shall be free from all third party liens. The Trustee shall
allow and credit interest on any such moneys held by it at such rate as it customarily allows upon similar
funds of similar size and under similar conditions or as required by law. Interest in respect of moneys or
on securities in any fund shall be credited in each case to the fund in which such moneys or securities are
held.

6400

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
F. The County may invest any moneys in a repurchase agreement. Each repurchase agreement
shall meet the requirements of the Public Funds Investment Act of the State of Illinois, as amended, or be
secured by Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations or obligations described in clause (d) of the
definition of Qualified Investments having a market value, marked to market weekly, at least equal to 102
percent of the amount invested in the repurchase agreement plus accrued interest. The Trustee shall at all
times have a first lien in such Federal Obligations or Agency Obligations perfected (i) by possession of
certificated securities held by the Trustee or held by a third party acting on behalf of the Trustee if the
Trustee is providing the collateral securities, or (ii) under the book-entry procedures specified in 31 Code
of Federal Regulations 306.1 et seq. or 31 Code of Federal Regulations 350.0 et seq. The President or the

repurchase agreement authorized by this Ordinance, and any additional documents as shall be necessary
to accomplish the purposes of any such agreement.
G.
Other funds or accounts appropriate for Variable Rate Notes, such as a purchase fund to
accommodate demands for purchase of such Notes and the remarketing of same to other Note owners,
may be created in the Indenture.
SECTION 13.

GENERAL TAX COVENANTS.

A.
Not Private Activity Bonds. None of the Tax Exempt Notes is a “private activity bond” as
defined in Section 141(a) of the Code. In support of such conclusion, the County certifies, represents and
covenants as follows:
1. No more than five percent of the sale proceeds of each Series of Tax Exempt Notes, each
considered separately, plus investment earnings thereon, will be used, directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part, in any activity carried on by any person other than a state or local governmental unit.
2. The payment of more than five percent of the principal of or the interest on each Series of
the Tax Exempt Notes, each considered separately, will not be, used, directly or indirectly (i) secured by
any interest in (A) property used or to be used in any activity carried on by any person other than a state
or local governmental unit or (B) payments in respect of such property or (ii) on a present value basis,
derived from payments in respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used in any activity
carried on by any person other than a state or local governmental unit.
3. No more than the lesser of five percent of the sale proceeds of each Series of the Tax
Exempt Notes and investment earnings thereon or $5,000,000 will be or was used, directly or indirectly,
to make or finance loans to any persons.

other than a state or local governmental unit will use more than five percent of the Infrastructure, in the
aggregate, on any basis other than the same basis as the general public; and no person other than a state or
local governmental unit will be a user of more than five percent of the Infrastructure, in the aggregate, as
a result of (i) ownership, (ii) actual or beneficial use pursuant to a lease or a management, service,
incentive payment, research or output contract, or (iii) any other similar arrangement, agreement or
understanding, whether written or oral.
5. The County has not and will not enter into any arrangement that conveys to any person,
other than a state or local government unit, special legal entitlements to any portion of the Infrastructure
that is available for use by the general public. No person, other than a state or local governmental unit, is
receiving or will receive any special economic benefit from use of any portion of the Infrastructure that is
not available for use by the general public.

6401

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
B.

Pertaining to Rebate.

The County further certifies and covenants as follows with respect to the requirements of
Section 148(f) of the Code, relating to the rebate of “excess arbitrage profits” (the “Rebate Requirement”)
to the United States:
1. Unless an applicable exception to the Rebate Requirement is available to the County will
meet the Rebate Requirement.
2. Relating to applicable exceptions, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to make
such elections under the Code as either such officer shall deem reasonable and in the best interests of the
County. If such election may result in a “penalty in lieu of rebate” as provided in the Code, and such
penalty is incurred (the “Penalty”), then the County shall pay such Penalty.
3. The Designated Officers may cause to be established, at such time and in such manner as
they may deem necessary or appropriate hereunder, a “2002 General Obligation Notes Rebate [or Penalty,
if applicable] Fund” (the “148 Compliance Fund”) for the Tax Exempt Notes, and such officers shall
further, not less frequently than annually, cause to be transferred to the 148 Compliance Fund the amount
determined to be the accrued liability under the Rebate Requirement or Penalty. Said Designated Officers
shall cause to be paid to the U.S., without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from
time to time as required, amounts sufficient to meet the Rebate Requirement or to pay the Penalty.
4. Interest earnings in the Note Fund and the Project Fund are hereby authorized to be
transferred, without further order or direction from the Corporate Authorities, from time to time as
required, to the 148 Compliance Fund for the purposes herein provided; and proceeds of the Tax Exempt
Notes and other funds of the County are also hereby authorized to be used to meet the Rebate
Requirement or to pay the Penalty, but only if necessary after application of investment earnings as
aforesaid and only as appropriated by the Corporate Authorities.
SECTION 14.

REGISTERED FORM.

The County recognizes that Section 149 of the Code requires Tax Exempt obligations to be issued
and to remain in fully registered form in order to be and remain Tax Exempt. In this connection, the
County agrees that it will not take any action to permit Tax Exempt Notes to be issued in, or converted
into, bearer or coupon form.
SECTION 15.

FURTHER TAX-EXEMPTION COVENANTS.

The County agrees to comply with all provisions of the Code which, if not complied with by the
County, would cause Tax Exempt Notes not to be Tax Exempt. In furtherance of the foregoing
provisions, but without limiting their generality, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such
further specific covenants, representations as shall be truthful, and assurances as may be necessary or
advisable; (b) to comply with all representations, covenants and assurances contained in certificates or
agreements as may be prepared by Bond Counsel; (c) to consult with Bond Counsel and to comply with
such advice as may be given; (d) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be
required and in a timely manner; and (e) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and
pay fiscal agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance.

6402

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
The County also certifies and further covenants with the Purchasers and registered owners of the
Tax Exempt Notes from time to time outstanding that moneys on deposit in any fund or account in
connection with the Tax Exempt Notes, whether or not such moneys were derived from the proceeds of
the sale of the Tax Exempt Notes or from any other source, will not be used in a manner which will cause
the Tax Exempt Notes to be “arbitrage bonds” within the meaning of Code Section 148 and any lawful
regulations promulgated thereunder, as the same presently exist or may from time to time hereafter be
amended, supplemented or revised.
The County further covenants that it will not take any action, or omit to take any action or permit
the taking or omission of any action within its control (including, without limitation, making or permitting
any use of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Notes) if taking, permitting or omitting to take such action
would cause any Tax Exempt Note to be a private activity bond within the meaning of the Code or would
otherwise cause interest on the Tax Exempt Notes to be included in the gross income of the recipients
thereof for federal income tax purposes.
SECTION 16.

REIMBURSEMENT.

None of the proceeds of the Tax Exempt Notes will be used to pay, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, for an expenditure that has been paid by the County prior to the date hereof except
architectural, engineering costs or construction costs incurred prior to commencement of any of the
Projects or expenditures for which an intent to reimburse was properly declared under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.150-2. This Ordinance is in itself a declaration of official intent under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.150-2 as to all costs of the 2008 Cash Management Project paid after the date
hereof and prior to issuance of the Notes.
SECTION 17.

OPINION OF COUNSEL EXCEPTION.

The County reserves the right to use or invest moneys in connection with the Notes in any
manner, notwithstanding the tax-related covenants set forth in Sections 13 through 16 herein, provided,
that it shall first have received an opinion from Bond Counsel, or, in the event Bond Counsel is unable or
unwilling to provide such opinion, then from an attorney or a firm of attorneys of nationally recognized
standing as bond counsel, to the effect that such use or investment as contemplated is valid and proper
under applicable law and this Ordinance and that such use or investment will not adversely affect the Tax
Exempt status of the Tax Exempt Notes.
SECTION 18.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING.

If required, any Designated Officer is hereby authorized to execute and deliver one or more
Continuing Disclosure Undertakings, each in customary form, to effect compliance with Rule 15c2-12
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. When
any Continuing Disclosure Undertaking is executed and delivered on behalf of the County, it will be
binding on the County and the officers, agents, and employees of the County, and the same are hereby
authorized and directed to do all such acts and things and to execute all such documents as may be
necessary to carry out and comply with the provisions of such Continuing Disclosure Undertaking as
executed and delivered. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the sole remedies for failure to
comply with any Continuing Disclosure Undertaking shall be the ability of the beneficial owner of any
Note to seek mandamus or specific performance by court order, to cause to the County to comply with its
obligations thereunder.

Variable Rate Notes shall be subject to payment, provision for payment and defeasance as
provided in a relevant Indenture. Current Interest Notes and Capital Appreciation Notes may be
discharged, payment provided for, and the County’s liability terminated as follows:
(a)
Discharge of Indebtedness. If (i) the County shall pay or cause to be paid to the
registered owners of the Notes the principal, premium, if any, and interest, in the case of Current
Interest Notes, and the Maturity Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Notes, to become
due thereon at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and herein, (ii) all fees and expenses
of the Trustee shall have been paid, and (iii) the County shall keep, perform and observe all and
singular the covenants and promises in the Notes and in this Ordinance expressed as to be kept,
performed and observed by it or on its part, then these presents and the rights hereby granted shall

Amount, in the case of Capital Appreciation Notes, to become due thereon at the times and in the
manner stipulated therein and herein, such Notes shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or
security under the Ordinance, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the County to the
holders of such Notes shall thereupon cease, terminate and become void and discharged and

Provision for Payment. Notes for the payment or redemption or prepayment of
which sufficient monies or sufficient Defeasance Obligations shall have been deposited with the
Trustee or an escrow agent having fiduciary capaCounty (whether upon or prior to the maturity or

Ordinance and no longer outstanding under this Ordinance; provided, however, that if such Notes
are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall have been duly
given as provided in this Ordinance or arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
made for the giving thereof. Defeasance Obligations shall be considered sufficient only if said
investments mature and bear interest in such amounts and at such times as will assure sufficient
cash to pay currently maturing interest, principal or Maturity Amount, as applicable, and
redemption premiums if any when due on the Notes without rendering the interest on any Notes
taxable under the Code.
The County may at any time surrender to the Trustee for cancellation by it any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder, which the County may have acquired in any manner whatsoever,
and such Notes, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be paid and retired.
(c)
Termination of County’s Liability. Upon the discharge of indebtedness under
paragraph (a) hereof, or upon the deposit with the Trustee of sufficient money and Defeasance
Obligations (such sufficiency being determined as provided in paragraph (b) hereof) for the

Notes shall cease, determine and be completely discharged and the holders thereof shall thereafter
be entitled only to payment out of the money and the proceeds of the Defeasance Obligations
deposited with aforesaid for their payment.

DUTIES OF TRUSTEE.

(a) Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Notes, the Trustee shall

(b) Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Notes, the Trustee need
perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in this Ordinance and no others. In the absence of
bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the

conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance. However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates
and opinions to determine whether they conform to the requirements of this Ordinance.

(2)
the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a
responsible officer of the Trustee, unless it is proved that the Trustee was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts,
(3)
no provision of this Ordinance shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder
or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing
that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably
assured to it.
(d) Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Notes, every provision of
this Ordinance that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to all the paragraphs of this Section.
(e) Subject to a different provision in an Indenture for Variable Rate Notes, the Trustee may

not be liable for interest on any cash held by it except as the Trustee may agree with the County or as set

paying agent may do the same with like rights.
SECTION 24.

TRUSTEE’S DISCLAIMER.

The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Ordinance or the
Notes; it shall not be accountable for the County’s use of the proceeds from the Notes paid to the County,
and it shall not be responsible for any statement in the Notes other than its certificate of authentication.
SECTION 25.

ELIGIBILITY OF TRUSTEE.

This Ordinance and any Indenture shall always have a Trustee that is a commercial bank with
trust powers or a trust company organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any
state or the District of Columbia, is authorized under such laws and the laws of the State to exercise
corporate trust powers and is subject to supervision or examination by United States or State authority. If

pursuant to any Tax Agreement;
(3)

All such monies shall be applied as follows:

(A)
first, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of
interest on Outstanding Notes then due, in the order of the maturity of such installments,
and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular
installment, then to the payment ratably, according to the amounts due on such
installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference;
(B)
second, to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid
principal or then current Compound Accreted Value of and premium, if any, on any of
the Outstanding Notes which shall have become due (other than Notes matured or called
for redemption for the payment of which monies are held pursuant to the provisions of
this Ordinance), in the order of their due dates, with interest upon such Outstanding
Current Interest Notes from the respective dates upon which they became due, and, if the
amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Outstanding Notes due on any
particular date, together with such premium, then to the payment ratably according to the

the time of application by the Trustee. Whenever the Trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying
such funds, it shall fix the date (which shall be an interest payment date unless the Trustee shall deem

RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
WHEREAS, HR 3887 as introduced and passed with only two dissents in the U.S. House of
Representatives, introduces a cohesive legal framework for fighting trafficking by combining and
streamlining efforts against the international and domestic sale of human beings; and

6425

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
WHEREAS, HR 3887 constitutionally targets the demand for international trafficking by directly
addressing the networks that buy and sell women and children for commercial sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 removes a barrier to effective prosecutions against traffickers by making “force,
fraud and coercion” part of aggravated trafficking rather than a requirement for all convictions; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 makes exporting sexual exploiters to other countries (“sex-tourism”) as significant
a crime as importing victims for sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 as drafted and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, will assist many
victims of trafficking and the sex trade in Cook County; in Chicago alone, 16,000 – 25,000 women and
girls are involved in prostitution every year; this bill will enhance legal options on a federal level to help
stem a significant piece of why so many women and children are forced into the sex trade in Chicago and
Cook County: the pimps and traffickers; and
WHEREAS, in October of 2007, the Cook County Commission on Women’s Issues released the report,
“The Realities of Trafficking” in Cook County that documented the scope of the problem in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, sixty-two percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois were first pimped out before
they were 18 and one third of women and girls in prostitution first become involved before age 15; many
adult women in Illinois are also trafficked and pimped by third parties who financially profit from
keeping them in prostitution; the majority of these adult women would face violence if they did not give
the money they make in the sex trade to these third parties; and
WHEREAS, pimps and traffickers do not always use force, fraud or coercion to bring adult women into
prostitution, but pimping and trafficking is always unlawful, and it is virtually always practiced on
previously harmed, notably vulnerable and objectively disempowered women; and
WHEREAS, seventy-five percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois are survivors of sexual
assault, most of multiple rapes and sixty-six percent are victims of incest; and
WHEREAS, fifty percent of women and girls in prostitution are homeless; often trading sex is the only
means of survival for these women and girls; pimps and traffickers often exploit these economic
hardships to maintain adults and children in prostitution; many traffickers and pimps profit from the
commercial sexual exploitation while the women and children trafficked remain poor.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby condemn the trafficking of human beings and support efforts to prosecute those who profit from
the exploitation of women and children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby
commend the U.S. House of Representatives and the Cook County delegation for their leadership in
expanding federal anti-trafficking legislation so that it more accurately represents the experiences of
victims in Cook County and expands the ability of federal prosecutors to bring domestic traffickers to
justice; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby urge
United State Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to support HR 3887 and the United States
Senate to pass the measure without modification; and

6426

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008

COMMEMORATING THE BERWYN CENTENNIAL
WHEREAS, the city now known as Berwyn began when two attorneys and land developers, Charles E.
Piper and Wilbur J. Andrews purchased 106 acres from the Field syndicate for the development near the
Chicago Burlington & Quincy Railroad tracks in 1890; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Piper and Mr. Andrews built a train station at Oak Park Avenue after the railroad had
refused to build one; and
WHEREAS, the railroad did agree to stop at the station, which was named Berwyn after an affluent
suburb of Philadelphia that Piper and Andrews hoped to replicate in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, a general store and an office building were soon constructed, followed by a small post
office; and
WHEREAS, homes quickly followed and gradually, eight miles of streets were macadamized and
sidewalks were laid; and

6427

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
WHEREAS, around this same time another community one and a half miles north of the one developed
by Piper and Andrews was developing on the north side of present day Berwyn, aided by “Honest John”
Kelly; and
WHEREAS, this area was known as South Oak Park and extended from Roosevelt Road to 16th Street
and from Ridgeland to Harlem; and
WHEREAS, the two areas were connected only by two dirt roads, Oak Park Avenue and Ridgeland
Avenue did not have matching street names and had their own churches, stores clubs and public
transportation; and
WHEREAS, at the turn of the century, the Oak Park-River Forest School District set its boundaries at
Roosevelt Road, thus eliminating north Berwyn families and severing the tie between Berwyn and Oak
Park; and
WHEREAS, in 1901 residents of the north turned southward and joined together with the town of
Berwyn; and
WHEREAS, Berwyn was incorporated as a village in 1902, and became a city on June 6, 1908, receiving
its official charter from the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, in the years which followed, Berwyn continued to grow and attract new residents who were
drawn to Berwyn by the safety and stability of the community and overall high quality of life Berwyn had
to offer its residents; and
WHEREAS, June 6, 2008 marks the 100th Anniversary of Berwyn becoming a city.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby congratulate the people and leaders of Berwyn on their 100th Anniversary as a
city, and wish Berwyn continued success in the future as it celebrates its rich and varied past; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be presented to the Mayor and
the Aldermen of the City of Berwyn in honor of the Berwyn Centennial.

DOCKET #8308 – J. PETITO, Owner, Application (No. V-07-78): Variation to reduce
north side yard setback from 10 feet to 2 feet 6 inches for a one story attached garage
addition in the R-5 Single Family Residence District. At the present time the applicant is

54 feet south of Gregory Street in Norwood Park Township, County Board District #9.

Two (2) neighbors spoke against allowing a 2 feet 6 inches side yard
setback stating that this was not the trend of development in this
neighborhood, although there are two-car garages, but none of them
come within 2 feet 6 inches of the lot line.

ambiguous and contradictory on the issue of measuring height in the absence of curbs;
and
WHEREAS, due to this oversight significant grade changes have become an ongoing
problem in unincorporated Cook County going forth relatively unfettered by County
Ordinance; and

contradictory language by clarifying the manner in which building height is measured
when there is no curb present.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the Cook County Building Code be amended as follows:
BUILDING CODE
ARTICLE III RULES AND DEFINITIONS
Building Height: is the vertical distance measured from the curb level or its equivalent
opposite the center existing lot grade five feet in front of the center of the front of the
building, to the highest point of the under side of the ceiling beams in the case of a flat
roof; to the deck line of a mansard roof; and the mean level of the under side of the
rafters between the highest eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip, shed, gambrel, or any
other pitched roof. Where no curb level has been established the height of a building shall
be measured from the mean elevation of the existing lot grade at the front of the building.
*Referred to the Committee on Zoning & Building on 06/03/08.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(1), Commissioner Goslin, seconded by

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 17, 2008
Reason:

This request will allow sufficient time for the rebid, award and implementation of the
new contract for which bids are tentatively scheduled to be open on June 25, 2008.
Implementation of a new contract for this service has been delayed due to bids which
have been rejected for exceeding the budgeted amount for this service, or for not meeting
specifications set in the bid documents.
The services under this extension and the contract to be awarded through the bid process
will be needed until Cook County purchases and installs a remote control camera system
for the Board Room, eliminating the need for leasing traditional television cameras and
related equipment.
Savings from the elimination of this service will be applied toward an expansion of the
planned County Board Webcasting Project. This project will result in live webcasts of
County Board Meetings, as well as archived audio and video of previous meetings
available through the Secretary to the Board of Commissioners website. The expiration
of the current contract was May 31, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $40,530.00 Contract extension: June 1, 2008 through November 30, 2008.
(018-224 Account).
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,

Program in the Criminal Division, Circuit Court of Cook County. TASC will provide screening,

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM (HOME)
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 23, 2008 from
DEBORAH J. FORTIER, Acting MAURICE S. JONES, Director, Department of Planning and
Development
Re: HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME)
Consortium Qualification Period
Federal Fiscal Years 2009, 2010 and 2011
transmitting herewith is the recommended HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) Consortium
Agreement. Under the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (“HUD’s”)
HOME Program, local governments are able to join together to form a “consortium” in order to receive
HOME funding for affordable housing. Forming a consortium creates a unique opportunity for local
governments to take a more collaborative approach to meeting the housing needs of its communities. The
local governments join together as a consortium for the purpose of receiving the HOME allocation and
administering the HOME program as a single participating jurisdiction.
The County of Cook, the City of Berwyn, the City of Chicago Heights and the Town of Cicero have
joined together to form a consortium. The parties must execute a HOME Investment Partnership
Consortium Agreement. Cook County, as the lead entity would be responsible for ensuring the
consortium compliance with all HOME Program rules and reporting to HUD.
A HOME Consortium must seek renewal once every three (3) years. During the 2005 Consortium
qualification period, the County of Cook, the City of Berwyn, the City of Chicago Heights and the Town
of Cicero also joined together to form a consortium.
Pursuant to HUD’s HOME Consortia Notice (CPD 08-01), the State of Illinois is required to provide a
written certification that the consortium will direct its activities to the alleviation of housing problems
with the State. The Consortium Agreement, the state certification and other required documents, must be
submitted to HUD by June 30, 2008.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended HOME Investment Partnership Consortium
Agreement and I, or the Chief of the Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities Management, or his
designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the program approved herein, including, but not limited to, agreements, letters, amendments and
modifications.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $589,875.00, Contract No. 06-41-694
with AMCAD, LLC, Herndon, Virginia, for conversion of back file microfilm.

Reason:

$1,966,250.00
(589,875.00)
589,875.00
$2,556,125.00 1,966,250.00

The Recorder of Deeds Office wants to correct the amount so as to accurately reflect the
dollar amount. The incorrect language that appeared in the fourth (4th) amendment of
contract should not have resulted in a decrease of $589,875.00. The intention was to
reference the 5th and final payment amount of the contract. The deleted amount of
$589,875.00 must be restored, in order to ensure full implementation of the contract
pursuant to the revised contract agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $589,875.00. (527-579 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the County Recorder Document Storage System Fund.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to increase the requested contract.
Following discussion, Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to correct the

Following further discussion, Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to defer
consideration of Contract No. 06-41-694 with AMCAD, LLC to the July 1, 2008 Board meeting. The
motion carried unanimously.
