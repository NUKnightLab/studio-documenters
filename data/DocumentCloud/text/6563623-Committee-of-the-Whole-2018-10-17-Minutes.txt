challenges that behavioral health/substance abuse clients and the faith community face in Cuyahoga County. Responses
to the RFP will address promoting spirituality, health and wellness, prevention/intervention activities, fighting stigma, and/or
building individual’s and our community’s resiliency to help participants achieve positive change.
Ms. Sizemore-Rice noted that the 2018 Faith-based Initiative Program exceeded the goal of reaching 1,480 individuals by

activities. To address input received at the recent Interfaith Community Forum, Board member, Elsie Caraballo, suggested

6. AUTHORIZING COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS (COG) SERVICE ORGANIZATION CONTROL (SOC) AUDIT
Scott Osiecki, C.E.O., explained that the Service Organization Control Audit is a shared expense for the COG. During the
review of COG operations, in conjunction with the annual audits of the three member boards of the COG, the State Auditor
requested the completion of a Service Organization Control (SOC) audit. The SOC audit will closely examine internal
controls within the SHARES system. The COG is seeking to contract for the completion of a Service Organization Control
(SOC) Audit with Clark Schaefer Hackett, CPA’s and Advisors.
Felicia Harrison, Chief Financial Officer, noted that the SOC Audit will evaluate and report on the design of internal controls
within SHARES and perform tests on the operational effectiveness of these controls. The consultant for the SOC Audit will
be engaged by the COG on behalf of the members of the COG. The cost of the SOC audit will be equally shared between
the three boards that make up the Council of Governments; the cost for the ADAMHS Board of Cuyahoga County is not to
exceed $40,000.00.
Motion to recommend authorization of COG Service Organization Control (SOC) Audit to the full Board.

 Committee of the Whole Minutes

October 17, 2018

Contracts
a. Ohio Mental Health & Addiction Services (OhioMHAS) Grant Funding for Psychotropic Drug Reimbursement
(Pass-Thru Funding)
- Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department - $6,576.00
b. Cuyahoga County Invest in Children (IIC): Diagnostic Classification for Ages 0-5 (DC: 0-5) Training for Early
Childhood Mental Health (ECMH) Contract Agencies
- Zero to Three - $17,800.00
Amendment:
a. Amendment to Resolution No. 17-10-05 – Approval of Community Capital Assistance Application
- The Briermost Foundation - $12,326.00 Increase
Mr. Snider addressed a decision of Cleveland Municipal Judge Michael Nelson who has decided not to set bonds for criminal
defendants unless charged with violent crimes to the Cuyahoga County Jail due to six recent inmate deaths. Mr. Snider
asked if we can find out whether these individuals might have been under treatment for mental illness and/or addictions.
Dr. Boehm felt that this question is very relevant. Mr. Osiecki and Maggie Tolbert, Assistant Chief Clinical Officer, provided
information about their efforts to work with the jail on this and other issues.
Ms. Tolbert noted that this is a complicated issue as the County Jail is managed by one entity that has interactions with the
courts. MetroHealth Medical Center has oversight of the medical portion of the jail but not the nurses who report to the
County Sheriff in charge of the jail. In the meantime, Judge Nelson has taken a stand that he will not send low level
offenders to the County Jail for now. Mr. Osiecki clarified that clients who are offenders are not probated to the Board;
therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction. Based upon the discussion, Board members requested that the meeting
minutes reflect their concern about the welfare of the inmates at the County Jail.
Motion to recommend approval of Contracts and Amendments (as listed above) to the full Board. MOTION: R. Blue
SECOND: S. Killpack / AYES: R. Blue, G. Boehm, E. Cade, E. Caraballo, R. Fowler, B. Gohlstin, K. Kern-Pilch, S. Killpack,
M. Rodas, H. Snider / NAYS: None / ABSTAIN: None / Motion passed.
9. IDENTIFY CONSENT AGENDA
Rev. Gohlstin identified the following elements to include into the Consent Agenda: (1) Acceptance of Board Voucher and
Expenditure Reports, Contracts, and Amendments.
10. POLICY STATEMENT RENEWALS
Bob Garrity, Director of Risk Management, highlighted the changes made to the following policy statements:
 GUIDELINES FOR DETOXIFICATION SERVICES FUNDED WITH NON-MEDICAID DOLLARS
Motion to recommend approval of the Policy Statement – Guidelines for Detoxification Services Funded with NonMedicaid Dollars to the full Board. MOTION: E. Caraballo / SECOND: R. Blue / AYES: R. Blue, G. Boehm, E. Cade,
E. Caraballo, R. Fowler, B. Gohlstin, K. Kern-Pilch, S. Killpack, M. Rodas, H. Snider / NAYS: None / ABSTAIN: None
Motion passed.
 PURCHASING POLICY
Mr. Snider referenced page 4 of the policy and questioned the change that doubles the amount of $25,000 to $50,000 as
the amount for a one-time purchase of supplies, equipment or services that does not require ADAMHS Board approval. He
asked (a) for the governing statute that permits this change and (b) if there is such a policy, why do we vote on sponsorships
that may be $1,000 or $500?
Mr. Garrity noted that the competitive bidding statute is ORC: §307.86. Mr. Osiecki explained that OACBHA (Ohio
Association of County Behavioral Healthcare Authorities) favored this change to support some Boards in the state that
experience difficulty in gathering its membership to vote on a specific expenditure.

 Committee of the Whole Minutes

October 17, 2018

Regarding our Board’s practice of bringing sponsorships before the Board, the Sponsorship Policy provides a process to
evaluate sponsorship requests for their appropriateness for the ADAMHS Board to be recognized as a sponsor. Despite
the revised ORC statute, Mr. Snider noted his objection to the amount increase for one-time purchases.
Based upon the discussion, Mr. Osiecki noted that the statement in the Purchasing Policy regarding Procurement Methods
could be revised to reflect that although the Ohio Revised Code Section 307.86 does not require competitive bidding for
one-time purchase of goods, equipment, or services under $50,000.00, the ADAMHS Board will still require purchases to
be approved if in excess of $25,000.00.
Dr. Fowler noted that the policy does not specifically mention the awarding of a contract. Discussion followed on the
rationale for a RFI (Request for Information) and a RFP (Request for Proposal). Based upon Dr. Fowler’s input, Rev.
Gohlstin noted that he had no objection to clarifying the process regarding the awarding of contracts further in this policy.
Motion to recommend approval of renewing the Purchasing Policy with suggested modifications to the full Board.
MOTION: R. Blue / SECOND: K. Kern-Pilch / AYES: R. Blue, G. Boehm, E. Cade, E. Caraballo, R. Fowler, B. Gohlstin,
K. Kern-Pilch, S. Killpack, M. Rodas, H. Snider / NAYS: None / ABSTAIN: None / Motion passed.
11. PRESENTATION OF CY2019 ADAMHS BOARD BUDGET
Mr. Osiecki acknowledged the hard work and efforts of staff to compile the information contained in the CY2019 Funding
Book binders distributed. He summarized the cover letter that identified the content of the binders as a first working draft of
the Calendar Year 2019 funding recommendations as a proposal for Board member’s consideration. The draft material has
been prepared a month earlier than previous years in order to give Board members adequate time to review the
recommendations and have questions answered.
The proposed budget was based on the continued flat funding of $39 million from the Cuyahoga County Health & Human
Services levies, as well as a loss of $4 million from the discontinuation of the 1915a Medicaid waiver. The waiver referenced
previously benefited both the children of Positive Education Program/Connections and other programs that provided
children’s mental health services. Although the Board’s overall budget is slightly over $64 million, it continues to be strained
to support all of the mental health and addiction recovery needs of our community causing Board staff to make difficult
decisions regarding previously funded and new programs while focusing on the Board’s priorities.
 Mr. Osiecki asked Board members to e-mail or call him directly with questions or concerns regarding the CY2019
Funding recommendations so that answers to questions can be provided before the next Board meeting.
 Board members were reminded that the October 24th General Meeting will be held offsite and hosted by Bellefaire
Jewish Children’s Bureau, 22001 Fairmount Blvd. in Shaker Heights.
 All were also asked to bring their CY2019 Funding Book binders with them to the General Meeting.

There being no audience comment or further business, the meeting adjourned at 5:40 p.m.
