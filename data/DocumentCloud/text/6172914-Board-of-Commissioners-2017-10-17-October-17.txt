recommended for approval the following three items.
Commissioner Markowski then presented an Omnibus Motion for approval of Items 1 through 3.
(Item 1)
In 2010, the CHA Board of Commissioners approved the commencement of activities for Chicago
Housing Consulting Services, Inc. (CHCS) as a designated instrumentality of the Chicago Housing
Authority to pursue performance-based contract administration opportunities and to allocate non-federal
funds to CHCS. However, CHCS never launched bona fide operations. With the formation of the
Investment Division in January 2016, the Revenue and Partnerships Department was created within the
Investment Division. This team has successfully navigated various non-federal initiatives and
investments, working cross-functionally within CHA, resulting in substantive, revenue-generating

 outcomes benefitting CHA and its residents. CHCS can help the CHA achieve its fundamental objectives
of providing affordable housing and helping low-income families achieve self-sufficiency by providing
additional revenue streams, independent of federal restrictions, for the agency. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item 1 approves the reorganization of CHCS; naming CHCS the Revenue Concession
Agent for the Chicago Housing Authority; approves a new Board of Directors and approves initial
funding for a not-to-exceed amount of $150,000. In order to effectuate the relaunch of CHCS, its
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws shall be amended and restated to reflect the revised purposes,
structure and functions of the organization.
