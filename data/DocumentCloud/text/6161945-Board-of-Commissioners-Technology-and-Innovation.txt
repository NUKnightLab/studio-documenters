CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, Dorothy Brown, transmitting a Communication,
dated January 6,2011:

requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $129,600.00 from
the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). The funds will be used to
improve disposition reporting to Illinois State Police. This grant requires a cash
match or an in-kind match of a minimum of 20 percent to provide for the additional
funds for providing an overall method or system of correcting the rejected postings
from the Illinois State Police's Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) system.

As the Clerk of the Circuit Court (000) lacks an overall method or system of
correcting the rejected postings from the Illinois State Police?s CHRI system, 
is proposing to build an application that will process the rejected dispositions that
did not post to CHRI, provide a user interface to allow for updates to the information
contained in the Clerk?s disposition reporting, and to transmit that information so
that it successfully posts to CHRI. This solution will specifically provide for:

Automating the interface of records that are pushed back to for
correction and resubmission to system for updating to and

Implementing improved data capture procedures (technical and operational)
that would facilitate complete arrest reporting, research missing dispositions
and information for reporting to lSP's system; and

Reengineering business processes that are impacted by the new application
bqu;and

Examining and improving data collection at critical points throughout the
justice process; and

Establishing more effective accuracy and information quality and auditable
controls; and

Reducing the backlog of missing disposition or related information.

Additionally, the solution will have to examine the collection points of information
coming into the Circuit Court. There may be opportunities for improvements in
receiving critical data through an electronic exchange as opposed to many of
manual entry points that exist today. Lastly, 000 will also add stakeholders to the
project as necessary, especially as it relates to agencies that are identified through
the data collection and exchange points, where improvements can be made in
ensuring accurate and complete information at its point of origin. Justice XML
standards will be used as appropriate.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $32,400.00. (528?818 Account). Grant Award:
$129,600.00. Funding period: January 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012.

Sufficient funds are available in the Circuit Court Automation Fund.
