 Influenza Surveillance Report
Week 36: September 6th – 12th, 2009
I. Influenza Summary to Date
Influenza surveillance for suburban Cook County** involves the weekly collection of data from a sample of hospitals,
private physician’s offices, and laboratory data. Our sentinel participants reported the following aggregate measures:
Syndromic Surveillance: 1.40% ILI1, Sentinel Sites: 4.50% ILI2. Thirty-seven (7.41%) specimens tested by
participating laboratories3 were positive for influenza, of which 94.12% of sub-typed influenza A viruses were novel
H1N1. The activity of influenza is higher than the influenza-like illness rates reported this week in each of the past two
years. To date, suburban Cook County has had 130 hospitalized cases of confirmed novel H1N1 and 4 deaths.
Thank you to all of our surveillance partners for their help in collecting this information.

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
Quality and Patient Safety Committee
Date: 9/22/09
Subject: Health Care Personnel Influenza Vaccination Requirements
Recommendation: Urge influenza vaccinations for all medical and nonmedical personnel in
contact with patients or patient samples, including, but not limited to, physicians, nurses,
physical therapists, dieticians, religious workers, and cleaning, kitchen, and laboratory personnel,
etc.
Purpose: To protect our employees and protect our patients and visitors that come into the
system.
MOTION LANGUAGE: Pursuant to the authority vested in the Cook County Health and
Hospitals System Board, the relevant employee health policies as it relates to Influenza
Vaccination are amended, as follows:
1. Definitions
(a) "Medically contraindicated" means a physician licensed to practice in the State of Illinois or a
nurse practitioner certified to practice in the State of Illinois certifies that influenza vaccine(s)
should not be administered to an individual because it would be detrimental to the individual's
health. Medical contraindication shall continue until such immunization is found no longer to be
detrimental to the individual’s health.
(b) “Personnel” means all persons employed by the System, whether paid or unpaid, including
but not limited to employees, members of the medical staff, contract staff, students, and
volunteers, who either have direct contact with patients or whose activities are such that if they
were infected with influenza, they could potentially expose patients, co-workers, or others who
have direct contact with patients, to influenza.
2. Health & Hospitals System - personnel influenza immunization requirements
The System shall notify all personnel of the requirement and require that personnel be
immunized against influenza virus(es) as a precondition to employment and on an annual basis.
Such influenza vaccination(s) must be in accordance with the national recommendations in effect
at the time of vaccination(s), unless the System has determined that there is not an adequate
supply of vaccine. If the System determines the vaccine supplies are not adequate given the
numbers of personnel to be vaccinated or vaccine(s) are not reasonably available, the System
may suspend the requirement(s) to vaccinate and/or change the annual deadline for such
vaccination(s), as established in this policy change.
Page 10 of 32

 3. Health & Hospitals System, existing personnel
The System will provide or arrange for influenza vaccination(s), at no cost to its personnel, either
at the facility or elsewhere. Personnel may choose to receive influenza vaccination(s) from a
source other than that arranged for by the System and provide documentation to the System’s
Employee Health Unit. Annual influenza vaccination(s) and the documentation thereof shall
take place no later than November thirtieth of each year.
4. Health & Hospitals System, new personnel
Personnel newly entering into service after November thirtieth but before April first of each year
shall have his or her status for influenza vaccination(s) determined the System’s Employee
Health Unit and, if found to be deficient; the System shall provide or arrange for the necessary
vaccination(s) at no cost to the new personnel. Instead of obtaining influenza vaccination(s) from
the System, personnel may choose to receive influenza vaccination(s) from a source other than
that arranged for by the System and provide documentation as described.
5. Documentation
The System shall document the annual vaccination(s) against influenza virus of all personnel in
their personnel files, including the date, site of administration, type of vaccine, dose,
manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine, reactions if any, vaccine information statement
given, and the name of the person administering the vaccines. If any personnel receive influenza
vaccination(s) from other than facility staff, the facility shall document in the personnel file the
date, type of vaccine, dose and name of the person administering the vaccine.
6. Exceptions
No personnel shall be required to receive an influenza vaccine if the vaccine is medically
contraindicated for that individual. Nationally recognized up-to-date guidance for medical
contraindications and recommendations for vaccination(s) for influenza will be reviewed
periodically and policies amended accordingly. The System shall, on a case-by-case basis,
evaluate what steps those who are not vaccinated pursuant to this section must take to reduce the
risk of transmitting influenza to patients.
7. Reporting Requirements
The System’s Employee Health Unit shall collect aggregate data on personnel influenza
vaccination(s) status for the period beginning April first and ending March thirty-first of each
year and report that data to the Quality and Patient Safety Committee of the System’s Board by
May first of the same year. Required data will include, but not be limited to, number of personnel
immunized by occupation, total number of personnel by occupation, and reason(s) personnel did
not receive vaccine.
