SCOPE OF SERVICES:

The CPS Program ("Program") is the of?cial interscholastic athletic league for Chicago Public
Elementary Schools. It's an out-of-school sports program offered to 5th through 8th grade students.
Starting with an initial pilot program of three (3) CPS networks-in the spring of the 2015- 2016 school
year, the Program was fully implemented as the district's elementary sports program in the winter of the
2016-2017 school year.

CPS leverages public-private partnerships to provide coaches, equipment, uniforms, of?cials,
tranSportation and site managers. With partners such as World Sport Chicago, Chicago Blackhawks,
BMO Harris and Target, the Program is able to offer a variety of sports each season to all students.
Students who register to participate practice a minimum of two (2) days per week with games played on
Saturdays in local high schools. High school site managers recruit high school students to serve as game
day staff to assist with scorekeeping and scoreboard operation in return for-service teaming credit. The
winter season consists of boys and girls basketball; the spring season consists of girls and boys track
?eld, ?oor hockey, and girls' soccer; and the fall season consists of girls and boys cross country, girls' and
boys' volleyball, and boys' soccer. The Program is run by CPS staff with assistance from the Chicago
Park District, for additional coaches, of?cials and sites, as needed. The Program currently serves over
25,000 students from approximately 250 schools. 

OUTCOMES: -

The three? (3) main objectives of the Program are to improve academic performance through sports
participation, increase athletic participation by instituting a?"no cuts/tryouts" policy and strengthen
communities through greater parental/guardian involVement. To achieve its ?rst objective, CPS works with
the schools to con?rm that students' grades, behavior and attendance are being monitored throughout the
season to ensure that those students who are meeting academic requirements have the opportunity to
participate. Our second objective allows for more student participation than the previous sports program.
Allowing more student-athletes to be involved in their school's sports program creates the necessary
access to learning and character development experiences that many of them would have gone without if
it weren?t for the CPS program. And lastly,.our third objective of strengthening communities is
achieved by holding the majority of games on Saturdays at neighborhood high schools. This change of
game scheduleand location allows for more parent involvement, as well as giving neighborhood and
community groups the opportunity to interact with students and families who will be attending the high
schools once their children graduate from elementary school.
