 Keys to Success

Systems Approach

Culture Counts

The approach to reduce
harm must be integrated and
implemented at the system
level.

Health systems and
organizations must truly
prioritize quality and safety
through an inspiring vision
and positive reinforcement,
not through blame and
punishment.

Patients as True
Partners
Healthcare organizations
must involve patients and
staff in safety as part of the
solution, not simply as
victims or culprits.

Bias toward action
Interventions should be
based on robust evidence.
However, when evidence is
lacking or still emerging,
providers should proceed
with cautious, reasoned
decision-making rather than
inaction
