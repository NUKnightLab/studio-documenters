disrepair are being torn down and larger new homes are being built. The lot
sizes are long and narrow, and the 3 foot setback has been typically for
garages, which eliminates parking and congestion in the streets. The home
the applicant is building is a ranch-type style and would not impact on air and
light. The subject property consists of approximately 0.07 of an acre, located
on the east side of Linder Avenue, approximately 97 feet south of 48th Street in
