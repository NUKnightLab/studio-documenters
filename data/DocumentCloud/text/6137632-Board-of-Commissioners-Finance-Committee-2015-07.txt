Amendment to File #15-4291
Meeting of the Finance Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE COOK COUNTY’S HOME RULE RETAILER’S OCCUPATION
AND SERVICE OCCUPATION TAXES
WHEREAS, Cook County Board President, Toni Preckwinkle (“President”) and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners successfully reduced Cook County’s Retailer Occupation and Service Occupation Taxes
(hereinafter referred to as “Sales Tax”) in 2012 and 2013 to address the economic reality at that time and to promote
and ensure operational efficiencies and a streamlined County government; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax reduction implemented by the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
allowed approximately one and a half billion dollars to remain in the pockets of Cook County taxpayers during the
2011 through 2015 fiscal years; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax reduction led to a downsized workforce, a reduction in non-essential expenditures,
enhanced collaboration resulting in a more streamlined County government, reductions in the County’s Health
System operating tax allocation, structured capital improvement plans, and a more efficient government; and

Page 2 of 10

 WHEREAS, the President and the County’s Finance Team have undertaken preliminary budget briefings with
members of the Cook County Board of Commissioners to discuss options to further streamline services as well as
evaluate revenue opportunities; and
WHEREAS, given the fiscal challenges facing the County, additional expenditure reductions and new sources of
revenue such as a property tax increase or a sales tax increase, are required to continue moving Cook County
forward and to address its long term needs in a responsible manner so as not to unduly burden the children and
grandchildren of current taxpayers with extensive debt and unfunded pension liabilities; and
WHEREAS, to serve the interests of current and future County residents and taxpayers, additional revenue
opportunities and expenditure reductions are needed to address actuarially projected shortfalls associated with the
County Officers’ and Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund (“the Annuity Fund”); County legacy debt service
payments; and County road and infrastructure needs; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of feedback provided by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the President
supports an increase in the County’s Sales Tax in 2016; the purpose behind this increase is to assist in promoting the
long-term financial health of the Annuity Fund, address increasing legacy debt service payments in a financially
prudent fashion, and fund various road and infrastructure needs, and to provide supportive governmental services to
protect the public health, safety and well-being of the poorest and most vulnerable residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, through statute, the State of Illinois has established the Annuity Fund as an independent body politic,
separate and apart from Cook County, and has further established statutory rules and systems that govern the
financing for and the measurement standards of annuities associated with the Annuity Fund; and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that Cook County employees and Cook County taxpayers consistently have
contributed to the Annuity Fund the full amount permitted by law, the Annuity Fund is on a trajectory of eventual
insolvency within 20 to 25 years; and
WHEREAS, according to current actuarial calculations, the statutory imbalance between contributions made by
employees and taxpayers to the Annuity Fund and the corresponding actuarial and market-based measurement
standards associated with the Annuity Fund increases costs by approximately $1,000,000 per day; and
WHEREAS, various parties representing County employees, County taxpayers and County executive and
legislative leaders have worked to develop certain State legislative reforms that seek to equitably balance the
interests of all parties to address this imbalance; and
WHEREAS, said State legislative reforms, if enacted into law, could reduce annual annuity-related actuarial costs,
permanently protect and preserve annuities, and deliver a healthcare trust fund and other significant new value to
annuitants; and
WHEREAS, while any action taken by the County must anticipate the possibility of legislative action by the State
of Illinois that could reduce the costs potentially attributable to taxpayers; in the absence of such legislative action,
the County must create the means to contribute additional resources to and reduce actuarial costs associated with the
Annuity Fund when permitted by law; and
WHEREAS, while the President remains hopeful that the State of Illinois will enact said legislative reforms, it is
neither prudent nor fiscally responsible for the County to wait for State legislative reforms before taking action and
a Sales Tax increase would prepare the County to be able to take action in a fair and responsible manner to help
promote the long term health of the Annuity Fund; and
WHEREAS, on July 8, 2015 the Governor of Illinois introduced a comprehensive pension reform bill which
incorporates the legislative reforms specifically sought by the various parties representing County employees,
County taxpayers, and County executive as referenced above; and
Page 3 of 10

 WHEREAS, President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners affirm that if the Governor’s pension reform
bill is passed into law and subsequently upheld as Constitutional by the Supreme Court of Illinois, these events
shall immediately trigger an automatic rollback of the Sales Tax increase to its previous level.; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax increase will allow Cook County to make $55 million in increased annual legacy debt
service payments by Fiscal 2017 without raising the property tax levy by a like amount; and
WHEREAS, the Sales Tax increase will allow Cook County to focus on County-wide road and infrastructure needs
resulting in an anticipated additional funding of $64.5 million annually by 2017 when compared with 2015 funding
via Motor Fuel Taxes; and
WHEREAS, $5 million of the proceeds from the Sales Tax increase shall be set aside to establish the Amari
Darnell Brown Parenting Workshop Grant program, which shall be administered by Cook County in order to
provide parenting support to at-risk families in low-income communities with a demonstrated need for such
services; and
WHEREAS, proceeds from the Sales Tax increase shall be set aside to establish a Cook County Job Training and
Workforce Readiness grant program which shall provide job training and workforce readiness support to Cook
County residents in low-income communities that have demonstrated a need for such services; and
WHEREAS, increasing the Sales Tax is not an easy choice; however, Cook County and its leadership must
continue to act responsibly to address the long-term needs of the County’s residents and taxpayers, and their
children and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby support increasing the Cook County Retailers’ Occupation and Service Occupation Taxes to reduce
actuarially projected shortfalls associated with the Annuity Fund, absorb the County’s legacy debt service increases,
and to provide additional funding for road and infrastructure projects, to establish the Amari Darnell Brown
Parenting Workshop Grant program, which shall be administered by Cook County in order to provide parenting
support to at-risk families in low-income communities with a demonstrated need for such services, and to establish
a Cook County Job Training and Workforce Readiness grant program which shall provide job training and
workforce readiness support to Cook County residents in low-income communities that have demonstrated a need
for such services; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President intends to recommend the appropriation of certain sums
attributable to a Sales Tax increase and establish such mechanisms as will result in a greater contribution of tax
receipts to the Annuity Fund as may be permitted by law, a significant increase in the County’s long-term debt
service associated with legacy borrowing from the year 2010 and earlier years, and additional funding for road and
infrastructure projects in the Appropriation Ordinance and Bill for Fiscal Year 2016, the establishment of the Amari
Darnell Brown Parenting Workshop Grant program, which shall be administered by Cook County in order to
provide parenting support to at-risk families in low-income communities with a demonstrated need for such
services, and the establishment of a Cook County Job Training and Workforce Readiness grant program which shall
provide job training and workforce readiness support to Cook County residents in low-income communities that
have demonstrated a need for such services; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
resolve to look at future reductions to the Cook County Retailers’ Occupation and Service Occupation Taxes in the
event the State of Illinois enacts legislation that reduces the long-term actuarial costs associated with the Annuity
Fund if the Governor’s pension reform bill is passed into law and subsequently upheld as Constitutional by the
Supreme Court of Illinois, these events shall immediately trigger an automatic rollback of the Sales Tax increase to
its previous level.
