EXPLANATION
On May 18, 2010, CHA received official written notice of an award from the Department of
Commerce and Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”) to create and implement a summer
Community Garden Program at Altgeld Gardens to provide CHA youth employment
opportunities. The grant funding from DCEO will provide 40 CHA youth with training in
agribusiness while supporting the establishment of a community produce garden. Through this
grant, Growing Power will be responsible for implementing this community garden in
collaboration with Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network (“UCAN”), TEC Services, Inc., and
University of Illinois Extension.

 Upon the Board’s approval, CHA will enter into a contract with Growing Power to expand the
community garden project created by the DCEO grant by creating an additional 150 adult
employment opportunities. Growing Power will provide oversight, training, supplies, tools, and
equipment for an additional 150 adult workers. Within these positions, TANF eligible adults
(ages 18+) will assist in the planning and creation of the community garden. CHA will leverage
the Put Illinois to Work program (“PITW”) grant, which was authorized by the Board on April
20, 2010, to fund the wages for the 150 adult workers. PITW funds will pay the subsidized
wages in an amount of up to $720,000. Adult participants will earn the standard $10 per hour
wage associated with the Put Illinois to Work program.
Participants will construct and install 150 raised box planters, and work in teams to install a
community garden, hoop greenhouses and compost system that will form the infrastructure for
long term sustainable jobs and produce for the community. Participants will also develop and
execute a food distribution system that includes farm stand sales, food pantry and home delivery
services, providing an entrepreneurial learning experience while promoting sustainability.
Participants will attend educational programs to increase understanding of local and regional
food systems and career opportunities in agriculture and natural resources (green jobs) and
cooking demonstrations to increase understanding of food preparation using the local produce.
Participants will also receive job readiness training including career exploration, job search and
application, resume writing, and interviewing and workplace skills.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to enter into
a contract with Growing Power, Inc. for the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, in an
amount not to exceed $165,000 to expand the community garden program at Altgeld Gardens.
