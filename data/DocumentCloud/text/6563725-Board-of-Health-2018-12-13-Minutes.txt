E. Public and Staff Comments (three minute maximum.)
loel Helms. 4977 Massillon Road, Green, Ohio, 44720
In 2015, I analyzed licenses for semi-public plants and came up with $80 for non-dischargers and
$150 for dischargers. I inspected all the plants that were going to the Ohio River basin in the lower
half of the county. Three years later, you are adjusting to $160.00; which is good. No reason to raise
non-dischargers up to that level. There are a lot of different responsibilities between dischargers
and non-chargers. I think you should reconsider the raise for the non-dischargers. The most
important, critical thing is that during my decades of having inspections, mosquito interns are doing
the inspection. If they find the grass high, the plants no good. If the grass is cut the plant gets a
satisfactory rating. It is not based on the actual operation of the plant Upon my inspections, I found
many of these plants in disrepair and being operated as they were originally designed. But not how
they were being operated at the time. I think it is important that you have a qualified registered
state person, like a wastewater 2 person or 3, to do the inspections; not your staff. You get this
contract from Ohio EPA and you can actually contract to someone else. You will get a better quality
inspection. I should be able to get input to the people and places that you inspect. Right now, it is a
fail or no fail or the grass is high type thing. It is very unqualified. You need to have a qualified
person doing these inspections.
