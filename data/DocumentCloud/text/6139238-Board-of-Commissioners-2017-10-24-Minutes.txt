semester with enthusiasm and great hope to advance in their studies; and
WHEREAS, for several years, Cook County has recognized the Federal Trade Commission’s “We Don’t
Serve Teens” consumer education campaign as a valuable resource to raise awareness among parents,

can further reduce illegal underage drinking and the dangers caused by underage drinking to teens
themselves and to the general public; and
WHEREAS, the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
indicates that progress has continued for more than a decade in reducing underage drinking, but it remains

criminal records for possession of alcohol beverages or driving after consumption of a single drink; and

higher risks than their non-college peers of injury or death from assault, car crashes, and other accidents
after illegally consuming alcohol; and
WHEREAS, the University of Illinois Youth Survey clearly indicates the importance that family members
can play in reducing young adolescents’ access to alcohol and the associated risks of injury and the early
onset of serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, the guidance from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcoholism stresses the roles that
parents can play in shaping young people’s attitudes toward drinking by talking about the dangers of
drinking, serving as positive role models in general, not making alcohol available, and communicating
with their children; and
WHEREAS, the consequences of illegal underage drinking are often tragic, and all of these hazards are
preventable with a sincere commitment of parents, guardians, and concerned citizens to remain invoiced
in the lives of their younger family members, friends and neighbors; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens provides concerned adults and teens with useful information on the
dangers of underage drinking, the manner in which most teens procure alcohol, the costs of violating the
law, and strategies to overcome peer pressure and other negative influences; and
WHEREAS, We Don’t Serve Teens information is available at a web site established by the Federal
Trade Commission, www.dontserveteens.gov; and the information will be publicized by Cook Countybased Constellation Brands Beer Division on billboards, digital ads, bus shelter posters, and at retailers
during the month of September.

RECOGNIZING OCTOBER AS BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH
WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States about one (1) in eight (8) women (about 12%) will develop invasive
breast cancer over the course of her lifetime; and
WHEREAS, in 2017, an estimated 252,170 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be
diagnosed in women in the U.S., along with 63,410 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, about 2,470 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in
2017. A man’s lifetime risk of breast cancer is about one (1) in 1,000; and

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

October 24, 2017

WHEREAS, one theory is that this decrease was partially due to the reduced use of hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) by woman after the results of a large study called the Women’s Health Initiative were
published in 2002. These results suggested a connection between HRT and increased breast cancer risk;
and
WHEREAS, about 40,610 women in the United States were expected to die in 2017 from breast cancer,
though death rates have been decreasing since 1989, with larger decreases in women under the age of 50.
These decreases are thought to be result of treatment advances, earlier detection through screening, and
increased awareness; and
WHEREAS, for women in the United States, breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other
cancer, besides lung cancer; and
WHEREAS, white women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer than African-American
women. However, in women under 45, breast cancer is more common in African-American women than
white women. Overall, African - American women are more likely to die of breast cancer. Asian, Hispanic,
and Native-American women have a lower risk of developing and dying from breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, in 2017, there are more the 3.1 million women with a history of breast cancer in the United
States. This includes women currently being treated and women who have finished treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of more than 5.20 million residents of Cook County, do hereby take this
opportunity to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceeding of this Honorable Body in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
Approved and adopted this 24th of October 2017.
