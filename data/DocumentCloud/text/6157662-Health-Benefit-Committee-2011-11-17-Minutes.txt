2. Prescription Drug Audit
Ms. McMillin reviewed the idea of considering a biennial audit plan whereby the
Committee would adopt the practice to review, consider and, if necessary, conduct
audits of health benefit providers every other year. She further discussed the need to
conduct the 1st PBM audit of Caremark in 2011 since contracting with them in 2009.
An audit of plan years 2009 and 2010 was recommended based on contractual
restrictions.
Ms. McMillin reviewed the five vendors that were asked to provide proposals to
conduct the PBM audit. These included the current health benefits consultant, Segal;
the firm that conducted the last medical benefits audit, Aon/Hewitt; the firm that
conducted the last PBM audit of Walgreens, PBM Analyzers & Stephens Consulting
Services; as well as an independent firm, Pharmacy Outcome Specialists. The scope
of services were similar though varied widely in price. Based on the review of
proposals the firm with the best client list of recommendations and overall fees for
services was Pharmacy Outcome Specialists.
It was moved by Trustee Balanoff and seconded by Trustee McFadden to recommend
to the Board for approval a PBM audit of Caremark utilizing Pharmacy Outcomes
Specialists for plan years 2009 and 2010.

 3. Voluntary Dental Plan
Ms. McMillin discussed member requests for a dental program and the ability of the
Fund to offer a dental plan to members on voluntary basis. The plan offerings of two
vendors, Delta Dental and Guardian, capable of providing the administration and
service of a voluntary program were reviewed. It was discussed that, if approved,
open enrollment for the voluntary program would take place April 2012 with a May
1, 2012 effective date.
Based on plan offering, pricing and familiarity with the County’s current dental plan
provider, Guardian was considered by Ms. McMillin to be the more favorable choice
overall.
It was moved by Trustee Balanoff and seconded by Trustee McFadden to recommend
to the Board to approve the offering of a Voluntary Dental Plan provided by Guardian
in April 2012.
Vote Result: MOTION ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY VOICE VOTE.
