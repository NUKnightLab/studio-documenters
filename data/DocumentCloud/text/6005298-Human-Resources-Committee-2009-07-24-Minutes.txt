CCHHS Employee Diversity Data Observations / Recommendations
CCHHS Diversity Council

J U I ~2009

1. African American Representation: Good employee-to-patient representation (about
50% for both). Recommend continued effort to increase AA physicians at Stroger and
OFH, both for attendings and house-staff, Stroger department chairs particularly need
under-represented minorities. Trade union jobs also can grow AA representation.
2. White Representation: Only 19% of CCHHS employees are white, close to the
patient percentage of 11%. White representation is high at the Board, and CCHHS top
leadership. White nurses make up 11% of employees. 32% of house-stflare white,
although most of these may be foreign medical graduates. 43% of CCHHS physicians are
white, which is about half of the US physician percentage.
3. Hispanic Representation: Low employee representation in nursing (4%), physicians
(6%), whereas Hispanic patients make up about 25-30% of CCHHS population. No
Hispanic COO, or top leadership, or top AA positions (6%). Low representation with
trade unions (2.5%). Hispanic house-staff make up 13% of docs in training, although
most are foreign graduates, not US gads. Very few Hispanic pharmacists to recruit.
4. Asian Representation: 3% of patients in CCHHS are Asian, 22% of all employees are
Asian, 44% of nurses, 42% of house-staff, 15% of grade 23-24 AA, 5% of clerks. Only
12% of nursing leaders are Asian.
5. Stroger Hospital: Discussion above applies to Stroger, as Stroger is similar to
CCHHS employee data.
6. Provident Hospital: Strong AA representation, showing that AA professionals and
employees can be recruited in high percentages. With growing integration, Provident
seeing more Hispanic patients, and needs more bilingual staff to meet the needs.
7. Oak Forest Hospital: Has diverse employee staff (45% AA, 3 1% White, 21% Asian,
3% Hispanic). Similar to Provident, also seeing more Hispanic patients (lo%), and needs
more bilingual staff.
8. Cermak Health Services: Has diverse and representative staff compared to patients.
Opportunity to grow under-represented minority representation at top leadership.
9. ACHN: Representative staff compared to employees. Opportunity to increase Asian
nursing leadership.
10. CORE: Good diversity match between staff and patients.
11. CCDPH: Good employee representation compared to communities served.
12. CCHHS Bureau: Opportunity to grow under-represented minority representation, to
reflect patients and staff, particularly at top positions.
13. CCHHS Board: Opportunity to grow under-represented minority representation, to
reflect patients and staff.
14. Most important: Top leadership must support diversity effort in order to succeed.
15. Equally important: Zero tolerance for racial, cultural , sexual orientation, religious,
or gender insensitivity or bigotry in the CCHHS!
16. Muy importante: The CCHHS mission and strategic plan must incorporate our
diversity effort and plan. Core values such as respect for patients, compassion,
professionalism, and others should be incorporated into our mission and culture.

 6
17. Minority CCHHS employee point of view: The CCHHS is a system of 70-80%
minority patients and employees, and minority representation at all CCHHS leadership
areas should not be a token number.
18. Non-minority CCHHS employee point of view: Excellent, caring, competent, and
professional health care delivery is the key goal, with attention to the linguistic, cultural,
racial, gender, and religious needs of the patients. A diverse employee staff at all levels is
important.
19. Patients point of view: The main thing we are looking for is a caring, competent
health care system, to address our needs, irrespective of race, gender, etc. Linguistic,
cultural, gender, racial, and religious needs are important for patient satisfaction.
20. CCHHS Diversity History: Great progress has been made in the last 20 years to
increase the CCHHS minority leadership representation, especially under the leadership
of Ruth Rothstein. Opportunities are still present for all of us to work on.
