PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO GRANT AUTHORIZATION TO
THE HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM BOARD TO LEVY TAXES FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government has the responsibility for providing health care to the
indigent that no other County in the State has; and
WHEREAS, the demand for quality healthcare has increased over the years. In addition, the
closing of state mental health hospitals, high unemployment rates, and returning of exoffenders to the community puts an overwhelming burden on Cook County tax payers to
provide adequate healthcare funding; and
WHEREAS, the financial problems confronting Cook County and the County’s
responsibility to fund public safety makes it difficult to meet the needs of quality healthcare;
and
WHEREAS, in an effort to ensure quality healthcare for the indigent and to enhance the
integrity of the Health Systems, it becomes necessary for the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System Board to become totally separate from the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, including financial independence; and
WHEREAS, the legislative body is the only authority that can create a taxing district to fund
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois granted the Chicago School Board the authority to levy its
own taxes; similar authority would give the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board a
greater opportunity to become independent of Cook County thus minimizing the politics and
afford them an opportunity to bring in revenue for the sole purpose of providing healthcare in
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, a permanent Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board with its own
consistent revenue source would be in the best interest of the citizens of Cook County; and

COMMITTEE REPORT
ITEM #3
RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 9, 2010 from
JOHN P. DALEY, Chairman, Audit Committee
In order to ensure that each member of the Board has had an opportunity to review the contents of the
amended response, I am requesting that the following letter from the Clerk of the Circuit Court be
received and filed. This amended letter from Clerk Brown was received by my office on March 5,
2010, which was subsequent to the approval of the Audit Committee Report of February 9, 2010 at the
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners held on March 2, 2010 (Agenda Item #6).
AMENDED LETTER FROM CLERK BROWN
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 4, 2010 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
Re: Revised Response to Question 3 of February 8, 2010 letter
Dear Chairman Daley:

AUTHORIZATION TO APPEND A REVISED LETTER TO A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
COMMITTEE REPORT continued
ITEM #3 cont’d

On February 16, 2010 the Clerk of the Circuit Court submitted to you a written response
to three questions you presented in your correspondence dated February 8, 2010. This
letter is a revision of our response to question number 3 of your letter, regarding
Communication Number 301501, which was on the agenda for the February 9, 2010
meeting of the Audit Committee.
Following is your question and our revised response to the question; changes are
underlined.
Question 3: “What would your position be on a proposal to accept certified checks
and money orders only, to reduce the incidents of NSF checks?”
For customer service reasons, the Clerk of the Circuit Court is proposing that we give the
customers the option of paying by certified checks, money orders, or a personal check
guaranteed by a service. Cook County could enter into a county contractual agreement
with a personal check guarantee service, and/or an immediate bank account debit service
in order to ensure guarantee of available customer funds at the point of service. The cost
of implementing and maintaining a personal check guarantee service partnership could be
borne by check writers opting to tender personal checks. Cook County could then
continue its practice of accepting personal checks and reduce the incidents of NSF
checks, at no cost to the County. This proposal would allow the Clerk of the Circuit
Court, and any other Cook County agency, to continue to provide excellent customer
service to our citizens by allowing personal checks to be used for payment, and not just
certified checks and/or money orders, and also eliminate exposure to NSF checks.
According to our research, the costs involved with various check guarantee services
range from as low as $0.14 per check, to as high as 1.45% of the check amount, plus
$0.28 per check. In addition to the per check fee, there is a monthly account service fee
and a monthly statement fee that would range from as low as $5.00 per month, to as high
as $40.00 a month. After performing a check volume analysis of county agencies
accepting personal checks and selecting a vendor, the County would set a nominal fee to
be paid by each customer to absorb the cost of the monthly fees.

WHEREAS, with appropriate antibiotic treatment, TB can be cured in most people. Left untreated, each
person with active TB disease can infect an average of between 10 and 15 people every year; and
WHEREAS, successful treatment depends on close cooperation between the patient and health care
provider. Patients who stop taking their medication before they are cured remain ill and are at risk for
developing and spreading multi-drug resistant TB, a deadlier form of TB that is much more costly and
difficult to treat; and
WHEREAS, in suburban Cook County, treatment and control services are provided by the Cook County
Department of Public Health’s (CCDPH) TB Prevention and Control Unit; and
WHEREAS, an effective TB prevention and control program includes screening, early case
identification, contact tracing, and treatment. These are the services provided by the CCDPH that are so
essential to the prevention of costly TB outbreaks.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, do hereby recognize the efforts of the Cook County Department of Public
Health to provide the services needed to control this disease and furthermore recognize March 24, 2010,
as World TB Day.

PROPOSED CONTRACT
ITEM #20
REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE #305673
Transmitting a Communication from
BENNIE E. MARTIN, Executive Law Librarian, Cook County Law Library
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Innovative Interfaces, Inc.,
Emeryville, California, to lease its Millennium system, an automated integrated library management
system, and for services from the company associated with installation of the system, including project
management, software configuration, training, implementation, consulting, data loading and maintenance
services.
Reason:

The Millennium system will replace the existing system, which was installed in 1992, and is
no longer supported by its vendor, and is inadequate for the Library's needs. The new system
will integrate the library's processes for acquisition, check-in, cataloging, and payment of
library materials, not all of which are currently automated. It will also produce a web-based,
online public access catalog of the library's holdings.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process per
County requirements. This vendor can fulfill the specialized automation requirements of a
large county law library, migrate the bibliographic data for this large collection from the
current system to theirs, and grow with the changes in the legal publishing and legal research
worlds to continue to meet the needs of the Cook County Law Library and its patrons.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has worked with other county law libraries.
