Committees. Per Commissioner Harris, a Joint Finance and Operations Committee session was held
on Wednesday, April 10, 2013 at approximately 1:00 p.m. at the CHA Corporate Offices. Present at
the meeting were Commissioners Beverly, Johnson, Harris, King, Markowski and Sierra. Since we did
not have a quorum for either committee, at the recommendation of the Chief Legal Officer,
2

 Commissioners were briefed on items appearing on the Agenda, however, for the record, no votes were
taken. Linda Riley Mitchell, the Chief Financial Officer and staff presented the Committee with the
March 2013 Treasury and Cash Flow Report.
Per Commissioner Harris, at the recommendation of staff, Item C3: Recommendation to award
contract for Authority-wide Construction Management Services was removed from today’s Agenda.
(Item C1 – This Number Not Used)
(Item C2)
The resolution for Item C2 ratifies the contract award to Burling Builders, Inc., in the amount of
$232,000 for electrical Bus Duct Upgrades at Lincoln Perry Apartments. The purpose of this contract
is to upgrade the main electrical service distribution equipment at Lincoln Perry Apartments in order to
bring it in compliance with the current City of Chicago Building Codes. During the summer of 2012,
this building suffered a major power failure in the electrical distribution system of the building and was
temporarily made operational to keep the building from being evacuated. Upon the completion of this
work, the electrical distribution system will meet applicable Building Codes. The CHA is scheduled to
appear at a hearing before the Circuit Court of Cook County on May 22, 2013 to confirm that a
contract has been issued to perform the work needed to correct the various Code violations issued to
the CHA based on the temporary electrical repairs. Due to the long lead time needed to order the bus
duct materials, it is necessary that the CHA issue the contract to Burling Builders, Inc. prior to the
April 16, 2013 Board meeting so that the installation work can be started before the May 22nd Court
date. Lincoln Perry Apartments is a nine (9) story tall building, containing two hundred sixty-seven
(267) dwelling units, completed in 1973 and located at 3245 South Prairie Avenue. Relocation of
residents will not be required for this project.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-27
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated April 10, 2013,
entitled “RATIFICATION OF CONTRACT WITH BURLING BUILDERS, INC. FOR
ELECTRICAL BUS DUCT UPGRADES AT LINCOLN PERRY APARTMENTS”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby ratifies the execution of a firm fixed price contract
with Burling Builders, Inc. for electrical bus duct upgrades at Lincoln Perry Apartments
in the amount of $232,000 for a term of ninety (90) calendar days.
These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3, and bonding and insurance requirements.

The Motion to adopt resolution for Item C2 was seconded by Commissioner Markowski and the voting
