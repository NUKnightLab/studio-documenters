A
RESOLUTION
CONSOLIDATING
VARIOUS
GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS BY COMBINING THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Elizabeth
“Liz” Doody Gorman, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CONSOLIDATING VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS
BY COMBINING THE OFFICE OF CONTRACT COMPLIANCE
WITH THE OFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT

WHEREAS, in an effort to help resolve the FY 2008 budget crisis, a resolution
consolidating certain government operations was introduced at the February 20,
2008 meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, during these tough economic times, the need to streamline County
operations still exists as the Board of Commissioners prepares to address the
FY 2009 budget; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent is the chief County official with the charge of
procuring quality goods and services for Cook County agencies at the best
market value, making certain that vendors comply with all of the requirements of
the Procurement and Contracts Code and recommending to the County Board
which vendors should be awarded contracts based on their bids and on meeting
all the required criteria; and
WHEREAS, one of the major criterion in determining which vendors should be
awarded contracts is compliance with the Minority and Women Owned Business
Enterprises division of the Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, compliance with the County’s MBE/WBE ordinance is the only
criterion, in the County’s contract procurement process, which is administered
by a County department other than the Office of the Purchasing Agent; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent should have the responsibility of making
certain that contracts are fulfilled appropriately and that vendors meet all of the
requirements of the Procurement and Contracts Code; and
WHEREAS, it is redundant to have two departments with such similar
responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, other large governmental bodies, such as the City of Chicago;
Orange County, California; Hennepin County, Minnesota, throughout the United
States, have only one department administering all of these functions; and

WHEREAS, it would be more cost efficient for the Office of Contract
Compliance to be merged into the Office of the Purchasing Agent.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Office of Contract
Compliance is hereby dissolved and the duties of said office shall be transferred
to the Office of the Purchasing Agent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the employees of the Office of Contract
Compliance shall now report to the Purchasing Agent.
*Referred to the Committee on Contract Compliance on 12-03-08.
Chairman Maldonado delivered the following opening remarks:
Today we will consider a proposed ordinance sponsored by Commissioner Gorman which
seeks to eliminate the Office of Contract Compliance and transfer its duties and staff to the
Office of the Purchasing Agent.
The Committee selected today’s date as an accommodation to Commissioner Gorman’s
request to hold this hearing as early as possible from the date she introduced the ordinance but
immediately after we thought the Committee on Finance would take a vote on the 2009 budget.
As you know, that vote took place last night so we could not have guessed today’s date for this
hearing any better than we did.
Nevertheless, Commissioner Gorman sent me a letter two days ago, requesting that the
Committee hearing be deferred because, and I quote, “It has been brought to my attention that
there may be investigations concerning certain contracts in the Contract Compliance
Department.”
In speaking with the Inspector General about the allegation, Mr. Blanchard stated that the
ordinance that directs his role as Inspector General prohibits him from either acknowledging or
denying the existence of any investigation. However, he clearly stated that his Office had no
objections to proceed with the hearing.
Moreover, let it be clear that the Office of Contract Compliance does not award contracts. This
is the exclusive role of the Office of the Purchasing Agent. Therefore, the implication in
Commissioner Gorman’s letter that the Office of Contract Compliance is under investigation
concerning certain contracts it awarded is, at the very least, a misguided allegation.
Ultimately, I am convinced that the bonafide MBE/WBE community will welcome any
investigation that would eliminate any possible wrong doing that would hurt the viability of this
essential program and therefore the preservation of the minority business community of Cook
County.
Yet, whether the Director of Contract Compliance, Ms. Betty Hancock-Perry, or the Inspector
General, Mr. Patrick Blanchard, wishes to make any statement about Commissioner Gorman’s
allegation is up to them.

However, as Chairman of this Committee, I will not allow the hearing to deviate from the subject
matter before us for consideration. That is, to deliberate on the elimination of the Office of
Contract Compliance. The MBE and WBE community deserves no less.
To that end, we have assembled a number of witnesses, all experts in this area, from whom we
will hear their perspectives on the proposed ordinance during the hearing. The Chair also
extended the same courtesy to the sponsor, Commissioner Gorman, to invite witnesses
But before we start with the invited witnesses and the public, let me set forth the procedures I
think we should follow:
1) We will hear from the sponsor of the Ordinance with her opening remarks and
description of the Ordinance.
2) We will then hear from the Director of Contract Compliance, Betty Hancock-Perry and
her perspective.
3) We will hear from the invited witnesses, allowing questions from the members.
4) The Committee will debate.
5) The public will testify.
6) A vote will be taken.
Commissioner Gorman delivered opening remarks. (See attached written statement.)
