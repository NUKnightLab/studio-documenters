RE: Merrill Development LLC (an entity of 5&5 Development LLC) - Petition to Establish a
Commercial Rehabilitation District for the Merrill Place Phase II Project generally known as
1301, 1312 and 1313 Seward Street Detroit, MI 48202 Updated July 20, 2019

Dear Honorable City Council Members:

This letter serves as a petition to establish a Commercial Rehabilitation District for the vacant parking
lots 1301. 1312 1313 Seward Street Detroit. Mi 48202, which are generally bounded by Virginia Park St.
to the north, John C. Lodge Freeway to the east, Pallister to the south, and Poe St. to the west (Please
see Attachment A. map and parcel information related to the proposed district).

Project Description

Merrill Development, under the umbrella of 5&5 Development, LLC has, since 2010, developed built and
operated Merrill Place Phase a six unit complex in the New Center area that is fully occupied with no
available units. Merrill Place Phase II will be a 54-Unit, two?building approximately 50,000 square foot
multi-family development designed specifically for residents seeking proximity to the expanding medical
center campus, New Center and Midtown areas. The current unit mix involves (36) 2-bedroom units and
(18) 1-bedrooms split between two sites, and in two stages respectively.

Both new buildings will make a crucial contribution to the neighborhood's aesthetic cohesiveness,
economic vitality, and community identity. As this will be the immediate hospital system area?s first new
construction multi-family development in over a decade, Merrill Place II will contribute to the overall
massing of the area, bridging the gap between the neighborhood to the North and the activity of West
Grand Boulevard. It will help define and complete the planning efforts ofthe area With the introduction
of an accessible multi-family development.

This residential project will play an indispensable role in adding to the diversity, stability, and safety of
the New Center and hospital system area. The uses ofthe buildings will create an influx of students,
residents and families that will translate to a higher quality of life and continued economic development
in the neighborhood for decades to come.

Eligibility

Under the Commercial Rehabilitation Act, Act 210 of 2005, the identified parking lot parcels on Seward
St. are ?Qualified Facilities" and in a qualified business area according to 207.842 Definitions, Sections
2(h) and Section 2(b) respectively:

Section 2(h) - "Qualified facility" means a qualified retail food establishment or a building or
group of contiguous buildings of commercial property that is 15 years old or older or has been
allocated for a new markets tax credit under section 45D ofthe internal revenue code, 26 USC
450. Qualified facility also includes a building or a group of contiguous buildings, a portion of a
building or group of contiguous buildings previously used for commercial or industrial purposes,
obsolete industrial property, and vacant property which, within the immediately preceding 15
years, was commercial property as defined in subdivision 

II Section 2(h) - "Commercial rehabilitation district" or "district" means an area not less than 3
acres in size of a qualified local governmental unit established as provided in section 3.
However, if the commercial rehabilitation district is located in a downtown or business area or
contains a qualified retail food establishment, as determined by the legislative body of the
qualified local governmental unit, the district may be less than 3 acres in size

- Subdivision - "Commercial property" means land improvements classified by law for
general ad valorem tax purposes as real property including real property assessable as personal
property pursuant to sections Sid) and 14(6) of the general property tax act, 1893 PA 206, MCL
211.8 and 211.14, the primary purpose and use of which is the operation of a commercial
business enterprise or multifamily residential use. Commercial property shall also include
facilities related to a commercial business enterprise under the same ownership at that location,
including, but not limited to, office, engineering, research and development, warehousing, parts
distribution, retail sales, and other commercial activities.

Purpose for Establishment of the District Exemption Length

The project site is located in a qualified low-income census tract, 5326. Census data shows that 42.4% of
its residents live below poverty level. Due to the economic condition ofthe surrounding area, project
revenues are limited to what the market will support. With the combination of development costs and
market?based revenue potential, the operating expenses must be decreased through property tax
abatement in order to create financial feasibility for the project. Accordingly, the project could not be
undertaken without the receipt of the Public Act 210 Commercial Exemption Certificate for a period of
ten (10) years. The project site was chosen due to its transformational and catalytic nature. The entire
project was based upon the principle of increased community deVelopment in a distressed area that
neighbors a robust area, and the plan was created around this concept, as such, the developer shall
designate 20 percent of its developed units to low and moderate-income residential units to create a

mixed-income neighborhood.

Project Benefits to the City of Detroit

Throughout the downtown and midtown areas, major anchors like The Detroit Medical Center, Wayne
btate and Henry Ford Heaith Syscem have all outstripped available space fol pen'nanent
residents, University students and medical residents. Merrill Place Phase II will make a significant
contribution to increasing the amount of housing currently in the Western sector of the New Center
area. The Merrill Place Phase II project will counter the existing blighting influences of vacant lots and
dilapidated housing stock found at the project site through demolition and new construction, and
essentially reverse the decline ofthis block through the introduction of new residential space.

The project will also provide the following benefits:

The project will add to the income tax base of the City of Detroit.

Spur other potential development projects in the area and increase the taxable value on

surrounding properties.

The creation of new residential units is expected to increase the number of people living in the
area, thus, the project will potentially increase the demand for incremental retail, restaurant

and other commercial amenities in the area.

The project will generate approximately 50 temporary jobs and 20 indirectjobs as a result of the

construction effort.

The developer is current on all taxes from Merrill Place Phase I and all vacant parcels for Merrill

Place Phase II

Projected Start and Completion Date
It is estimated that construction will begin in Fall 2019 and be completed by Spring 2020

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Assessors Office, has reviewed the proposed Commercial Rehabilitation District located at
1301, 1312 and 1313 Seward Street near the Virginia Park area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Commercial Rehabilitation Districts under PA 210 ol 2005, as amended, is based on the anticipation of
increased market value upon completion of new construction and/or significant rehabilitation of commercial and former industrial
property where the primary purpose and use is the operation of a commercial business enterprise or multifamily residential use.

RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Commercial Rehabilitation District (PA 210) for 1301, 1312,
and 1313 Seward.
CC: Katy Trudeau, Deputy Director, Planning and Development

Kevin Schronce, PDD Central, Planning and Development

In order to ensure that establishment of a Commercial Rehabilitation District is consistent with the
City?s Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity;
create, retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of
residents in a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 210 of 2005 (section 207.843), the
Planning and Development Department?s Planning Division submits the following interpretation. The
Petition is Merrill Development LLC (an entity of 5&5 Development LLC)

Location and Project Proposal: Property is currently a vacant parking lot located at 1301, 1312, and 1313
Seward Street. Project seeks to develop approximately 50,000 square foot, multi-family structure to
contain 54 units of housing. Project seeks to specifically target residents seeking proximity to the
expanding medical center campus, New Center, and Midtown areas. The anticipated mix of housing
involves (36) 2-bedroom units, and (18) 1-bedroom split between two site. Project will be constructed in
two phases.

Master Plan Interpretation

The subject site area is designated Low/Medium Density Residential (RLM). Low/Medium Density
Residential areas should have an overall density of 8 to 16 dwelling units per net residential acre. The
areas are often characterized by two or four family homes with small yards, on-street parking, or garages
with alley access. The residential classifications allow for neighborhood-scale commercial development.
For instance, in a Low/Medium Density Residential area, small scale commerce convenience stores)
should exist to serve residents' day-to-day needs.

The Master Plan Future General Land use categories used on all the maps are generalized. Boundaries
are not meant to be precise as to blocks or property lines. Categories are descriptive of general
development recognizing that some intermixtures are permissible or desirable.

The proposed development conforms to the Future General Land Use characteristics of the
area.
