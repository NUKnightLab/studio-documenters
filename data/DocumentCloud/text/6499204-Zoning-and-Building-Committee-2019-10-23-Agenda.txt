Designated Floodway means the channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain
adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and convey
the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot increase in stage due to the
loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent increase in velocities.
(1) The floodways are designated on the countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map for Cook

Floodplain means that land typically adjacent to a body of water with ground surface elevations at or
below the base flood or the 100-year frequency flood elevation. Floodplains may also include detached
special flood hazard areas (SFHAs), ponding areas, etc. The floodplain is also known as the special flood
hazard area (SFHA). The floodplains are those lands within the jurisdiction of the County that are subject
to inundation by the base flood or 100-year frequency flood. The special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) of
the County are generally identified on the Countywide flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for Cook County

the adoption of this ordinance wherein, the cost of the improvements which equals or exceeds 50 percent
of the market value of the structure or increases the floor area by 20 percent either, before the

damage occurred.
