Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Ms. Besenhofer noted that, with regard to request number 1, the dollar amount includes a one-time start up fee in
the amount of $45,790.
With regard to request number 4, a request to execute a contract with Konica Minolta Business Solutions USA,
Inc., for multifunctional devices, a question was raised regarding the year-over-year anticipated savings. Ms.
Besenhofer stated that, right now, it is estimated to be a 20-25 % savings. They are reducing the number of
copiers and coming up with the first phase of re-engineering to have a centralized copier area; this will reduce
the cost from the standpoint of how people utilize the devices. This is part of the bigger strategy, in terms of
document management. She stated that as soon as she has a dollar figure associated with the anticipated savings,
she will share that with the Board. Director Lerner stated that the Board would appreciate receiving essentially a
return on investment analysis.
Also with regard to request number 4, Director Lerner inquired whether there is a security system attached to
these machines. Ms. Besenhofer responded that there are entry codes that can be utilized. If the devices are
located in general public areas, there will be security codes that will have to be utilized to use the machines; if
the devices are located in the work areas, codes will probably not be utilized. Director Lerner suggested that all
of the devices have coded entry to track volume by cost center.
Director Gugenheim recommended that management have a way of conveying this plan to the users, and provide
a rationale and reasoning for why this change is fundamentally good for the System. Ms. Besenhofer concurred;
she stated that one of the things that will be a part of the roll-out is to have informational sessions for users.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved the approval of request numbers 1
through 4. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

Cook County Health and Hospitals System issued three requests for proposals for the subject services.
The first RFP was responded to by only one proposer. The second third yielded three 8 six responses
respectively, but the vendors did not possess significant healthcare experience. An emergency situation arose that
required management to enter into a contract with Jani-King of Illinois for a two month period from
11/05/2012 to 01/05/2013 to bridge cleaning services at the community clinics. The contract was in the amount of
$126,436.00. Requests to amend and extend the contract were approved by the Board on 02/01/2013,

amount was approved by Supply Chain Management for a period of two (2) months.

  
   
      
    
 
 
    
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

An additional request to amend and increase for the time period of 12/01/2013 through 05/31/2014 was prepared for
presentation to the Board for $357,319.12. Management recently learned we inadvertently failed to present
this request to extend and increase to the Board for approval. Accordingly, this request is for approval to
extend and increase the contract from 12/01/2013 through 06/30/2014 in an amount of $416,872.31, which includes
a $357,319.12 for the period of 12/01/2013 through 05/31/2014 and $59,553.19 for the period of 06/01/2014 through
06/30/14. The remaining thirty-one days of the contract period will allow for the ramp up and implementation of a new
model that will standardize management for the cleaning of all facilities, including the community clinics, and will

. allow us to begin to hire workers to clean the facilities. This request will increase the total contract
authorization to $1,198,393.29.

TERMS OF REQUEST: AP 30

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
This is a request to execute a contract for the lease of multifunctional devices on a cost per copy basis for ail health
system facilities. All devices over the past 5 years have been under a County-wide contract. These devices will
upgrade our ability to copy, print, scan and fax documents. This contract includes the use of the equipment,
maintenance services (technician onsite) and all supplies (excluding paper). Multifunctional print device leasing
allows Cook County Health and Hospitals System to keep up with technology and regulatory requirements
including so as not to have any breach of patient information. Multifunctional print devices will allow
to reduce stand-alone printers and fax machines which will reduce capital outlay, maintenance costs and

i supply costs. The devices will not be replaced one for one, but will be located in central locations. There will be a
copy center located at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital to be able to do quick turnaround for specific types of jobs. The
roilout of the copy center will be the first step in the reengineering of document management. The anticipated overall 3
savings will be realized in reduced utilization of toner cartridges, printer maintenance, and reduced paper utilization in i
i the range of 20% to 25% overall.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH
8: HOSPITALS SYSTEM

    

JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD

INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

MAY 30, 2014

- The 2015 Cook County budget process is underway. President Preckwinkle is expected to release her preliminary
budget in the coming weeks. departments are currently entering their 2015 budget requests and then will
meet with System leadership in June ultimately leading to the introduction of the 2015 Budget to the
Finance Committee in August.

- is analyzing the potential impact of the proposed changes to the Cook County Pension Plan. A preliminary
analysis reveals that there are 1,400 employees over age 50 with at least 20 years of service representing 25% of
our currently employed workforce. Within the 1,400 are 300 employees who are 50 years old with at least 30 years
of service. All managers and leaders have been asked to assess their areas for the potential impact. Senior
leadership will work with their respective teams to develop strategies to manage the impact as best as possible
with minimal disruption to clinical operations as the priority.

The Dialysis Unit at Stroger has been recertified by the Illinois Department of Public Health for three years. The
Nephrology program combines outstanding patient care, teaching and research.

Legislation:

On Thursday, May 29, 2014 the Illinois Senate voted 46-10 authorizing final approval to a comprehensive Medicaid
package which will now go to the Governor for signature. This legislation contains several major provisions but of critical
importance is the language requested by for an amendment to the Illinois Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)
Act expanding the definition of "Organization" to include and a local government health system operating within a county
of a population of 3 million or more. This amendment to HMO Act removes a legislative barrier that now would allow Cook
County, through the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, to apply for an HMO license and operate a managed care
plan for those who do not qualify for Medicaid. By offering private insurance planls) on the Health Insurance Marketplace,
will have the opportunity to ensure continuity of care for those adults that have income at or below 200% of the
federal poverty level that due to income changes may move between eligibility for Medicaid and subsidized coverage
offered on the Market Place. We are grateful to our many community partners that lent their support on our behalf.

Other Medicaid related issues addressed in this legislation include: the four (4) prescription limit - drugs are
not subject to prior approval, and exempts children with complex medical needs in care coordinated entities; requires the
Department of Healthcare and Family Services cover kidney transplantation for noncitizens with end-stage renal disease;
therapy services twenty (20) maximum limit expires; podiatry services not limited to patients with diabetes; adult dental
services not limited to emergency dental services (still does not cover preventive services), and continues coverage of
pregnant women prior to delivery.

Calendar Events

allow us to test our Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) in a simulated exercise including ?live? patients. The 
team meets regularly and participated in a tabletop exercise last month in preparation for the drill.

The CORE Center team is preparing for the annual Step Up. Get Tested program that brings mobile HIV testing into the
community with the goal of testing 5,000 people annually. Through June and July, the CORE team will provide testing and
education at CTA train stations and neighborhood pharmacies.

The Community Relations team has kicked off its summer schedule of events to promote health and wellness and 
programs, including CountyCare. The team will be participating in dozens of events throughout the summer months
including the Thapeio/BrotherZBrother Men?s Health Fair, Fiestas Puertorriquenas, the Chicago Gospel Music Festival, the

A Farmer's Market will be held in the alcove of the Stroger Cafeteria starting in June offering patients, visitors and
staff with the fresh fruits and vegetables for purchase.
