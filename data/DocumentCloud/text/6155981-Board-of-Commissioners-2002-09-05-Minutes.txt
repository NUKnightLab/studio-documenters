percentage of the principal amount of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds to be redeemed and
as a percentage of the Compound Accreted Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed) not to
exceed one hundred three percent (I 03.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate
Bonds, accrued interest to the date ofredemption, as detennined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time
of the sale thereof. If less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series are to be optionally redeemed, the
Bonds to be called shall be called from such Series, in such principal amounts and from such maturities as
may be detennined by the County and within any maturity by lot within a maturity in the manner
hereinafter provided. Any Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds may be made subject to
mandatory redemption, at par and accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption, by the application of

as set forth in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture. The terms and provisions for any redemption of
Variable Rate Bonds shall be as detennined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds
and as set forth in a relevant Indenture, provided that such tenns shall be within the limitations set forth in
this Article.
Section 7.2.
Notice of Redemption. When the Trustee shall be required or authorized, or
shall receive notice from the County of its election to redeem Bonds, the Trustee shall, in accordance with
the terms and provisions of such Bonds and of this Ordinance and the Bond Order, select the Bonds to be
redeemed as described in Section 7.3 and Section 7.6 and, unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be
redeemed, shall give notice of the redemption of such Bonds. Notice of any such redemption shall be
given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less
than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of
the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the registration books maintained by the
Trustee or at such other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owners to the Trustee.
All notices of redemption shall include, at a minimum, the infonnation as follows:
( 1)

the redemption date;

(2)

the Redemption Price;

(3) if less than all of the Bonds of a particular Series are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the respective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;

47

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2002

( 4) a statement that on the redemption date the Redemption Price will become due and
payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest thereon
shall cease to accrue from and after said date; and
(5) the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption
Price, which place of payment shall be the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Bonds are held by the Depository.
Unless such redemption shall have been made conditional upon the availabi lity of sufficient funds
as described below, on or prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an
amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are
to be redeemed on that date.
Notice of redemption having been given as provided therefor, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so
to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein
specified, and from and after such date (unless the County shall default in the payment of the Redemption
Price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Bond
shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, failure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the Redemption Price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herein provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner (a) in the case of any Capital Appreciation Bond, a
new fully registered Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds of the same Series and of the same maturity in
Authorized Denominations, for a like aggregate Maturity Amount or (b) in the case of any Current
Interest Bond or Variable Rate Bond, a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same tenor, of the same
interest rate and maturity, in Authorized Denominations, in the amount of the unpaid principal.
With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the Redemption Price
of the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption shall be conditional
upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the Trustee shall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

Section 7.3.
Redemption Otherwise Than at County's Election. Whenever by the terms of
this Ordinance or an applicable Bond Order or Indenture, the Trustee is required to redeem Bonds of a
Series otherwise than at the election or direction of the County, and subject to and in accordance with the
terms of this Article and, to the extent applicable, Article V, the Trustee shall select the redemption date
of the Bonds to be redeemed unless otherwise specified in such Bond Order or Indenture, and give notice
of redemption in the manner prescribed in Section 7 .2.

Fund Installments so effected, which notice shall be given at least 45 days prior to the redemption date or
at such later date as shall be acceptable to the Trustee. Unless such notice shall have expressly stated that
redemption is conditioned upon availability of sufficient funds as described in Section 7.2, the County
shall, and hereby covenants that it will, prior to the redemption date, pay to the Trustee an amount in cash
that, in addition to any other moneys available therefor held by the Trustee, will be sufficient to redeem at
the Redemption Price thereof, plus interest accrued to the redemption date, all of the Bonds that are to be
redeemed.
Section 7.5.
Payment of Redeemed Bonds. Notice of redemption having been given in the
manner provided in Section 7.2, the Bonds so called for redemption shall become due and payable on the
redemption date stated in said notice (unless such notice shall have expressly stated that redemption is
conditioned upon availability of sufficient funds as described in Section 7.2) at the Redemption Price
applicable on said date plus interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date, and, upon presentation
and surrender thereof with a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered owner or his
duly authorized attorney, such Bonds shall be paid at the said Redemption Price plus any interest accrued
and unpaid to the redemption date. Jf, on the redemption date, moneys sufficient for the redemption of all
the Bonds to be redeemed, together with any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date, shall be
held by or on behalf of the Trustee so as to be available therefor on said date and if notice of redemption
shall have been given as aforesaid, and notwithstanding any defect therein or the Jack of actual receipt
thereof by any holder, then from and after the redemption date the Bonds so called for redemption shall
cease to bear interest and said Bonds shall no longer be considered as Outstanding hereunder. From and
after the redemption date, all moneys held by or on behalf of the Trustee for the redemption of particular
Bonds shall be held uninvested in trust for the account of the holders of the Bonds so to be redeemed

shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such Bond of such
maturity a distincti ve number for each $5,000 principal amount or Maturi ty Amount (as appropriate) of
such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at $5,000 for each
number, shall equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bonds to be
redeemed. The Bonds to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so selected;
provided that onl y so much of the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each Bond
shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so selected. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the County in writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in
the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal amount or Maturity Amount thereof to
be redeemed.
Section 7.7.
Reduction of Sinking Fund Installments. In the event of the optional
redemption by the County of less than all the Bonds of the same Series and maturity with respect to which
Sinking Fund Installments have been established, the principal amount so redeemed shall be credited
against the unsatisfied balance of future Sinking Fund Installments or the final maturity amount
established with respect to such Bonds, in such amount and against such Sinking Fund Installments or
final maturity amount as shall be determined by the County in a certificate of a County Officer filed with
the Trustee prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption of such Bonds or, in the absence of such

consented to as in this Section provided). Such ordinance shall not be effective unless and until, and shall
take effect in accordance with its terms when, (a) there shall have been filed with the Trustee (i) the
written consents of the holders of a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Bonds (determined as
provided in Section 12.3 hereof) as specified in Section 9.2, and (ii) a Counsel' s Opinion stating that such
ordinance has been duly and lawfully adopted by the Board of Commissioners in accordance with the
provisions of this Ordinance, is authorized or permitted by this Ordinance, and will be valid and binding
upon the County and enforceable in accordance with its terms upon its becoming effective as in this
Section provided, and (b) a notice shall have been mailed as hereinafter in this Section provided. Each
such consent shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of the holding, at the date of such consent,
of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall be such as is pennitted by
Section 12.2. A certificate or certificates by the Trustee filed with the Trustee that it has examined such
proof and that such proof is sufficient under the provisions of Section 9.3 shall be conclusive that the
consents have been given by the holders of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of the
Trustee. Any such consent shall be binding upon the holder of the Bonds giving such consent and upon
any subsequent holder of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such
subsequent holder thereof has notice thereof), provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section
12.2, such consent may be subsequently revoked by the holder of such Bonds giving such consent or a
subsequent holder thereof by filing such revocation with the Trustee, prior to the time when the written
statement of the Trustee hereinafter in this Section provided for is filed. The fact that a consent has not
been revoked may likewise be proved by a certificate by the Trustee filed with the Trustee to the effect
that no revocation thereof is on file with the Trustee.
At any time after the holders of a majority in principal amount (determined as provided in Section
12.3) of Outstanding Bonds shall have filed their consents to the ordinance, the Trustee shall make and
file with the County and the Trustee a written statement that the holders of such a majority in principal
amount of Outstanding Bonds have filed such consents. Such written statement shall be conclusive that
such consents have been so filed. At any time thereafter notice, stating in substance that the ordinance
(which may be referred to as an ordinance adopted by the Board of Commissioners on a stated date a
copy of which is on file with the Trustee) has been consented to by the holders of a majority in principal
amount of Outstanding Bonds and will be effective as provided in this Section, shall be given by the
County by mailing such notice to Bondholders and each Bond Insurer (but failure to mail such notice
shall not prevent such ordinance from becoming effective and binding as in this Section provided). The
County shall file with the Trustee proof of the mailing of such notice.
A record, consisting of the papers required or permitted by this Section to be filed with the
Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated. Such ordinance making such modification or
amendment shall be deemed conclusively binding upon the County, the Trustee, each Bond Insurer and
the holders of all Bonds at the expiration of 40 days after filing with the Trustee of the proof of the
mailing of such last-mentioned notice, except in the event of a final decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction setting aside such ordinance in a legal action or equitable proceeding for such purpose
commenced within such 40 day period, of which decree timely notice shall have been given to the
Trustee; provided that the Trustee and the County during such 40 day period and any such further period
during which any such action or proceeding may be pending shall be entitled in their absolute discretion
to take such action, or to refrain from taking such action, with respect to such ordinance as they may
deem expedient.

Article VIII or in the foregoing provisions of this Article, the tenns and provisions of this Ordinance or

of the holders of all the Bonds then Outstanding, such consent to be accompanied by proof of the holding
(at the date of such consent) of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall
be such as is pennitted by Section 12.2. No notice to Bondholders shall be required. No such
modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of the Trustee without
its written assent thereto.

Section 9.5.
Exclusion of Bonds. Bonds owned or held by or fo r the account of the County
shall not be deemed Outstanding and shall be excluded fo r the purpose of consent or other action or any
calculation of Outstanding Bonds provided for in this Article, and the County shall not be entitled with
respect to such Bonds to give any consent or take any other action provided for in this Article. At the

established prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in
respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and
established by a certificate signed by a County Officer stating the same, and such certificate shall be full
warrant for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Ordinance in reliance
thereon, but in its discretion the Trustee may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or
may require such further or additional evidence as to it may seem reasonable. Except as otherwise

Amount of Capital Appreciation Bonds with respect to which provision for payment was made by deposit
of such substituted Defeasance Obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Section and (b) an opinion
of nationally recognized Bond Counsel to the effect that such substitution has been duly authorized in
accordance with this Ordinance and will not affect adversely the tax exempt status of any Bonds

Louis DeRose, Acting Director, Cook County Department of Environmental Control, stated that within
the last 5 years, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the Environmental Control Committee and
the Department of Environmental Control have addressed the issues of recycling and waste management.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners adopted the Cook County Solid Waste Management Plan that
sets forth requirements for recycling and also the adoption of a Solid Waste Coordinator. Regarding the
proposed ordinance at hand, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control supports the
proposal.
Louis DeRose asked Raymond Akers, Solid Waste Coordinator, to provide infonnation and insight
regarding county recycling and waste management. He further commented that the Sheriffs Office
oversees certain waste recycling programs for the county.
Raymond Akers commented that one year ago he, Commi ssioner Quig ley and the Sheriffs Custodi al
Office met to discuss recycling and waste management. Since then a major study has been undertaken of
the court facilities. It has been proposed that compactors be installed as it was detennined that over 50%
of the Sheriff s facilities' waste was paper and cardboard . The study resulted in the recommendation that
the present cost could be reduced by separating cardboard, mixed paper and office paper. If this
recommendation proves successful , the Sheriffs Custodial Department will expand the plan to include
county facilities such as the hospitals. He said there is a bid opening scheduled for September IO, 2002.

275

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2002
Commissioner Quigley stated that he had met with fonner Environmental Control Director Charles
Lagges and Michael Finn, who determined that because there are several elected officials, different
haulers, and different facilities, all under the rubric of Cook County, the county should establish a unified
plan. Also, employees need to be both educated and given the opportunity to recycle. Cook County
should be a leader among counties by meeting the Illinois goal of recycling 25% of all waste.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether the proposed ordinance applied to only Cook County
government and not to any municipalities or unincorporated areas.
Chairman Moreno replied that the ordinance applied only to Cook County government.
Commissioner Hansen inquired what the net cost and impact on the County budget would be. He
commented that certain municipalities make a profit on their recycling. He also contrasted the problems
that Chicago is having with the blue bag program against the fact that the Mt. Prospect residential
community recycles 60% of its waste.
Louis DeRose replied that, as with the vast majority of waste management projects, he recommends that a
cost/benefit analysis be undertaken. Mistakes can occur, as in DuPage County, were the solid waste
recycling program turned out to be too much of a taxpayer burden. In contrast, there is the Illinois
ordinance controlling air pollution that resulted from an ozone study, where the legislature placed a
premium on the benefit.
Chairman Moreno pointed out that the last paragraph of the proposed ordinance recommended that a plan
be developed for the purpose of further reviewing cost.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that certain government responsibilities should not be looked at as revenue
sources, and perhaps inherently require investment, such as schools, the CTA and recycling. He stressed
that the environment needs to be protected as a place we live in, not to preserve its pristine beauty. He
pointed out the problematic nature of a cost/benefit analysis to certain situations. Commissioner Silvestri
asserted that certain issues are just matters of doing the right thing, and that this is the right thing because
an inherent responsibility of government is not just to constituents but to our children and grandchildren.
Commissioner Quigley inquired what the tipping fee is at the dump for waste hauled away from the
County.
Raymond Akers responded that waste goes to a transfer station on the South Side and that the tipping cost
is between $30 and $35 per ton.
Commissioner Quigley noted that studies show that waste removal costs go down when paper recycling is
implemented. He inquired whether this was Mr. Akers' impression.
Raymond Akers responded that this was correct, that the study on their facilities indicates that garbage
collection drops in cost by well over 50% with paper and cardboard recycling.
Commissioner Quigley stated that, in speaking with the City of Chicago's Department of the
Environment, he understood that they had a request for proposal for the recycling of high quality paper
for which they were paid a nominal amount. It also saved the City waste hauling expense. The
commissioner asked if a substantial amount of the county's waste in this building is paper and cardboard?
Louis DeRose responded that paper was at least, conservatively, 50%.

276

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2002

Commissioner Quigley noted that the household is the most expensive entity to recycle from, given the
complexity of recyclables.
Louis DeRose confinned this, adding that it is by far the most expensive, and that what the County Board
is dealing with in its facilities is mainly paper goods. He stated that the reason he brought up the DuPage
example was to illustrate that it is imperative to do a cost/benefit analysis. Man hours need to be looked
at, there needs to be a procedure and a hard financial number. There seems to be general agreement that
the financial situation most likely would range somewhere between a slight cost to possibly a profit.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the other half of this building (the City of Chicago) recycles and they
do not lose money.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the Board needs to know the financial impact of the ordinance, whether
positive or negative, before approving it. He also stated that the market for recyclables is tenuous. For
example a number of governments have stopped recycling newspaper because there is no market for it.
He stated that the Board might want to do adopt the ordinance regardless of cost because the ordinance is
a good idea; it is, however, responsible to know what to budget and what impact the ordinance will have
on taxpayers. Also the Board should pick and choose the recyclables according to cost-paper is any easy
choice, but the Industrial Engineers operation should take a look at the situation and prepare some figures
for the Board.
Raymond Akers stated that the market looks to be coming back at the moment. Quoting from the
Chicago transacted paper stock values from August I 0, 2002 they read: mixed paper $40-$45 per ton,
newspapers $65-$70 per ton, old corrugated cardboard $95-$100 per ton , and sorted white ledgers $130$ 140 per ton.
Commissioner Butler noted that when he convenes the bid openings, recycled paper is considerably more
expensive than regular paper. He asked why that is.
Commissioner Quigley responded that because the Board passed a purchasing ordinance and other
governmental bodies, there was a great cost differential given to recycled paper to encourage the market.
It worked, because there was a lot of recycled paper available. The cost of recycled paper is now on a par
with regular paper. Nationally there is a glut of recycled paper and the markets are growing. Per the
county ordinance, all of the Board's copy paper is recycled and almost all other paper is recycled. The
exception is chlorine-free paper; where there is a big cost difference. Commissioner Quigley stated that
the Board ' s hope is that the chlorine paper market will expand as well. Other elected officials are
following suit, such as the Treasurer's Office. He concluded by stating that the Purchasi ng Agent has
done a great job in moving the Board toward purchasing recycled paper.
Commissioner Butler requested that the ordinance plan include a cost history of what the Board has paid
for virgin and recycled paper over the past four years.
Commissioner Quigley stated the plan should also include the cost history Commissioner Butler
requested, a cost analysis of recycling various waste products, taking into account the offsetting savings
in waste disposal, and a societal analysis.
Chainnan Moreno stated that it is the intent of the language to develop and implement a plan to include a
cost benefit analysis.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved approval of the Substitute
Ordinance (Communication No. 239003). The motion carried.

AN ORDINANCE DIRECTING COOK COUNTY TO ADOPT LEADERSHIP IN
ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) GREEN BUILDING RATING
SYSTEM FOR ALL NEWLY CONSTRUCTED COUNTY FACILITIES (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Mike Quigley, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by William R. Moran and Herbert T. Schumann, County
Commissioners:
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), a non-profit, nationally
recognized association with membership representing all segments of the building
industry, including architects, manufacturers, government agencies, and environmentalists,
has created LEED, a green building rating system that provides specific principles and
practices, some mandatory but the majority discretionary, that may be applied during the
design, construction, and operation phases, which enable the building to be awarded points
from reaching preset standards of environmental efficiency so that it may achieve LEED
certification from the USGBC as a "green" building; and
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED,

I.
That Cook County does hereby order all of its newly constructed
buildings to employ the LEED Green Building Rating System, Version 2.0, throughout
their design, construction, and operation and does further order that each new building
must achieve the LEED silver level of certification.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
II.
That the USG BC intends to release a revised version of the LEED Green
Building Rating System every three years; and with this in consideration when beginning a
new building project, Cook County shall refer to the most current version of the LEED in
existence; and after registering with the USGBC at the design stage of the project as is
required, the County may adhere to that existing version until completion of the project,
regardless of any new LEED version that may be released at a later time.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
III.
That with specific regard to the LEED Energy and Atmosphere category,
because achieving increasing levels of energy performance above the set energy code
standards is the surest way of realizing significant operational cost savings, all buildings
must obtain a total of at least eight points.

279

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2002

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,
IV.
That Cook County also encourages the application of LEED principles
during retrofit and renovation projects of its current standing structures whenever it is
practicable.
NOTE:

This matter was also referred to the Committee on Construction. (See Comm.
No. 24 1445).

POLLUTION FROM COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by William R. Moran, County Commissioner.
Co-sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, air pollution has been shown to be a contributing factor to premature death,
aggravating asthma and is especially harmful to vulnerable groups such as children, the
elderly and people with existing lung and heart disease; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that the
Chicago metropolitan area is a severe non-attainment area for ozone and failure to conform
with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Clean Air Act standards; and
WHEREAS, non-attainment area status could lead to a loss of federal transportation
dollars, the curtailment of economic opportunities and the imposition of other federal
sanctions that could erode local control for the Chicago metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS, the twenty-five coal-fired power plants in Illinois are a significant source of
air pollution in Illinois, emitting smog-fonning nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide contributing
to particulate poll ution and carbon dioxide contributing to climate change and toxic metals;
and
WHEREAS , the coal-fired power plants of Illinois were built between 1951 and 1975
making them exempt from meeting the pollution standards of the Clean Air Act; and
WHEREAS, pollution from coal-fired power plants could be reduced by installing modem
pollution controls or burning cleaner fuels such as natural gas; and
WHEREAS, there is a threat to the health and safety of the residents of Cook County and
the State of Illinois because of the emissions from the coal-fired power plants.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the Board does hereby urge Governor George Ryan and the Illinois
General Assembly to ensure that pollution from coal-fired power plants be dramatically
reduced by passing legislation that would effectively end the "grandfathering" of these
plants from the new plant emission standards of the Clean Air Act;

280

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 5, 2002

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to
Governor George Ryan and the Illinois General Assembly.

* Referred to the Environmental Control Committee on 06-05-01.
Commissioner Moran, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to defer Communication No.
244064. The motion carried.
New Business
Chainnan Moreno stated that he will be providing a packet to all the commissioners regarding a new
technology which he was recently invited to learn about at Balboa Energy Technologies. This new
technology is the Bal-Pac Thennal Converter System, that eliminates every type of waste except radiation
through a series of burners which operate at a temperature of 1300 degrees to 2400 degrees.
Commissioner Silvestri suggested that the Committee review the Environmental Control ordinances and
resolutions to detennine what additional legislation the Committee should be seeking and also to
detennine what grant and programmatic funding is available from outside sources. Commissioner
Silvestri suggested that the Committee seek an RFQ (Request for Qualifications), RFP (Request for
Proposal) or contract for an outside analyst to assist in the review and research process.
Chairman Moreno suggested that Commissioner Silvestri submit a resolution to that effect.
Louis DeRose commented that the ordinance was drafted in the late l 960's and needs to be updated to
address current issues.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the revamping of the Environmental Control ordinances could be
modeled on the revamping of the Zoning Ordinance and Land Use Plan. Specifically, leadership efforts
could be spent integrating the 120 municipalities of various sizes into a comprehensive recycling plan.
He reiterated that the analysis should be conducted by an outside contractor.
