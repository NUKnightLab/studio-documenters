ITEM NO. B2

February 10, 2010

REVISION OF CHA TREASURY COLLECTION/DEPOSITORY POLICY
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached revised CHA Treasury
Collection/Depository policy dated December 31, 2009 attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

FUNDING
N/A

EXPLANATION
The CHA receives hundreds of checks during the course of monthly business. These checks are
received from both internal and external sources. Many are billed directly to the third party payer
through an automated non dwelling rental billing procedure established by Finance. In an effort to
formalize the collection, accounting and monitor and control of these funds Treasury has developed the
attached policy and related procedures. The primary revision revolves around the migration to an
automated remote deposit function from the old CHA lockbox procedures.
In addition it provides a framework and procedures for new revenue items and the ability to codify and
manage the collection, accounting and reconciliation of CHA miscellaneous income sources.
This policy was presented to the Investment Committee on January 27, 2010.
