 Transmitting a Communication dated November 22, 20 I 0
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board 

and 

WILLIAM T. FOLEY, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System 

In light of the recognition of Resolution 10-R-03 approved and adopted December I, 2009 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners regarding the adjustment of any Grade 24 positions we are presenting the following
Grade 24 adjustments:

Oak Forest Hospital Deputy Director
Shirley Bomar-Cole
Promotion: This equity adjustment was based on an assignment to Oak Forest Hospital in 2005. Ms. Cole
was part of an interim team and promised a raise if made permanent. The position was made permanent but
she never received the promised increase.

Oak Forest Hospital, Provident Hospital and ACHN Chief Financial Officer
John Cookinham
Error Adjustment: An error was made in the compensation when Mr. Cookinham was re-hired. This
adjustment moved him to the level he was paid when he left the hospital two years ago and also reflects
expanded System responsibilities.

Oak Forest Hospital Associate Administrator
Thomas Dohm
Re-classification: This reflects a promotion to Associate Administrator and was part of the realignment at
Oak Forest Hospital. The new organizational structure at Oak Forest Hospital presents a savings.

System Chief Psychologist
Rocco Domanico
. Promotion: This reflects a promotion to Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, assisting the Chair in
the general oversight, direction, and management for the Department.

Oak Forest Hospital Chief Operating Officer 

Sylvia Edwards 

Promotion: An equity adjustment was given based on a comparison between the position of Chief Operating 

Officers at both Provident and Oak Forest Hospitals. It was determined that the Chief Operating Officer at 

Oak Forest Hospital was performing the same job as the Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital but at 

lower pay rate. 


System Director of Talent Management 

Gina Goodson-Allen· 

Promotion: This individual applied for the position of System Director of Talent Management. She was 

promoted from Nurse Recruiter to this new position with responsibility for all recruiting including Taleo. 


Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center Pharmacist Manager 

Richard Grant 

Data base correction: This does not reflect a change in salary. There was a problem with the set-up of their 

payroll which has been corrected. 

The adjustments to the Grade 24 positions will be funded from the 110 Account. Pursuant to Resolution 09-R­
526 the System Board has authority to transfer funds in and out of the 100 Services Accounts (Personal Services),
therefore the above adjustments are within the Cook County Health & Hospitals System FY2010 appropriation.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors reviewed the above Grade 24 adjustments at
their meeting of November 19,2010.

friends, and colleagues.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Dr. Margaret G.T. Burroughs will live on in the hearts
of the many whom she touched and loved.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President, and the Cook County Board of
