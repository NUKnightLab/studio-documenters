DUTY DISABILITY CLAIMS
Ferraro, Patricia D.
This was a duty disability application filed by the officer relating to some orthopedic injuries. From the
medical reports of Dr. Levin, the orthopedic medical complaints have resolved and are no longer an issue
in this case. The officer is now seeking a heart disability benefit and wants to proceed with an application
for an occupational disease disability. On 09/25/2014, this matter was deferred.
Officer Ferraro appeared, with counsel, before the Board on her application for disability benefits. The
Board is not in the position to address an occupational disability because Officer Ferraro has not
exhausted her non-duty benefits, medical leave, with the Chicago Police Department.
Review and testimony was focused on the period the officer exhausted her IOD medical benefits with the
CPD through the current date. Medical reports were reviewed and testimony was taken.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board go into executive
session pursuant to 2 (c)(11).

cleared for employment with certain restriction.
Testimony was taken from staff member Bob Crawford, concerning this submission and conversations
had concerning her desire to be reinstated to the Chicago Police Department.
