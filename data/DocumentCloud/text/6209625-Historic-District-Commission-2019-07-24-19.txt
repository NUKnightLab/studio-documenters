HISTORIC DISTRICT: INDIAN VILLAGE
APPLICANT: CAL GARFIELD
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 5-28-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
Erected ca. 1923, the resource located at 3000 Seminole is a 2 ½-story, single-family dwelling that is
located within the Indian Village Historic District. Exterior walls are primarily clad with red brick.
Wood siding appears at the rear elevation. Windows are 6/6, double-hung units and decorative shutters
at the front elevation.

With the current application, the property owner is seeking the Commission’s approval of the following

 work items:
Rear/East Elevation
• Remove existing window well,
• Erect a new “breakfast nook” addition at the rear elevation. The footprint will measure 9’-6” x
12’-2”. The addition will feature double-hung wood windows, wood trim Painted yellowish
white), and a salvaged brick kneewall. The roof will be topped with aluminum railing and will
function as a deck/second- story porch.
• At the location of the new second-story porch, remove the existing window (salvage window),
expand opening and install a set of French doors (material no specified)
Side/North Elevation
• At first story, remove one existing window, lengthen opening to 44”, and install salvaged
window and stone sill to match remaining windows/openings
Sitework (Landscape and Hardscape)
• At rear yard, install new broken stone paver walk and new concrete walkway (sample not
provided)
• At rear garage, install new concrete pad at man door
• At new rear addition, install new planter bed with boxwoods
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed new addition is compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features of the historic home. Furthermore, the use of wood siding marks the wing as
new/differentiates it from the original fabric.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
1) Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two (2) full stories plus attic or finished
third floor within the roof; these are generally called "two-and-a-half@ story houses. Additions
to existing buildings shall be related to the existing structure; new buildings shall meet the
following standards:
(i) The eight (8) adjoining houses on the same face, excluding any houses built since 1930,
churches, schools and commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If
eight (8) houses are not available on the same block face, then one or more houses as close as
possible to being directly across the street from the proposed structure may be used. On Jefferson
Avenue, the five (5) existing houses shall be used. The height of the two (2) adjoining houses
shall be added into the total twice, with a divisor of ten (10) (seven (7) on Jefferson Avenue)
used to determine the average. Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at least
eighty (80) per cent of the resulting average; in no case shall a new building be taller than the
tallest roof height included in the computation. In determining the height of existing structures
and proposed structures, the highest point of the main roof shall be used, even where towers,
cupolas, or other minor elements may be higher.
(ii) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for
compatibility as the room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the

 same process as that described above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the
eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per cent of the average determined from existing
structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be lower than the
lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.
(2) Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age,
style, and location in a specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards above,
proportion will be established by permitting no proposed building or addition to create a front
facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than
wide; several windows are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window
openings are always subdivided, the most common window type being guillotine sash, whose
area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have approximately fifteen (15) per
cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sunporches with a very high proportion of
glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In
examples of other styles, especially those of neo-Tudor and Victorian substyles, voids are
arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally
determined by the setback from the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot
width may vary. Because of the existence of several subdivisions and their related subdivision
and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to area in the district.
In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house
placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large
houses by district standards. A more typical placement of houses of average size for the district
is at the side of the wide site, placed normally in relation to one of the adjoining houses. The rest
of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house, and the entrance is often oriented
toward that side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration,
entrances and porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display
more freedom with entrance and porch placement, with some having the main entrance at the
side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at the side of the
building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many are
partially or totally stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost never
the sole material. Wood shingle is occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the second
floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile, and wooden and asphalt
shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames and other
functional trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence of several

 subdivisions and their related deed restrictions, the exterior textures and materials may vary from
block to block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of
the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone
trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces
is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where they exist.
Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to
imitate some other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its
natural state, or painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors,
wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint
colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including "putty."
Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in use on
buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries on similar buildings may be
considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably neo-Tudor) generally have
painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Half-timbering is almost
always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or late Victorian examples may have several paint colors
on a single facade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the "earth tone" family. The
original colors of any house, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for
that house, and may provide suggestions for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings
display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but not always,
treated are porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows. Details on
Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in
stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of medieval
inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament on window
frames, door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne or late Victorian style buildings tend to have details
in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly embellishing cornices, window frames and door
frames. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A few
examples of the gambrel-type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip types,
with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist primarily on
porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes have relatively small
flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their
uniform setbacks within the blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity.
Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and where trees in rows have survived in sufficient
numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots contribute to the major
wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.

 (13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment
of individual properties is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading
to the front entrance, and sometimes with a walk at the side leading to the rear. Materials for such
walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those materials. Some front yards have
rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These unpaved terraces have
sloping embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation
plantings, often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period 1895-1930, are present
virtually without exception. Hedges between properties, and ornamental front yard fences or
hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually extinct in the district, though once the
dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period, though only a
disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice. Plantings of new trees should be
directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows of large trees on the front yards
and "tree lawns." Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear garages exist, but alleyfacing garages are common, particularly in the southern portion of the district. Where alleyfacing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to the succession of front lawns.
Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in the district,
and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots are
usually landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally contain paved
areas such as a tennis court. The street right-of-way of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement
width of between twenty-four (24) and twenty-nine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm
areas, which adds to the generous ambience of the urban landscape of the district. Street
pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in portions of the district. Alleys are
frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley facing garages are common. Fencing ranges
widely in type; fencing in public view was generally designed to compliment the style, design
material, and date of the residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of
vacant land, a city park, school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where
an original or early arrangement of a house and grounds included and still includes landscaped
lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots are significant
landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and
style to style; most houses have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of
facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Facade elements
have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Large wings at the front are atypical,
while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and sunporches, are common.
Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of the windows
within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their
related subdivision and deed restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district,
though they are consistent within each block or area. The varying designs of the houses,

 occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback
line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within each
block or area a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve (12) per
cent or less in the case of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per cent to
thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by
what is typical and appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have
simple, rectangular facades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as "Queen
Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have facades complicated by gables, bays,
slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.
(20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street, it
is not unusual for an entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot or
corner house.
The street facade in these cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages
are frequently oriented either toward an alley or a side street; almost all garages are detached and
at the rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they are
at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are generally
not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired
buildings are generally symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally
asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets,
its hierarchy of walls of continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has
an urban, substantial, low density residential character.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed new addition is compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features of the historic home. The use of wood siding marks the wing as new/differentiates
the addition from the original fabric. Additionally, the lengthening of the side elevation window, the
addition of a set of French doors at the second story, and the proposed sitework will not result in the
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for the
proposed project because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, Standard
number 2). The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and space that characterize a property shall be avoided and 9). New
additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features
and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the
old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing
to protect the integrity of the property and its environment
