The Village intends to use each of these three buildings for industrial and
commercial development. They are not part of our 138th Street Corridor Plan;
however, they are adjacent to the southern border of the Plan area and have
similar characteristics as those properties in the Plan area. The Village intends
to develop the properties in the same spirit as the 138th Street Corridor Plan in
order to expand tax revenues. Currently, there is no third?party-applicant for any
of the parcels.

The Village agrees to report the status of each parcel to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development annually for five consecutive years or
until the intended use is complete, whichever is last. Also, the Village will apply
for tax exempt status on each parcel once a tax deed is obtained until a
developer is designated.

The Village has retained the Law Offices of Kenneth W. Pilota and shall bear all
costs to proceed to tax deed and perform all legal and other activities associated
with this program.
