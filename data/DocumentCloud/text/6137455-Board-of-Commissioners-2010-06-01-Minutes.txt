PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REGARDING ADMINISTRATION OF THE
PRESIDENT’S OFFICE OF EMPLOYMENT TRAINING (POET)
WHEREAS, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) administers
federally funded workforce programs in Illinois through 26 Local Workforce Investment Areas
(LWIA’s); and
WHEREAS, one of these areas LWIA 7 located in south suburban Cook County is managed by the
President’s Office of Employment Training (POET) with the President being designated the Chief Elected
Official; and
WHEREAS, in June of 2005, DCEO placed LWIA 7, administered by POET, on “high risk” status due
to chronic fiscal and programmatic deficiencies and worked in conjunction with POET to resolve said
deficiencies; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois took these and subsequent measures after repeated warnings from the
U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) to resolve problems with POET or face federal penalties; and
WHEREAS, despite training, technical assistance and attempts to negotiate a voluntary transfer of
responsibilities for administering LWIA 7 to a third party, DCEO has reported that problems identified in
2005 have persisted; and
WHEREAS, said problems have contributed to POET returning nearly $10 million of funds over the last
five years to DCEO, which were designated to assist unemployed and low income residents hampering
efforts by local agencies to deliver services to this population; and
WHEREAS, current funding levels should allow POET to serve at least 15,000 needy residents;
however, records indicate that fewer than 1,500 may be receiving services; and

11

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010
WHEREAS, LWIA 8, the other local workforce investment area located in Cook County, which covers
the northern part of the county has been under the direct control of the State with the Governor designated
as the Chief Elected Official since their local administrator was decertified in 2004; and
WHEREAS, the State through DCEO is seeking to have a third party assume administration of fiscal and
programmatic duties for LWIA 7 to institute sound fiscal and programmatic structures as well as
consolidate LWIA 7 with LWIA 8 with the goal of ultimately transitioning the re-combined area back to
Cook County within a two year time frame; and
WHEREAS, the voluntary cooperation of the County’s administration during this transition will enable
the President to remain as the designated Chief Elected Official and consequently allow the County to be
in position to preside over and manage the newly re-organized and re-combined Local Workforce
Investment Area of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, failure to cooperate with the State’s plan will afford DCEO the power to reorganize under
powers granted to the Governor by federal law and also change designation of the Chief Elected Official
from the President to the Governor; and
WHEREAS, said scenario will also likely result in further returned monies as well as federal penalties.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the President to accept the terms of the State of Illinois as presented through DCEO to reorganize POET through a designated third party and fully cooperate with said re-organization plan in
order to ensure that the combined workforce investment area will be transitioned back to Cook County
within the two year time frame.

Proposed Substitute Resolution sponsored by Edwin Reyes, Joseph Mario Moreno and
Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by Earlean Collins and
Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING BOYCOTT OF ARIZONA
AND ARIZONA-BASED BUSINESSES
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona adopted a controversial new law, SB 1070, which makes

50

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010
it a state-level crime for someone to be in the country illegally and criminalizes the failure
to carry immigration documents at all times by lawful foreign residents or otherwise
hereinafter referred to as the “Arizona Immigration Law”; and
WHEREAS, since SB 1070 was signed into law, the Arizona Legislature has passed HB
2162, making amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law which are an improvement,
but far from ideal; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law imposes a requirement for police officers to
question those they suspect may be in the United States illegally when they are lawfully in
contact with such people while enforcing any other law; and
WHEREAS, the Arizona Immigration Law has been rebuked by the nation’s top law
enforcement community, which found that local police enforcement of immigration laws
would likely lead to racial profiling and have a negative effect and undermine the level of
trust and cooperation between local police and immigrant communities; and
WHEREAS, the recent amendments to the Arizona Immigration Law try to eliminate
racial profiling by no longer allowing race, color or national origin as a factor to be
considered when forming a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the United States
illegally; and
WHEREAS, while removing race, color or national origin as a factor to be considered is a
good idea, the problem is the law now contains no guidance or definition of what criteria
should be used to form a reasonable suspicion that a person is in the United States illegally,
which can still lead to racial profiling; and
WHEREAS, the State of Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist
politics before public safety, and betrays our most deeply-held American values; and
WHEREAS, as it did two decades ago when the State of Arizona refused to observe Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the State of Arizona has again chosen to isolate itself from
the rest of the United States of America; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State
of Arizona, is to assure that the State of Arizona’s isolation is tangible rather than
symbolic.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Board of Commissioners hereby finds the Arizona Immigration
Law to be offensive to the values of the taxpayers of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this
Board of Commissioners hereby boycotts the State of Arizona and Arizona-based
businesses until the Arizona Immigration Law is repealed or invalidated; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
County will not enter into any contracts with the State of Arizona or with any companies
headquartered in the State of Arizona nor shall the County renew any current contracts
with the State of Arizona or with companies headquartered in the State of Arizona when
they expire; and

the executive power over immigration matters; and

America; and
WHEREAS, Flagstaff and Tucson Arizona, have filed lawsuits and other municipalities, including
Phoenix, are considering lawsuits against the State of Arizona to repeal SB 1070 (Chapter 113) that
imposes an unfunded mandate to carry out the responsibilities of the federal government; and
WHEREAS, many cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and Milwaukee are considering or
have passed legislation to ban Arizona state-based businesses; and
WHEREAS, the most appropriate response, by the taxpayers of Cook County to the State of Arizona, is
to assure that the State of Arizona’s isolation is tangible rather than symbolic; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, the 2nd largest county in the nation with a budget of over 3 billion dollars
and a diverse population of more than five million, should be a leader in protecting the rights of people.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this

PRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting
a Communication, dated May 14, 2010 from Joe Sova, Chief, Bureau of Human
Resources:
Comptroller Connie Kravitz and I have discussed how best to produce the Human
Resource Activity report as outlined in New Item #5 approved by the Board of
Commissioners on May 4, 2010. She and I will be conducting a meeting next week with
key members of our staffs as well as Nathan Paige of the Department for Management of
Information Systems to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate and
timely Human Resource Activity report on an ongoing basis.
The Comptroller currently produces a quarterly report that is sent to the Board but the
report is limited to hires and terminations. Connie and I are committed to producing the
new Human Resource Activity Report but I respectfully request an extension of a couple
weeks for us to discuss how best we can leverage current database systems that will
capture all activity for the Grades 17 thru 24 executive, administrative, and professional

54

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010
employees across all of Cook County.
Secondly, I would like your perspective on whether producing the report on a less frequent
basis (as opposed to generating it within seventy-two (72) hours of a change) would be
acceptable.

PRODUCTION OF CONTRACT PAYMENTS REPORT, AND HUMAN
RESOURCE ACTIVITY REPORT. Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17,
2010 from Constance Kravitz, County Comptroller:
New Item No. 4 (Ordinance No. 10-O-23) and New Item No. 5 (Ordinance No. 10-O-24)
approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010 requires the
Comptroller to provide the County Board with specific information and reports regarding
contract payments and salary data in a specific time frame.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-23
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-23, the Cook County Comptroller is responsible for
providing to the Cook County Board of Commissioners various payment reports within 72
hours of any payments involving an expenditure of less than $100,000 that was approved
by the Purchasing Agent and of payments made pursuant to contracts for professional and
managerial services for Cook County, including the separately Elected Officials, which
involve an expenditure of less than $25,000 that were approved by the Purchasing Agent.
The Comptroller has been diligently working with the Comptroller’s Accounts Payable
Department (A/P) and the Department for Management of Information Systems (MIS) to
produce an accurate and timely payment report. While the specific data related to contract
payments is generally included in our JD Edwards System, there is limited ability to pull a
canned report such as a check registry report. Additionally, the report that is extracted is
not in a sortable format and written duplications may occur when a Purchase Order (PO)
has multiple lines. The Office of the Comptroller has been working with MIS to create a
special report that would address such issues.
Once these reporting issues are resolved, it is projected that the Comptroller’s Office will
be able to issue such reports within the 72 hour timeframe. The Office of the Comptroller
prints checks weekly, on Thursdays and as a result, it is anticipated that the report pursuant
to Ordinance 10-O-23 would then be available the following Monday or Tuesday.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-23 will be resolved
in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple
of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-24
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24, the Cook County Comptroller in partnership with the

55

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010
Chief of Human Resources is required to make detailed specific Human Resource Activity
Reports as outlined in the Ordinance.
I have been working with the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the Director of
MIS to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate and timely Human
Resource Activity Report. The applicable parties are meeting to determine how each of
the parties database systems capture employee information and whether a new report
should be created to address the human resource activity information requested by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
The Office of the Comptroller will continue to work with MIS and the Bureau of Human
Resources to create a special report that would address and report the information
requested under Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-24 will be resolved
in a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple
of weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.

PRESIDENT'S OFFICE
VETO
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 24, 2010 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised, that in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code and for the reasons stated herein, I hereby veto New Item #5, as amended, passed by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on May 18, 2010 wherein the County Board mandated County Board
approval prior to adjusting a salary of a Grade 24 employee.
In accordance with Section 2-6008, I hereby transmit my veto of New Item #5, as amended and approved
on May 18, 2010 and request that this veto message be placed on the County Board Meeting Agenda for
the next meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, June 1, 2010.
New Item #5, as amended passed on May 18, 2010 by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. This
Ordinance requires County Board approval prior to adjusting the salary of a Grade 24 employee. This
Ordinance requires Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs or Department Heads to place a request to adjust the
salary of a Grade 24 employee, including the rational and justification for the request on the County
Board Agenda prior to implementing an adjustment; once on the Board Agenda, the matter can be taken
up for immediate consideration or may be referred to the Finance Committee for a hearing.
Requiring County Board approval prior to implementing a salary adjustment to a Grade 24 position,
whether said adjustment is an increase or decrease in salary, will inhibit the operations of the County
Board President and potentially the Offices of the separately Elected Officials. This May 18, 2010
Ordinance passed by the County Board is an attempt by the Legislative Branch to interfere with the
personnel operations of the Office of the President and the Offices of the separately Elected Officials and
will likely result in the pre-empting of employment by the County Board President.
This Ordinance further allows the County Board to refer to the Finance Committee requests from County
Elected Officials, Bureau Chiefs and Department Heads to adjust the salary of a Grade 24 position.
Referring such requests for adjustment to the Finance Committee will slow the pace of County operations
will prevent the timely hire of an individual. The Ordinance also requires the County Board or Finance

62

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010
Committee to approve or disapprove the request for adjustment, essentially putting the County Board in
the position to control the hiring of staff that is otherwise the statutory responsibility of the President.
This Ordinance interferes with the hiring authority of the President and is an attempt to control personnel
matters and the operations under the jurisdiction of the President and potentially the separately Elected
Officials.
The May 18, 2010 action by the County Board in passing New Item #5, as amended will result in a
burden on the operations of the County Board President, slow the pace of County government and
infringe on the President’s statutory right to hire. For this reason, I urge you to reconsider your support of
New Item #5, as amended.

ORDINANCE
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOHN P. DALEY, BRIDGET GAINER,
TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER, LARRY SUFFREDIN,
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, GREGG GOSLIN,
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, EDWIN REYES AND PETER N. SILVESTRI
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 34
Finance, of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 34-42.

Grade 24 Salary Adjustments.

In the event of a request from an Elected Official, Bureau Chief or Department
Head to adjust a salary of a Grade 24 employee made pursuant to Resolution 10-R-03,
such request shall be placed on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled Board
meeting, along with supporting documentation explaining the rationale and justification
for the request, including but not limited to job title and compensation, for immediate
consideration or for referral to the Committee on Finance.
If referred to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on Finance shall hold a
hearing to consider the appropriateness of such request at its next meeting following the
referral to Committee. The Committee shall by roll-call vote approve of disapprove the
requested employment action.

Commissioner Sufferdin, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the communication be

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $18,840.00 $12,560.00 and extend for
two (2) months, Contract No. 08-84-14 Rebid with Cavalcade Communications Group, Inc., Chicago,

The Office of the Secretary to the Board and the Department of Public Affairs and
Communications completed the selection process for a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a
new contract for this service, and is awaiting the final review of this contract by the
appropriate County agencies so the new contract can be implemented. Because this
review will be completed after June 1, our office is requesting this extension to continue
recording the meetings.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $12,560.00. Contract extension: March 1, 2010 through May 31, 2010. (018224 Account).
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1)
Prior notice to public; agendas. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that request of the Secretary to the

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 5, 2010 from
MARK KILGALLON, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Canon Business Solutions,
Lake Success, New York, for the leasing of 350 multifunction photocopiers on a cost per copy basis. All
County departments participate in the photocopier leasing program. The following offices will be
receiving equipment from this contract: Sheriff, Judiciary, Clerk of the Circuit Court, State's Attorney,
County Clerk, Assessor, Board of Review, Recorder of Deeds, and Offices under the President. All
equipment will be capable of network printing, faxing, and scanning. Cost per copy includes the use of
the equipment, maintenance services and all supplies (excluding paper). Request for Proposals (RFP)
were issued resulting in the submission of five (5) responses.

64

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 1, 2010

Reason:

Canon Business Solutions has been selected as the lowest cost qualified proposer based on the
Request for Proposals. Evaluation of the proposals was based on the following criteria: (1)
proposed cost per copy, (2) firm's experience and qualifications, (3) technical and equipment
information, (4) firm's installation and maintenance plan, (5) firm's billing and reporting
information, and (6) firm's ability to meet the MBE/WBE requirements of the County. The
equipment that will be replaced is currently provided by Canon Business Solutions.
It has been determined that leasing of multifunction photocopier equipment saves the County
an average of $900,000.00 annually versus purchasing and maintaining the same equipment.
Additionally, photocopier leasing contracts allow the County to keep up with technology by
replacing the equipment every five (5) years. Finally, multifunction photocopier equipment
allows departments to eliminate stand alone printers and fax machines which reduce capital,
maintenance, and supply costs.
This contract will replace the existing multifunction photocopier contract which will expire on
November 14, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $3,043,860.00 (FY 2010 - $50,000.00; FY 2011 - $608,772.00; FY 2012 $608,772.00; FY 2013 - $608,772.00; FY 2014 - $608,772.00; and FY 2015 - $558,772.00). Contract
period: November 15, 2010 through November 14, 2015. (490-630 and 499-630 Accounts). Requisition
No. 04900099.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 funds.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peracia, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be

Risk Management is an essential area of specialized effort which focuses on reducing the types of
situations which may lead to litigation and liability. A good risk management program saves the County
and the System money by preventing incidents which increase costs in a variety of areas and by assisting
the facilities to comply with specialized regulatory and accreditation requirements. There are very few
staff currently assigned to perform risk management activities within the CCHHS affiliates; for example,
Stroger Hospital eliminated its department of risk management a few years ago and assigned limited risk
management functions (facilitating service of process and circulating discovery requests) upon the already
over-stretched quality assurance department. In response to this situation, the CCHHS hired this attorney
to establish an effective risk management program throughout the System and to direct the activities of
affiliates in this area. This individual is a highly qualified attorney with years of relevant experience who
has worked in, established and directed risk management programs in a number of Chicago area hospitals

(1) GRADE 24 NEW HIRE
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 20, 2010 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
LETTER
May 20, 2010
Chairman Daley
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street, Floor 3M
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear Chairman Daley:
As you know, In 1999, the ACLU filed a class action lawsuit, Doe v. Cook County, No 99 C
3945, regarding inadequate conditions of confinement at the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center (JTDC). After a series of federal court orders, including the Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA), the Agreed Supplemental Order (ASO) and the Modified Implementation
Plan (MIP), Cook County entered into a settlement of the lawsuit. This agreement, reached on
August 14, 2007, provided for the Appointment of the Transitional Administrator (TA) and
the creation of the Office of the Transitional Administrator (OTA). The OTA has the
authority and responsibility to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the
aforementioned federal court orders.
Pursuant to the Order appointing the Transitional Administrator, I am deemed an agent of the
Federal Court and specifically appointed with the authority and responsibility to put into
place at the JTDC qualified management to implement the requirements of the MOA, the
ASO, and the MIP. Additionally, I have the power to establish personnel policies, to create,
abolish, or transfer positions; and hire, promote, transfer, and evaluate management and staff
of the JTDC. Thus, pursuant to this authority vested to me, I have made two Grade 24
adjustments and one Grade 24 new hire. These Grade 24 positions were included in every
Budget since 2008 and approved by the Board accordingly. It is my understanding that these
positions were listed in the budget for the Office of the Chief Judge and I want to clarify that
these Grade 24 positions were created by me, as the Transitional Administrator. Submitted is
the Court Order appointing me as the Transitional Administrator.
Sincerely,
Earl L. Dunlap
Transitional Administrator
Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
