PROPOSED RESOLUTION

REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS COMMITTEE OF THE
COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO DISCUSS THE PRACTICES OF
COOK COUNTY HEALTH (CCH) RELATED TO COUNTYCARE FINANCES AS
DISCUSSED IN THE INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT (IIG 18-0100)

WHEREAS, in 2012, the State of Illinois obtained a federal Section 1115 demonstration waiver to get an
early start on Medicaid expansion as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act, which allowed
adults living in Cook County and making less than roughly $15,860 (or 133% below the federal poverty
level) to get Medicaid; and I

WHEREAS, the initiative was named ?CountyCare? and was designed to help the state and CCH build
capacity and experience to support implementation of the of?cial Medicaid expansion in January 2014, as
more than 618,000 uninsured adults were estimated to be eligible for the Medicaid expansion in
Illinois, with over 341,000 of them residing in Cook County; and I

WHEREAS, as part of this initiative CountyCare had to handle management of its waiver from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and needed a third party to evaluate the effectiveness of
the waiver showing that it enrolled enough patients; that those patients were geographically acceptable
enough to encourage providers to participate in the plan; and showing that CountyCare could deliver and
generate enough medically necessary claims processed through the state Medicaid agency; and

WHEREAS, the program is considered crucial to the ?nancial survival of the health system, and to the
county. itself, which subsidizes the system with tax dollars; Before CountyCare, the system historically had
been spending $500 million to $600 million a year for uncompensated care; and

WHEREAS, in 2014, CountyCare transformed its health plan to also accept traditional Medicaid
populations and as a result .is now one of the largest Medicaid managed health plans in the State;
CountyCare currently has a healthcare network of approximately. 4,500 primary care providers, 15,000
specialists, 50 hospitals, and 335,000 Members; and

WHEREAS, on June 21st, 2019, the Of?ce of the Independent Inspector General (011G) released a
report on CountyCare Healthcare Expenses (IIG 18-0100), which was prompted after receiving
information during the course of their review of CCH bad debt expense and claim denials; and

WHEREAS, the OIIG report identi?ed key managerial decisions and ?nancial policies associated with
large volumes of unpaid healthcare expenses related to the CountyCare program including outstanding
liabilities of $701 million for the 2018 ?scal year-end compared to the small amounts the State tends to
owe CountyCare at the end of the year and according to the report can only pay 2% of the outstanding
liabilities; and

WHEREAS, according to the report, CountyCare does not generate enough revenue to pay all the
outstanding healthcare expenses at the end of the ?scal year and has a practice of using subsequent
period budgetary funds to pay prior period bills, such that CountyCare?s unpaid healthcare expenses are
steadily growing and could become too large to pay without an extraordinary contribution from another
funding source in the future; and

WHEREAS, the report further states that routinely changes revenue and expense ?gures between
CCH's operating units Stroger, CountyCare, etc.) to reach desired ?nancial goals for CountyCare
and Stroger Hospital in CCH's and annual ?nancial reports, and as a result, these practices make
it dif?cult for the CCH Board and Cook County Board of Commissioners to have a sound baseline to
evaluate the performance of the individual operating units that make-up and

WHEREAS, CCH has stated that they are absolutely con?dent" in the integrity of the CountyCare
program and will respond in a comprehensive manner in time; and

WHEREAS, with the FY2020 budget process already started, the time is now to address this report and
provide answers to the Board and the Public;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that a meeting of the Health and Hospitals Committee be convened to discuss the
CountyCare program and ?nancial and reporting practices of Cook County Health as it relates said
program; and I

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the OIIG appear before the Committee and be prepared to
explain its review of CountyCare, CCH, and the ?ve report recommendations; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Financial Of?cer and any other pertinent
representatives of Cook County Health, as well as the Independent Hospital Board appear before the
Committee and be prepared to update the Committee on the contents of the 011G report and the
relationship between CountyCare and CCH, and be prepared to answer questions on the same.
