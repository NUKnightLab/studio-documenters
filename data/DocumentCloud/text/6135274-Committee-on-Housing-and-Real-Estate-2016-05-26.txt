CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF
PLANNING DEVELOPMENT

LETTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER

We are pleased to submit the 2016 First Quarter Progress Report, which presents the Department of Planning
and Development?s progress on the goals set forth in the City?s Five-Year Housing Plan. With this report we
begin the third year of the plan, Bouncing Bar/e, which covers the years 2014?18.

During the first quarter of 2016 the City approved funding for two multi?family development projects and
launched two new homeownership initiatives: a homebuyer assistance program offering cash support for down
payment and closing costs and a home improvement grant program for current homeowners living along the
new 606 Trail on the Northwest Side.

As we do at the beginning of each year, the Department is also releasing estimates of housing production under
our programs for the full year of 2016. This year we expect to deploy more than $250 million to support over
8,000 units of housing through programs in the following three categories:

- To Create andPrereroeA?fordable Rental Units: $204.6 million to assist 5,610 units
To Promote and 5250170? Homeowners/11p: $32.5 million to assist 432 units
To Improve and Preserve Homer: $13.1 million to assist 2,007 units

The Department?s resources also encompass over $3 million for other initiatives, including delegate agency
programs that support our housing production efforts.

To help readers better understand the production tables included in these quarterly reports, we have included
a user?s guide to the Department?s housing development and preservation programs. The guide is organized
according to the three program categories noted above; it offers a brief description of each program along with
information about funding sources and reporting methodologies.

The Department of Planning and Development (DPD) is the lead agency for the City?s affordable housing,
housing preservation and homebuyer assistance programs. DPD also promotes economic development by help-
ing existing businesses grow and attracting new industry to the city, and it coordinates all of our zoning, land
use planning, sustainability and historic preservation initiatives.

The unresolved budget impasse in State government has created particular problems in the affordable housing
sphere for both local g0vernment and our community partners who provide direct services in Chicago?s neigh-
borhoods. We at DPD could not succeed in our work without the ongoing support and cooperation of these
valued partners, together with elected of?cials, state and federal agencies and other community stakeholders.
Through these efforts, we will continue to move forward in creating and preserving affordable housing for the
people of Chicago.

Multi?family Rehab and New Construction

Magnolia Court Apartments

On February 10 the City Council approved a $1.5 million Multi?family Loan to
support the rehab of a 60?unit affordable rental development in Uptown. The $4.3 million
renovation of Magnolia Court Apartments will feature a new roof, upgraded kitchen and
bathroom cabinets, and new energy?efficient appliances. The threevstory courtyard building,
located at 4878 N. Magnolia Ave. in the 47th Ward, was originally constructed in the 19205.

The City?s assistance will enable the developer, Magnolia
Court Apartments LLC, to preserve fifty of the units for
residents earning up to 60 percent of area median income;
the other ten apartments will be offered at market rents.
The loan will be contingent upon the developer and HUD
executing a minimum 15?year renewal of an expiring project-
based Section 8 contract on the affordable units.

 

Trianon Lofts

On February 10 the Council also authorized construction of a new residential and retail
complex as the next step in the continuing redevelopment of a 504?unit Section 8 develop?
ment in Woodlawn. Trianon Lofts, to be developed by Preservation of Affordable Housing,
Inc. (POAH), will include 24 rental units, 7,000 square feet of ground??oor retail space and
24 outdoor parking spaces. Half of the apartments in the four-story structure will be made
available to households earning up to 80 percent of area median income; the other units will
be rented at market rates.

The $12.5 million project, to be located at 803 E. 615t St. in the 20th Ward, will be
assisted by the City through a $2.5 million Multi?family Loan. Other funding sources
will include $3.3 million in New Markets Tax Credit equity, $3.3 million in HUD Choice
Grant funds and a $3 million private construction loan. The new building will be named
for the Trianon Ballroom, which was located nearby until its demolition in 1967.

PROMOTION AND SUPPORT
OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

In 2016, the Department of Planning and Development expects to commit nearly $33 million
to help more than 400 households achieve or sustain homeownership. DPD initiatives support
the construction of new homes, the acquisition and rehab of deteriorated and abandoned
properties and financing programs for home purchase and rehabilitation.

During the first quarter, the Department committed almost $6 million to support 85 units,
achieving 18% of the 2016 homeownership resource allocation goal and 20% of the
homeownership unit goal.

The Department utilizes a variety of programs to support and promote homeownership.

Mayor Announces New Financial Assistance
For Chicago Home Buyers

Low? and middle-income families seeking to buy homes in Chicago neighborhoods are now
eligible for ?nancial assistance under a new citywide initiative announced by Mayor Emanuel
on January 25. The Home Buyer Assistance Program will help make homeownership possible
for working families and individuals by providing support for down payment and closing
costs.

The program, which is administered by the Chicago Infrastructure Trust, can be applied to
the purchase of any owner?occupied property up to four units, including single?family homes,
town homes or condominiums. It may also be used to refinance an existing mortgage.

Qualifying home buyers can receive grants of up to 7 percent of purchase price, based on
income. Depending on whether they select an or Freddie Mac-insured loan, home
buyers may have annual incomes of up to approximately $133,000. Since the typical home in
Chicago is sold for $250,000, an eligible family could receive a grant of more than $12,000 to
help cover down payment and closing costs. First+time buyers must complete a home buyer
education course before they can participate in the program. Applications will be accepted by
authorized lending institutions on a first?come, first?served basis.

The Home Buyer Assistance Program is one of the new initiatives launched by the City under
Mayor Emanuel?s Five?Year Housing Plan, which will invest $1.3 billion between 2014 and
2018 to create or support more than 41,000 units of housing. The City is providing the ini?
tial $1 million to launch the program, which is expected to become selfrsustaining over time.

IMPROVEMENT AND PRESERVATION
OF HOMES

In 2016, the Department of Planning and Development expects to commit over $13 million
to assist more than 2,000 households repair, modify or improve their homes.

During the ?rst quarter, DPD committed almost $700,000 in resources to support over 100
units, achieving 5% of the 2016 improvement and preservation resource allocation goal and
5% of the improvement and preservation unit goal. These low utilization rates are due in
part to the usual seasonal slowdown in our home repair programs, along with the hold?up
of certain funds due to the continuing State budget impasse.

The Department utilizes a variety of programs for home improvement and preservation.
major programs are brie?y summarized below, along with an explanation of how we

New Home Improvement Grants
Offered to 606 Trail Homeowners

A new home improvement initiative launched this year by DPD is designed to assist low? and

Trail Homeowners Forgivable Loan Program is open to qualified owner?occupants of single-
family properties within two blocks of the 2.7?mile trail running through the Logan Square,
Humboldt Park and West Town neighborhoods.

The forgivable loans can cover up to $25,000 in exterior work affecting roofs, porches, siding,
painting, tuck pointing, windows and doors. Loan funds can also be used to address health
and safety hazards involving plumbing, heating or electrical systems.

The program is being funded through a $1,000,000 allocation under the Neighborhood
Lending Program, which is administered by Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago
(NHS). To qualify, property owners must earn no more than 80 percent of area median
income?approximately $60,800 for a family of four?and the property must be their prin?
cipal residence. Applications will be accepted by NHS on a first~come, first?served basis as

long as funds are available.

AND OTHER ISSUES

Neighborhood Stabilization Program Update

Although the City no longer is using NSP grant funds to acquire additional buildings for
rehab, we will continue to report on the status of all NSP properties during 2016 until the
?nal units have been completed.

Through the end of the ?rst quarter, a total of 879 units in 199 properties have been acquired
using funds from Chicago?s three NSP grants. Construction has started on 826 units in 171
properties; 859 units (190 properties) have been ?nished or are nearing completion. One
hundred ninetyeone units (139 properties) have been sold to qualified homebuyers, and 46
multi?family properties containing 635 units have been fully rented out. A list of all proper-
ties that have been assisted through NSP can be found in the Appendix. An updated version
of this list is available at

NOTE: Beginning in 2013, we report on ARO proiects when they have paid their fee-in-Iieu or have filed the affordable housing covenant securing construction of the required af'FordabIe
units This does not necessarily mean these units have begun construction, but does imply that they were ready to begin construction, since the building permit cannot be released until the
covenant has been recorded Note also that totals represent all proiects approved by City Council after the 2007 updates to the ARC.
