THE DETROIT MEDIA GROUP, LLC

LOCATION:

10 Witherrell St. Between: Woodward Ave. and Broadway
St. in a B5-H Zone (Major Business District-Historic) –
Council District #6

LEGAL DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY:

E WOODWARD 22 PLAT OF SEC 7
GOVERNOR & JUDGES PLAN L34 P544 DEEDS, W C R 1/9 62.16 IRREG

PROPOSAL:

The Detroit Media Group, LLC request to overcome the presumption
abandonment to erect a 13,875 square foot changeable sign copy advertising sign at 10
Witherell approved in BZA Case 83-04 and BSEED issued a permit for such signage February
10, 2006 in a B5- H zone (Major Business District – Historic). This case is appealed because once
abandoned, a nonconforming use shall not be re-established or resumed, except in
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 61-15-18 of this Code. Any subsequent use or
occupancy of the structure or open land must comply with the regulations of the district
where it is located and all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance. On
December 12, 2017, the Detroit Media Group applied to BSEED for a permit to erect a 5,980
square foot advertising sign at 10 Witherell, and on June 13 2018, DMG petitioned the BZA to
the same effect. BSEED’s review of DMG’s application and supporting documentation, as well
as of its own permitting records, has revealed the following: 1. The petitioner in BZA Case
83-04 failed to timely secure the necessary permitting by July 1, 2005, 2. No advertising has
been posted at 10 Witherell since 2012, 3. No application for annual sign licensing to operate
advertising signage has been received by BSEED since 2014, 4. Wall anchors, lighting and
other necessary structural elements have not been maintained and 5. The art mural depicting
whales and other sea life has been maintained at 10 Witherell in place of any advertising
signage, furthermore a recent inspection of the building exterior conducted on August 8, 2018
confirmed that no advertising signage or supporting infrastructure is currently erected,
therefore under Section 61-15-21 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, these findings constitute
evidence of abandonment of the advertising sign use of 10 Witherell, and based on its review
BSEED has determined that the use of 10 Witherell for advertising signage is PRESUMED TO
HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. (Sections 61-15-21 Loss of nonconformity status; abandonment
and 61-15-21 (#3 Overcoming Presumption of Abandonment) - Loss of nonconformity status;
abandonment).AP
