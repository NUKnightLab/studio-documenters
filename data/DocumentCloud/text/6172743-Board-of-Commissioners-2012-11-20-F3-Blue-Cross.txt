GENERAL BACKGROUND

The current contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) for employee healthcare plan
bene?ts (medical and dental) will terminate on December 31, 2012 and must be extended or
replaced effective January 1, 2013. The US. Department of Housing and Urban Development
has previously authorized the CHA to utilize its insurance Broker of Record to solicit
competitive insurance bids on behalf of the CHA.

Although CHA did not receive guaranteed medical premium rates for FY 2013, CHA estimated
an increase of $450,000 for FY 2013 for an amount not-to-exceed $5,400,000.00 based on
projected increases in medical insurance premiums for FY2013 for all BCBS clients and a
possible enrollment (employee headcount) increase during the plan year for 2013. Essentially,
medical renewal rates are based on claims experience (amount paid out by insurer compared to
the premiums paid), promptness of payment of premiums, the size of the group and the number
of months of claims experience used to evaluate renewals. The trend factor for BCBS renewals
are currently averaging at 12.5% across organizational size similar to CHA. However, after
experiencing $1.2 million in ?shock? claims and the migration of 42 participants from the HMO
to PPO plan, our costs increased by 21%.

The not-to-exceed amounts for both medical and dental bene?t plans re?ect the total amount of
premiums needed to cover the projected headcount of eligible participants and the
eligible participants of af?liates. As in previous years, af?liates will reimburse
CHA for 100% of the premiums (approximately $500,000) needed to cover their eligible
participating employees for the above referenced Employee Health Bene?t Plans during the term
of these contracts, which will be an offset to the total not-to-exceed amount of premiums.

Based upon the above considerations and the recommendation of management, it is in the
best interest of the CHA to (I) authorize the Chief Executive Of?cer or his designee to amend
and extend Contract No. 11070 with Blue Cross Blue Shield for one year extension for FY2013
for medical bene?ts and employee dental bene?ts and (2) approve funding therefor in an
amount not to exceed $5,985,074.00 and $288,938.00 for medical and dental bene?ts,
respectively, for an aggregate amount of $6,274,012.00 for FY2013, covering eligible
participants of the CHA and eligible participants of the CHA af?liates.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The Executive Vice-President of FinancefChief Financial Of?cer concurs with the
recommendation to amend and extend Contract No. 11070 with Blue Cross Blue Shield.

The CEO/President recommends that the Board of Commissioners approve the recommendation
to amend and extend Contract No. 1 1070 with Blue Cross Blue Shield.11.. . .2, Crisp mg. 2? - 5.1m.
