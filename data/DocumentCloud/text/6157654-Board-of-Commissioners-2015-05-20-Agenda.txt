BOARD AGENDA

Sec. 66-60. - Annual requirements.
(a) A grantee is required to provide the following documentation to the Director prior to each July 1
falling within the term, or as set forth below:
(1) A current certificate of insurance, or other evidence acceptable to the Director of Risk
Management, evidencing all insurance required to be maintained by grantee under Section 66-62.,
, must be on file with the Director at all times; therefore, an updated certificate of insurance must
be provided to the Director upon expiration and renewal of any policies required under the license
agreement.
(2) The annual license fee in effect from time to time.
(3) A certified report of current facilities and their locations, including plans, drawings or such other
material as is necessary to fully describe the facilities and their locations, as provided in Section
66-55, or a statement certified by an authorized representative of the grantee stating that there has
been no change to the facilities since the prior annual report or the issuance of the license, in the
case of the first such certified report.
(4) Such other documentation and information reasonably requested by the Director.
(b) Failure to fulfill annual requirements. If grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements by July 1,
grantee shall be subject to penalties as set forth in Section 66-91 and, in addition, the Director may revoke
the license at any time thereafter by terminating the license agreement as set forth below; provided,
however, that if grantee provides the certificate or other acceptable evidence of insurance and pays the
annual fee within 15 days after receipt of notice from the County of failure to comply with the annual
requirements (which shall constitute a violation notice under Section 66-87), grantee may request an
extension as to Section 66-60(a)(3) and the Director may grant such extension as the Director deems
appropriate (which shall constitute additional time to cure pursuant to Section 66-88(c)). If such extension
is granted, no penalties will accrue and the County will not be entitled to revoke the license if the
requirement is fulfilled prior to the expiration of the extension period. If grantee fails to provide the annual
report within the extension period, then penalties shall be assessed retroactively to the date which is five
days after receipt of the County's notice, and the Director may, in his or her discretion, revoke the license. If
the Director deems it advisable to revoke the license as allowed under this Section 66-60(b), the Director
shall notify the grantee in writing not less than 30 days prior to the effective date of such revocation, which
notice shall be ineffective if the grantee fulfills all requirements prior to the effective date set forth in the
notice. If a grantee fails to fulfill the annual requirements as provided herein, then the County may exercise
the rights and remedies described in this article, including assessment of penalties and requiring removal or
deactivation of such person's facilities. In addition, the County may refuse to process any applications or
grant any permits until such license agreement is executed.
***
Sec. 66-63. - License renewal.
A grantee shall be solely responsible for requesting the County, in writing, to renew a license for any
subsequent ten-year term. Such a request shall be made to the Director not less than six months prior to the
then current license expiration date, unless a later date is agreed to in writing by the Director.

(a) Request for license renewal shall be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section
66-59 of this article for a new license; however, Board authorization shall not be required for license
renewals, which may be approved by the Director. If a grantee having existing facilities fails to timely apply
for or diligently pursue a renewal of a license, then the County through the Director may exercise the rights
and remedies described in this article, including assessment of penalties and requiring removal of such
person's facilities.
(b) Notwithstanding the fact that the County Director may determine that a grantee has been in
reasonable compliance with the terms and conditions imposed by this article and the license agreement, the
County Director shall have no obligation to renew the license. If the County Director does not renew the
license, the County Director shall have the option to require the removal of all grantee's facilities and other
property located within the licensed area, at the grantee's expense, in accordance with Section 66-80.
Should the Director not renew a license following an application to renew, the annual license fee
accompanied with accompanying the renewal application shall be refunded. No provision of this article
shall be deemed or construed as to require the Board or Director to grant a license. The Director may
consider any relevant facts and circumstances, including the qualifications of the applicant and compliance
with the license agreement in the past, in determining whether to grant or renew a license. The Director
shall inform the Board within 30 days of any renewal license applications denied by the Director.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

Under the current contract, System Solutions, Inc. (SSI) is responsible for delivering high speed network
hardware and hardware installation services upon the completion of fiber optic construction projects.

completion of the projects detailed above. This contract was awarded through the use of a Comparable
