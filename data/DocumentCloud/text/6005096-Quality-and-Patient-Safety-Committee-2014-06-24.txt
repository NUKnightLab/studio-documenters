Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
B. Publicly Reported Ratings
Dr. Krishna Das, System Chief Quality Officer, stated that she had no new regulatory or accreditation issues
to report.
Dr. Das stated that, with regards to the recent Ambulatory survey by representatives of The Joint
Commission, evidence of standards of compliance have been submitted; they will need four months of
monitoring before they hear the final determination about the certification. She added that staff is still
waiting and actively preparing for Provident Hospital’s triennial visit from The Joint Commission.

discussed the information.

The Committee reviewed and

During the discussion of the information regarding the Emergency Department (ED) Arrival to Admission
inpatient data, Director Lerner asked whether the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
allows for that line to be cut down by cohort of patients, if the patients were staged or ranked; additionally,
he inquired whether the System cuts back that information to look at the cohort of patients. Dr. Das
responded affirmatively. The administration particularly looks at the wait time to provider data, because it
is felt that once the patient is in the hands of the ED providers, they are in a safer environment and there is
very close monitoring. In terms of ED arrival to admission times, the administration can look at the data by
acuity - most of these patients have higher levels, and for these patients, if there are longer waits, it is either
related to bed availability or ED testing, so that data can be shown. She stated that, the point is, when the
patient is in the ED, they are already receiving inpatient care; because of the long waits in the ED and the
need to initiate care, the inpatient teams actually go down to the ED and collaborate with the ED staff to
start inpatient care.
Chairman Collens noted that the Trauma Unit has its own admissions function, separate from the ED; he
asked for further information on an example of a patient seen in the Trauma Unit who is quickly transferred
to admissions. Dr. Das responded that when someone enters the Trauma Unit, they are essentially admitted
almost immediately. They are within the Trauma Unit, receiving all types of care, even intensive care; they
may have gone to the operating room and come back to the unit, but during that entire time, because of the
type of admission, they are classified as observation patients. In that setting, during that time where all
kinds of very high level medical care was delivered, the patient is still considered officially not admitted.
The administration is having discussions to see if the Trauma Unit’s administrative staff could do whatever
it takes in the system to put the patients in a different status – that would be how the ED Arrival to
Admission numbers would decrease. There is nothing staff can do to optimize or enhance the care provided
in the Trauma Unit, because staff is already providing an extremely high level of care in a very short time
period.
Director Muñoz inquired regarding the percentage of Trauma Unit patients versus regular ED patients. Dr.
Das stated that, in any given data set of 100 ED and Trauma Unit patients, there are approximately 3 to 5
Trauma Unit patients (or 3-5%), which is not a large number of patients; however, the Trauma Unit patients
are really outliers in terms of their times, and that has contaminated the whole data set.
Director Lerner inquired whether the System utilizes the concept of huddles, which is a group of
multidisciplinary professionals that come together on the patient’s care. Dr. Das responded that this is an
initiative that has been rolled out in the Ambulatory clinics. On the inpatient side, for a couple of years
now, interdisciplinary rounds have been held on the general Medical/Surgical Units; additionally, all of the
Intensive Care Units have interdisciplinary rounding as a standard. Director Lerner inquired whether those
currently involve the patient or the patient’s family. Dr. Das responded in the negative. Director Lerner
stated that this might be something to consider, as he has found that to be effective for patients with chronic
disease; it also works with patients with acute problems. Dr. Das indicated that there is widespread interest
in that.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer (continued)
C. Key Quality Indicators Report: FY2014 – 1st Quarter
In response to Director Gugenheim’s question regarding staffing levels for Dr. Das’ department, Dr. Das
stated that the department is growing. She currently has the following staff: one staff member at Provident,
three staff members within the ACHN clinics, two Assistant Directors (one who manages data and one who
abstracts data). She noted that most hospitals this size have between four and six persons who only abstract
data. She added that she has two positions that are currently in recruitment for quality data abstraction, so
when those positions are filled, she will have three people performing that function. Dr. John Jay Shannon,
Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Clinical Integration, provided additional information. He
stated that that there is an organizational philosophy connected to that subject. There is no question that the
infrastructure for quality is strategic and the organizational awareness piece needs to be amped-up;
however, the misconception that he wants to avoid is that the Quality Department produces quality for the
organization - it is 100% across-the-board organizational ownership of the production of quality. The
Quality Department can only support, guide and give a little bit of supporting function to that.

D. Quality Report – Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County (Attachment #2)
This item was taken out of order.
Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County, provided
an overview of the CORE Quality Report. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on viral suppression, Director Lerner inquired whether there has
ever been a study on the social cost benefit for those patients whose viral load is suppressed and who remain
engaged in ongoing care. From a public health policy point of view, he stated that what one would want to
look at is the social cost benefit of doing this kind of treatment and outreach - how many people does CORE
get to the viral suppression stage and who are back in the workforce, producing economic development,
gainfully employed, those kinds of things. If a study on the social cost benefit is done, it shows the validity
of going through this process, and it gives standing to the people who are policymakers to continue to fund
this. Dr. Barker responded that there are quite a bit of data about cost effectiveness of HIV care. The
current annual cost of treating someone who has reasonable CD4 counts is about $17,500 per year, which is
well within the range of what is considered cost effective. The years of additional life gained through HIV
care are essentially currently unbounded; as the average age of patients receiving care is 35, the patient is so
far below median mortality, which is what is needed in the Kaplan Meier assessment to calculate mortality,
that one really cannot tell how many years are being added to people’s lives. The Danes did a very good
study on this subject; they found that the Danish patients who came to clinic and took their medications
have a longevity that is indistinguishable from Danes who are not HIV infected. He added that Denmark
has a national health system and that everybody has access to the care and medications.
Dr. Barker stated that HIV care is definitely a winner, in terms of cost effectiveness, quality-adjusted life
years, and gaining the quality of life for these patients that improves markedly - they stop losing weight, are
less fatigued, and feel better.
Director Lerner encouraged the administration to consider this subject as a focus for a public relations story
in the future. A reporter might want to follow some patients and talk about the policy implications of this
kind of intervention. He stated that the public does not understand it; additionally, there is a fear factor, so
this is another way of getting the message across.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
D. Quality Report – Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of Cook County (continued)
Director Gugenheim stated that this is an amazing success story of the medical home concept and successful
handling of a population’s health; she added that it is the model of what the System should be doing for
every diagnosis.
Chairman Collens thanked Dr. Barker and staff for the report. He also recognized and thanked Dr. Robert
Weinstein, Chief Operating Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center, who will be transitioning into a
different role at the end of the month.
Dr.Shannon provided additional comments on the subject. He stated that many people in the organization
are aware that Dr. Weinstein will be transitioning at the end of the month – he is not leaving the
organization, but is stepping down from a couple of his formal leadership positions in the Department of
Medicine. He has been with the organization for 20 years. He first arrived as the Chief of Infectious
Diseases in 1994. He led the CORE Center from 1998, when it opened in its new facility until the present
time, and has been the Chairman of the Department of Medicine since 2008. At the end of this month, he
will transition into voluntary status and will continue to be very engaged with the organization. Dr.
Shannon wanted to recognize him for a number of things, but most importantly, for the features of a leader
– features that include strategic thinking, taking responsible action, and attracting and mentoring a whole
cadre of dedicated individuals.
Dr. Shannon stated that, in addition, he thinks that it is very important to point out the good quality results
that Dr. Barker presented. At the CORE Center, one can see the development of the tripartite mission that
the System has tried to accomplish throughout its history; it is around patient care, but also around teaching
and around discovery. Those are very important and cannot be overemphasized.
Dr. Shannon noted that two-thirds of what happens in the CORE Center comes in with extramural dollars;
it does not cost the County taxpayer anything over and above that degree of federal dollars that come in
through that extramural funding. In addition to that, Dr. Weinstein and the team in HIV services have
demonstrated a remarkable stewardship. The providers and the team at the CORE Center think about how
they are at an inflection point with the way that the country is looking at how to take care of HIV infected
individuals. That will have significant effects, as many patients transition off Ryan White funding, which is
the funding of last resort, to other forms of coverage, including the Medicaid expansion. That will have
very real financial implications for the bottom line of the Medicaid Managed Care plan. The good news is
that the previous track record of engagement of those leaders bodes well for the organization. They are
going to help think through how to make that transition happen in a way that works for the patients and the
System.
Dr. Shannon referenced Director Gugenheim’s earlier comment regarding the CORE Center being a model
for the patient-centered medical home concept. He stated that many of the things that that are being
currently discussed relating to the patient-centered medical home are exactly analogous to the care provided
over the years at the CORE Center - wrap-around and supportive services, integration of behavioral health,
integration of dental health and spiritual support of the individuals. The challenge for the organization is
going to be around scale. As Dr. Barker mentioned, there are approximately 4,000-5,000 individuals in
chronic care at the CORE Center; in adult primary care, there are approximately 100,000 within the System
right now, and there was recently an infusion of an additional 65,000 adults.

I got the help I needed
I got a busy signal
I was disconnected
was put on hold too long
I left a message and no one called me back
I dont like to call because a machine always answers
The phone rang many times before it was answered

Public Health Approach
• 33% of all living Chicagoans who have been diagnosed 
with HIV and nearly 50% of Chicagoans who are 
actively in HIV care are seen at CORE.
• Promote widespread routine testing for HIV in CCHHS
• Maintain easy Access to HIV Clinics at CORE
• Outreach to newly diagnosed, linkage to care
• Evolution to Patient Centered Medical Home to 
improve retention in Care
• Measure virologic suppression as community viral load 
and provider specific outcome.

 Pre‐Exposure Prophylaxis ‐ PrEP
• Giving a combination of two HIV medicines to 
persons at high risk to prevent HIV infection
–
–
–
–

S. Hosek PhD and J. Martinez led CCHHS PrEP studies
Effective at preventing infection if med taken every day
Risk of developing resistance becomes infected
Low risk of drug toxicity – requires lab tests

• CDC Recommendations for PrEP in May 2014
• Is not Cost‐Effective
– best case scenario $330K for meds alone per case 
prevented, meds are ~80% of all costs
– Limited budget for HIV meds – CORE / CCHHS will not bear 
cost of meds – MAP or Insurance
Page 49 of 59

 Translational Science
• From 2003 through 2011 CORE served as a site for 
CDC funded surveillance to quantify how frequently 
drug resistant HIV is transmitted ‐ >12% of newly 
diagnosed
– CORE accumulated >4,000 genetic sequences of newly 
diagnosed patients.

• In 2013 Drs. Lubelchek & Hohnen analyzed 920 of 
these sequences from 2009 – 2011
– 14% of these or 124 patients had HIV that was closely 
related to another patient’s strain 
– 26 “clusters” were identified – 3 to 21 members
– Especially likely to be true for young, African‐American, 
men who have sex with men

 Intervention
• Analyze all 6,000 sequences available to us
• Add new sequences to dataset in real‐time as 
we acquire them through clinic 200‐250/year
• Where analysis reveals clustering send DIS 
staff to interview patients who are members 
of cluster and elicit sexual contacts
• Offer HIV testing to untested members of 
cluster
– CORE uniquely well positioned because of large dataset available, 
large numbers of new patients seen each year, and high proportion of 
all patients in major metropolitan area in care.
