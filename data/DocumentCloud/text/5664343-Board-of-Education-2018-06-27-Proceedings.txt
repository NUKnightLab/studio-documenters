POLICY ON HIGH SCHOOL PROMOTION

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education adopt the amended policy on high school promotion.

POLICY TEXT:

Introduction

The Chicago Board of Education believes that promotion from one grade in high school to the next must
indicate that students have passed a series of academically challenging courses in the core subject
disciplines of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Sciences, as well as Courses in other areas such
as world languages, ?ne arts, physical education, and career education that are aligned with the Illinois

Leamlng Standards. Students who successfully earn course credits should display their understanding of
and competency in course subject matter through both standardized exams and appropriate assignments

 

ssheel?graele?This promotion policy requires that the city?s high school students demonstrate genuine
academic achievement and a commitment to learning in order to make progress toward earning their high
school diplomas.

I. De?nitions

 

A. For purposes of this policy, a ?unit of credit" is 120 hours of classroom instruction unless

otherwise approved by the Chief Education Of?cer. A half unit of credit, which is 60 hours
of classroom instruction. represents the credit that students can earn for successfully
completing one semester of class work in a particular course. 

B. For purposes of this policy, a ?core course? is any coursein one of the core subject
disciplines of English, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences.

C. A passing grade for purposes of this policy means at least a average for the semester
in a course.

II. Promotion Requirements

The following guidelines regarding promotion shall apply for ninth, tenth and eleventh grade
students:

assignments, homework and classwork. These assessment criteria should be appropriate to the course
content and should provide students with a variety of means by which they can demonstrate their mastery
of the material covered in a class. 

One important method of assessing student success in learning course subject matter is ?nal end-
of?semester examinations. It is recommended as an educationally bene?cial practice that final end-of?the?
semester examinations for students taking the same course at a school be developed collaboratively by
the course teachers working under the auspices of the department chair. Results on final end-of?semester
examinations shall constitute at least 10% of students? ?nal semester grade.

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:
That the Chicago Board of Education amend its policy regarding residency for all employees of the Board

of Education, This June 2018 amendment will allow teachers with a Special Needs waiver to become
Principals, Assistant Principals or Resident Principals without losing their Residency Waiver.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this Policy are to establish consistent, equitable, and enforceable guidelines
concerning the Board?s requirement that all of?cers and employees of the Board of Education be

residents of the City of Chicago that are consistent with state law, 105 ILCS 5134-831, and to establish
new provisions to the residency requirement. 

 

HISTORY OF BOARD ACTION: On July 9, 1980, the Board adopted a "Resolution to Require
Residency Within the City of Chicago of all Personnel Employed by the Board of Education On or after
September 1, 1980? (See The Board subsequently adopted Board Report #83-
110, which superceded the previous resolution and which provided waivers to its residency policy under
certain circumstances. On April 18, 1990, the 1983 resolution was amended to provide waivers for
employees in ?Special Needs? categories and for exemption of principals from the residency requirement
(See Resolution On November 20, 1996, the Board adopted a residency policy (See

- Board Report which exempted employees hired prior to September 1, 1980; allowed any
employees hired between September 1, 1980 and August 26, 1996, whose address of record with the
Department of Human Resources indicates that he/she resided outside the City of Chicago to continue'to
live outside the City; and required all new employees to be City residents. _On August 27, 1997, the Board
amended the residency policy (See Board Report #97-0827- -PO4) to allow a six-mOnth grace period for
compliance with the policy for newly hired or rehired employees and for those employees formerly in- a
special needs exemption area. On August 22, 2001, the Board rescinded the reSidency policy adopted
under Board Report #97- and adopted its current residency policy 01- 0822-P02 which
requires all full-time employees hired on or after November 20, 1996 to be actual residents of the City of
Chicago, sets forth disciplinary actions for teachers, principals and all other employees and provides for
waiver of the policy upon Board action. The Board amended the policy _in Board Report 
(Adopted October 27, 2004) to (1) identify responsible persons and offices for monitoring compliance with

identify responsible persons and of?ces for monitoring compliance with warnings and written reprimands
issued to non-compliant employees; (3) establish consistent discipline for non-compliant employees; (4)

clarify the policy and the requirements and procedures for "special needs waivers;" and (6) require
employees who must ?le Statements of Economic Interests under the Ethics Policy to annually certify
their compliance with the Residency Policy in the Statement of Economic Interests. The Board amended
the eu?ent policy in Board Report to define ?material omission of fact" and to make such
omissions with respect to an employee?s residency a violation of this policy. The Board amended the
policy in Board Report to (1) modim the timeline on which the Board annually designates
ecial needs ositions that are eli ible for a residenc waiver and 2 modi the duration that ecial

introduction. The boundaries of the school district under the charge of the Board of Education
of the City of Chicago are cotermlnous with the boundaries of the City of Chicago. it has been,
and continues to be, the belief of the governing boardof the district that it is desirable to maintain
a policy requiring that its officers and employees maintain their residence within the City of
Chicago, and that its educational and governmental purposes are best served by the
establishment of the residency policy contained herein.

The Board of Education, therefore deems it proper and appropriate to maintain a residency
recluirement for its of?cers and employees for reasons which include but are not limited to, the
following.

A. quality of performance of duties by of?cers and employees of the Board will be enhanced
by a more comprehensive knowledge of the conditions existing in the school system and
by a feeling of greater personal stake In the system? 5 progress;

B. resident of?cers and employees will be more likely to be involved in school and

community activities thus bringing them into contact with community leaders and
citizens;

C. absenteeism and tardiness will be diminished;

D. economic bene?ts will accrue to the school system from local expenditure of salaries and

the payment of local sales and real estate taxes, and educational bene?ts will be derived
from residency by teachers, administrators and other employees in the City of Chicago.
The Chicago Board of Education, therefore, adopts without the necessity of-annual re-
adoption the following residency policy.

De?nitions. For the purpose of this Policy only, the following de?nitions will apply:

lives and has his or her true, permanent home to which whenever he or she 15 absent,

E. ?Academic year" means the regular school year commencing in August or September
and ending in June.

F. ?Material omisSiOn of fact? means the employee's intentional failure to disclose hislher
actual residence purposes of concealing from the Board hislher non-compliance with
the actual residence requirements of this Policy.

Current Employees Hired On or 'After November 20, 1996. All employees hired'on or after.
November 20, 1996 will be required to be actual residents of the City of Chicago within six

78

June 27,2018

IV. Current Employees Hired Prior To November 20, 1996. All employees hired prior to
November 20, 1996 - the date when the Board originally adopted a residency policy requiring

employees hired on or after November 20, 1996 to reside in Chicago who have remained
continuously employed by the Board shall not be required to live within'the Chicago city limits
regardless of whether such employees have moved into the city since November 20,1996. Any
employee hired prior to November 20, 1996 who has had a break in service after November 20,
1996 will be regarded as a new employee and will be required to reside in Chicago within six
months after returning to full-time employment with the Board unless the employee obtains a
waiver in accordance with Section of this Policy .

V. Noti?cation of Change of Address. All employees must notify .the Board of a change in their
address within fourteen (14) calendar days of their change of address. Noti?cation to the Board of

his/her hire or at any time thereafter and 1) who subsequently moves hislh'er actual residence
from the City of Chicago, and 2) fails to notify the Board of his/her change of address required by
this Section shall be deemed to have made a material omission of fact for the purpose of
concealing his/her actual residence.

Vt. Proof of Residency. For the purposes of this Policy, the question of an employee's residence is
principally one of where an employee intends to live and have his or her one true, permanent
home or domicile to which an employee intends to retum following an absence. The presumption
in this Policy is that the address an employee gives on a completed Residency Form is that
employee's correct address. In disputed cases, the burden of proof rests with the employee to
show that his or her claimed residence is the one where the employee intends to live and have as
his or her one true permanent home or domicile. Because intent may be manifested in
innumerable ways, any residency inquiry must consider all the pertinent factors on a case-by?
case basis. Such an inquiry shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: voter
registration, place of filing tax returns, property ownership, driver?s license and car registration.

Vii. Penalties for Violation of the Residency Policy.

A. Principals and ?Tenured Teachers. According to the Illinois School Code, tenured
. teachers and principals only maybe dismissed for conduct deemed "irremediable," or for
?remediable? conduct which employees have been specifically warned may lead to their
dismissal if repeated. The School Code de?nes ?irremediable? conduct as conduct which
is cruel, immoral, negligent,?or criminal or which in any way causes harm or
injury to a student. 105 5/34-85. The Board shall Consider any tenured teacher or
principal to have engaged in irremediable conduct and subject to dismissal without prior
warning if helshe has intentionally misrepresented his/her actual residence, whether such
misrepresentation is made byactive representations or by material omissions of facts,
with the intent to avoid the residency requirements set forth in this Policy Other initial
violations of this Policy that do not involve such misrepresentations shall not be treated
as ?irremediable" offenses.

Accordingly, in those cases where no misrepresentation occurs, a principal or tenured
teacher who is subject to this Policy may be dismissed for failure to Comply with the
residency requirement if, after receiving a Warning Resolution from the Board the
employee fails to comply with the warning and establish his or her residency in Chicago.

Report of the Senior Vice President of Finance (?Chief Financial Of?cer?)
pursuant to Board Rule 5-14 and Section 35 ILCS 200/ 18-60 of the Illinois
Property Tax Code

35 ILCS 200/ 18?60 of the Illinois Property Tax Code (?the Code?) requires that not less

authority made as provided in Section 18?60 is more than 105% of the amount
extended or estimated to be extended upon the final aggregate levy of the preceding
year, then the corporate authority is required to give public notice of and hold a public
hearing on its intent to adopt a levy in excess of 105% of the amount extended or
estimated to be extended in the prior year.

Board Rule 5-14 delegates to the Senior Vice President of Finance (?Chief Financial
Officer?) the authority to annually determine the estimate of property taxes to be levied
as required under 35 ILCS 200/ 18-60 and to report that estimate to the Board
through the Office of the Secretary of the Board.

Board Rule 5? 14 also requires that not less than 20 days prior to the adoption of the

act of the corporate authority upon receipt of the Senior Vice President of Finance?s
report of the estimate by the Secretary of the Board.

The Senior Vice President of Finance hereby estimates that the amount of money
necessary to be raised by taxation upon the taxable property in the district as defined
in Section 18?60 of the Code is $3,038,780,053 and certi?es that this estimated
