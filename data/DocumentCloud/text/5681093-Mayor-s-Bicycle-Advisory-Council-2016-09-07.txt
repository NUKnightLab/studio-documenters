 Vision Zero Chicago Update
Mayor Emanuel Launches Vision Zero Chicago Initiative To Eliminate
Traffic Fatalities And Serious Injuries Across The City
The City will release a three-year Vision Zero Action Plan in the fall of 2016.
The plan will look at traffic safety as a public health issue and identify priorities
for the City’s engineering and education initiatives, as well as enforcement
support for reducing crashes. City departments are currently working with
stakeholders and the public to develop the final goals and strategies included
in the plan.
“Every day someone is injured or worse as the result of a car crash on Chicago’s
streets – and that is simply unacceptable,” Mayor Emanuel said. “These
crashes are preventable, and that is why we are stepping up our efforts,
developing partnerships with communities and private industry. We are going
to use all the resources at our disposal to eliminate traffic fatalities and serious
injuries in Chicago.”
