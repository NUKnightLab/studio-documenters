 Funding
Resident Services Division Budget
Background
CHA’s employment preparation and placement program will prioritize service delivery for CHA
public housing residents and Housing Choice Voucher participants, 18 years of age or older and
17 years of age, not attending school full time with priority given to those who must meet CHA’s
work requirement. The service delivery framework will consist of a comprehensive approach that
focuses on services that provide the education, skills, work experience, and support needed to
successfully transition to a career and accomplish self-sufficiency and/or enhanced earning
power. CHA employment preparation and placement activities include, but are not limited to
provision of career coaching services; evaluation and enhancement of soft skills; connecting job
seekers to employers for unsubsidized employment placement opportunities; referral for
training services that lead to credentials; referrals to apprenticeships, paid work experiences and
other supportive services.
During 2019, employment placement services were removed from the FamilyWorks program,
and will be shifted to the recommended awardees for this Board authorization request. The
recommended awardees will leverage CHA’s additional employment and education resources,
such as FamilyWorks, Transitional Jobs, Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, City Colleges of
Chicago, CHA’s scholarship program, etc. to assist with service delivery.
