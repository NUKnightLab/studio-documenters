Section 3:

GENERAL BACKGROUND:

Legal Services Agreements are needed in various areas of law should referrals to outside legal
counsel become necessary due to extraordinary volume in a particular area, or for matters which
are extremely complex or which involve special expertise not generally available from in?house
staff. There exists a timeliness factor in the retention of legal services, which requires that
matters be referred to counsel as quickly as possible. However, pursuant to the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development handbooks, the procurement of legal services
must be conducted in accordance with 24 C.F.R. 85.36 and with speci?c approval of the HUD
Of?ce of the General Counsel.

In order to facilitate the retention of outside counsel, the Of?ce of the General Counsel
obtains advance approval from HUD of the Request for Proposals and draft Legal Services
Agreement. The Of?ce of General Counsel received conditioned approval by letter dated
December 17, 2012. This process eliminates the time required to competitively procure legal
services and then obtain HUD approval of the procurement when matters requiring the retention
of outside counsel arise. The execution of a Legal Services Agreement with a ?rm does not
obligate funds and does not imply any commitment to assign of legal matters with any of the
respective legal counsel.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The Deputy Chief Legal Of?cer concurs with recommendation to authorize the contract award of
Legal Services Agreement to various law ?rms, the nine legal services areas as set forth in the

attachment hereto.

The CEO/President recommends the approval of the proposed contract awards for legal services
agreements for said nine legal services areas.
