for waiver enrollees;
2. Specifies a process by which the System will be reimbursed monthly by a "per member per
month (PMPM) methodology for waiver enrollees;
3. Modifies the section wherein the System will reimburse the State of Illinois for "onsite"
enrollment office expenses, and other costs related to waiver implementation; and
4. Permits data sharing between the Department of Healthcare and Family Services HFS and the
System;
The provisions of this IGA are consistent with the requirements of HB5007, as signed into law by
Governor Quinn on June 14, 2012.

ITEM #23
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 16, 2012 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
ALEXIS A. HERRERA, Chief Financial Officer
and
MARIA DE LOURDES COSS, Chief Procurement Officer
requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with A
Safe Haven, LLC, Chicago, Illinois, to provide housing and appropriate support services to
eligible participants as referred and space availability for a minimum of eight (8) eligible participants of
the Cook County Sheriff's Electronic Monitoring Program.
Reason:

As of June 2, 2012, there were approximately 104 detainees who were eligible for release
from the Cook County Department of Corrections into the Electronic Monitoring Program,
but had no residence to accommodate the electronic monitoring equipment.
In an effort to reduce the population at the Cook County Department of Corrections and to
provide rehabilitative services to qualifying detainees, the Cook County Sheriff's Office and
the Cook County Justice Advisory Council have worked together to find suitable residency
for these detainees. A Safe Haven, LLC was chosen because they could accommodate our
security requirements and currently provide similar services to the Illinois Department of
Corrections.
The funding for this contract will be paid partially by the Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund
and the Justice Advisory Council. The Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund will cover the
approximate cost of room and board and the Justice Advisory Council will cover the cost of
treatment services. A Safe Haven, LLC will allow housing and appropriate support services
for participants as referred and space availability for a minimum of eight (8) participants
every day of the week.
The total cost per day per participant will be $51.67.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: not to exceed $62,850.00. Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund.
Contract period: This contract will commence after execution by the Cook County Department of
Corrections and A Safe Haven, LLC (Commencement Date) for a period of one (1) year and will
automatically renew on the Commencement Date of each year unless one of the parties gives 30-days
written prior notice of its intent to discontinue.

Reason:

$4,502,092.50
140,000.00
1,060,000.00
$5,702,092.50

Due to the increase in the number of individuals being placed on electronic monitoring, it has
become necessary to increase the contract with our existing vendor.
This increase will allow for the completion of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process to
award a consolidated contract for electronic monitoring services. The expiration date of the
current contract is April 30, 2013.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,060,000.00. (239-449 Account).

COOK COUNTY CEMETERY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CEMETERY
WHEREAS, recent events as well as investigations by the Cook County Sheriff have
brought into serious question and unfortunate light, the manner by which the Cook
County’s indigent, unclaimed and unknown individuals have been buried; and

 FINANCE AGENDA
JULY 24, 2012
PAGE 24
WHEREAS, disturbing practices have included persons stacked eight coffins high, bodies
placed in coffins with unidentified limbs and skeletal remains from other bodies, medical
waste and non-human debris, and coffins buried haphazardly in a manner making future
location for personal or law enforcement purposes, difficult if not impossible; and
WHEREAS, such practices not only demonstrate an unacceptable lack of respect for the
least fortunate among us and are unbecoming of a civilized society, but additionally
impede ongoing criminal investigations in cases of unknown decedents, as the identifying
characteristics of hundreds of unidentified remains buried by the County have failed to be
entered into the NCIC (National Crime Information Center), the nationally recognized
database for tracking crime-related information; and
WHEREAS, the discovery of the above-mentioned practices led to the introduction and
passage of an ordinance on May 4, 2011, setting new standards and safeguards for the
manner in which burials of the indigent, unclaimed and unknown are handled in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, said ordinance clarified the role and responsibilities of the Office of the
Medical Examiner in preparing the bodies for burial as well as the methods by which
burials are to be conducted by cemeteries that have contracts with the county for such
burials; and
WHEREAS, this Government is ultimately responsible for these individuals, and
consequently it is the in the best interest of the County and its residents for the County to
once again operate a cemetery for the burial of our County’s indigent, unclaimed and
unknown persons; and
WHEREAS, for over a century, from 1854-1971, Cook County operated, maintained and
administered its own cemetery, the most recent site having been located on the land
adjacent to the Oak Forest Hospital, known as the Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent,
where tens of thousands of individuals have previously been laid to rest; and
WHEREAS, the reestablishment of a permanent Cook County Cemetery would not only
ensure that our indigent are put to rest in a respectful manner, but it would also facilitate
proper documentation for law enforcement purposes, proper maintenance, as well as save
the County millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, with the use of approximately 5 acres of land contiguous to the location of
the former Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, the County could establish a cemetery
capable of meeting the needs of the County for the next 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid land is presently owned and maintained by the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, since the Forest Preserve acquired said cemetery, no plan for addressing the
former cemetery site has been forthcoming, and as such, ample opportunity still exists to
determine a proper use of that parcel and the surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, there exist several precedents for the co-existence of cemeteries on Forest
Preserve property, including Bachelors Grove Cemetery, Sauerbier-Burkhardt Cemetery

 FINANCE AGENDA
JULY 24, 2012
PAGE 25
and the above-mentioned Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department already owns the equipment necessary to
operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff has expressed a willingness and ability to provide
sufficient labor necessary to operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
WHEREAS, based upon anticipated costs for the currently mandated indigent burial
program, the reestablishment of a County cemetery can reasonably expect to save Cook
County taxpayers in excess of $175 million over the next 100 years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that the Office of the Medical Examiner, the Office of the Cook County
Sheriff, the Cook County Bureau of Administration, the Cook County Real Estate
Management Division, the Cook County Highway Department, the Forest Preserve District
of Cook County and any other agency deemed necessary are hereby directed to cause a
plan to be completed and presented to the Board of Commissioners for the reestablishment
of a Cook County Cemetery at the aforementioned site for the purpose of indigent,
unclaimed and unknown burials; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall include the creation of an
intergovernmental agreement between the County of Cook and the Forest Preserve District
of Cook County to locate said cemetery on the 5 acres to the immediate west of the old
Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said intergovernmental agreement shall stipulate
that the reestablished Cook County Cemetery shall remain Forest Preserve property in
order to ensure its permanency; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that said plan shall provide the structure by which the
affected agencies shall coordinate and delegate responsibilities in order to establish,
operate and maintain such a cemetery; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the results of the aforementioned plan shall be
delivered to the Cook County Board of Commissioners no later than August 1, 2012, with
an implementation date of January 1, 2013.
Effective Date: This Resolution shall be effective upon passage.
