STAFF REPORT 10-9-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6495
ADDRESS: 4440 E. CANFIELD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SWEETEST HEART OF MARY
APPLICANT: TJ GARRETT
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 8/30/2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 10/1/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: INSTALL NEW CELLPHONE EQUIPMENT/VENTS AT TOWER
EXISTING CONDITIONS
As per the Detroit Historic Designation Advisory Board:

Sweetest Heart of Mary is a typical cruciform plan church built of painted red brick with stone trim and a
patterned slate roof. The main west facade is distinguished by a stone base topped by a quatrefoil frieze over
the main portal and twin buttressed towers surmounted by octagonal spires. Sweetest Heart's 217 spires house
three large bells, cast in St. Louis in 1889 to be placed in the bell tower of the school. A smaller spire marks
the intersection of the nave with the transept. Several motifs unify the composition of the edifice: alternating
patterns of pinnacles and decorated gables define the bases of the main spires; the gable ornamentation,
consisting primarily of blind serrated lancets, is repeated on the four larger gables which mark the ends of the
nave and transepts: the pointed gable shape is echoed not only on the spires and the roof, but also on the side
buttressing and above all of the portals; lancet windows fenestrate the towers, the gables, and the main threeportal facade; and circles dominate the tracery of the tower windows and the smaller windows of the north
and south facades. Gables, pinnacled buttresses, and angled side entrances provide the nave facades with a
multiplicity of line and form. Much of this detailing derives from northern European precedents; the
combination a French front and a German nave reflects the late Victorian propensity towards the use of a
multiplicity of forms.

The lower pane of this window will be removed and replaced with new louvers
PROPOSAL
The project involves the installation of new cellphone equipment within the building’s southwest tower.
The majority of the work associated with this project will be undertaken within the building’s interior
space/within the portion of the building which is not covered under the building’s interior designation.
However, one element of the project involves the replacement of one exterior window. Specifically, the
exterior work item associated with this project includes the following:
•

At the north elevation, second story window at the tower, remove the lower light from the sash in
install. replaced with (2) 13”x22” intake and exhaust louvers. Louver color to match beige
stonework (Greenheck manufacturer, color: sierra tan/ color code: GF118)

STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The air exhaust and intake vents are proposed for installation are necessary in order to maintain
proper air flow and temperature control for the new equipment
• The window pane proposed for replacement is an opaque glass and is likely not original/historic
age
• It is staff’s opinion that the new louvers will be minimally visible and will not detract from the
building’s historic appearance
ISSUES
• None
RECOMMENDATION
As noted aboe, it is HDC staff'’s opinion that the new louvers will be minimally visible and will not detract
from the building’s historic appearance. HDC staff therefore recommeds that the Commission issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation, standard #9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction

 shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.

Background 
The Sweetest Heart of Mary Catholic church 
was built in 1893. In 2004 T‐Mobile installed their 
equipment in the south steeple of the church. 
Antennas are mounted in the open window bays on 
the fifth floor of the south steeple. The auxiliary T‐
Mobile telecom equipment are housed on the third 
floor of the south steeple.    
Over time water seeped inside both 
steeples. Water entered the fifth, fourth, and thirds 
floors of the south steeple. The water has affected 
T‐Mobile’s equipment and operations. As the parish 
began structural repairs to both steeples, T‐Mobile 
and the church agreed to move the auxiliary 
equipment from the third to second floor of the 
south steeple. (The second floor of the steeple did 
not suffer any water damage.) The following 
outlines design requirements necessary to relocate 
T‐Mobile’s equipment.

the Contractor proceeds with the work in the affected areas.
B. The Bidder, if awarded the contract, will not be allowed any extra compensation by reason of any
matter or thing concerning the work which the Bidder might have fully discovered prior to the bidding.
C. No plea of ignorance of conditions that exist, or of difficulties or conditions that may be

sufficiently far away from the rod under test so that the regions in which their resistance is localized do
not overlap.
B. Contractor to conduct ground resistance test in the format as follows:
1. Equipment Building
A. First test - shall be with four ground rods installed, one at each corner of the building but not
connected to the main grounding bus. Furnish wire to connect (temporary clamp) all four ground rods
together to make a system test after each rod is individually tested. If any individual rod tests 25
OHMS or more, the electrical contractor and owner's representative should be notified so that the rod
can be driven deeper until all four rods have a resistance of 10 OHMS or less on a dry day.
B. Second test - shall be with the ground rods connected with dry soil and when no standing water has
been present for the past ten days. The maximum allowable reading is 5 OHMS to ground. If the
resistance of the entire system exceeds 5 OHMS, the electrical contractor and owner's representative
should be notified so that either additional and/or deeper rods can be installed.
2. Tower
A. First test - shall be with nine (9) ground rods installed (min.) equally spaced around the tower
foundation, but not connected to the equipment building external ground ring. Furnish wire to connect
(temporary clamp) all three ground rods together to make a system test after each rod is OHMS or
more, the electrical engineer and the owner's representative should be notified so that the rod can be
driven deeper until all three rods have a resistance of 10 OHMS or less on a dry day.
B. Second test - shall be with the grounds connected, with dry soil and when no standing water has
been present for the past ten days, the maximum allowable reading is 5 OHMS to ground. If the
resistance of the entire system exceeds 5 OHMS the electrical contractor and owner's representative
should be notified so that either additional and/or deeper rods can be installed.
3. Equipment Building and Tower
A. After the equipment building and tower ground resistance test is completed, electrical contractor
shall tie equipment building external ground ring together. After first and second test, all connections
shall be "cadweld". No lugs or clamps will be accepted.
B. After all the external ground rings are tied together but before the equipment building is tied down, a
megger check of the ground system should be done. The maximum allowable reading is 5 OHMS to
ground.
C. Ground Resistance Test Report
Upon completion of the testing for each site, Contractor shall submit a test report showing resistance in
OHMS with auxiliary potential electrodes at 5-foot and 10-foot intervals until the average resistance
starts increasing; 10-15 photos must be taken to proof entire external ground ring system before backfill
or project manager must be notified no less than 48 hours in advance of backfill. Testing shall be
completed by general contractor and two (2) sets of test documents are to be bound and submitted
within one week of work of completion.
