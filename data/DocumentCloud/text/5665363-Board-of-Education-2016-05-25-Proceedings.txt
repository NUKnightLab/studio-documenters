I. INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE OF POLICY

The Employee Discipline and Due Process Policy for Seheel~Basee Union
Employees (Except CTU) (?Policy?) applies to all seheel?based Employees represented
by a labor organization, except Employees that belong to the Chicago Teacher Union's
bargaining unit. The Board of Education of the City of Chicago (?Board?) is a public
employer that requires its Employees to perform their job duties and in a
manner that promotes the best interests of the students of the Chicago Public Schools,
furthers the goals of the Chicago Public Schools, and results in the highest level of
public trust and con?dence.

In accordance with state law, this Policy grants the authority and responsibility to
take disciplinary action against Beard Employees (Except CTU), up to and
including discharge. This Policy also grants the Chief Executive Of?cer the Of?ce of
Employee Engagement, peineipais?and Union Employees supervisor or Principal?
depa?ment?heads?and?ethers, as delegated by the Board, the authority and
responsibility to discipline, up to and including discharge Employees (Exce cetp
CTU). Any limitation on their
authority to discipline Board Employees is specifically set forth in this Policy and state or
federal law.

 

This Policy is a general statement of disciplinary procedures. These
disciplinary procedures are not intended to limit or restrict in any way the Board?s
right to discharge any Employee with or without cause or notice, subject to the
requirements set forth in the Illinois School Code and related laws. Moreover,

this Policy should not be. construed as a contract. Wespeet?te?Empieyees?net

requirements.

II. PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

The Board embraces the concept of progressive and corrective discipline for
Employees. The Board encourages its managers and supervisors to use progressive
discipline when they believe that an Employee is amenable to correcting his
misconduct.

Progressive discipline is a systematic approach to correct unwanted behavior
and deter its occurrence by administering disciplinary actions based upon various
factors, including but 'not limited to: (1) the seriousness of the offense; (2) the number of
times it has occurred; (3) prior acts of misconduct; (4) the length of time between
infractions (5) the attitude and cooperation of the Employee; (6) the Employee's work
history; and (7) the totality of the circumstances. .

While the Board encourages the use of progressive discipline,
circumstances dictate that it cannot be used for every act of misconduct.
Therefore, the Board uses progressive discipline at its discretion and does not
solely rely on this concept in every instance when taking disciplinary action.

While it is not possible to list every act which will or might result in disciplinary
action, the actions described in the Acts of Misconduct Section reflect conduct which is
deemed to be inappropriate and which may result in disciplinary action. The Acts of
Misconduct Section is not exhaustive, but' Is offered instead to generally provide notice
of inappropriate conduct. The Offic_e_ of
Employee Engagement may hold that conduct other than that referenced in the Acts of
Misconduct Section is improper and warrants discipline. Further the Ghief?Exeeutive
Gf?eer?er-his-designee Of?ce of Employee Engagement has the discretion to determine
what degree of discipline" is appropriate after weighing all the situational factors involved
in the misconduct.

PAYMENT PERIOD: Tuition payments are authorized for university courses scheduled from July 1, 2016
through June 30, 2018.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Payments cover a fraction of tuition for authorized CPS teachers enrolled in
courses at participating universities under the ESLIBilinguai Endorsement Initiative. The ESL/Bilingual
Endorsement Initiative provides an opportunity for CPS teachers to pursue an ESL or bilingual
endorsement so that an increased number of English Language Learners (ELs) in CPS are taught by
competent and expert educators who are able to meet the unique needs of these students. Providing an
opportunity to earn an ESL or bilingual endorsement is critical to ensun?ng that all CPS students receive
appropriate support and have access to high quality, rigorous education. Equally important, this program
is essential for the district to be in compliance with Illinois state and federal laws, rules and regulations. It
is vision that every EL in CPS is taught by an appropriately certi?ed, endorsed, expert teacher.
Offering cohorts of teachers the opportunity to engage in the coursework together, to collaborate, and to
learn with and from each other is an important step towards actualizing the vision.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the ESLIBilingual Endorsement Initiative coursework will include CPS
.teachers who possess an ll. teaching certi?cate, have demonstrated leadership skills, and desire to
obtain an ESL or Bilingual Endorsement to support ELs in CPS. Participants will be selected through a
competitive process; they will commit to a twenty-four (24) month sequence of courses to teaching at
CPS for at least two years after obtaining their ESL or bilingual endorsement, and to maintaining at least
90% attendance and a grade of or higher in every course.

In addition, the ESL/Bilingual Endorsement Initiative is aligned to our district goals of ensuring that every
child has access to high quality teaching and learning in' alignment with the Common Core State 
Standards All teachers who enroll in these courses will bene?t by having opportunities to become expert
in using instructional strategies and providing support to ELs, thus ensuring that they gain access to
rigorous content and meet the ambitious new standards. 

OUTCOMES: The ESL/Bilingual Endorsement Initiative Coursework program will result in an increased
number of educated and properly endorsed teachers of ELs in our district. This creates increased
opportunities for students to learn more rigorous content and not only expand the opportunities to
learn English, but will also support the development of bilingualism and biliteracy.

COMPENSATION: Tuition payments to all three (4) universities during the payment period shall not
exceed $600,000 total through June 30, 2018
