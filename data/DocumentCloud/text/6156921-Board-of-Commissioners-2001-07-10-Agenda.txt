the commencement of any work on the s ubject property, including mass grading and the installation
of site utilities, pursuant to any permit issued by Cook County. Said fe ncing shall remain in place
until a certificate of occupancy is issued for the structure. The location of the perimeter fencing may
be changed during the construction period with approval of the Building and Zoning Department.
"No Trespassing" signs shal I be mounted on the fencing in conspicuous locations around the site. If

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Tuesday, June 26, 2001 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North C lark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Sandra K. Williams, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, announced a revised Transfer of Funds
packet was delivered to the Commissioners earlier.

2378

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2001
Commissioner Hansen noted that the figures in the Appropriation Trial Balance are difficult to read
because of the fo nt size. He said he hoped to receive a revised document that would be easier to read and
asked that the totals be placed in the front of the document instead of the back. He indicated there is no
percentage on the amount of time of the year e lapsed in the fiscal year, to measure against the percentage
of expenditures out of the adjusted appropriations.
John Chambers, County Comptroller, stated that the font will be increased and the percentages of the year
expired will be added.
C hairman Daley asked Grace Colbert, Director of Budget and Management Services, to explain the
purpose of the Transfer of Funds meeting.
Ms. Colbert explained that a budget is an estimated spending plan and in order to realign any
appropriation, the Board authori zation is necessary during a transfer of funds meeting. She added, once
into the fiscal year, if it is determined that certain line items are under- or over-estimated, then the line
items are realigned. She said the debt is shuffled and the departments cannot exceed the original
appropriation. Ms. Colbert concluded by stating that since 1995, transfers requested have always been
less than two percent.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the majority of departments use surplus funds from vacant positions? He
asked ifthe Budget Department was aware of certain trends in the transfer requests since 1995?
Ms. Colbert responded that the 110 Account (Salaries and Wages of Regu lar Employees) is the largest
area from which transfers are made and are usually taken from vacant positions.
Comm issioner Quigley stated that based on the information provided, it could be assumed that transfers
of funds is a permanent system that creates contingencies so departments can transfer fund s at will midyear. The Commissioner further stated that this blindsides the budgetary process and said in time he
hopes transfer requests will be less than half of one percent.
Chairman Daley stated that prior to budget approval, all commissioners have the opportunity to reduce the
budget by offering amendments that could eliminate positions in departments.
Commissioner Si lvestri asked about procedures used by other units of government with regard to
transfers of funds.
Chairman Daley stated that in some cases, other governments may allow fund transfers without approval
by a legislative body. For example, the C ity of Chicago operates under different rules. Leave was
granted for Sharon G ist-Gilliam to explain this further.
Sharon Gist-Gilliam, Vice President of Unison Maximus and former City of Chicago Budget Director,
stated that the Cities and Vi llages Act of the Illinois Revised Statutes controls what and how
municipalities can transfer funds. She said the City of Chicago is a special section of the Act and it
all ows transfers among the objects of appropriation within the categories of appropriation. City
departments must present their requests to the City Council by a certain date before a transfer can be
approved. She added that moving monies from one line item to another within contractual services, as an
example, does not require approval; however, if a department requests to transfer funds from contractual
services to materials and supplies, then the department must seek approval from the City Counci l.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's statements, Commissioner Steele said the transfer process is
designed to allow some flexibility in the budgetary process.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 200 I
Commissioner Hansen said he believes the current transfer process provides the Budget Depattment with
accurate information on how to budget for the next year based o n any line item adjustments in the current
year's budget. He said if the Board allows the departments to make adjustments without approval, the
Board runs the risk of not being aware of these budgetary changes. The Commissioner noted that
emergency transfer req uests can be brought before the Finance Committee at any time. Commissioner
Hansen acknowledged that historically the total yearly transfers are less than two percent, which is a
minimal amount for a budget that is $2.7 bi llion and 27,000 employees.
Chairman Daley has submitted questions to departments as part of the record. (The referenced documents
are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)
The Committee considered requests from various departments to transfer appropriations between
budgetary accounts. Chairman Daley proceeded to the requests for transfers of funds under $I 0,000.
They are as follows:

Transfers less than $10,000
Dept. No.

Commissioner Quigley requested detai led information regarding vacant positions and what transfers have
been requested on an annual basis from departments. The Commissioner said that he wants the Board to
be able to see if certain patterns exist in the transfer requests from a desire to have flexibil ity or simply to
adjust line-items in mid-year.
Ms. Colbert clarified that the information that Commissioner Quigley has requested is currentl y available,
but changes each pay period. She acknowledged that the budget is based on every department
maintaining a 3% vacancy factor at all times. She noted that 100% of the vacant positions are not fu nded
and staffing is at a 97% level. Ms. Colbert concluded by stating that it is up to each department to
manage the vacant positions in a way in which 3% of the funding is not spent.

Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn. Seconded by Commissioner Moreno, the motion carried
unanimously and the meeting was adjourned.
Transcripts for this meeting are available in the Office of the Secretary to the Board, I 18 North Clark

Also Present:

Calvin R. Sutker, Commissioner (1); Michael LaMont - Director, Office of Capital

Patricia Shymanski - Interim Chief of Staff

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Thursday, June 21, 2001 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North C lark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item(s) and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
244389

OFFICE OF CA PIT AL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated June 12, 2001:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the County Wide Elevator Modernization Phase II, Bid
Packages 5, 6 and 7. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this
request.

2471

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 200 I
This project provides for modernization of elevators that will be divided into three different
bid packages. Package 5 will provide for work on 11 elevators at the Rockwell Warehouse
and the Department of Corrections parking structure; Package 6 will provide for work on 19
elevators at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and the Durand and Hektoen buildings at
Cook County Hospital ; and Package 7 will provide for work on 13 elevators at the 4th and
6th District Courthouses.
Bond Iss ue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 6/1 9/01.
Chairman Carr asked Michael LaMont to explain the reason for the fiscal impact increase.
Michael LaMont responded that the increase is due to the addition of the two escalators located in the
Cook County Building on the Randolph Street side that go down to the Vital Statistics Department. He
said originally the escalators were going to be modernized after the City of Chicago built the pedway to
the County Building, but the C ity of Chicago informed the County that the City is no longer building the
pedway. He stated that the project adds about $0.5 million to the budget request.
Commissioner Hansen asked the location of the two escalators?
Michael LaMont reiterated that the escalators are located in the Cook County Building on the Randolph
Street side.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what would the escalator modernization provide?
David Roth, Lerch, Bates and Associates, stated that the escalator modernization consists of a total
replacement of all the parts inside the escalator, including steps, axles, bushings, and chains that would
bring the escalators up-to-code. Mr. Roth said the life of an escalator is between twenty-five and thirty
years. He also stated that the escalators have reached the end of their useful life. Finally, Mr. Roth stated
that it is becoming more difficult for current maintenance providers to obtain parts for the escalators and
it is time to replace them.
Chairman Carr asked Mr. LaMont to explain the county-wide elevator modernization.
Michael LaMont referred to the back-up materi al, " Summary of the County-W ide Elevator
Modernization" that highlighted the condition of the 354 elevators throughout Cook County. Mr. LaMont
stated that in 1999, he requested approval of a $24 million county-wide program for elevator and
escalator improvements. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy evaluated all county escalators and
elevators and the units were categorized as poor, fair, good and excellent. Currently, there are four
moderni zation contracts and when those contracts are complete the number of units that are now poor and
fair will drop and the amount of escalators and elevators in excellent condition will increase.
Mr. LaMont further stated that if the request before the committee today is approved and once the project
is completed, within two years the County will be at a point between good and excellent for almost 90%
of all the elevators in the County. He concluded by stating that most of the poor units are in the old Cook
County Hospital and the old Children's Hospital and are not being upgraded because they are slated for
demolition.

2472

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2001
Commissioner Collins asked how the elevators in the County Building are rated?
Michael LaMont stated that the elevators are in either good or excellent condition. He said a complete
rehabilitation was done in the early 1990s and there have been occasional problems but all have been
renovated.
Commissioner Collins asked the total amount allocated for the project.
Michael LaMont responded the amount allocated is about $24 million.
Commissioner Collins asked how much has been spent so far?
Michael LaMont stated that he does not have an exact amount at this time, but will have it for the
Commissioner after the meeting.
Commissioner Hansen asked what steps are being taken now to ensure that the elevators do not reach the
42% level in the future?
Michael LaMont stated that a continuing program is not needed because of the full modernization but in
five to ten years a mid-term modernization may be necessary in addition to standard elevator
maintenance.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there is any kind of a program that keeps up with the expenditure and
maintenance of the elevators before they fall into the poor condition?
Michael LaMont asked David Roth from Lerch, Bates and Associates to respond to Commissioner
Hansen's question.
David Roth stated that the County is currently performing spot audits and during these spot audits, Lerch,
Bates and Associates randoml y selects elevators and escalator units to audit. Technicians physically go to
the job site to perform audits on units that are measured against industry performance standards. All
deficiencies are reported to the maintenance contractor who has a thirty day-time frame to correct any
deficiencies. He concluded that Lerch, Bates and Associates photographs and documents all deficiencies
in reports.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler,
Communication No. 244389, as amended. The motion carried.

Michael LaMont stated that about half of the requested funding is for the 1900 West Polk Building and
the rest is for connection wiring between all other buildings wired into the new phone switch installed
under a separate contract for the new Cook County Hospital. Further, he stated that this is a low voltage
voice and data wiring that is the same wiring in the Daley Center and the Cook County Building. Mr.
LaMont stated that the cost to wire a building is six dollars per square foot.
Commissioner Hansen asked what percentage of the Polk Building will be used for hospital
administration in terms of square feet?
Michael LaMont stated that he would respond with a breakdown at a later date. He stated that the Bureau
of Health Services has offices in the building and does not know the breakdown per square feet.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how much has been invested in the 1900 West Polk Building for long-term
use?
Michael LaMont stated that in the past five years about $7 million worth of renovation has been spent on
the building and covers the modernization of the elevators, completely new elevator cabs and controls,
new electrica l switchgear, fire alarms, new electrical wiring, new chillers and new air conditioners.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if additional funds are needed for the Administration Building?
Michael LaMont stated that if more space is needed, the building would have to be reconfigured to
accommodate a particular department and there would be a cost. Mr. LaMont further stated that the
Administration Building was not built as an office building. He also stated that this summer the Office of
Capital Planning and Policy will be working with the Bureau of Health Services on the administrative
space needs of the building and depending on the outcome, funds will be allocated in the Capital Budget
for next year.
Commissioner Collins asked if a feasibility study was done before investing $7 million in the building?
Michael LaMont stated that a feasibility study wou ld show that a new building would cost more. He said
that the building is now functioning as an office building.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated June 14, 200 I:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request to allocate $12,940,000.00 from the
contingency and equipment line items in the New Cook County Hospital Budget to the
contract with Walsh/ Riteway, Joint Venture Construction Manager. It is respectfully
requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This request can be categorized as follows:

2474

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2001

MEP Design Revisions - Various revisions to the plans primarily due to mechanical,
ventilation, electrical and fire alarm/firewall changes. Several of these changes are
categorized as potential errors and/or omissions. (Note that the County has a wrap-up
insurance policy to cover professional liability).
Owner/User Requests - During the final design of the facility, hospital staff requested
improvements to the design for optimum functioning of the new hospital. Some of these
requests included expansion of the pneumatic tube system, changes to the burn unit,
incorporation of additional dialysis facilities in selected patient rooms and other changes.

Equipment Related Changes - The final preparation of the equipment bid packages has
caused refinements in the utility design of the building, therefore, additional electrical,
mechanical and plumbing work has to be added to the base design.
New Regulatory Requirements - The nature of a multi-year construction project is that
there will be regulatory code changes that must be accommodated before the facility opens.
The changes requested here pertain to the coding of fire and smoke dampers that was not
required during initial code reviews.
All of the funds requested at this time will be allocated from the contingency line item and
the equipment line item in the budget. This budget was approved by the Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994.

Comm issioner Hansen referred to the contract modification chat1 and asked about modification #2.
Michael LaMont stated that the chart represents increases that are attritiutable to the main construction
budget. He said contract modification #2 was approved for technology item s, which were not part of the
construction budget.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how much of the design revision could be subject to professional liability?
Michael LaMont responded forty-one percent.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ifthere are potential errors and omissions that could apply?

2475

 JO URNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2001
Michael LaMont stated the Office of Capital Planning and Policy reviews any change orders before be ing
submitted to the professional liability carrier to investigate. He said two claims are currently under
review.
Commi ssioner Silvestri asked if a claim is deni ed, what is the next step?
Michael LaMont said he really cannot respond to the question because no claims have been approved or
denied.
Commissioner Sutker asked what portion of the mod ifications are reinstatements of any items previously
removed from the original bid?
Michael LaMont stated that the reason items were removed from the original bid was to re-examine the
project scope in order to lower the cost. As a result, the project was reduced by between $ 15 and $20
million. Further, he stated the cost of the project was further reduced due to competitive bids that the
County did not initially have.
Mr. LaMont stated that he bel ieves no items were put back in the bid, but will review the request and
respond to the commissioner.
Commissioner Sutker stated in regards to the errors and omissio ns, the County's recoveries from the
errors and omissions policies are contingent upon many considerations. He asked if there are any joint
and severable liability policies included in the $20 million package?
Michael LaMont stated that he would like to look at the policies in particular in order to answer the
commissioner's questions.
Chairman Carr asked Michael LaMont to make sure the committee rece ives copies of the response.
Commissioner Butler asked if pages ten through fifteen of the backup materi al could be made part of the
record regarding the reasons for modi ti cations.
Chairman Carr stated these pages should be made part of the record. (The referenced documents are on
file in the Office of the County Clerk).

Informati on on how the Institutional Review Board (IRB) functions throughout the Bureau of
Health Services
Review the functions, process and concerns of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)
Reviewing and understanding the federal guidelines that regulate all research in volving human
participants

2479

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 200 I
Following the Roll Call, Chairman Butler made remarks regarding the purpose of the meeting. He stated
that in 1986 when he was elected a county commissioner, there were research issues at Cook County
Hospital regarding the use of dilantin, and most commissioners did not realize this drug was being used in
research cases at the hospital. As a result, Chairman Butler decided it would be prudent to discuss these
bio-ethical issues before the Health and Hospital s Committee to inform the commissioners of the
guidelines used in research activities.
Ruth Rothstein stated that at one time each institution had their own review board but now the Bureau of
Health Services has consolidated these boards into a single Institutional Review Board (IRB). Further,
Ms. Rothstein stated that Dr. Peter Orris, Chairman of the Institutional Review Board, would give a slide
presentation and discuss the function of the board and federal guidelines that regulate all research
involving human participants. Chief Rothstein introduced Lynda Brodsky, Director, Research Affairs, as
well as the other members of the Institutional Review Board: Dr. Bradley Langer, Dr. Madhu Malhotra,
Dr. Linda Murray and Dr. Aaron Hamb.
Dr. Orris stated that the Institutional Review Board was established to protect the rights and welfare of
human subjects in research activities; and said a review of any project is based on three ethical
foundations: I) respect for persons; 2) beneficence; and 3) justice.
Dr. Orris said the IRB recognizes the personal dignity and anonymity of each individual and the
individual is given an informed consent as to whether they want to participate in the research activities.
He said if they choose not to participate, they must understand that their medical care will not be
impacted. He further stated research is voluntary and for those who participate, do so out of a desire to
improve medical knowledge.
Dr. Orris continued that all research has some risk because the research involves comparing a known drug
to one that may be better based on both animal and human experiments. He said patients must understand
this ri sk and it is the obligation of the Institutional Review Board to make certain there is a balance
between the safety of the patients and any risk. Finally, Dr. Orris said that the benefits and burdens of the
research are to be fair and that the ri ghts of patients are to be protected within the process.
In response to Commissioner Hansen ' s question, Dr. Orris defined research as the desire to improve
medical knowledge.
Commissioner Sutker questioned when a hospital advertises for research, whether the ad indicates the
possibility of side effects from the drugs. He also asked about liability issues and if patients sign waivers.
Dr. Orris stated that he does not believe there have been any liability issues involving any studies the
Institutional Review Board has undertaken. He further stated an attorney from Risk Management and an
Assistant State's Attorney are present at all meetings.
Commissioner Moreno asked how many studies are currently underway at the Bureau, in what research
areas and what other research the hospital would like to undertake?
Dr. Orris said he would respond in writing to the question.
Chairman Butler asked Ms. Rothstein to give a closing statement.
Ruth Rothstein stated she believed today' s meeting was successful and educational. She said each month
a grants newsletter is distributed to County Board members from Lynda Brodsky' s office that may answer
questions commissioners have or they can contact the Bureau of Health Services.

242356

TOWN OF CICERO (NO CASH BID REQUEST.) Transmitting a Communication, dated
March 19, 200 I from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting
a request from Judd M. Harris, Attorney.

2481

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY JO, 2001
The Town of Cicero is requesting tax certificates from the No Cash Bid Program for the tax
delinquent properties in the submitted list.
The intended use of the parcels is for public purposes including but not limited to : parking
lots, green space and play lots. Submitted is a copy of Resolution number 78-01 , in which
the Town of Cicero formally requests the no cash bid for these parcels. Also included are
Sidwell maps of each parcel. A photograph and current title search of each parcel will be
given to the Board within the week. In add ition, Fredda Berman, attorney for the Cook
County Clerk, has been notified of the proposed no cash bid on these parcels and has sent out
the necessary thirty-day letters required under lllinois law.
The Town of Cicero has retained Judd M. Harris, Esq. to file petitions for tax deeds for the above
mentioned parcels.
Fredda Berman, Director of Real Estate Services, stated that parcels 16-21-035-007, 16-21-309-012, 1622-102-010, and 16-28-219-00 1 are available for a No Cash Bid purchase, but are subject to prior tax
sales that could yield tax deeds to buyers from the 1999 Scavenger Sale. She said if a deed is awarded,
the court will require payment of the delinquent taxes, and if this occurs after a No Cash Bid sale, then
payment of the delinquencies would be in the fonn of redemption.
Commissioner Carr asked if one of the parcels is a business that owns adjacent prope1ty, but is not paying
taxes on it?
In response to Commissioner Carr's question, Troy Deckert, Department of Planning and Development,
answered that his department is not sure that the business owns the property. The business is a restaurant
that has a parking lot next to it and there are tax delinquent lots located next to those parcels that are being
used as additional parking for the restaurant.
Commissioner Moreno asked how many lots are being considered on the No Cash Bid for C icero?
Chairman Sims answered 22 lots are being considered.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the County has the exact addresses of these properties?
Ms. Berman responded the exact addresses are not known, however the County can establish commonly
known addresses for these properties.
Commissioner Moreno indicated, in late March 2001, the subcommittee approved the transfer of
approximately 42 lots to Cicero on a No Cash Bid basis. He said the request was to use the parcels for
public purposes, play lots, parking lots and other public interest purposes. The Commissioner asked if
there is a manner in which the County can track exactly what will ultimately happen with these lots.
Ms. Berman responded that the Department of Planning and Development requires participants in the No
Cash Bid process to come back to inform the department of the status of the purchases.
Mr. Deckert added that the Department of Planning and Development requests annual reports that the
Department compiles and transmits to the Board of Commissioners. The report includes every parcel
approved as a No Cash Bid.
Chaim1an Sims stated a copy of the annual report would be available to all the comm issioners.

2482

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 10, 2001
Commissioner Moreno asked if the parcels are transferred by way of sale to an existing business if the
County tracks the purchasers and the purchase price amount?
In response to Commissioner Moreno's inquiry, Mr. Deckert indicated that all public records are included
as well as the names of the developers. The law does not require the purchase price to be listed but the
question is asked and if a business is identified in advance, an affidavit is signed attesting that they did
not previously own the property and are not a part of any de! inquent taxes.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the City of Chicago has sole discretion as to who receives these
properties as well as for what purposes?
Mr. Deckert answered that all municipalities negotiate with developers. He said it is a decision made by
the municipalities and voted on by that legislative body.
Commissioner Moreno inquired if requests must be sent directly to the municipality or is it possible to
have the requests conveyed to a 50 l-C3, non-profit organization?
Mr. Deckert acknowledged that the usual procedure is to have the property conveyed to a municipality
because back taxes are cleared and the municipality conveys the parcel(s) to a private developer or nonprofit organization. He said a municipal exemption allows complete wipe-out of the taxes.
Commissioner Collins asked ifthere is a time limit as to how long a property can be held before selling it
or conveying it to another entity?
Mr. Deckert answered that there are annual reports sent to the Department of Planning and Development
from the various municipalities that can be made available to the Board.
Randy Kemmerer, State's Attorney ' s Office, answered that the properties can be held for an extended
amount of time.
Commissioner Goslin asked how long properties remain on annual reports?
Mr. Deckert answered the properties are listed on the reports as long as they are vacant, land banked and
are reported for five years or until the development is completed.
Mr. Deckert requested Judd Harris, Assistant State's Attorney for the Village of Cicero, to address the
subcommittee.
Mr. Harris stated that PIN 16-21-306-032 was deeded to the Town of Cicero in June 1998 and then a tax
deed was issued to American National Bank and Trust Company. He said that the land trust is not one
over which the Town of Cicero has control. It is a subsequent deed and having no known challenges
recorded within two years following the date of deed, and the assumption is a valid title would have been
conveyed. It is hard to say what would have happened if the Town of Cicero had contested the tax deed.
The Town of Cicero was probably made a necessary party in the litigation that led to American National
Bank being named as trustee in October 1998. He noted that counsel for the Town of Cicero, Beth Janaki
Clark, had previously addressed the specifics and substantive issues of the deed with Mr. Deckert.
Mr. Deckert asked if there is anything relevant about PIN 16-21-400-025?
Mr. Harris responded there was a lawsuit about five years ago and does not know the basis of the lawsuit.

2483

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY I 0, 200 I
Mr. Deckert stated that if the lawsuit is not relevant that the Department of Planning and Development
would not object to the parcel being approved and recommends its consideration.
Mr. Deckert referenced PIN 16-22-102-0 I 0 that shows the Department of Transportation. He said his
concern is whether this is some government ownership of the land.
Mr. Harris said there does not appear to be any government interest that would preclude the parcel from
being considered as a No Cash Bid.
Mr. Deckert referenced PIN 16-22-100-006, and said a title search was not received by the Department of
Planning and Development and therefore recommends deferral of this PIN .
Commissioner Moreno referenced PIN I 6-21-306-013 and asked if the parcel was conveyed to American
National Bank and Trust under a trust that would eventually be utili zed to acquire three Cicero owned lots
and two other parcels to construct a Walgreen's Drug Store on Cermak? He inquired if a broker was used
and ifthere are restrictions on monies attained by the municipalities on the sale of such lots?
Mr. Harris could not provide an answer to Commissioner Moreno' s question.
Mr. Deckert said in general, monies attained from sales go to the general fund but in reference to
Commissioner Moreno' s question, he would respond later to the subcommittee.
Commissioner Collins asked ifthe property has to be sold at market value or does the municipality make
the total decis ion on how much and to whom they want to convey it?
Chairman Sims responded that the municipality makes all the decisions.
Chairman Sims stated there are nine parcels not available for approval.
Ms. Berman indicated that the reason parcels 16-20-205-026-0000, 16-20-307-018-0000, 16-21-100-0l 10000, 16-21-205-022-0000, 16-21-205-023-0000, 16-21-209-027-0000, 16-21-306-012-0000, 16-21-308009-0000 and I 6-22-100-005-0000 are not available is because there are not two years of delinquent
taxes available.
Mr. Harris added there were I 5 parcels that were approved at the last tax delinquency meeting and
certificates were not received for these parcels. He wanted to ascertain what was the status of these
parcels.
Chairman Sims asked Mr. Harris to see her assistant, Aeria Charles, for clarification of the status of the
parcels.

Commissioner Carr, seconded by Vice Chairman Schumann, moved the approval of
Communication No. 242356, as amended. The motion carried.
