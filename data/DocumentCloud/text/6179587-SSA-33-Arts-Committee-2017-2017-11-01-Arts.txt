October 24, 2017
In attendance: Sam Marts, Dan Murphy, Charlie Rees, Cortney Lederer, Mary Antonakos, Pamela Maass
(Executive Director), Michael Ashkenasi (Program Specialist)
1. The committee discussed on-going projects
a. The committee discussed the Wicker Tree installation
i. MA relayed that the Parks District has now withdrawn their request for fine arts
insurance, and is stating the boulders are now up optional. The committee
discussed and agreed not to go forward with the boulders due to (a)
safety/climbing/falling concerns, (b) there will be added costs that the artist will
not pick up
ii. The artist will now get final drawings and engineering specs to the Parks District
and hopefully the District will finally sign off
b. The committee discussed the One Big Thing
i. MA relayed that we have received our Grant of Privilege permit
ii. The artist – and her General Contractor - now has to apply for a construction
(“public way”) permit, and has to sign a maintenance agreement for what CDOT
is calling the “non-standard” pavers.
2. The committee reviewed the Arts internship description. Consensus that if we’re going to pay
$15/hour, we should be able to get a very qualified person (grad student, local artist, etc.) MA
will circulate the job description and the committee members will then feed to their networks.
3. The committee discussed reaching out to committee members who haven’t been involved in a
while and seeing if they want to stay on the mailing list or not.
