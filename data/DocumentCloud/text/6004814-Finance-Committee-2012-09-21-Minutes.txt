B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
i. Update from Cook County’s Office of Contract Compliance (Attachment #2)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration. It was noted that the amount cited for deferred liability on the transmittal for request number 1 is
incorrect; a correction to the transmittal will be made. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Ms. Besenhofer stated that staff has continued to evaluate and identify improvements to the process and
information through the transmittal process; some minor adjustments have been made, and the end goal over the
next few months is to improve the process and provide proper information through an integrated electronic
process.
Noreen Lanahan, Director of Finance for the Cook County Department of Public Health, reviewed request
numbers 1 through 11. With regard to request number 4, Board Chairman Carvalho stated that the vendor name
should be the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, rather than the Illinois Department of Public
Aid.
With regard to the grants for the Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), under request
numbers 1 and 5, Chairman O’Donnell inquired whether the grant covers the total cost of the program, or if the
County subsidizes any part of the program. Ms. Lanahan responded that the grant does not cover all of the
expenses of the County; it only covers the payroll expenses of the employees that are on the grant. The operating
expenses, such as real estate, infrastructure and information technology, are all absorbed by the infrastructure of
Public Health.
Further discussion took place regarding the WIC grants. Board Chairman Carvalho stated that the System
receives a number of grants from the State agencies to subsidize activities that, as a Department of Public Health,
it is required to do. Additionally, there are a number of grants that the System receives from the State, to provide
services as a vendor to the State. There has been a history of grants being provided that were adequate to cover
the costs, but as the State’s budget crunch kept their grants flat, and the System’s cost structure constantly goes
up, the cost of doing the grant has exceeded the dollars that are received.
Board Chairman Carvalho asked Ms. Lanahan whether the WIC grants are for services that are mandated, or
whether it is a program that the System chooses to do. Ms. Lanahan responded that it is not a mandated program.
The System enters into a contract with the State; the contract could be given to a not-for-profit company in the
community, which is how it is administered in the City of Chicago. She stated that the grant covers the cost of the
employees that are on the budget. It does not cover the cost of computer systems, rent and incidental operating
costs.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, in the past, the prior Department of Public Health’s leader brought to the
Board a suggestion/recommendation that the System stop receiving grants for services or programs that are not
mandated, because the State wasn’t giving the System enough funding to adequately cover the provision of those
services or programs. The first time it was recommended to discontinue a program/service, it was approved by
the Board with some controversy; the second time that a program/service discontinuance was recommended, there
was more controversy, and the Board reversed the decision to discontinue. He noted that this is a live issue in
which the Board needs to be actively engaged; although some of those activities that the State does not adequately
fund may be exactly where the Board decides a subsidy is necessary, the Board should be aware of which grants
are being subsidized by the System. Chairman O’Donnell noted that the information indicated that the grant does
not cover the costs; however, this is a program that the System has chosen to do because the Board feels like it is
an important service to a population that is traditionally seeking care in the County System. She stated that if the
Board wants to revisit whether or not to do this, then that discussion should be held.

III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
i. Update from Cook County’s Office of Contract Compliance
The Committee discussed the subject of deferred liability in relation to the grant-related requests; deferred
liability is the risk assessment to Cook County government, should a grant not be renewed. Director Michael
noted that a question that might be worth a follow-up review is whether the System might be overestimating the
total deferred liability, from an accounting/bookkeeping standpoint. As the System is generally taking a deferred
liability on nearly every one of the grants held, the reality is that there are not that many grants that the System
terminates or that are not renewed. He added that if the System believes some grants are in areas of high risk
where the State may terminate funding, those are the areas that he would be concerned about continuing to
provide the service, because the System would be responsible for the liability.
Chairman O’Donnell indicated that for grants that do not fully cover costs, the actual costs to administer the
services should be reflected on the transmittal and tracked. Board Chairman Carvalho requested that additional
information reflecting the difference between the grant dollars and the cost to provide services be provided for
these grant-related requests, prior to the Board Meeting on September 28th.
On a separate subject, Chairman O’Donnell noted that there are several requests for consideration that seem to
address the problems that the System has experienced in recruiting and hiring. She asked whether the Human
Resources Committee is reviewing this subject and the subject of addressing the System’s ability to attract the
staff needed. Director Golden stated that the subject matter is not on the agenda for review by the Human
Resources Committee for the meeting scheduled later that day. She stated that the Committee will follow-up on
the subject; once the details have been reviewed, an update will be provided.
During the discussion of request number 12, Board Chairman Carvalho briefly provided information on the
subject that had been previously provided to the Finance Committee and Board. A couple of years ago, it was
highlighted to the Board that nearly all of the System’s coders were not certified. A plan was developed, under
which the coders were given an opportunity to become certified; at the end of this effort, the System was only
going to have certified coders. He requested an update on the subject. John Cookinham, System Chief Financial
Officer, stated that there are currently sixteen (16) coders; thirteen (13) coders are certified, the remaining noncertified individuals were grandfathered in to lesser positions. He stated that there are some people who are on
recall, but in order for them to be recalled, they have to successfully pass the certification test. He stated that the
request to increase the contract with K-Force Healthcare, Inc. is necessary because the System does not have
enough coders in total; however, recruitment efforts are ongoing. Additionally, he noted that the International
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) conversion activities in October 2014 will exacerbate the issue,
because all of the coders across the United States will potentially have to be re-trained and re-certified.
With regard to request numbers 13 and 14, which are requests to increase contracts for the provision of temporary
staffing, it was noted that the purpose of the requests is to work on the backlog of prescriptions; the administration
will be reviewing the matter on an every thirty (30) day basis until the backlog is gone.
LaVerne Hall, Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance, provided a report (Attachment #2)
regarding the review by Contract Compliance of the contractual requests. The Committee reviewed the
information.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 23, as amended, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
C. Approval of Transfer of Funds request (Attachment #3)
Mr. Cookinham presented the request for approval of Transfer of Funds. The Committee reviewed and discussed
the request. Ms. Besenhofer provided additional information regarding the request.
Director Golden, seconded by Director Michael, moved the approval of the Transfer of
Funds request. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Any items listed under Sections III and IV

E. Proposed Resolution authorizing the Chief Executive Officer to approve and enter into certain transactions
in support of 1115 Waiver Demonstration Project and Managed Care arrangements (Attachment #4)
Helen Haynes, System Associate General Counsel, presented the proposed Resolution for the Committee’s
consideration. Board Chairman Carvalho referenced the requirement in the CCHHS Procurement Policy that
communications regarding a purchase from individuals outside the System, System Directors, or from elected
officials be memorialized in a log maintained by the Supply Chain Director and posted on the website. He
requested that similar language be included in the proposed Resolution; it was determined that the proposed
Resolution would be revised to include that language and submitted directly to the Board for their consideration at
the meeting on September 28th.
Director Michael requested that the reporting on these types of matters be done as part of the Chief Executive
Officer’s monthly report to the Board.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #5)
Ms. Besenhofer presented the emergency purchase that has recently been made. In accordance with Part II,
Section 2.10 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy, a communication in writing
was sent to Chairman O’Donnell and the members of the Finance Committee within five (5) business days of
making the emergency purchase.

B. Report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, for the period of June 1, 2012
through August 31, 2012 (Attachment #6)
Ms. Besenhofer presented the report of purchases made under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer. The
Committee reviewed the information.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
C. Financial Reports through August 2012 (continued)
Chairman O’Donnell noted recent changes in the law regarding charity care; as a result, she recalled that recently
it was determined that a review of CareLink would need to take place. She asked for an update on the matter. Mr.
Cookinham responded that there has been a group scheduled to review CareLink for this purpose; this group will
also review it to ensure that it is consistent with what is planned in relation to the Section 1115 Waiver.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Golden, moved to accept the Financial Reports
through August 2012. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

D. Update on implementation schedules and timelines for the following Projects:
i. Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver (Attachment #8)
ii. Global Healthcare Exchange (GHX) contract management /electronic exchange system
iii. Meaningful Use
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver, and provided information regarding a potential contractual request for an application assistance vendor;
this contractual request is anticipated to be presented to the Board for their consideration on September 28th.
Ms. Besenhofer provided an update on the GHX system. She stated that staff has completed the planning and
assessment phase, and the integrated project plan between GHX and Lawson has been completed. Currently, it is
in the design/build phase; this includes all data build, inventory locations and required changes in processes and
procedures. Currently, an update to the current Lawson general ledger system has been installed and tested; it will
be ready to go live on October 1st.
The report on Meaningful Use will be deferred to the October 19th Finance Committee Meeting.

V.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #9)
Mr. Cookinham presented his report, which included information on the following subjects: Revenue Cycle
Updates; Budget and New Programs; and CareLink Report. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Board Chairman Carvalho suggested that the Committee receive information from representatives of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), regarding challenges experienced at the System during their engagement,
particularly with regard to their work on Revenue Cycle Management. He noted that he thought that the vendors
who have been engaged in Revenue Cycle Management have come in with the best of intentions, and discovered
what a challenge the System is; since the System is about to embark on something that is probably several times as
challenging with the Waiver, it would be informative to hear their perspectives as they leave their engagement with
the System.
At this time, Chairman O’Donnell recessed the meeting to the call of the Chair, in order for the Human Resources
Committee Meeting scheduled for 9:00 A.M. to be called to order and recessed to the call of its Chair. Following this
activity, Chairman O’Donnell reconvened the Finance Committee Meeting; the Finance Committee continued its
consideration of the items presented.
During the Committee’s discussion on CareLink, Board Chairman Carvalho asked whether all patients who are not
identified as a sponsored patient are run through the CareLink program. Following discussion, Elizabeth Reidy,
System General Counsel, responded that the subject will be reviewed.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended August 31, 2012. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the nine months with overall
revenue of $708,850 and overall expenses was $699,453.
Net Patient revenue for the nine months was $478,610.
5
Page 67 of 112

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $4,822. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
August-2012 reduced by 6 to 148 days. The 6 day decrease in this figure, as compared to
July-2012 figure, is due largely to the one-time or first-time occurrence of the following
factors:




Movement of accounts with undeliverable addresses to the collection agency;
Correction of pharmacy charging issues; and
Transition of patients previously covered under the LOL program to the Carelink
program.

Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts grew by $6.970M (2.02%) as compared to the November-2011
balance and also grew by $2.173M (0.6%) as compared to the prior month’s balance.
This figure has declined in six (6) out of the last seven (7) months, although there was a
slight increase in this month’s figure. The overall decline in this figure indicates an
increasing number of accounts are completing the collection process.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
6
Page 68 of 112

 diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of August-2012 decreased by
$4.638M (21.9%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is greater
than the previous month’s balance by $1.421M (9.4%) as well. This indicates that fewer
inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of August-2012 increased by $9.059M (4.7%). This
amount is greater than the previous month’s balance by $6.795M (3.5%).
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that fewer accounts are being removed from
active accounts receivable, although an increasing number of accounts are moving to a
“Billed” status. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt writeoffs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $3.734M (16.7%) by the end of
August-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
This month’s balance increased by $0.780M (3.1%). Fewer outpatient accounts are
moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the November-2011, and there was a growth
in the outpatient unbilled accounts during the month of August-2012. The reduction of
internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a decline in the unbilled
accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
7
Page 69 of 112

 The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of August-2012 fell by $2.089M
(1.3%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is smaller than the
previous month’s balance by $4.622M (2.8%).
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $102.365M
Depreciation - $25.224M
Utilities - $7.498M
Insurance - $23.215M
Nonoperating Revenue was $225.419M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
sales tax in the amount of $91.648M and property tax in the amount of $60.364M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois 8
Page 70 of 112

 Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 07/18/2012 - 08/09/2012 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" total is a payment to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Upper Payment Limit Revision is spread over 11 months, beginning Jan-2012, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received.
The "Medicaid Retroactive Payment" was budgeted all at SHCC.

• The 2012 Budget assumed that the outstanding Medicare, Medicaid, and
Other A/R could be accelerated and reduced by 69 million dollars. The 
progress in reducing A/R has been hampered by required billing format 
changes and other required system changes There has been progress in
changes and other required system changes. There has been progress in 
addressing these issues in September that should improve results going 
forward through the balance of the fiscal year. 
• Physician billing revenue was budgeted at a higher level than the current
collections.  The most recent months support that the collections from this
point forward will be greatly improved.
• The 2012 Budget assumed an adjustment to the Upper Payment Limit.  
The UPL adjustments have not been processed as of the end of August.  
CCHHS still expects to receive funds for this issue by the end of the fiscal 
year.

 CCHHS has experienced a shift in the System utilization to more outpatient
 CCHHS has experienced a shift in the System utilization to more outpatient 
activity than was planned in the budget.  This can be seen in the increased 
number of adjusted patient days.
 The inpatient volume has declined from budget by approximately 4%.
 The YTD actual payer mix of admissions and patient days has shifted from 

the levels assumed in the budget of greater volume from insurance payers to 
more self pay patients.
 The payer mix of the adjusted patient days shows that the actual share of 

self pay patients has increased by almost 27% from the budget for 2012.
