PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX

WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to our cultural
identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the County and around
the world by exempting them from the City and County?s amusement tax for live performances; and

WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and de?ne what is and is not ?music?; and

WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not applicable to
the small venue exemption clauSe is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor the expansive de?nition
of music;

WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music genres evolve
and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc. and

WHEREAS, DJ ?5 have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences? Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical
at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds
or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and

WHEREAS, the ?rst Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago?s very own Frankie Knuckles
whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized musical genre during
the 19803 led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and

WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small venues with
a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further amended said ordinance
by de?ning live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art forms including live musical
performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the encompassing term ?music?; and

WHEREAS, the cun?ent language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary confusion
as to what constitutes ?music? and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being required to comply
with inconsistent de?nitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of Chicago; and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74

Taxation, Article X, Amusement Tax, Sections 74?391 and 74?392 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances are

ESTABLISHING EARNED SICK LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES IN COOK COUNTY

WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution,
Article VII, Section 6 and,

WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise any power and
perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of
the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and,

WHEREAS, employees in eveiy industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to tend to their own
health or the health of family members; and,

WHEREAS, in Cook County approximately 40 percent, or 840,000, private sector workers receive no paid sick
leave; and,

WHEREAS, earned sick leave has a positive effect on the health of not only employees and their family members,

but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national suivey of US.
restaurant workers found that two?thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have come to work sick; and,

Page 62 of 69

WHEREAS, earned sick leave reduces healthcare expenditures by promoting access to primary and preventative
care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and,

WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with earned sick leave would result in $1.1 billion in annual savings
in hospital emergency department costs; and,

WHEREAS, nearly one in four American women report domestic violence by an intimate partner, nearly one in
?ve women have been raped, and nearly one in six women have been stalked. Many workers, men and women,
need time off to care for themselves after these incidents, or to ?nd solutions, such as protective orders or new
housing, to avoid or prevent further domestic or sexual violence. Without paid time off, employees are in grave
danger of Iosing their jobs, which can be devastating when victims need economic security to ensure their own
safety and that of their children; and,

WHEREAS, at least 28 local jurisdictions have enacted Earned Sick Leave including Chicago, New York City,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Jersey City and Seattle; and,

employers.
