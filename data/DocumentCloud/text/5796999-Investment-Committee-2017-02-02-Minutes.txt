BY TRUSTEE PEGG – SUPPORTED BY TRUSTEE DIAZ
WHEREAS, at its regular meeting on February 2, 2017, the Board of Trustees of the Police and Fire
Retirement System of the City of Detroit (“PFRS”), received and reviewed correspondence from PFRS
Member Kassel James, Sr. dated January 13, 2017, which included a request to instate Mr. James as
vested member based on his service from January 20, 1986 to January 15, 1996; and
WHEREAS, Mr. James accurately reports that at the time of his termination from service with the Detroit
Police Department in January 1996, the vesting rule in place provided that vesting required 40 years of age
with at least 8 years of service; and
WHEREAS, Mr. James reports that he separated from service with the Police Department at age 32, just
96 hours short of 10 years of service; and
WHEREAS, Mr. James reports that the vesting classification changed after the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9
bankruptcy proceedings to 10 years of service, and cites this policy change as the reason for his request;
and
WHEREAS, the Board maintains the obligation to discharge fiduciary duties to PFRS pursuant to the Public
Employee Retirement System Investment Act, Act 314 of 1965; and
WHEREAS, the Board is required to administer payment of benefits consistent with the terms of the

WHEREAS, the Board limited by the language of the Combined Plan, see Component I Section 14.1(3), to
making only those benefit payments that are required as provided in the Combined Plan; and
WHEREAS, the terms of the Combined Plan do not provide authority for the Board to grant the request
made by Mr. James; and the Board has considered this matter in open session, now therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the Board respectfully denies the request made by Mr. James to be instated as a vested
member based on his service rendered from January 20, 1986, to January 15, 1996, for the reason that the
Board lacks the authority to grant the request; and be it further
RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution will be forwarded to Mr. James and General Counsel:
