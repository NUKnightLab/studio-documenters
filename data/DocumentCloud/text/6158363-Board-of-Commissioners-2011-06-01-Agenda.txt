BIKE TO WORK WEEK IN COOK COUNTY

WHEREAS, commuting by bicycle has health, environmental and economic benefits; and

can improve mental health and cardio-vascular fitness; and
WHEREAS, cyclists miss less work due to illness, accrue lower health costs and are less likely to be late
to work due to traffic or difficulty parking; and
WHEREAS, bicycle commuting saves employees money on parking, fuel and auto maintenance. Bike
riders also contribute less to traffic congestion; and
WHEREAS, up to ten (10) bikes can park in the space of a single motor vehicle, saving infrastructure
costs and scarce urban land, as well as public subsidies of road maintenance and health losses from
pollution; and
WHEREAS, autos are the single largest source of air pollution in the U.S., yet 40 percent of all trips are
less than two (2) miles. Substituting bikes for short auto trips can prevent up to 3.6 pounds of pollutants

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 10, 2011 from
HERMAN BREWER, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $153,463.50 and extend for one (1)
year, Contract No. 09-53-353 with Digby's Detective & Security Agency, Inc., Chicago, Illinois for
Security Services at Hawthorne Warehouse.
Board approved amount 05-18-10:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$156,183.39
153,463.50
$309,646.89

It is important that we continue to protect employees, contractors and visitors against vehicle
related thefts, theft of equipment or tools and theft of personal items. Before the security was
in place, we had several incidents of theft inside the building, as well as unauthorized visitors
entering the building during normal hours of operation. The Hawthorne Warehouse cannot go
without security due to the amount of election equipment and court records that are currently
being stored at the facility. Also, due to the construction being performed under the
Countywide Exterior Wall Renovation Project, the north wall of the building is being
completely demolished and reconstructed which exposes the building to the outside. A
temporary wall has been constructed, but the building is still vulnerable to intrusion under
these circumstances. The total amount of this extension is approximately 2% less than their
current contract.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $153,463.50. Contract extension: May 19, 2011 through May 18, 2012. 20000

Based on the recommendation by the Public Building Commission to consolidate the
Hawthorne Parking Lot Resurfacing and Entrance Control, the Countywide Window
Replacement, Package 1 and the Countywide Warehouse and Records Storage Center Project,
some additional design, rebidding and construction administration services will be required.
This change order includes additional design work for an additional water service connection
to the building, an external water connection for irrigation of landscaping, re-bidding and
construction administration services. Due to the size of the building, the additional water
service is required by the City of Chicago to meet fire protection and egress building codes.
The design will include civil engineering, surveying, fire protection engineering and
coordination with the City of Chicago. The design for an external water connection is needed
for the landscaping that will be included in the newly designed parking lot. Additional funds
will also be needed to cover the cost associated with re-bidding the Project with an increased
scope.

respectfully requesting approval of a Third Amendment to Lease between the County of Cook, as
Landlord, and CASA of Cook County, as Tenant. CASA, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, occupies
space on the eighth floor of the Cook County Juvenile Court Center Building, at 1100 South Hamilton
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. This amendment extends the term of a lease approved by the Board of

ITEM #26
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 4, 2011 from
ANNA ASHCRAFT, Acting Director, Real Estate Management Division
respectfully submits to your Honorable Body and recommends for adoption an amendment to the Public
Way Regulatory Ordinance. This amendment would revise Article III Public Way Regulatory Ordinance,
Chapter 66 Roads and Bridges, Sections 66-88, 66-90 and 66-91 of the Cook County Code.
In 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a Public Way Regulatory Ordinance (07-O33), which established a uniform approach for regulating non-highway uses of Cook County rights of
way, and imposed fees in compliance with state law. Utility companies, pipeline companies and similar
users are required to obtain a license from the Real Estate Management Division, and must obtain a
permit from the Highway Department prior to any construction.

The Ordinance provides certain enforcement powers to the Superintendent of Highways, in the
case of permit violations. The proposed amendment would extend to the Director of Real Estate
Management the ability to issue violation notices and exercise certain remedies in case of license
violations, including use of the administrative hearing process set out in Chapter 2, Article IX of
the County Code.

BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 66 Roads and Bridges,
Article III Public Way Regulatory Ordinance, Sections 66-88, 66-90 and 66-91 of the Cook County Code
is hereby amended as follows:
ARTICLE III. PUBLIC WAY REGULATORY ORDINANCE
Division 5. Violations; Enforcement
Sec. 66-88. Notice and opportunity to cure.
In the event the County believes that a violation or breach has occurred, the County may notify a
grantee, in writing, setting forth the nature and facts of such noncompliance. For purposes of this
division, the “County” may act through the Superintendent, in the case of violations pertaining to permits,
and through the Director, in the case of violations pertaining to licenses.

(a)
Cure period. In the discretion of the Superintendent or the Superintendent's
designate, in the case of violations pertaining to a permit, or the Director, in the case of
violations related to a license, the grantee may be given five days to cure the violation described
in such notice; provided that for violations (other than the payment of money and defaults
described in Section 66-87(f) or 66-87(g), which are not curable) which cannot reasonably be
cured within five days, the grantee may be given such additional period to cure as described in
Section 66-88(c) below.
(b)
Penalties. Where the grantee is given a five-day notice, grantee shall be subject
to penalties for violations described in Sections 66-87(a) through 66-87(f) commencing on the
fifth day after the date of such notice in accordance with Section 66-91, regardless of any

Additional time to cure in appropriate instances. As to violations which cannot
reasonably be corrected within five days, then within such five-day period the grantee shall
respond in writing identifying the steps which have been taken by grantee to correct such
violation and the time frame reasonably necessary to complete such corrective action, and if the
County is satisfied with the corrective action to be undertaken and approves the time frame
requested, grantee shall have such additional time as is agreed by the County to complete such
corrective action.
(d)
Stop work order. As to permit violations, if such violation is not completely corrected
within ten days after the notice described above, then notwithstanding any additional cure period which
may be granted in accordance with Section 66-88(c), or in the case of an incurable violation in the
discretion of the Superintendent, the Highway Department may also issue a "stop work" order under the
permit. In addition to the foregoing, if at any time the Highway Department determines that a grantee's
insurance has lapsed or that the continuance of the work is likely to cause imminent harm to persons or
property, the Highway Department may issue a "stop work" order until such matter is corrected.
Sec. 66-90.

Remedies

If the grantee fails to cure a violation within the applicable cure period, and also in the case of an
incurable violation, then the County shall have the right to invoke any remedies available at law or in
equity, in addition to assessing penalties, and any of the following remedies, any of which may be
exercised individually or cumulatively:
(a)

Revoke any license or permit immediately upon written notice;

(b)
Upon ten days' notice, the County may cure the violation by any means deemed
reasonable by the County, including in appropriate instances removal of Facilities, and recover the costs
from the grantee;
(c)
Upon ten days' notice, the County may deem the grantee's facilities abandoned and
property of the County, except to the extent such remedy would constitute a violation of Federal law.
(d)
In the case of a license violation, upon request by the Director and without any further
notice, the Superintendent may cease processing any permit application, withhold issuance of any permit,
or issue a “stop work” order, until such violation is cured.

Penalties

The Superintendent (and the Director, in the case of a violation of a license agreement) may
impose a fine of not less than $100.00 and not more than $1,000.00 for each offense (unless another
specific fine has been specifically provided for by the Board), upon any person who violates, disobeys,
omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article, a license agreement or a
permit. Each day that a violation continues after expiration of applicable cure periods constitutes a
separate and distinct offense. The current amounts of specific fines are set forth in Section 66-102. These
penalties shall be in addition to any other costs or damages incurred by the County.
(a)
Suit to enforce payment. If any person fails to remit any penalties required pursuant to
this article upon request of the Superintendent, the Director, or the Department of Revenue, the State's
Attorney may bring, or cause to be brought, an action to enforce payment.
(b)
Violations of the provisions in this article are declared to be public nuisances. If any
person fails to remit any penalties required pursuant to this article, the Superintendent, the Director, or the
Department of Revenue may utilize the administrative hearing process provisions, set out in Chapter 2,
Article IX of this Code, to enforce the provisions of this article, adjudicate liability, and enforce payment.
The provisions of this subsection shall be applied prospectively and retroactively, regardless of the date of
the violation.

ITEM #28
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 4, 2011 from

ITEM #29

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 5, 2011 from
THOMAS J. DART, Sheriff of Cook County
by
RASHANDA CARROLL, Executive Director, Department of Reentry and Diversion Programs
requesting authorization to decrease a grant award in the amount of $2,783.00 from the Illinois
Department of Human Services. The purpose of the grant is to provide alcohol, tobacco, and other drug
abuse prevention services in Leyden, Norwood Park, Riverside and Stickeny Townships.

of Commissioners in the amount of $130,574.00. The reduced grant amount will be $127,791.00.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding period: July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

CONTRACTS
ITEM #30
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 12, 2011 from
ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State’s Attorney
by
MICHELE V. LATZ, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State’s Attorney’s Office
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Treatment Alternatives for
Safe Communities, Inc. (TASC), Chicago, Illinois, for the State's Attorney's Office Drug Abuse Program,
a drug diversion and education program for non-violent adult drug offenders with limited criminal
backgrounds.
All previous agreements for this program have had contract periods concurrent with Cook County’s fiscal
year. Although our last agreement expired November 30, 2010, we were unable to immediately renew it
due to the uncertain nature, at that time, of funding in the 2011 budget. At the suggestion of the
Purchasing Agent we are requesting that, if approved, the new twelve month agreement begin June 1,
2011, and will request approval of payment for services received in the interim at a subsequent Board
Meeting. By shifting the contract period to begin mid-year we hope to assist the budget process and
avoid future lapses in the agreement.
Reason:

As the State of Illinois designated agency for court treatment programs as a condition of
probation, TASC is the only authorized agent to act as an intermediary. By contracting with
TASC to administer this program there is a consistency between the State's Attorney's Office's
intervention program and the various court mandated programs available throughout the
system. This contract will ensure continuity of service to participants. TASC has consistently
met or exceeded all performance goals set up by the State's Attorney's Office.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $702,034.00 (FY 2011 - $351,017.00; and FY 2012 - $351,017.00). Contract
period: June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012. (250-260 Account). Requisition No. 12500018.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2012 funds.

ITEM #31 cont’d
Reason:

These vendors are grant partners for the Project Reclaim grant approved by the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and by this Board. Each specific vendor, with
their unique skills and resources, will be able to provide all necessary resources to ensure all
grant goals are met. These goals are obtained by maintaining interagency information sharing
that tracks juvenile needs and services. Accountability-based programs will provide court
advocacy services, gang intervention, mentoring programs, English classes, youth support
groups, after school and summer youth programs, improved academic performance and
positive decision-making skills. Restorative justice programs will provide peer jury and peer
mediation, family group conferencing programs, viable alternatives to court prosecution and
conflict resolution for first time or early juvenile offenders, victim/offender conferencing, and
peace-making circles, all of which lead to the reduction of recidivism. Partners will also
provide risk and needs assessment, intensive one-on-one mentoring services,
counseling/therapy in individual, group and family modalities, and referrals to other mental
health and substance abuse providers. The State's Attorney's Office has identified areas in
need of services across Cook County by evaluating police and Juvenile Justice Enterprise
Management System (GEMS) reports as well as reports generated through computer mapping
of juvenile crime, and has identified these uniquely qualified partners in each of these areas.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Funded Amount: $345,000.00. Contract period: June 1, 2011
through November 26, 2011. (833-260 Account).
