PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO SUPPORT ASSESSMENT REFORM
WHEREAS, analyses revealed that Cook County's unique property tax system created an inaccurate
system that lacks transparency; and
WHEREAS, analyses have revealed that the hardest hit by said system were people of color and owners
of lower-priced properties such as those located in the South Suburbs; and
WHEREAS, property tax reform, including as it relates to accurate assessment of property is vital to
creating a fair and transparent system as well as fostering economic development throughout Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, using improved data will help eliminate uncertainty and hidden costs in the current system,
which deter institutional investment and hurt our economy; and
WHEREAS, utilizing transparent assessment methodology and better data will make it easier for
institutions to invest in less familiar asset classes and neighborhoods, giving a stimulus to places that need
it most; and
WHEREAS, international assessment standards recommend assessors employs the traditional three
approaches to value, which are cost, market/sales comparison and income, and while each approach has
its own unique characteristics, their goal is to utilize the most appropriate approach for the specific
property to arrive at its most accurate true cash value or usual selling price on an annual basis; and
WHEREAS, by collecting income and expense data up front on an anonymized and bulk basis the Cook
County Assessorâ€™s modeling and valuations teams will be able to take current market rents, vacancy
rates, and trends into account, to deliver fair, accurate and transparent assessments; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly is currently considering legislation (HB2217) sponsored by
Representative William Davis and (SB1379) sponsored by Senator Toi Hutchinson to enable Assessors
including the Cook County Assessor to collect relevant data to properly determine said values; and
