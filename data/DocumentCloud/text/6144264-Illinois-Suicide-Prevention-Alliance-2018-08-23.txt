Guest Speakers: Jessica Gerdes, Maryann Mason and Jennifer Martin – Suicide Data Presentation(s)






Jessica Gerdes gave an overview of the Youth Risk & Behavior Survey (YRBS), which has been done in conjunction
with the CDC for approximately 20 years. The YRBS is a sampling of all Illinois high school students. The data
presented at this meeting was taken from a 109 page report summarizing the results of the survey and analyzing
trends in suicide-related questions from 2007-2017. The survey included five questions regarding suicide (#s 26-30);
please see the handouts for data broken down by gender/age/race. The Peoria school districts are considering doing
their own survey, but are unsure if they will actually follow through as the process requires funding and is laborintensive.
Maryann Mason presented two data briefs: Suicide rates among Illinois youth ages 10-17 has increased overall in
Illinois from 2010-2017; and a report regarding suicide among the elderly will be released in September 2018 to
coincide with Suicide Prevention Month. A member asked if there are data on incarceration. It was explained a
certain number of cases are needed to report dat. Teen suicide is rare and incarcerated is rarer. Dr. Olivia Johnson
shared she has some county data for this population.
Jennifer Martin gave an overview of the subway map (page 26 of the data book) showing the leading causes of
injury/death contained within the Making Illinois Safer: Injury, Violence, and Suicide Prevention Data Book among
different age groups. The book also includes cost data and rates for suicide/suicide attempts by age and
gender. Members asked why the “subway” map states suicide is the 5th leading cause of death for ages 15-24 - ISPA
members thought it was the third leading causes.
o In follow-up to the meeting, Jennifer consulted with data staff to provide the following clarification. The
subway map is the leading causes of injury deaths… not all mortality. Also, the subway map includes very
large “buckets” of topics, such as firearm and motor vehicle, would be lumped into unintentional, probably
TBI too… then Suicide is 3rd

 Overview of Suicide Prevention-Related Legislation – Steve Moore









The National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act (3-digit suicide hotline) was signed into national law on August 14,
2018. The intent is to study the current effectiveness of the hotline, the feasibility to add a 3-digit number, what the
cost will be, and how to pay for a 3-digit number.
The Firearms Restraining Order Act was signed into Illinois law (Public Act 100-0607) and will become effective on
January 1, 2019.
HB 4658 - School Code – Mental Health Awareness - is now Public Act 100-0903. Provides that, at least once every 2
years, a school board shall require in-service training of licensed school personnel and administrators (rather than
school guidance counselors, teachers, school social workers, and other school personnel) who work with pupils in
kindergarten through grade 12 (rather in grades 7 through 12) to identify the warning signs of mental illness and
suicidal behavior in youth (rather than in adolescents and teens).
Other bills related to mental health
o SB 1707 - School Code – Booking Stations - is now Public Act 100-0204.
o HB 5111 – Behavioral Health Workforce Education Center Task Force – is now Public Act 100-0767.
o HB 5109 – Community Behavioral Health Care Professional Loan Repayment Program – is now Public Act
100-0862.
o SB 2951 – Early Mental Health and Addictions Treatments Act – is now Public Act 100-1016.
Chuck Johnson and Steve Moore had a teleconference with Senator Jill Tracy. Senator Tracy had a call with IDPH
Chief of Staff Erik Rayman which resulted in a letter to the IDPH Medical Director, Dr. Nirav Shah. Dr. Shah asked the
ISPA to identify what they want to do but can’t do to lack of funding. Please email Steve with ideas and suggestions,
to express interest in participating in this ad hoc committee, or to offer resources whether it be time, money,
etc. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, Illinois Chapter believes more resources are needed for
suicide prevention. Steve Moore, along with Chuck, are developing an ad hoc committee to brainstorm on ideas of
what is needed and what can be done with more resources. If you are interested in this committee, please contact
Steve Moore at smoore200400@yahoo.com.
