Minutes
March 27, 2018
In attendance: David Ginople (chair), Alma Weiser, Carron Little, Mary Antonakos, Sam Marts, Jordan
Miller (WPB/SSA Arts + Social Media Admin), Sam Choudhury (SSA program manager), Hans Kumler (SSA
program specialist).

1. The committee discussed RFP for Wicker Park Fest Arts programming. More proposals are
needed and the Arts Committee will forward information to local artists for added visibility.
Proposals are due Friday April 20th, 2018.
2.

The committee discussed concepts for a neighborhood-wide “storefront activation” project.
Overall, committee thinks project should convey a future-oriented view of what WPB could be
with added art in vacant spaces. The committee aims to encourage public interest in WPB’s
vacant spaces through this initiative. This may look like: selecting amenable property owners (of
vacant property) and developing a branded “wallpaper” to install on vacant storefronts.
Wallpaper could be designed by local artists, with commissions provided by SSA.

3. HK/SC stil working with artists commissioned for the 2016 & 2017 public art installations (Lynn
Basa and Mike Helbing). No updates at this time. Chicago Sculpture Exhibition will install 5
sculptures in SSA 33 in early/mid May.
4. The committee discussed outlining a template for artist agreements, that clearly states the
payment structure. Committee would like SSA to pursue legal aid in creating these agreements
to ensure work is completed in a timely manner.
