RESEARCH FEE FOR PROPERTY TAX RESEARCH REQUESTS ORDINANCE
(PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Transmitting a Communication, dated July 15, 2008
from Maria Pappas, County Treasurer:
submitting a proposed ordinance creating a Research Fee for Property Tax
Research Requests for your consideration and request placement of the proposed
ordinance on the Cook County Board of Commissioners Board Meeting Agenda
for full Board consideration.
The proposed ordinance will allow the County Treasurer to charge and collect from
a Refund Company a fee of $50.00 per research request for all refund applications
for which the Refund Company fails to provide Documentary Proof.
There is no fiscal impact associated with the collection of the fee authorized by this
ordinance and it is anticipated that $200,000.00 will be generated through the
issuance of this fee to be deposited in the Tax Sale Automation Fund.
The purpose of the Fee is to supplement the resources of the Treasurer that must
be utilized to train its employees and process each research request made on
behalf of Refund Companies which may require numerous hours to complete
depending on the Property Index Number (“PIN”), payment year and payment
method.
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
PROPERTY TAX RESEARCH REQUESTS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Treasurer (the “Treasurer”) in the capacity as
County Collector, desires to clarify the procedures for conducting research to
determine the proper claimant to a refund for any property that has been assessed
twice for the same year, or assessed before it becomes taxable, or if property
taxes have been overpaid by the same claimant or by different claimants, as
authorized by the Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/ 20-175; and

WHEREAS, the efficient operation of the County Treasurer’s Office pertains to the
County’s government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Treasurer in the capacity as County Collector is responsible for
issuing refunds for erroneous assessments or overpayments pursuant to the
Property Tax Code, 35 ILCS 200/ 20-175; and
WHEREAS, Refund Companies and individual taxpayers submit to the office of
the Treasurer capacious numbers of requests for research to determine whether a
refund is available, whether the refund application was timely filed and whether the
refund applicant is the proper claimant for purposes of determining eligibility for
refunds, over payments, or correction of erroneous assessments; and
WHEREAS, the resources of the Treasurer must be utilized to train Office
employees and process each research request made on behalf of individuals and
Refund Companies which may require numerous hours to complete depending on
the Property Index Number (“PIN”), payment year and payment method; and
WHEREAS, a research request, depending on the payment method, may be
complex and require reference to the PIN Research System, the Electronic Tax
Paying Agent (“TPA”) System, the Internet site of the Treasurer, the over-thecounter RCS cashiering software data base (which itself requires a determination
whether the payment was in cash or by check for one PIN or a batch of PIN’s) and,
for pre-1999 payments and the Treasurer Microfiche files.
