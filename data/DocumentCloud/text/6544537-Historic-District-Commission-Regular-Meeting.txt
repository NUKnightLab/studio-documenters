STAFF REPORT: 11-13-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6533
ADDRESS: 1550 HUBBARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: HUBBARD FARMS
APPLICANT: ROBERT HOCHSTADT
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 10-16-2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 11/7/2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: INSTALL SOLAR PANELS AT ROOFTOP
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 1550 Hubbard is a two-story, single-family dwelling that was erected ca. 1910. The
resource is rectangular in plan and is clad with brick. The primary roof is hipped with a front gabled wing
and is topped with a front-gabled dormer. A lower, gabled-roof is located to the rear of the building.
Asphalt shingles cover the roof. Windows are double-hung, wood-sash units. A partial-width, flat-roof
entry porch with Ionic wood columns/supports and masonry stoop shelters the home’s primary entrance.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to install two solar panel

 arrays at the building’s roof. Specifically, as per the attached, the applicant proposes to undertake the
following work items:
Solar Array # 1
• Install an eight-panel, 10’-10”x 17’-2”x 17’-3”x 34’-10” array and associated flush-mounted rail
system, at the south-facing roof surface
Solar Array # 2
• Install a four-panel, 11’-3” x 12’-11” x 12’-10” x 12’-3” array and associated flush-mounted rail
system, at the rear, lower gabled roof
Solar Edge Inverter
• Install equipment/solar edge inverter near the utility meter at the rear of the house (specific location
is unclear/photos of specific location has not been submitted)
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The smaller solar array (Solar Array # 2) will not be visible from the public right –of-way due to its
placement at the building’s rear wing
• The larger solar array (Solar Array # 1) will be visible from the public right-of-way
• As per HDC resolution, HDC staff has the authority to approve new solar panel installations under
the condition that the y are not visible from the public right-of-way. Staff forwarded this
application to the HDC for review because the larger solar array will be visible from the public
right-of-way
• The application outlines the presence of two solar panel installations in the neighborhood (1551
Hubbard and 1520 Hubbard). The installation at 1551 Hubbard was approved by HDC staff on 101-2019 because the installation would not be visible from the public right-of-way. A review of the
project files for 1520 Hubbard revealed that the Commission did not issue an approval for the
installation of solar panels at 1520 Hubbard
• The Commission recently approved two applications for solar panel installations which are visible
from the public right-of-way for the following reasons:
o 4444 Second (Warren Prentis) - The building is industrial in nature, the prevailing character
of the immediate environment is commercial in nature, and the panels were compatible
with the diverse physical appearance of the adjacent architectural resources. The panels
were minimally-visible from the right-of-way as they were pushed back 7’-0” from the roof
edge, behind a 3’ -0” -high parapet. Finally, a solar panel array which was installed at the
building roof in 2010 (also visible from the public right-of-way) established a precedent for
solar panels at the building.
o 479 Prentis (Warren Prentis) – The building is located in a residential neighborhood,
however, the array was set back 14’-9” from the house’s front face, behind a chimney. The
applicant’s initial submittal did propose to install the array directly north of the chimney, in
a location which would be highly visible from the public right-of-way. However, after
discussion with HDC staff, the applicant repositioned the array to a less-visible location,
behind the chimney/14’-9” from the house’s front face. Also, the adjacent 4-story apartment
building served to further minimize the visibility of the western roof slope and the proposed
array. Staff therefore felt that that the installation would be minimally
visible/inconspicuous and would not detract from the building’s or districts historic
character.

 •

The solar array proposed for installation at the rear portion of the roof will not be visible from the
public right-of-way. However, the eight-panel array will be visible. See the National Park Service
Bulletin entitled “Interpreting the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, # 52
Subject: Incorporating Solar Panels in a Rehabilitation Project”:
https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/applying-rehabilitation/its-bulletins/ITS52-SolarPanels.pdf
This bulletin notes that “properties with a hipped or gabled roof are generally not good candidates
for a rooftop solar installation. Solar panels on historic buildings should not be visible from the
public right of way such as nearby streets, sidewalks or other public spaces.” However, the below
National Park Service publication entitled “Illustrated Guidelines on Sustainability for
Rehabilitating Historic Buildings” does cite two examples of solar installations that are “…visible
but not conspicuous…” and thus meet the standards:
https://www.nps.gov/tps/sustainability/new-technology/solar-on-historic.htm

•

Finally See the below link to the National Park Service publication entitled “Illustrated
Guidelines on Sustainability for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings” which outlines the
“Recommended” and “Not Recommended” treatment re: the installation of new solar panel
equipment at the exterior of historic buildings
https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/rehabilitation/guidelines/solar-technology.htm

ISSUES
• It is staff’s opinion that the proposed eight-panel array will be conspicuous/visible from the public
right-of-way and is not appropriate within the building’s residential context/general environs
• When staff received the initial proposal, staff did counsel the applicant to seek an alternative
location which might minimize the array’s appearance. It is unclear if the applicant undertook such
analysis and exhausted all other options
RECOMMENDATIONS
As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that the proposed eight-panel array will be conspicuous/visible from
the public right-of-way and is not appropriate within the building’s residential context/general environs.
Staff therefore recommends that the Commission deny the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness
(COA) for this work item because the work does not meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation, standard # (2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and standard # (10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken
in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and
its environment would be unimpaired.
In re: to the proposed four-panel array, it is staff’s opinion that the work will not result in the alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property as it will be located at the building’s rear wing and will not
be visible from the public right-of-way. Also, the work will not result in the removal of historic materials
because the current roof surface is non-historic asphalt. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission
issue a COA for the installation of the four-panel array because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation, standard # (2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a
property shall be avoided and standard # (10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction

 shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the
historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. However, staff recommends that this COA be
issued with the following condition:
• The applicant shall submit documentation to HDC staff which clearly indicates that location and
the method of installation for the solar edge inverter for review and approval prior to the issuance
of the COA.
