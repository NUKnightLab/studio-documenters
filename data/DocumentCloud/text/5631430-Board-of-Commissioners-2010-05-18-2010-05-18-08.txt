RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO THE FY2010
ANNUAL PLAN – PLAN FOR TRANSFORMATION YEAR 11
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the attached Amendment to
the FY2010 Moving To Work Annual Plan – Plan For Transformation Year 11 and grant
authorization to submit the document to the United States Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD).

EXPLANATION
On June 26, 2008, CHA executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated
Agreement) between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement. The
Restated Agreement extends CHA’s participation in the MTW Demonstration to the end of
FY2018. CHA’s continued participation in the MTW Program is contingent upon
adherence to the requirements set out in the Restated Agreement, which included
submission of the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan – Plan for Transformation Year 11 to HUD
on October 16, 2009. The document represents CHA's FY2010 MTW Annual Plan and
details CHA’s anticipated activities for FY2010.
CHA determined the need to amend portions of text in the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan to
reflect both newly proposed and revised MTW activities, as well as anticipated
dispositions for the current year.
CHA has organized the discussions of activities in the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan under
the following Sections: General Housing Authority Operating Information, Non-MTW
Related Housing Authority Information, Long-Term MTW Plan, Proposed MTW
Activities, Ongoing MTW Activities-HUD Approval Previously Granted, and Sources and
Uses of Funds. Moreover, each of the activities has been tied to one of the following
MTW Statutory Objectives: 1) Increase housing choices for low-income families; 2) Give
incentive to families with children where the head of household is working, seeking work,
or is preparing for work by participating in job training, education programs, or programs
that assist people to obtain employment and become economically self-sufficient; and 3)
Reduce cost and achieve greater cost effectiveness in Federal expenditures.
To this end, CHA has complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and
HUD regulations regarding annual plans. CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners
approve the Amendment to the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan. Pending Board approval,
CHA will submit the Amendment to the FY2010 MTW Annual Plan to HUD.
