 Planning and Development – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• Department was awarded a $30 million Section 108 Loan Guarantee by HUD, which is allowing
the creation of a new economic development resource and increasing the County’s direct impact
on regional growth.
• To date, the Department has successfully expended approximately $35 million in Federal
Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) affordable housing funds in advance of HUD
deadlines to support development activities including 81 ownership units, 168 rental units, 42
unit demolitions, and 1 public facility across 20 suburban communities. Note - some projects
remain in progress but will be completed by early 2014 in accordance with HUD deadlines.
• Additionally, the Department successfully expended over $15 million in Federal Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to far exceed HUD timeliness ratio standards and fulfill
requirements of an expenditure workout strategy. Almost $6 million was potentially at risk from
past performance problems if these spending targets were not met. This CDBG spending
supported over 100 critical capital improvement projects and varying social services for low- and
moderate-income residents.
• Lastly, in 2013 the Department successfully finished committing $27.1 million of previously
undeployed Federal HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funds dating to 2008 for
affordable housing, thus funding 10 eligible projects across 10 communities based upon a
reconstituted and more robust project pipeline.
13

 Planning and Development – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• To date, the Department has recruited 3 Northwest municipalities to join the HOME Consortium
whose additions are slated to result in an increase of $536,000 in future HOME funding for the
County (based upon current HUD formula calculations).
• Through the use of various tax incentive programs, the Department generated approximately
$150 million in private investment, created an estimated 1,900 jobs, retained 600 jobs and
provided assistance to 48 businesses in 22 municipalities.
• The Department continued to improve its capacity to administer Federal funds including
enhanced compliance with related requirements and resolution of outstanding audit issues.
• The Economic Development Advisory Committee (EDAC) has been reconstituted to advise on
Class 7b tax incentives, policies, strategies, and plans to improve the business environment,
encourage productivity, and support regional economic growth.

14

 Planning and Development – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• The Department is largely funded by federal dollars through the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) via the following ongoing programs:
-

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program - principally provides grants for
social services and infrastructure improvements.
Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program - principally provides grants for shelter and
services for the homeless and those at-risk of homelessness.
HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) - principally provides loans for affordable
housing development.

• Between 2010 and 2013, CDBG and HOME funding allocations from HUD have declined
significantly by 13% and 36% respectively. Notwithstanding these steadily declining resources,
HUD remains the primary funding source for the department.
• The Department was awarded $14.5 million in combined federal CDBG, ESG, and HOME
funds to support 29 capital improvement projects, more than 50 social service and homeless
service agencies, demolition needs, and 6 affordable housing projects consisting of 485 units.

15

 Planning and Development – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• The Department continues to partner and pursue additional resources including competitive
applications for public and private funding such as HUD Choice Neighborhoods Planning
Grants.
• Efforts are ongoing to expand HOME Consortium and/or CDBG Urban County jurisdictions to
include current non-member municipalities. These member additions would result in increased
HUD funding formula allocations, more efficient inter-jurisdictional coordination, and expanded
impact of resources.
• The Department is launching the HUD Section 108 funded $30 million BUILT in Cook Loan
Program to support job-creating economic development activities.
• Continued collaboration in the implementation of the Cook County Land Bank Authority
(including $4.5 million in start-up funds) as well as integration with existing No Cash Bid and
tax incentive initiatives is ongoing.

16

 Planning and Development – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation

• The Department has renewed the use of the County’s allocation of Private Activity Bonds for
the first time in a decade to support an 84-unit affordable housing project with $4.8 million in
bond financing. Utilization of this bond authority will enable access for private entities to taxexempt financing through the County. In 2014, the Department will explore options for
expanded use of this financing mechanism to support other affordable housing and industrial
development projects across suburban municipalities for a broadened economic development
impact.
• In 2014, implementation of streamlining and organizational efficiency improvements based
upon HUD-funded technical assistance will continue. Towards this end, there will be continued
programmatic and staff restructuring around three functional areas: economic development,
housing, and community development for improved coordination and strategic targeting of
limited resources.
• The Department is launching a major strategic planning process to develop a new five-year
Consolidated Plan and Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) for submittal
in 2015 with technical assistance from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP).
These two plans will form the framework for future investments by the County of Federal
resources to further stimulate private investments and economic growth.

the conceptual design of the Stroger Hospital campus redevelopment.
• GEPC: The County’s Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracting (GEPC) initiative will fund
over $60 million in facility upgrades to Stroger Hospital and the Cook County Corrections
Complex. These projects are funded with capital dollars upfront and the energy savings pay
for the improvements over a 20 year period. In addition, these projects reduce operating costs
and greenhouse gas emissions.
• Awards: GEPC received recognition as a Top 100 Chicago Innovations Awards nominee.
21

 Office of Capital Planning – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation
• Energy Manager: Hire an Energy Manager to oversee all energy related capital projects

 Building & Zoning – FY2013 Accomplishments
FY2014 Budget Presentation

•

Increased revenue from permits and inspections - A new strategic and systematic
approach generated a 25% increase in permit revenue and a 39% increase in annual
inspection revenue. This includes the gradual elimination of the full and partial waiver of permit
fees for all governmental entities and not-for-profit organizations in unincorporated Cook
County.

•

Adoption of International Building Codes (IBC) is expected by close of 2013 - Use of
these codes will provide regulations to ensure the construction of safe, sustainable, affordable
and resilient structures and further the attractiveness of these areas as a location for private
investment and job growth.

•

Transition from a paper to an electronic permitting system will provides a controlled,
coordinated, transparent and cost efficient approach and contributes to improving the
attractiveness of Cook County as a location for economic development.

•

Negotiated intergovernmental agreements with the Villages of Oak Lawn, Robbins,
Hoffman Estates, Hanover Township and Leyden Township for the enforcement of the Vacant
Building Ordinance, code enforcement and permitting.

27

 Building & Zoning – FY2014 Budget Highlights
FY2014 Budget Presentation

• Complete transition to an electronic online permitting system – Allow monitoring and
tracking, as well as fee payments for violations and inspections.
• Introduce use of the International Building Code – Educate constituents on the IBC
which will allow the unincorporated areas of the County to utilize a standard and uniform
set of codes that are considered “best practices” within the industry. This will lead to
increased compliance and an improved environment for development.
• Continuation of Strategic Building Inspection Program – Ensures compliance with
codes and regulations, allows for a more efficient use of staff, increases customer
satisfaction and offers a consistent and predictable schedule for the recipients.
• Expansion of intergovernmental collaboration – Expand use of the Vacant Building
Ordinance and Building Code enforcement through new intergovernmental agreements
with suburban municipalities.
