Alexis A. Herrera, Chief Financial Officer, Office of the Sheriff, commented the Audit Report is
done yearly for the Sheriff’s Office Asset Forfeiture accounts. Four (4) accounts were audited
and there was one finding.
Sojourner Colbert, Finance Director, Office of the Sheriff, stated the one finding for the State
Asset Forfeiture Fund was basically a mistake on behalf of the Sheriff’s personnel at the Police
Department. One of the Sheriff’s officers was on an investigation and he came back with the
flash roll monies which were put into a box where all monies were segregated. The monies
should not have been placed in this box.
Chairman Daley asked if all appropriate precautions are now in place to ensure the security of
cash on hand. Ms. Colbert replied in the affirmative.
Vice Chairman Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved to receive and file
Communication Number 307676. The motion carried.
Commissioner Schneider, seconded by Commissioner Reyes, moved to adjourn the
