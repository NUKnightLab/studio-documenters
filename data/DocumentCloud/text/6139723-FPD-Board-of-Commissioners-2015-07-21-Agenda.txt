PROPOSED CONTRACT
Department(s): Resource Management
Vendor: Mark Hansen, Crete, Illinois
Request: Authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to enter into and execute
Good(s) or Service(s): Hay farming
Contract Value: $6,120.00
Contract period: 7/21/2015 through 12/21/2017
Estimated Fiscal Impact: Generation of $6,120.00
Accounts: Revenue Generating
Contract Number(s): 15-31-109
Concurrences:
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
Summary: Historically, hay farming has taken place on land owned by the Forest Preserve District of
Cook County (the “District”). This practice allows the District to generate revenue, while at the same
time preventing invasive plant species from taking over fallow land. It is the District’s intention to
restore fallow land wherever possible and these farming practices are a good method to keep these lands
in a more manageable condition until a restoration project can take place on the site. The contract term
for hay cutting is a period of one year, with two (2) one-year renewal options which gives the District the
option to discontinue farming practices in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.
Mark Hansen was the highest responsible bidder of the two (2) bidders for hay site #8, Zander Woods,
for a total potential revenue generation over the next three years of $6,120.00
