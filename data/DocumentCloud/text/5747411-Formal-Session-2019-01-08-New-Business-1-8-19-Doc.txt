PRESIDENT’S REPORT ON STANDING COMMITTEE REFERRALS
AND OTHER MATTERS:
INTERNAL OPERATIONS STANDING COMMITTEE
THE FOLLOWING ITEM(S) ARE TO BE REFERRED TO THE INTERNAL
OPERATIONS STANDING COMMITTEE:
MAYOR’S OFFICE
9.
Submitting report relative to the Reappointment of Gina Hughes as a member of the
Fire Board of Appeals.
LEGISLATIVE POLICY DIVISION
10.
Submitting report relative to a review of the Michigan Lame-Duck Bills (Nov. 18,
2018-Dec. 31, 2018). (Due primarily to the impact of Michigan’s State office term
limits law, there was a significant turnover of lawmakers in both the Michigan
State House and Senate. This year, during the State Legislature’s Lame-Duck
Session, the State House and Senate submitted approximately 340 bills for the
Governor to consider, of those bills, the Governor vetoed 55 bills. It appears the
term limits law has influenced the legislature to promote bills which
disproportionally support the concerns of special interest, while railing against
causes which would help the less fortunate of Michigan, such as curtailing the
recent voter approved referendum on minimum wage increases, under Senate
Bill 1171, which is detailed in this report. We have attached a complete list of the
Lame Duck legislation and actions for Council’s edification.)

Exemption Certificate No. 3-09-0002, on behalf of Fort Shelby Hotel, LLC, in
accordance with Public Act 146 of 2000 (Related to Petition #557). (On October 23,
2018, Fort Shelby Hotel, LLC, submitted a request for the partial revocation of
Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Exemption Certificate 3-09-0002 (amended) in
order to remove Unite 2 from the property located at 525 West Lafayette, Unit 1

apartments are being converted into for-sale condominiums.)
13.

Submitting reso. autho. HUD Section 108 Loan Guarantee Assistance Program
Request to refinance Six (6) Existing Notes. (The Housing and Revitalization
Department (“HRD”) coordinates several loans the City of Detroit (“CITY”) has
taken out in prior years with the United States Department of Housing and
Urban Development (“HUD”) under the HUD Section 108 Loan Guarantee
Assistance Program (“Section 108 Program”). The City repays the principal and
interest owed to HUD pursuant to the Notes from the annual allocation of
Community Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds received by the City.
The proposed refinancing of the Notes would decrease loan repayment terms by
approximately 2 percentage points that will save the City roughly $2,000,000.00
in CDBG funds over the remaining term of the original Notes. Such CDBG
savings can then be utilized by the City for other purposes.)
