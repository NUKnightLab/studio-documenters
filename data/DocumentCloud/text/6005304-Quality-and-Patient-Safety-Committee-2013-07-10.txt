Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation
Dr. Krishna Das, System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation, presented her report.
She stated that she would like to make couple of announcements and ask for permission to defer the bulk of her
report to the next meeting. She noted that she had an item for closed session, as well.
Dr. Das stated that notification was received yesterday regarding The Joint Commission’s (TJC) survey of
Stroger Hospital that occurred six months ago. TJC has completed and reviewed all of the submissions; Stroger
Hospital received full accreditation for the next three years.
Dr. Das indicated that the System will be facing an Ambulatory outpatient survey sometime in the next six
months. Their last survey date was three years ago, as of October. Staff is gearing up for that; she plans to

Report from System Director of Quality, Patient Safety, Regulatory and Accreditation (continued)

Staff continues their activities relating to a System-wide Culture of Safety Survey. This is the first time that this
type of survey has been done here; there is a requirement by TJC and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) that an assessment is done regarding employees’ attitudes and feelings about the safety culture.
Dr. Das stated that the Survey concludes this week; once the data is collected she expects that it will be
presented at a future meeting.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
The report from Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of
Cook County, was deferred to the Committee’s meeting in August.
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the EMS of Stroger Hospital of Cook County, presented his report. He stated
that EMS met yesterday; a couple of issues were discussed at the meeting. He stated that manpower
shortage issues continue. He noted that the administration is doing what they can to fill the vacancies, but
each time meetings are held and requests are presented, the same issues arise. The second issue relates to
quality. He noted that, at the EMS meeting, Dr. Das presented her report on quality, along with some
suggestions on what can be done to move forward; within the next month or so, staff will do everything
possible to organize and to address those issues.
Dr. Ukoha noted that Ms. Debra Carey, the new Chief Operating Officer of Outpatient Services, was
introduced at the EMS Meeting. It requested that she review the practitioner well-being policy that goes
back to 2004; EMS plans to review this, as well. The policy has been revised a couple of times but has not
been revised from a context of the current makeup of house staff and administration; he expects that this will
be addressed in the next month or two.
Dr. Ukoha added that two items went to Executive Session at the EMS Meeting - one of them will be
discussed later today at the Joint Conference Committee Meeting, and the other will come up in the
immediate future.
