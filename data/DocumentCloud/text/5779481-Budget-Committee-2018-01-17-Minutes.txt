CALL TO ORDER

Pamela McClain called the meeting to order at 4:00 PM.
GENERAL
Review Second Amended DBRA Budget
Mr. Long presented the proposed changes to the budget. The DBRA needs to amend its
budget for two reasons: 1. The DBRA has received considerably more Application and
Administrative Fees than expected due to an increase in traditional Brownfield Plans
received, as well as the Transformational Brownfield Plan. 2. The DBRA has been asked
to pay for costs of environmental due diligence for the AMC Site.
Revenue increases are proposed for Application/Admin. Fees line from $600,000 to
$765,000 and Interest/Other Income from $5,000 to $10,000.
Expense increases are proposed for Legal from $75,000 to $150,000 due to
Transformational Brownfield Plans and the ongoing litigation. The Special Projects
proposed increase is from $40,000 to $255,000 to accommodate the AMC Site
environmental due diligence. Increasing the Special Projects budget to $255,000 would
result in having to use $120,000 of the DBRA’s fund balance. While staff will work
diligently to control costs and try not to use the fund balance, staff did want to be forthright
and recommend budgeting for what anticipated expenses could be for the AMC Site

 environmental due diligence. Less than 10% of the DBRA’s fund balance would be used
for the proposed Amended Budget.
Mr. Long and Mr. Vosburg answered committee members questions regarding the
increase in Administrative Fees and efforts to control costs for the AMC Site project.
Citing no further discussion, Ms. McClain called for a motion recommending approval of
the Second Amended DBRA Budget as presented. The committee members present
unanimously recommended approval of the Second Amended DBRA budget as
presented.
PUBLIC COMMENT
None.
ADJOURNMENT
Citing no further business, Ms. McClain called for a motion to adjourn the meeting.
Committee members present unanimously approved adjournment at 4:05 PM.
