Alexis A. Herrera, Chief Financial Officer for the Sheriff’s Office, stated the 2008 expenses
exceeded the revenue for that year, but such fluctuations are normal, and the overall balance

COOK COUNTY AUDITOR, by Laura A. Burman, transmitting a Communication,
dated May 27, 2009:
We are submitting herewith a copy of the Cook County Public Administrator Internal
Investigation report dated October 17, 2007 from McGovern & Greene LLP.
* Referred to the Audit Committee on June 2, 2009.

Nicholas G. Grapsas, Cook County Public Administrator, stated all relevant law enforcement
agencies related to the inquiry have been contacted including the Attorney General’s Office. He
stated that he has been advised that no further inquiry is pending. In the past, pending
investigations had precluded his office from releasing the audit.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated the Financial
Crimes Unit of the State’s Attorney’s Office considered the available evidence and declined to
pursue an investigation, but did refer the matter to the Attorney General. The Deputy
Supervisor of the Financial Crimes and Governmental Corruption Unit indicated they would not
pursue any investigation, because the three year statute of limitation for state crimes has
elapsed. In the federal system, the limit is five years, with a ten year limit for certain types of
bank fraud.
Commissioner Peraica objected to the fact that the statute of limitations had lapsed, thus
preventing any possible prosecution.

Commissioner Gorman inquired as to the payee’s relationship with the estate in the matter of
the stolen checks. Mr. Grapsas responded it was unclear, but it was determined that the payee
was not an employee of the previous public administrator.

funds of Cook County at any time. The transfers in question were from dedicated reserve funds

identified.

the nine recommendations on page 18 of the independent auditor’s report. (See attachment 2).
At the request of the Public Administrator, a copy of his reply to a published report, co-signed by
Ms. Burman, is included in the record. (See Attachment 3).
