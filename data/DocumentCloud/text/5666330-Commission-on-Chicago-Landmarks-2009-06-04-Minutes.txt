 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
June 4, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on May 7, at 1:15 p.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department of
Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

6016 S. Ingleside
(Lorado Taft Midway Studios – 20th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior rehabilitation of the Lorado Taft Midway Studios building,
including replacement of roofing and skylights and new front porch; and
demolition of later 1970s and 1980s building additions west of the Studios
building (only partially within the boundary of the designated landmark)

Action:

Action on the demolition portion of the project was deferred at the request of
Alderman Willie Cochran, 20th Ward, with owners concurrence, to allow time
for the alderman to convene a community meeting on the project.
The rehabilitation project was approved unanimously with the following
conditions:
1. As proposed, portions of the brick facades of the Studio buildings shall be
repaired, as necessary. Replacement brick shall match existing in size,
finish, color and profile. Landmarks staff shall review and approve
replacement brick prior to order and installation. Tuckpointing mortar shall
match the original in type, color and joint profile. Details of brick
replacement shall be included on permit plans;
2. As proposed, the existing cupola on the roof of the southeast studio building
shall be replaced to match existing. Details of the cupola shall be included
on the permit plans;
3. As proposed, the stucco cladding on the north façade of the northwest coach
house shall be replaced with new stucco cladding to match the profile,
texture, detailing and color of the existing stucco cladding. The plans shall
be revised, however, to eliminate the stucco cladding installation on the west
façade of the coach house (which was not historically clad with stucco).
Details of the stucco cladding shall be included on the permit plans;

 4. Slate roofing, as proposed, is approved for the c.1885 house. For the
remaining Studios buildings, the plans shall be revised to show asphalt
roofing, rather than slate roofing as proposed, unless there is physical or
other evidence that slate roofing originally existed on the buildings; and,
5. The proposed decorative porch brackets, which are conjectural features,
shall be simplified or eliminated from the new porch design. Additional
archival research should be undertaken, however, to identify any available
photographic or other documentation that might provide additional
information on the original porch design and ornamental details; and the
porch design revised to reflect any such new information.
2.

2300 S. Indiana
(Motor Row District – 2nd Ward)

3.

Proposal:

Proposed exterior rehabilitation as part of the conversion of a 6-story warehouse
building into a 150-room hotel with a ground- floor restaurant

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the new windows will be aluminum with single-pane glazing
to match the historic steel-sash configuration and profiles. The proposed
window details shall be revised to accurately show the proposed window
material and profiles;
2. Should any brick replacement be required as part of the masonry restoration
work, all replacement areas are to be reviewed and approved by Landmarks
staff. The existing parapet heights shall remain unchanged. Any new brick
and mortar shall match the existing in size, color, finish, profile, and texture;
and,
3. The halo- lit sign section detail for the refacing of the existing vertical sign
along Indiana shall be revised to show an opaque painted metal face, not a
plexiglass face (the section detail on Sheet 7 should match the section detail
on Sheet 2). The proposed halo- lit “Bennigan’s” sign shall be mounted to a
horizontal raceway bar to be mounted to the horizontal concrete band with
only 2 attachments. The raceway should be painted out to match the color
of the horizontal band, and any conduit and related electrical elements shall
be concealed as much as possible. Sign fixture attachment details shall be
submitted as part of the sign permit application. Any exterior lighting
fixtures shall be reviewed and approved by Landmarks staff prior to order
and installation.

840-842 N. Wolcott
(East Village District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of an attached 2½-story masonry addition on a vacant lot
adjacent to existing 2-story building, including penthouses and decks on both
the proposed and existing structures, for a total 6-unit development

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditio ns:
Existing Building:
1. As proposed, existing windows shall be replaced with new wood or cladwood windows and existing historic wood mullions, trim and brickmolds

 shall remain and be repaired. The replacement windows shall match
historic windows in arrangement, size, glass size, and exterior profiles.
Existing and proposed window details shall be submitted with permit plans;
New Construction:
2. The proposed use of cement- fiber siding on the south elevation is approved,
given its proposed location and corresponding minimal and limited, if any,
visibility from the public way, thereby not negatively affecting the historic
character of the district;
3. Samples of the proposed cast stone shall be submitted to landmarks staff for
review and approval prior to order and installation. The lintels shall project
from the face of the building, creating three dimensionality in the façade
and a shadow line;
4. As proposed, the front façade and finished returns will be clad with common
brick reclaimed from the garage on the site. Should the amount of
reclaimed brick be insufficient for completion of the project, staff shall
review and approve supplementary salvaged common brick, which shall
match the reclaimed brick in color, size, texture and finish or, as an
alternative, face brick for the cladding of the front elevation. An analysis
of whether enough salvaged brick will remain to clad the front of the new
building shall be submitted with the permit plans;
5. The project will require a zoning exception for side yard set back. The
Commission has no purview or opinion regarding the appropriateness of
the proposed exception. The Commission takes no position regarding
reduced yard requirements; and,
6. Proposed front window details shall be submitted with the permit plans,
including horizontal and vertical, dimensioned, detail sections through a
typical window opening. The windows shall not be flush with the facade
of the opening, but recessed within the window opening.
4.

2128 W. Haddon
(Ukrainian Village District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed rehabilitation of an existing 1½-story cottage, including removal of an
existing front bay, masonry cleaning, and new dormers and skylights

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
Design:
1. The synthetic siding on the front bay shall be removed to determine whether
any historic elements remain. Landmarks staff shall be notified by the
applicant to schedule a site visit to inspect the front bay. Subject to the
determination of Landmarks staff, should eno ugh physical evidence be
uncovered substantially revealing the historic design and configuration of
the bay, the applicant shall revise their plans to retain the bay and/or restore
it to its historic design and configuration.
Otherwise, in consideration of the lack of any documentary evidence for the
original design and detailing of the historic bay; the extensive alteration of
the bay and those of the other four remaining homes built along with this
residence; and the substantiated lack of sufficient surviving physical
evidence upon further investigation, the proposed replacement of the front
bay window with a flat brick facade (with three new windows at the first

 and basement levels) may be approved in this limited instance and
circumstances. The basement stone lintels shall be eliminated or modified
(such as to a brick header or soldier course) to create more simplified
detailing and architectural expression at the basement windows openings,
more typical of historic detailing of worker cottages in the district.
2. The front- facing elevation of the proposed shed dormer on the west facade,
which will be partially visible from the street, shall be modified to
incorporate roof cladding on the upper portion to simulate the appearance of
a hipped roof, in keeping with the intent of the Commission's guidelines and
policy for visible new dormers in the Ukrainian Village District.
3. Based on the visibility of the proposed skylights (as demonstrated by the site
mock-up), the skylight location and configuration shall be restudied to
further minimize their visibility from the public way. The skylight(s) shall
be no closer than 10 feet from the front of the building, the maximum
cumulative size (whether one or more skylights) shall be no larger than the
combined size of the faces of the two proposed skylights, and the skylight(s)
shall be no higher on the roof than as proposed. The skylight(s) shall have a
low-profile frame, and the color shall match the roofing material.
Materials:
4. The proposed 8"x12" metal roof shingles are approved, although a less
reflective finish shall be used if available. The applicant shall submit
additional information to Landmarks staff regarding the available finishes.
5. Given that the structure is masonry and that the new dormers have limited
visibility the proposed fiber-cement siding may be used as a cladding for the
existing and proposed dormers. Such siding shall have a smooth finish and
otherwise match the predominant wood siding within the district in size,
profile, lap exposure, and finish. Details and material samples of the
proposed siding material shall be reviewed and approved by Landmarks
staff as part of the permit application;
6. If the removal of the bay is approved, the applicant shall provide a detailed
brick infill plan to be submitted with the permit plans. Staff recommends
that the existing face brick at the basement level below the string course be
removed, salvaged and reinstalled above in order to maintain matching areas
of brick in regard to brick size and colo r. Should the amount of historic
brick not be sufficient to do so, an inset panel of new brick beneath the first
floor windows would also be acceptable. Brick and mortar samples are to
be reviewed and approved by Landmarks staff as part of the permit
application;
7. The proposed dry- ice blasting cleaning method is not approved, due to its
use’s potential damage to the masonry. The owner shall investigate
chemical or other alternative masonry cleaning methods, with preference
given to the least abrasive methods. Additional information shall be
submitted for Landmarks staff review and approval on the selected cleaning
method, and the Landmarks staff may require a test panel using the
proposed cleaning method prior to final approval.
Informational:
8. Sections and details of the new entry door, sidelight, stair and railing shall
be submitted with permit plans. Stairs should have wood treads and closed
risers; and,
9. Details of the existing and proposed 2 over 1 double-hung clad-wood

 windows shall be included on the permit plans. The replacement windows
shall match historic windows in arrangement, size, glass size, and exterior
profiles.

565 W. Arlington
(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed alteration of front façade to enlarge masonry window openings and
install new windows

Action:

The Committee (voted: 4 -0, Ben Weese recused) preliminarily found that: (i)
the building is a contributing structure to the character of the district; and (ii) the
proposed project would have an adverse effect on the significant historical and
architectural features of the building and district due to the proposed removal of
the existing windows which appear to be part of the c.1940 re-front, or earlier,
and therefore within the period of significance for the district; and the proposed
enlargement of the window opening and the installation of a new window type
and configuration that never historically existed on the building.
The Committee voted to advise the applicant that the project sho uld be restudied
so that:
1. The existing windows are retained and repaired; or,
2. Subject to the determination of Landmarks staff, if the windows are beyond
repair, they may be replaced in-kind to match the originals in terms of
arrangement, size, glass size, and exterior profiles. A report or other
evidence regarding the condition of the windows and window details would
need to be submitted for Landmarks staff review and approval prior to order
and installation.
