AUDIT PURPOSE, SCOPE, OBJECTIVES, METHODOLOGY AND CONCLUSIONS

AUDIT PURPOSE

The audit of the Casino Development Fund - Detroit Community Loan Fund project was
performed in accordance with the Office of the Auditor General?s (OAG) charter
mandate to conduct audits of the financial transactions, performance and operations of
City agencies based on an annual risk-based audit plan prepared by the Auditor
General, or as othenNise directed by the City Council, and report findings and
recommendations to the City Council and the Mayor.

 

City Council requested that the OAG perform an audit of the Casino Development Fund
in relation to a Legislative Policy Division report dated October 11, 2016.

AUDIT SCOPE

The scope of this audit was an independent review and assessment of the Detroit
Community Loan Fund project. Our audit was conducted in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United
States, except for the completion of an external peer review of the OAG within the last
three years.

AUDIT OBJECTIVES
The overall audit objectives were to:

 

a Review financial reports and audited financial statements from each sub-grantee
to ensure the Casino Development Funds are properly accounted for and spent
in accordance with program objectives and guidelines as stated in the casino
agreements, Economic Development Corporation of Detroit and
EDC/sub-grantee funding agreements.

. Conduct a performance audit of each sub-grantee to ensure the Casino
Development Funds are effectively and efficiently received and spent in
accordance with best practices and in support of program objectives and
guidelines.

AUDIT METHODOLOGY
To accomplish our audit objectives, our audit work included:

 

- Reviewing the Casino Development Agreements, project funding agreements,
City Charter, the project budget reports, and organization charts.

- Gathering policies and procedures of core operations and similar data.

. Conducting an audit-planning meeting to determine the scope and audit
objectives, and to determine the financial transactions and/or areas to audit.

. Developing questions regarding the Casino Development Fund project?s
transactions, controls, functions, records, and personnel.

- Identifying risks relative to financial transactions and mitigating controls with
appropriate personnel.

1

- Interviewing appropriate personnel, reviewing documentation, and making
observations to aid in developing audit programs.

CONCLUSIONS

As a result of our audit of the Detroit Community Loan Fund project, we are unable to
determine if the Casino Development Funds of $3,421,043 were spent in accordance
with the Funding Agreement between EDC and DCLF due a lack of documentation.

We also could not conclude on whether Detroit Community Loan Fund achieved its goal
to assist in building small business infrastructure in the City of Detroit by providing loan
funds to expand existing successful small business loan funds due to the lack of
documentation.

BACKGROUND

Oriqination of Casino Development Fund

The Casino Development Fund is a commitment made by the three Detroit casinos
(MGM Grand Detroit, MotorCity, and Greektown) and the City of Detroit, to contribute
money for the purpose of assisting minority business development in a specified area
within the City. The assistance to business development focuses on: financing facade
improvements, GAP financing, loan guaranties, rehabilitation, equipment and working
capital for existing and new businesses.

The City received $2.5 million from MotorCity Casino during the period of the initial
Casino Development agreements (1998-1999). The City received $30 million from the
three casinos ($10 million from each casino) in accordance with the Casino
Development Agreements for a total of $32.5 million.

Economic Development Corporation

The Economic Development Corporation (EDC) is a public body corporation created by
the Detroit City Council by enactment of Ordinance 120-H effective June 9, 1979. All
services to be performed are set forth in the ?Scope of Services? section of the 
personal service contract and is coordinated and performed by the Detroit Economic
Growth Corporation (DEGC). The DEGC is a private non-profit 501c.4 organization and
is an agent of EDC that acts as a liaison between EDC and the City.

Detroit Communityr Loan Fund

The Detroit Community Loan Fund (DCLF) is a community development financial
institution and low-profit limited liability company, managed by the Detroit Development
Fund (DDF) and Invest Detroit. They finance small businesses headquartered in the
city of Detroit which have traditionally faced obstacles in obtaining financing, but have
demonstrated growth potential.

The DDF was and is the managing partner of the DCLF and has and still handles all of
the finances and management for the DCLF. Originally, they were Shorebank
Enterprise Detroit when the DCLF started and managed all aspects of the DCLF and
still do as DDF.

Proiect Obiectives for the Detroit Community Loan Fund

The Funding Agreement By and Between the Economic Development Corporation and
the City of Detroit provides funding for the Detroit Community Loan Fund (DCLF). The
goal of DCLF as stated in the Funding Agreement is to assist in building the small
business infrastructure in the city of Detroit by providing loan funds for expanding the
already successful small business loan fund jointly operated by Detroit Renaissance,
ShoreBank Enterprise Detroit and the Detroit Investment Fund.

AUDIT SUMMARY

We reviewed a Detroit Community Loan Fund (DCLF) update report received from EDC
in a December 17, 2018 email. DCLF reported that:

?Only $300,000 of the Casino Development funds were used as lending
dollars. In short, Casino funds were basically not used for lending.
DDF provided the EDC with the types of companies financed by DDF
and the DCLF because we were not using Casino funds for the loans,
we agreed for privacy and lender liability issues that it wasn ?t necessary
to provide the EDC with names of the companies.?

The update report also stated that:

?We believe we have fulfilled the mission and obligations of the Casino
funds by providing loan capital to Detroit companies who were unable to
find financing from traditional sources. The Casino funds strengthened our
ability to raise additional capital and provide more loans to help grow small
businesses in Detroit. 

Fundinq Information
The DCLF project was originally allocated $4.5 million to fund their activities. The EDC
amended original budgeted amount bringing program budget down to

$3,421,053. DCLF has received all Casino Development Funds (CDF) allocated to
them.

According to reports submitted by DCLF to EDC, DCLF spent their CDF as follows:

Operating Expenses

 

Salary $1,893,015.41

Occupancy 14,381.61

Telephone 5,449.88

Insurance 4,800.00

Other Operating 19,714.35

Audit Fees 21,552.00
Management Fees 59,029.83

Legal Fees 9,687.32

Payroll Processing 1,508.60

Other Professional Fees 50.00 
Total Operating Expenses $2,029,189
Expenses 629,500
Loans Write Offs 104,118
DCLF DDF Investment in DCLF 358,236
Lending Capital 300,000
GRAND TOTAL $3,421,043

 

 

Neither EDC nor DCLF provided the auditors with supporting documentation for the
expenditures reported by DCLF on the reports given to our office. Therefore, we cannot
attest to how those funds were actually spent.

We determined that per the Funding Agreement, DCLF did not provide the following
required information:

- Quarterly reports to EDC

. Information concerning the $300,000 in loans made using CDF

We requested and reviewed all reports EDC had that were submitted by DCLF from
2006 to current. DCLF provided annual reports for the following years:

0 2006 0 201 1
2007 i 2015
2008-2009 0 2016
0 201 0-201 1

A review of the seven reports submitted (listed above) disclosed that they did not
contain information specific to CDF loans. The reports revealed that:

. 6 of 7 (or 86%) reports did not contain the CDF loans in process
. 3 of 7 (or 43%) reports did not contain the number of CDF loans made

. 7 of 7 (or 100%) reports did not contain the business terms of loans made or in
progress for CDF

7 of 7 (or 100%) reports did not contain the current status of CDF loans

The Funding Agreement By and Between the EDC and the DCLF, Article Section
3.01 Recipient Activities requires:

The Recipient shall perform the following functions:

Prior to making the first loan, the Recipient will prepare and present for approval
by the EDC the following documents:

0 A Lending Policy

0 A Credit Policy

0 Standard loan documents
0 A Marketing Plan

Following approval by the EDC of the above items, the Recipient agrees that
they cannot be materially changed without the prior approval of the Board of

Directors of the EDC, except as otherwise detailed in the Recipient?s Lending
Policy.

0 No loans may be made that are not consistent with the policies and programs
approved by the EDC without the prior approval of the EDC Board of Directors,
except as detailed in the Recipient?s lending policy.

5

 The Recipient will make quarterly reports to the EDC enumerating the loans in
process, the loans made, a synopsis of the general business terms of each loan
made or in progress, and the current status of each loan whether they current or
in default.

We requested on multiple occasions supporting documents from EDC for the items
listed on DCLF reports explaining how Casino Development Fund were spent. EDC
was only able to provide us with Excel spreadsheets, reports and annual Financial
Statements submitted by DCLF which did not allow us to verify expenditures. These
documents were not sufficient to authenticate expenditures. Therefore we
could not substantiate how the funds were spent on this project.

We have reviewed the ?nal audit report submitted by the ?rm that did The Casino Fund Audit. We
provided them all of the information we could ?nd (please see the reports we sent with our orginal
response).

Detroit Development Fund and The Detroit Community Fund are bascially sister companies. The funds
provided to DCLF were used to assist DDF DCLF in their growth. As a result of the casino fund
assistance we were able to raise millions of additional dollars to provide additional loans to Detroit small
businesses. The casino funds were instrumental in allowing us the capability to rasie additional capital to
achieve our goal of providing lending capital to many Detroit small businesses and building the small
business infrasturcture. We?ve loaned over $50,000,000 in capital to Detroit small businesses, which a list
of the Detroit companies receving loans was provided in our previous response. This [can program has
helped to retain over 2,000_jobs For Detroit residents and has created 3.200 newjohs for Detroit residents.

Our Entreprcuner of Color Loan fund has closed over $3,000,000, in loans to Detroit minority small
businesses in the last 2 'xi years. The casino Funds were important in our growth and our ability to achieve
the loan levels and the positive impact DDF had in Detroit since inception.

We would be happy to meet with the city council to discuss the program, and answer any questions they
may have.

Sincerely-i

RE: Friendship Meadows Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Liability Company Payment
in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

Communities of Hope, Inc. and SPM Property Group, Limited Liability Company have formed
Friendship Meadows Limited Dividend Housing Association LLC in order to develop the Project
known as Friendship Meadows Apartments. The Project is an existing one hundred fifty-three (153)
senior rental units located in three (3) two-story buildings in an area bounded by Superior on the north,
Russell on the east, Leland on the south and Service Drive on the west.

The substantial rehabilitation Project will include one hundred seven (107) 1 bedroom/1 bath and forty-
six (46) 2 bedroom/1 bath apartments and a community center. The preservation and renovation of the
development will not result in a rent increase for the existing tenants.

A construction loan in the amount of $7,000,000 will be provided by Citizens Bank and will convert to a
Greystone serviced Freddie Mac Targeted Affordable Permanent Loan totaling $5,900,000. RBC Tax
Credit Manager II, Inc. will make Capital Contributions of $9,600,000 which includes the purchase of Low
Income Housing Tax Credits. Additionally, the Sponsor has agreed to defer $143,968 of the developer
fee.

Rents for all units have been set at or below eighty percent of the area median income. Thirty-
eight (38) Section 8 voucher residents will contribute only thirty percent of their adjusted gross
income towards the rent amount. All one hundred fifty-three (153) units will be subject to the PILOT

based on Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive the benefits of
tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966 (PA 346 as
amended, MCL 125.1415A). Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body will therefore satisfy the
requirements of Public Act 346 and City Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by establishing a service charge of
five percent of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this housing project.

RE: Information Regarding State Lodging Tax

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) along with the Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer
(OCFO) has been reqested by Council Member anee?Ayers to provide a report on the annual
state lodging taxes received from Detroit hotels, along with how those dollars are allocated. In
addition, the report is to include information from the past 10 years on the annual funds the City

receives from the lodging tax and what is forecated for the next 5 years.

LPD has reviewed the Michigan statutes relative to lodging taxes and have identi?ed two that are
relevant to the assigned request. The two statutes are Public Act 94 of 1937, the Use Tax MCL
205.91 et seq., and Public Act 106 of 1985, the State Convention Facility Development Act,

MCL 207.621 et seq. The application of the two statutes are outlined below.

Entities that provide rooms or lodging are subject to taxation under Public Act 94 of 1937, the
Use Tax Act. The Use Tax under Section 205.93a provides in pertinent part:

1) The use or consumption of the following services is taxed under this act in the
same manner as tangible personal property is taxed under this act:

Rooms or lodging furnished by hotelkeepershmotel operators, and other

persons furnishing accommodations that are available to the public on the basis of if
a commercial and business enterprise, irrespective of Whether or not membership 3:
is required for use of the accommodations, except rooms and lodging rented for a 0i
continuous period of more than 1 month. As used in this act, "hotel" or "motel" 53
means a building or group of buildings in which the public may obtain g:


accommodations for a consideration, including, without limitation, such
establishments as inns, motels, tourist homes, tourist houses or courts, lodging
houses, rooming houses, nudist camps, apartment hotels, resort lodges and cabins,
camps operated by other than nonpro?t organizations but not including those
licensed under 1973 PA 116, MCL 722.111 to 722.128, and any other building or
group of buildings in which accommodations are available to the public, except
accommodations rented for a continuous period of more than 1 month and
accommodations furnished by hospitals or nursing homes.

The rate of taxation by the State on rooms and lodging are set forth under MCL 205.93

(1) There is levied upon and there shall be collected from every person in this
state a speci?c tax, including both the local community stabilization1 share and
the state share, for the privilege of using, storing, 'or consuming tangible personal
property in this state at a total combined rate equal to 6% of the price of the
property or services speci?ed in section 3a or 3b.

One of the stated objectives of the Local Community Stabilization Authority (LCSA) is to
provide revenue to local governments dedicated for local purposes, including police safety, ?re
protection, and ambulance emergency services. As such a portion of the use tax for rooms and
lodging will go into the LCSA which will be distributed in accordance with that Act to
municipalities. LPD does not have the resources to ascertain the annual funds received by the
City over the past 10 years or what is forecasted for the next ?ve years. The Of?ce of the Chief
Financial Of?cer may be able to provide this information and has been requested by this
Honorable Body to do so.

In addition to the Use Tax that is levied upon rooms and lodging in general, the State also
imposes an excise tax on ?Convention Hotels? in accordance with the Public Act 106 of 1985,
the State Convention Facility Development Act (SCFD), MCL 207.624 which provides:

(1) There is hereby .levied upon and there shall be collected from any person
engaged in the business of providing accommodations to transient guests in a

 

MCL 123.1347 identi?es the local Community Stabilization Authority Section and provides the following (1) The
local community stabilization authority is established as a metropolitan government for the metropolitan areas of
this state under section 27 of article VII of the state constitution of 1963. The authority is a public body corporate
and a special authority. The authority is not an agency or instrumentality of state government. (2) The property of
the authority is public pr0perty devoted to an essential public and governmental purpose. Any income of the
authority is for a public and governmental purpose. (3) Property of the authority and its income, activities, and
operations are exempt from all taxes and special assessments of this state or a political subdivision of this state.
Property of the authority is exempt from any ad valorem property taxes levied under the general property tax act,
1893 PA 206, MCL 211.1 to 211.155, or other law of this state authorizing the taxation of real or personal property.
The authority is an entity of government for purposes of section 4a(1)(a) of the general sales tax act, 1933 PA 167,
MCL 205.54a, and section of the use tax act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.94. (4) The validity of the creation of
the authority is presumed unless held invalid by the court of appeals in an original action ?led in the court of appeals
not later than 60 days after the establishment of the authority under this section. The court of appeals has original
jurisdiction to hear an action under this subsection. The court shall hear the action in an expedited manner.

3 MCL 207.629 de?nes a ?Convention Hotel? as being a hotel located within a Quali?ed Governmental Unit that
has a Convention Facility with a capacity of 350,000 sq. ft. of total exhibit space within its jurisdiction. Quali?ed
local governmental unit includes a metropolitan authority that leases, develops, operates, and maintains a quali?ed
convention facility under the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL 141.1351 to 141.1379.
The Detroit Regional Convention Facility Authority (DRCFA) is a quali?ed governmental unit under the Act.

with more than 160 rooms.

The taxes collected pursuant to the State Convention Facility Development Act are deposited in
the state treasury to the ?convention facility development fund? under MCL 207.628. Subsection
(2) provides:

The convention facility development fund shall be distributed for certain state
purposes and to local governmental units for use only for or more of the
following purposes:

leasing a convention facility.

In conjunction with an activity listed in subdivision repairing, furnishing,
and equipping the convention facility.

In the case of a local governmental unit that is a metropolitan authority, for
any purpose authorized under the regional convention facility authority act, 2008
PA 554, MCL 141.1351 to 141.1379.

The distribution of the taxes collected and placed into the convention facility development fund
are made in accordance with MLC 207.629 and provides:

obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness incurred for the purposes speci?ed
in this act or the regional convention facility authority act, 2008 PA 554, MCL
141.1351 to 141.1379, plus operating de?cit cost expenditures and other
