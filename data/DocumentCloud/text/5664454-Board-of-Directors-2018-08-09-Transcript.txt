I kind of feel like it needs to be more things to bring

2

us together, because it is already a stigma.

3

already so much hostility on each side.

4

It is

Another point that I want to make, there

5

was a bait truck that was placed in the community over

the weekend.

7

bait -- is a worm on the hook.

set them up and they go in and then there is a S.W.A.T

this mission with the railroad quite often.

with the railroad to be honest with you.

13

Even though it wasn't on the railroad

MR. NASH:

Is it targeted primarily in the

neighborhood?

15

equally in the affluent communities versus our

community?

17

Is it something that is spread out

MR. WALLER:

We look where the thefts are
