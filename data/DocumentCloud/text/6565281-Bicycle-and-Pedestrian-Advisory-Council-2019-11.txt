8333c

1-1

 •

CUY IR 271 10.24 Noise Barriers (PID 108655) - This project involves constructing
approximately 3,200 feet of noise barrier along the east side of IR-271. The total cost of
this project is $1.6 million. No NOACA funds will be used for this project.

•

GCRTA FFY 2020 Capital Program & 2016, 2017 and 2019 Revision - Four projects
need to be added to the FY2020 Capital Program and revisions need to be made to five
existing grants. The total cost of this program is $54.5 million. No NOACA funds will be
used for this program.

Mr. May stated that staff will coordinate with the project sponsors accordingly.
Mr. Cross asked about the proposed size of the sidewalks on Miller Road. Mr. May said he did
not know for sure, but believed the size to be 5 feet. Ms. Sarli stated that the project is still in the
study phase. Mr. Cross stated that the sponsor should make the sidewalks 8 feet and make at
least one of them 10 feet.
Mr. Cross asked why the noise wall project was being proposed now when it was not proposed
previously. Mr. David Short stated that there were previously no homes in the area, but now a
subdivision has been platted and ODOT has chosen to change its position on the noise wall.
In reference to CUY IR 77 11.21 Major Rehabilitation (PID 105743), Ms. Sara Maier asked if
ODOT or the City of Cleveland can provide information on whether the trail and the IR-77 project
can be done concurrently. Mr. Cross said he did not have any information on hand. Ms. Maier
stated that the City of Cleveland was putting forward $200,000 for preliminary engineering for the
trail, but was waiting to see if the project could be done in sync with the ODOT drainage and
widening project.
Mr. Jacob VanSickle suggested that all the parties get together and provide an update on the IR77 project and the construction dollars for the trail.
Ms. Maier stated that Cleveland Metroparks is not the sponsor of the trail project but has
committed funding for the design and would like to know the year to budget for the design.
SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety
Ms. Kate Moening provided information on SAVE that included the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

8333c

Annual Fatalities and Serious Injuries, 2007-2017
A Comprehensive Approach Using the “6 E’s” of transportation safety
Fatalities and serious injuries by maintenance responsibility, local vs. state
Strategy #1: Collect and analyze data to identify high crash locations
Strategy #2: Support the implementation of proven and low-income infrastructure safety
countermeasures
Strategy #3: Promote safe behaviors that contribute to the reduction of roadway
departure fatalities and injuries
Short-term goals to work toward an annual reduction of 2% each year to 2023
A heat map showing the relative density of “Impaired Driving” for all crashes across the
region, with a number of targeted corridors with a high frequency of fatal or serious
injuries (FSIs).

1-2

 Ms. Moening stated that NOACA staff will develop and support key initiatives in partnership with
other organizations to advance safe projects and encourage safer traveler behavior. She
mentioned that the SAVE Plan can be found on NOACA’s website under Regional Safety
Program. She asked members to contract her at 216-241-2414, ext. 285, if they have any
questions.
Mr. Cross asked if anyone is pushing to make cell phone use while driving a primary offense.
Mr. Blayney said yes and noted that research is being done by the state.
Ms. Maier commented that there are a few municipalities that have made cell phone use while
driving a primary offense, as well.
Mr. Cross said he would like to see a statewide law on cell phone use while driving.
2017 Safety Priority Lists
Mr. Blayney stated that staff will continue to prepare regional safety priority lists on an annual
basis to identify intersections and road segments that exhibit a high need for improvement due to
the frequency and severity of crashes within the NOACA region.
Mr. Blayney presented tables on the following for the period of 2013-2017:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Regional safety priority intersections - four or more fatal or serious injury crashes
Regional safety priority intersections with more than 150 crashes
Regional safety priority corridors - five or more fatal or serious injury crashes per mile
Regional safety priority corridors with more than 150 crashes
Regional safety priority corridors - three or more pedestrian and bicycle FSI crashes per
mile
Safety priority locations for the 5-year period ending in 2016 and 2017 on NOACA’s GIS
portal

Mr. Blayney stated that NOACA safety priority locations were developed by evaluating historical
crash performance at intersections and along roadway segments. The primary safety priority lists
consider the number of fatalities and serious injuries (FSIs) that have occurred at intersections or
along one-mile segments of the region’s non-freeway road network.
Ms. Maier asked the number of locations where safety studies were done or other things planned.
Mr. Blayney said half of the locations are chronic and have been studied through the ODOT safety
program. He mentioned that NOACA’s program also evaluates non-state highway system
locations that may not have had a safety study done.
Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program Update
Mr. Jim Thompson provided background on the TLCI program. He mentioned that the program
provides up to $500,000 for planning studies and at least $1.5 million for implementation projects.
He mentioned that NOACA will focus on the following TLCI studies in 2020:
•
•
•

8333c

Downtown Cleveland Transportation Connectivity Study
Regional Metroparks Trails/Transportation Connections Study
Regional Lakefront Transportation Connections Study

1-3

 Mr. Thompson mentioned that staff is proposing that only TLCI implementation applications for
the SFY 2020 be accepted this round. Mr. Thompson reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•

Eligible applicants
Eligible implementation activities
Project evaluation criteria – implementation
TLCI program schedule

Mr. Thompson stated that program guidance and applications can be found at noaca.org/TLCI.
He informed members that they can contact him at Jthompson@mpo.noaca.org or 216-241-2414,
Ext. 275, if they have any questions. Mr. Thompson stated that applications are due by noon on
October 11, 2019; implementation presentations will be given at NOACA the week of October 21,
2019; and applications will be presented to BPAC, SOC, and the Transit Council for input on
November 15, 2019.
Ms. Maier asked if the process for planning studies will be led by NOACA staff or consultants.
Mr. Thompson said consultants will lead the studies and one or two NOACA staff members and
relevant regional partners will provide assistance.
Ms. Joyce Braverman asked if the consultant list has been or will be updated. Mr. Thompson
said the consultant list is updated every two years; however, this round NOACA will probably do
a direct procurement and update the list the next round.
Mr. Alex Harnocz asked Mr. Thompson to talk about the criteria for a TLCI-like study.
Mr. Thompson stated that the sponsor needs to demonstrate that there was public involvement
or an engagement process for the study; the sponsor must document public meetings with
neighborhood or community feedback specific to the transportation component; the study must
have a multimodal transportation focus; and the study must recommend specific
countermeasures at specific locations.

Old Business
Mr. VanSickle asked when the Regional Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan will kick off. Ms. Katie Sieb
stated that staff is working on an analysis and will be launching the survey presented at the last
BPAC meeting.
Mr. VanSickle asked if staff can provide an update on NOACA’s Complete and Green Streets
Policy. Ms. Kathy Sarli stated that the policy has been refined; presented to the Transportation
Subcommittee for review; and presented to the Policy Committee, which gave its support. She
noted that the next step will be to present the policy to the Board in December for approval so it
can be implemented.
Mr. VanSickle congratulated the City of Cleveland Heights for being recognized by Smart Growth
America for having the best complete streets policy in the country.
New Business
Mr. VanSickle asked if it was possible to combine the BPAC and SOC meetings when the
agendas are similar. Ms. Sarli pointed out that not all BPAC and SOC members serve on both
councils and each council has its own focus.
Mr. Cross asked if it was possible to move the BPAC and SOC meetings to a Tuesday,
Wednesday or Thursday. Ms. Sarli stated that all of NOACA’s meetings are held on a Friday and
the schedule is unlikely to change.
Mr. Jim Ziemnik asked who at NOACA will be representing this region’s Strategic Highway Safety
Plan (SHSP) in Columbus. Ms. Sarli said Ms. Melissa Thompson.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Council

FROM:

Kathleen Sarli, Director of Planning

DATE:

November 8, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Review (PPR)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
3rd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
Councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

RE:

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 23 requests for funding: 7 planning study requests totaling about $1.1
million in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. All requests
are being evaluated based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the
planning studies and implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.

RE:

Safe Routes To School Program Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Plan, designed to achieve NOACA SAVE Plan goals, was introduced to
the Safety and Operations Council during the November 16, 2018 meeting. This program elevates NOACA
programs and initiatives that support goals in safety, active transportation and air quality, supports
partnerships with state and regional organizations also working to improve transportation safety, and strives
to attract state and federal funding to our region to improve safety and multimodal access.
A school travel plan (STP) is a local planning document outlining infrastructure and non infrastructure actions
to improve safety for students traveling to and from school through active transportation, such as walking or
biking. An STP is a valuable resource to guide local community investment, pursue state, regional and
national funding, identify actions through public input and stakeholder engagement, and develop community
partnerships to achieve goals.
NOACA is in the process of assisting four school districts with the task of creating or updating their School
Travel Plans in 2019. Once finalized and accepted by ODOT, these STP’s will enable local agencies to apply
for funding administered through ODOT to implement recommendations benefitting schools in grades K-8.
Applications for the next round of Ohio Safe Routes to School Infrastructure and Non-Infrastructure funding
opens early next January of 2020 and closes in early March. Next year will be the last year of funding eligibility
for school districts whose plans were completed in 2015, unless these school districts take steps to update
their School Travel Plans. These school districts are Rocky River, Euclid, and Willoughby-Eastlake. Attached
is a map indicating school districts that have plans approved in 2014 or older, which will need to be updated
to meet funding application requirements.
A major change occurring with this round of ODOT Safe Routes To School funding is that communities who
are seeking consultant assistance from ODOT for STP development must submit an application during the
round.
5 - 17

 Local government agencies (cities, villages and counties) are encouraged to partner with their local school
districts to develop and update School Travel Plans and submit applications for Ohio Safe Routes to School
Infrastructure and Non-Infrastructure funding. Local agencies may ask NOACA staff to assist with School
Travel Plan development and SRTS grant applications. NOACA staff will provide assistance based on safety,
education and equity. All applicants are encouraged to requests letters of support from NOACA at least 3
weeks prior to the application deadline.
Potential applicants should plan to participate in an upcoming informational webinar being hosted by ODOT’s
Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP), which is scheduled for Thursday, December 12 from 2:00 to
3:00 pm. To register, visit this link on Ohio LTAP’s web page.
The NOACA Safe Routes to School Assistance program also supports air quality goals through the promotion
and implementation of Schoolpool, a program within the Gohio Commute platform. Schoolpool is a free,
secure service that connects families who want to share the school commute. NOACA has implemented
Schoolpool pilot programs in two schools in Lorain County, with the expansion of the program to more schools
expected in 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
The Council will continue to be updated.
