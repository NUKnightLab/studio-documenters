claims more lives than colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, influenza, pneumonia, auto
accidents, HIV, firearms, and house fires combined; and
WHEREAS, heart disease (including Coronary Heart Disease, Hypertension, and Stroke) remains the
No. 1 cause of death in the United States, while the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the U.S.
is 720,000 new attacks and 335,000 recurrent attacks per year; and
WHEREAS, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside of the hospital each year and nearly 45
percent of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims survived when bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) was administered, as immediate CPR can double or triple chances of survival after cardiac arrest;
and
WHEREAS, similarly to national statistics, heart disease is the leading cause of death in Cook County as
well, accounting for just under 10,000 deaths per year with more than half occurring in suburban Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of
Public Health can contribute to decreasing the incidents of fatal heart attacks in Cook County by creating
a robust awareness campaign to increase participation of Cook County employees in existing training
programs on how to properly administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation and how to use an automated
external defibrillator (AED) as well as expand access to such trainings countywide in all County
workplaces; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois beginning in 2014 has made such training a curricula requirement for all
secondary schools in the state; and
WHEREAS, the County awareness and training initiative should cover adult CPR & AED training and
such training must include a hands-on practice component for beginners, as well as be in accordance with
the standards of the American Heart Association, or another nationally recognized certifying organization;
and
WHEREAS, any improvement in outcomes associated with heart attacks would have an immeasurable
impact on survivors both for County employees and their co-workers and families as well as the general
public;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners requests the development of a countywide CPR and AED training awareness campaign
for all Cook County employees as well as expanded access to training programs in all County workplaces
in order to assist in reducing incidents of death due to cardiac arrest both in the workplace and general
public; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
requests that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System along with the Cook County Department of

begin in February 2019 to coincide with American Heart Month; and

System reports.
