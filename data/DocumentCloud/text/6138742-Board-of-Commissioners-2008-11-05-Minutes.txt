Award Recommendation Presented to the Board:

October 15, 2008

After receipt of the bid, the Office of Contract Compliance followed its standard operating procedures as
it does for all bids received from respondents to Cook County. During the review process, Contract
Compliance makes every attempt to secure compliance with Cook County's Minority and Women Owned
Business Enterprise participation goals and provides respondents with an opportunity to exercise good
faith efforts in meeting the stated contract goals. The following is a synopsis of the Department's findings
resulting from our comprehensive review:
UTILIZATION PLAN
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals”, however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, "see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals." This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for respondents must be exercised prior
to bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the respondents
actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia ("Valdivia") as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.

7688

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008 (See attached fax).
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and nowhere in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, with stated reasons as to why they were
unable to meet the full 24% goal.
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work for Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition”. The bid document states “A
Bidder may count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of work for which they are
certified on or before the date of the bid submission”. The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resign and Vinyl Flooring; Waterproof
Membrane Systems Installation; Locker Installation.” Contract Compliance considered drywall
installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor for the provision of this service.
However, they were not certified to provide demolition services which meant that Madison would not
have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7% participation as stated in the
submitted Utilization Plan. Additionally, there were no other Minority/Women Owned Business
Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the M/WBE goals of Cook County Government and
did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
LETTER OF INTENT
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE Subcontractor or
Supplier (Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required
Pre-Award Submittals reads as follows: To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the Project
Specific MBE and WBE goals by submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letter(s) of
Intent and Letter(s) of Certification….Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these
requirements will cause the Bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the Bid to be
rejected.
GOOD FAITH EFFORTS CHECKLIST
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) (“made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract”), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was “not
applicable.”
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.

7689

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
There were three (3) Subcontractors listed on the Good Faith Efforts Log:
•

City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as “not enough time to bid project.” The date of
contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

Kingdom Community: Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as “not enough time to bid
project.” The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HVAC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as “not interested.” The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.

The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return call to Office of Contract Compliance.
S Mechanic’s telephone was disconnected. As of today’s date the telephone number listed on the
contact log remains disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as “Good Faith” there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County’s directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC – 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see attached letter)
The Office of Contract Compliance’s procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive, however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation.
Upon award of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non
responsive.
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.

7690

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at
that time. (see attached letter)
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman’s Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to
speak to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from
the office.
As a result of the call from the Commissioner’s Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner’s
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman’s staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachments Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did
not confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, “Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition” as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty four
(34) days late to this office.
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the “build out of the pharmacy” within the Bureau of Health. It is my hope that this
chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I would be
happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING CONTRACT NO. 07-53-562
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 5, 2008 from
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioner
Item 20 on the Cook County Board Agenda of November 5, 2008 is information supplied by Betty
Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract Compliance regarding Contract No. 07-53-562. There
are a number of inaccuracies in this document which I would like to address. Please review the
following:
Utilization Plan
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals,” however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, “see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals.” This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for the respondents must be exercised
prior to the bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the
respondents actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
See attached page PE-6 from the bidder bid which clearly indicates that the good faith efforts will
be followed. The bidder did exercise good faith efforts prior to bid submission however a
statement was added that the bidder would continue to try to achieve the goals even though the
good faith option was exercised.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia (“Valdivia”) as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008.
The bidder clearly executed the good faith efforts clause of the contract which does not require
letters of certification. After several calls to the compliance department by the bidder, the bidder
was requested to supply the letter on August 20, 2008. The bidder supplied the letter within 24
hours of the request.
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and no where in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, which stated reasons as to why they
were unable to meet the full 24% goals.

7692

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Please see the bidders bid form page PE-6 with the appropriate box checked indicating the bidder
was utilizing good faith efforts. Also see the bidders documents PE-6b checklist for MBE/WBE
Good Faith Efforts. Also see bidders document PE-6c checklist for good faith efforts. There is
no portion of the bid application that allows the bidder to state a reason to why they were unable
to meet the goals.
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work fro Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition.” The bid document states “A
bidder my count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of the work which they are
certified on or before the date of the submission.” The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resin and Vinyl Flooring;
Waterproof Membrane Systems Installation; locker Installation.”
Contract Compliance considers drywall installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor
for the provision of the service however they were not certified to provide demolition services which
meant that Madison would not have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7%
participation as stated in the submitted Utilization Plan.
Additionally, there were no other
Minority/Woman Owned Business Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.
Please see the bidder’s letter of intent between the prime contractor and ERA Valdivia. The letter
lists demolition, Drywall, ceilings and painting. The project contains what is commonly called
“demolition” this is removal of existing drywall and drywall studwall commonly called
“carpentry.” This work is routinely performed by ERA Valdivia, and covered by ERA Valdivia’s
Letter. This is the exact same work that was found to be acceptable by compliance for the bidder
that was $161,000 higher than Madison Construction.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the MBE/WBE goals of Cook County Government
and did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
The bidder did exercise its good faith efforts to meet the MBE/WBE goals; however because of
the type of work requested the bidder was unable to meet the goals. The bidder submitted the
proper documentation and when Cook County requested further information responded
expeditiously.
Letter of Intent
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE subcontractor supplier
(Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required PreAward Submittals reads as follows:
“To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the project specific MBE and WBE goals by
submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letters(s) of Intent and Letter(s) of
Certification…Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these requirements will cause
the bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the bid to be rejected.”
The paraphrasing of this portion of the document completely excludes the second avenue a bidder
can utilize to be considered compliant. The portion of the statement that is left out includes:

7693

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Or (2) if the bidder cannot achieve the project specific MBE and/or WBE goals, by submitting
with the bid documentation its Good Faith Efforts to meet the project specific MBE and or WBE
Goals.
This was the avenue in which the bidder utilized to be considered compliant. By utilizing this
submittal process, it is impossible to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these
documents are to be filled out to identify compliance with the MBE/WBE compliance. A bidder
would be falsely representing their intention if submitting this documentation while conforming
to the Good Faith Efforts process.
Good Faith Efforts Checklist
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) ("made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract"), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was "not
applicable. "
The bidder identified that it was “not applicable.” There is no basis for this grievance.
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.
According to the bid instructions there is no requirement to provide any additional documentation
indicating the efforts to reach out to MBE/WBE companies.
•

City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid project." The date of contact
was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

Kingdom Community Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid
project." The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HVAC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not interested." The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.

The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return calls to the Office of Contract
Compliance.
S Mechanic's telephone was disconnected. As of today's date the telephone number listed on the
contact log remains disconnected.
7694

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Juan Candelaria was contacted in the required 10 days prior to the bid due date.
John Abercrombie is a pastor of Kingdom Community church and his construction company goes
by the same name. He had an extensive conversation with compliance exceeding thirty minutes
on September 2, 2008.
S Mechanicals number was disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as "Good Faith" there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County's directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC - 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see submitted letter)
By utilizing the Good Faith Efforts submittal process, according to the bid instructions, it is not
necessary to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these documents are to be
provided when attempting to represent compliance with the MBE/WBE goals. An issue is made
here that information was submitted 34 days after the bid was presented. Why then did Contract
Compliance request this information on the 33rd day.
The Office of Contract Compliance's procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive,
however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation. Upon award
of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non responsive.
The bid documentation states that “If a Utilization Plan is denied because the Good Faith Efforts
requirements have not been met, the County shall inform the bidder in writing for the basis for the
denial. To protest such a decision, the bidder shall follow the purchasing protest process
described in Cook County’s Purchasing office Solicitation instructions.”
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, the Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.

7695

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at that
time. (see submitted letter)
This statement attempts to misrepresent the intention of Mr. McCarthy’s statement. The bidder
was unable to provide the goals at the time of the bid. This is a fact that the bidder did not
attempt to keep undisclosed. The bid suggested that they attempted to meet the goals through
good faith efforts. Mr. McCarthy’s letter indicated that the bidder will continue to attempt to meet
or exceeded the MBE/WBE goals.
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman's Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to speak
to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from the
office.
A staff member from Ms. Hancock-Perry’s office called back that day, Monday, and stated that
Ms. Hancock-Perry was well aware of this bid but would be unavailable to speak with me until
Thursday, September 25, 2008
As a result of the call from the Commissioner's Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner's
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman's staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
No, I wasn’t satisfied with the information as the answers changed almost on an hourly basis. For
example, Ms. Hancock-Perry told me during one conversation that a bidder could protest being
found non-responsive on the Contract Compliance website. I looked at that website and could not
find anywhere to level such a protest. Also note that no bid recommendations were presented to
the County Board for approval at the October 1, 2008 board meeting.
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachment Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did not
confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.
The letters supplied by the bidder to Commissioner Gorman were not intended to be submittals
for the Bid as the above paragraph attempts to assert, however were provided to acknowledge the
bidders continuing participation and support for MBE/WBE Companies.

7696

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, "Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition" as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty-four
(34) days late to this office.
If compliance found “Valdivia not certified in the area of Demolition,” why then was it
acceptable for the second bidder John Burns Company?
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the "build out of the pharmacy" within the Bureau of Health Services. It is my hope
that this chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I
would be happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.
The Office of Compliance has consistently made statements that are not consistent with the bid
application. The “standard operating procedures” of the Office of Contract Compliance along
with the bid material may need be reviewed to determine if the information is consistent. This
document acts to refute, yet again, the statements made by the Office of Compliance regarding
why Madison Construction’s bid was considered non-responsive. Cook County must be losing
significant revenue because of such inconsistencies and would have lost $161,000 if this bid
would have been assigned to the second bidder.

WHEREAS, First Sergeant Jose “Joey” V. Juachon, who celebrates his 90th birthday today, is a former
prisoner-of-war and veteran hero; he survived the infamous Fall of Bataan and Bataan Death March in the
Philippines during World War II; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
WHEREAS, at the time of the military service of these Filipinos, the Philippines was a United States
commonwealth, and these brave servicemen were promised veterans’ benefits by the United States
Military; and
WHEREAS, as these Filipino servicemen fought, suffered unspeakably at the hands of their Japanese
captors and died, their blood was just as red as that of a United States soldier, marine, airman or sailor;
and
WHEREAS, in 1946, when the Philippines gained independence, the United States Congress passed the
Rescission Act, which stripped Filipinos of all the benefits promised to them; of the 66 countries allied
with the United States during World War II, the Philippines is the only country that did not receive
military benefits from the United States; and
WHEREAS, sociologists have introduced the term, “second class veterans” to describe the plight of the
30,000 Filipino-American veterans, most of them citizens, who live in the United States today; and
WHEREAS, currently there are bills in the United States Senate and the United States House of
Representatives to right this shameful wrong, S. 57 and H.R. 760, respectfully; these veterans only desire
the same benefits as their United States servicemen compatriots no more, no less.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, along with the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby offer my
most humble thankfulness to First Sergeant Jose “Joey” V. Juachon for his military service and sacrifice,
do wish him a healthy and happy 90th birthday, and do urge the United States House of Representatives
and the United States Senate to pass S. 57 and H.R. 760 respectively, and may a suitable copy of this
Resolution be tendered herewith.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Chairman Daley stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the status of a request by the Chief
Financial Officer to issue bonds for pension obligations and a scheduled payment to the Self Insurance
Fund. He stated that capital improvement projects will not be included in this discussion, but will be
considered at a later date.
In response to inquiries by Commissioners Goslin and Silvestri, Chairman Daley called upon Donna L.
Dunnings, Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the potential impact of decreasing the operating budget or
accessing a pre-established line of credit, in lieu of a bond issuance.
Ms. Dunnings stated that unencumbered operating funds were insufficient for this purpose. She provided
an estimate of $364 million in cuts to the annual operating budget that would be necessary to provide a
source of funds other than a bond issuance. The Board members would be expected to identify where in
the 2009 budget those cuts would occur. A reduction in the workforce of 1,000 employees would be the
likely outcome.
In response to a request from Commissioner Silvestri for clarification regarding how the workforce
reduction figure was calculated, Ms. Dunnings agreed to provide a memorandum to the Committee,
explaining the matter in further detail.
Commissioner Schneider asked if the sales tax rate increase resulted in sufficient new revenue to fund the
pension and self insurance requirements.
Ms. Dunnings explained that the sales tax increase did generate new revenue, but those funds are already
fully encumbered for the remainder of the current fiscal year.
Commissioner Claypool expressed his concern that the proposal would result in spending debt proceeds
for operating purposes.
Commissioner Gorman asked about the repayment status of previously issued Tax Anticipation Notes.
Ms. Dunnings stated that repayment of the notes was proceeding according to schedule.
Chairman Daley called upon Daniel R. Degnan, Executive Director, County Employees’ Annuity &
Benefit Fund of Cook County, to explain the need for the requested $104 million payment to the Fund.
Mr. Degnan stated that the $104 million payment is mandated by statute, and the Board of Trustees of the
Pension Fund has prepared a budget in anticipation of receiving it as expected. If the funds are not
forthcoming, it presents a cash flow problem for the Pension Fund. As a result, the Trustees may be
required to liquidate other assets of the Fund, at a low point in their market value. This would be
regrettable and unwise, but may be the only alternative if the Board of Commissioners fails to meet its
obligation.
Commissioner Peraica observed that a recent report from the Cook County Treasurer indicates a decline
in revenue due to a degrading economic environment.
In response to an inquiry from Commissioner Goslin, Mr. Degnan stated that the Fund is currently funded
at 77% of net liability, which compares favorably against many of the retirement funds managed by the
State of Illinois.

7805

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Ms. Dunnings explained that the $104 million payment is required due to an obligation created by the
Optional Pension Contribution program. Upon the optional program’s expiration in 2005, the County
was required to match certain employee contributions on a one-time basis. However, a decision was
made to fund part of the contribution with proceeds from a future bond issue, to be approved at a later
date. That date has now arrived, and the proposed bond issue has been approved by the Board of
Commissioners. Approval of the bond counsel, bond management, and financing team is pending.
Commissioner Schneider presented a possible scenario whereby all other expenses and revenues from
2008 are equal in 2009, with the exception of a COLA adjustment, repayment of Tax Anticipation Notes,
and the requested increase for the Health and Hospitals System. These three items total $525 million in
new costs for 2009. Yet new revenue from the sales tax is projected at $380 million. Thus, we would
begin Fiscal Year 2009 with a deficit of $145 million.
Ms. Dunnings said she believed Commissioner Schneider’s analysis was correct.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice Chairman Sims, moved to adjourn. The motion carried
and the meeting was adjourned.

Award Recommendation Presented to the Board:

October 15, 2008

After receipt of the bid, the Office of Contract Compliance followed its standard operating procedures as
it does for all bids received from respondents to Cook County. During the review process, Contract
Compliance makes every attempt to secure compliance with Cook County's Minority and Women Owned
Business Enterprise participation goals and provides respondents with an opportunity to exercise good
faith efforts in meeting the stated contract goals. The following is a synopsis of the Department's findings
resulting from our comprehensive review:

7819

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
UTILIZATION PLAN
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals”, however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, "see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals." This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for respondents must be exercised prior
to bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the respondents
actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia ("Valdivia") as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008 (See attached fax).
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and nowhere in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, with stated reasons as to why they were
unable to meet the full 24% goal.
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work for Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition”. The bid document states “A
Bidder may count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of work for which they are
certified on or before the date of the bid submission”. The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resign and Vinyl Flooring; Waterproof
Membrane Systems Installation; Locker Installation.” Contract Compliance considered drywall
installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor for the provision of this service.
However, they were not certified to provide demolition services which meant that Madison would not
have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7% participation as stated in the
submitted Utilization Plan. Additionally, there were no other Minority/Women Owned Business
Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the M/WBE goals of Cook County Government and
did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
LETTER OF INTENT
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE Subcontractor or
Supplier (Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required
Pre-Award Submittals reads as follows: To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the Project
Specific MBE and WBE goals by submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letter(s) of
Intent and Letter(s) of Certification….Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these
requirements will cause the Bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the Bid to be
rejected.

7820

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
GOOD FAITH EFFORTS CHECKLIST
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) (“made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract”), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was “not
applicable.”
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.
There were three (3) Subcontractors listed on the Good Faith Efforts Log:
•

City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as “not enough time to bid project.” The date of
contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

Kingdom Community: Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as “not enough time to bid
project.” The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HVAC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as “not interested.” The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.

The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return call to Office of Contract Compliance.
S Mechanic’s telephone was disconnected. As of today’s date the telephone number listed on the
contact log remains disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as “Good Faith” there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County’s directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC – 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see attached letter)

7821

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
The Office of Contract Compliance’s procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive, however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation.
Upon award of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non
responsive.
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at
that time. (see attached letter)
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman’s Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to
speak to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from
the office.
As a result of the call from the Commissioner’s Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner’s
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman’s staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachments Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did
not confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.

7822

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, “Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition” as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty four
(34) days late to this office.
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the “build out of the pharmacy” within the Bureau of Health. It is my hope that this
chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I would be
happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.
_________________________
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the communication be received and
filed, as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Gorman voted “no”.

MEMORANDUM REGARDING CONTRACT NO. 07-53-562
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 5, 2008 from
ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN, County Commissioner
Item 20 on the Cook County Board Agenda of November 5, 2008 is information supplied by Betty
Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract Compliance regarding Contract No. 07-53-562. There
are a number of inaccuracies in this document which I would like to address. Please review the
following:
Utilization Plan
Madison indicated the bid they submitted did not meet the “Specified Goals,” however, a note was
included at the bottom of the Utilization Plan which stated, “see good faith efforts, we will continue to try
to meet the goals.” This response was not sufficient for this bid to be deemed responsive. The
compliance section of the bid document defines good faith efforts for the respondents must be exercised
prior to the bid submission, and supporting documentation must be included which validates the
respondents actions taken for them to be deemed responsive.
See attached page PE-6 from the bidder bid which clearly indicates that the good faith efforts will
be followed. The bidder did exercise good faith efforts prior to bid submission however a
statement was added that the bidder would continue to try to achieve the goals even though the
good faith option was exercised.
Madison’s Utilization Plan indicated the direct participation of ERA Valdivia (“Valdivia”) as an MBE
participant with the dollar amount of participation listed as $200,000.00 (7%) of the bid amount.
Additionally, while the MBE/WBE Utilization Plan states that the Letter(s) of Certification must be
attached to the bid, the Letter of Certification for Valdivia was not attached to the bid and was later faxed
to this office and received on August 21, 2008.

7823

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
The bidder clearly executed the good faith efforts clause of the contract which does not require
letters of certification. After several calls to the compliance department by the bidder, the bidder
was requested to supply the letter on August 20, 2008. The bidder supplied the letter within 24
hours of the request.
This was the only vendor listed on the Utilization Plan submitted by Madison, and no where in the
documentation did they request a reduction of MBE participation, which stated reasons as to why they
were unable to meet the full 24% goals.
Please see the bidders bid form page PE-6 with the appropriate box checked indicating the bidder
was utilizing good faith efforts. Also see the bidders documents PE-6b checklist for MBE/WBE
Good Faith Efforts. Also see bidders document PE-6c checklist for good faith efforts. There is
no portion of the bid application that allows the bidder to state a reason to why they were unable
to meet the goals.
Another area of deficiency in the Utilization Plan was surrounding the work to be performed by the MBE.
The description of work fro Valdivia was listed as “Carpentry, Demolition.” The bid document states “A
bidder my count only the participation of MBEs and WBEs for the scopes of the work which they are
certified on or before the date of the submission.” The Certification Letter from the City of Chicago
listed Valdivia as certified in the following areas:
“Painting, Drywall and Sandblasting Contractor; Terrazzo, Tile Resin and Vinyl Flooring;
Waterproof Membrane Systems Installation; locker Installation.”
Contract Compliance considers drywall installation as a form of carpentry work and accepted this vendor
for the provision of the service however they were not certified to provide demolition services which
meant that Madison would not have received MBE credit for these services and thus not meet the 7%
participation as stated in the submitted Utilization Plan.
Additionally, there were no other
Minority/Woman Owned Business Enterprises listed on the Utilization Plan.
Please see the bidder’s letter of intent between the prime contractor and ERA Valdivia. The letter
lists demolition, Drywall, ceilings and painting. The project contains what is commonly called
“demolition” this is removal of existing drywall and drywall studwall commonly called
“carpentry.” This work is routinely performed by ERA Valdivia, and covered by ERA Valdivia’s
Letter. This is the exact same work that was found to be acceptable by compliance for the bidder
that was $161,000 higher than Madison Construction.
Overall the Utilization Plan did not sufficiently meet the MBE/WBE goals of Cook County Government
and did not show proof that Madison exercised good faith efforts to meet the stated goals.
The bidder did exercise its good faith efforts to meet the MBE/WBE goals; however because of
the type of work requested the bidder was unable to meet the goals. The bidder submitted the
proper documentation and when Cook County requested further information responded
expeditiously.
Letter of Intent
The Letter of Intent between the Prime Contractor (Madison) and the MBE/WBE subcontractor supplier
(Valdivia) was submitted blank. The General Conditions, Section GC-52, Section II – Required PreAward Submittals reads as follows:

7824

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
“To be responsive, A bidder shall either (1) meet the project specific MBE and WBE goals by
submitting with the bid a Utilization Plan, supported by Letters(s) of Intent and Letter(s) of
Certification…Failure to submit the documents in accordance with these requirements will cause
the bid to be considered non-responsive and shall be cause for the bid to be rejected.”
The paraphrasing of this portion of the document completely excludes the second avenue a bidder
can utilize to be considered compliant. The portion of the statement that is left out includes:
Or (2) if the bidder cannot achieve the project specific MBE and/or WBE goals, by submitting
with the bid documentation its Good Faith Efforts to meet the project specific MBE and or WBE
Goals.
This was the avenue in which the bidder utilized to be considered compliant. By utilizing this
submittal process, it is impossible to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these
documents are to be filled out to identify compliance with the MBE/WBE compliance. A bidder
would be falsely representing their intention if submitting this documentation while conforming
to the Good Faith Efforts process.
Good Faith Efforts Checklist
Included in all Bid Packages is a Good Faith Efforts Checklist which is used as a guide for bidders to
ensure that they have complied with all areas of the M/WBE compliance portion of the bid. Madison
checked all items on the Good Faith Efforts Checklist and indicated for item number five (5) ("made
efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as may be
required for performance of the contract"), while it was checked as a good faith effort; it was "not
applicable. "
The bidder identified that it was “not applicable.” There is no basis for this grievance.
The Good Faith Efforts Contacts Log was submitted with the bid. However, Madison did not, at the time
of the bid opening, provide any documentation supporting the purported contacts made in an effort to
meet the M/WBE.
According to the bid instructions there is no requirement to provide any additional documentation
indicating the efforts to reach out to MBE/WBE companies.
•

City Lights: Work solicited was for Electrical. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid project." The date of contact
was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

Kingdom Community: Work solicited was for Carpentry and Demolition. The reason stated in
the document as to why agreement was not reached was indicated as "not enough time to bid
project." The date of contact was listed on the document as July 7, 2008.

•

S Mechanic: Work solicited was for HVAC. The reason stated in the document as to why
agreement was not reached was indicated as "not interested." The date of contact listed on the
document was July 7, 2008.

The Office of Contract Compliance contacted the subcontractors listed on the Contact Log to verify the
reasons included in the document and the following was noted:

7825

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Juan Candelaria of City Lights stated they were contacted too late to provide a bid. They were
given two (2) days notice.
John Abercrombie of Kingdom Community did not return calls to the Office of Contract
Compliance.
S Mechanic's telephone was disconnected. As of today's date the telephone number listed on the
contact log remains disconnected.
Juan Candelaria was contacted in the required 10 days prior to the bid due date.
John Abercrombie is a pastor of Kingdom Community church and his construction company goes
by the same name. He had an extensive conversation with compliance exceeding thirty minutes
on September 2, 2008.
S Mechanicals number was disconnected.
Note: While there were three (3) vendors listed as "Good Faith" there are forty seven (47) vendors listed
in the County's directory in the area of construction.
The General Conditions Section GC - 52, Section II, bidder must notify MBEs and WBEs of
subcontracting opportunities at least ten (10) business days before submission of the bid. The MBEs listed
on this bid were notified eight (8) business days prior to bid opening, not ten (10) as stated in their letters
(exhibit 2).
On August 21, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received via fax, the signed Letter of Intent
between Madison Construction and ERA Valdivia signed and notarized on July 15, 2008. This document
which is to be included at the time of bid opening was received thirty four (34) days after the bid opening.
(see submitted letter)
By utilizing the Good Faith Efforts submittal process, according to the bid instructions, it is not
necessary to submit a Letter of Intent or Utilization Plan because these documents are to be
provided when attempting to represent compliance with the MBE/WBE goals. An issue is made
here that information was submitted 34 days after the bid was presented. Why then did Contract
Compliance request this information on the 33rd day.
The Office of Contract Compliance's procedure is not to communicate with bidders our findings until the
Board has voted on the bid. The Office of Contract Compliance may determine a bidder is nonresponsive,
however; the Board of Commissioners have the authority to override this recommendation. Upon award
of a contract, we will provide any bidder with reasons as to why their bid was non responsive.
The bid documentation states that “If a Utilization Plan is denied because the Good Faith Efforts
requirements have not been met, the County shall inform the bidder in writing for the basis for the
denial. To protest such a decision, the bidder shall follow the purchasing protest process
described in Cook County’s Purchasing office Solicitation instructions.”
On September 12, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance having completed the analysis and
investigation of the bid and all documentation received for Contract No. 07-53-562, sent a letter to the
Purchasing Agent indicating Madison Construction as being non-responsive.

7826

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
Shortly thereafter, on September 17, 2008, the Compliance Officer received a telephone call from Martin
McCarthy, Director of Performance Contracting, Madison Construction, requesting a reason as to why
they had been found non-responsive. When Mr. McCarthy was not satisfied with the answer he received,
he proceeded to call the Compliance Administrator, requesting a written explanation as to why their bid
was non-responsive.
The explanation given to Mr. McCarthy was that this Office does not provide a letter to bidders until such
time as a recommendation has been voted upon by the Board of Commissioners.
On September 19, 2008, the Office of Contract Compliance received a letter from Mr. McCarthy of
Madison Construction indicating they were now willing to meet or exceed the MBE/WBE participation
goals. This communication was received after the bid opening, therefore, it could not be considered at that
time. (see submitted letter)
This statement attempts to misrepresent the intention of Mr. McCarthy’s statement. The bidder
was unable to provide the goals at the time of the bid. This is a fact that the bidder did not
attempt to keep undisclosed. The bid suggested that they attempted to meet the goals through
good faith efforts. Mr. McCarthy’s letter indicated that the bidder will continue to attempt to meet
or exceeded the MBE/WBE goals.
On September 22, 2008, Commissioner Gorman's Administrative Assistant telephoned our office to speak
to the Administrator regarding the Madison file. She was told the Administrator was away from the
office.
A staff member from Ms. Hancock-Perry’s office called back that day, Monday, and stated that
Ms. Hancock-Perry was well aware of this bid but would be unavailable to speak with me until
Thursday, September 25, 2008
As a result of the call from the Commissioner's Office, Staff of the Office of Contract Compliance
telephoned the Administrator about the request for information on Madison Construction and was
directed to take the file and review it with Commissioner Gorman. When they arrived at Commissioner's
office, they were told she was not in. My staff however, reviewed the information in the file with
Commissioner Gorman's staff.
On September 25, 2008, the Administrator telephoned Commissioner Gorman and asked if she had
received the information the staff shared with her staff and whether or not the explanation answered her
concerns. She stated she had received the information; however, she was not satisfied with the
explanation.
No, I wasn’t satisfied with the information as the answers changed almost on an hourly basis. For
example, Ms. Hancock-Perry told me during one conversation that a bidder could protest being
found non-responsive on the Contract Compliance website. I looked at that website and could not
find anywhere to level such a protest. Also note that no bid recommendations were presented to
the County Board for approval at the October 1, 2008 board meeting.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2008
On October 15, 2008 at the Cook County Board Meeting, Commissioner Butler provided the
Administrator with a copy of the letter Commissioner Gorman distributed to the County Board Members.
The Administrator had no knowledge of the document prior to Commissioner Butler sharing it.
After reviewing the letter submitted by Madison, it should be noted that attachment Exhibits 1 and 2
which denotes the MBE bidders solicited and supporting letters documenting their good faith efforts,
were received after the bid opening. Please note that they are dated September 24, 2008, well after the
July 17, 2008 bid opening date. These documents were not a part of the bid as required by GC-52, II
paragraph one. We do not concur with Madison's assertion that the Office of Contract Compliance did not
confirm Madison's good faith efforts. As noted above, we made every attempt to do so with the
information that was provided to us at the time of bid submission.
The letters supplied by the bidder to Commissioner Gorman were not intended to be submittals
for the Bid as the above paragraph attempts to assert, however were provided to acknowledge the
bidders continuing participation and support for MBE/WBE Companies.
Further, it should be noted that Contract Compliance did not state that Valdivia was not certified to do the
work in the bid package. Our finding was and it was stated, "Valdivia was not certified in the area of
Demolition" as listed on the Utilization Plan, and later listed on the Letter of Intent received thirty-four
(34) days late to this office.
If compliance found “Valdivia not certified in the area of Demolition,” why then was it
acceptable for the second bidder John Burns Company?
In conclusion, the Office of Contract Compliance followed standard operating procedures as it reviewed
the bid response for the "build out of the pharmacy" within the Bureau of Health Services. It is my hope
that this chronology answers any questions regarding the decision to deem Madison non-responsive. I
would be happy to answer any additional questions that may arise.
The Office of Compliance has consistently made statements that are not consistent with the bid
application. The “standard operating procedures” of the Office of Contract Compliance along
with the bid material may need be reviewed to determine if the information is consistent. This
document acts to refute, yet again, the statements made by the Office of Compliance regarding
why Madison Construction’s bid was considered non-responsive. Cook County must be losing
significant revenue because of such inconsistencies and would have lost $161,000 if this bid
would have been assigned to the second bidder.

Robert Perkins was asked on several occasions to correct emergency issues with the existing

additional hours that he devoted to stabilizing the existing system.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $8,700.00. (239-260 Account).

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with EyeMed Vision Care,

program from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011.
The Request for Proposal (RFP) for Vision Care Benefits was joint initiative by the various municipal
agencies and issued by the Chicago Transit Authority. Six (6) national vision care companies responded
to this Request for Proposal. Based on an extensive financial analysis and overall evaluation of benefits
from the respondents, the Department of Risk Management recommends the selection of EyeMed Vision

service and ease of administration to covered members; very competitive administrative fee; and a fiveyear rate guarantee for materials and services (three year term, with two one-year renewal options). The
proposal from EyeMed Vision Care includes Minority Business Enterprises (MBE)/Women Business
Enterprises (WBE) direct participation and has been found responsive to the Contract Compliance
guidelines. This will allow Cook County employees to continue to participate in the Vision Care program
