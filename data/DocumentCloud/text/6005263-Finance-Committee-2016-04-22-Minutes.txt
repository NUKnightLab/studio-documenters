Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (Attachment #1)
Topic: Community Health Planning Initiatives, presented by Dr. Terry Mason
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, stated that Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Operating Officer of the
Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH), will be reviewing a strategic planning presentation on
Community Health Planning Initiatives. Additionally, he introduced Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of
Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health, who will be facilitating the strategic
planning discussions in these meetings through to the adoption of a full strategic plan in the summer.
Dr. Shannon noted that specially called meetings of the Board for strategic planning discussion purposes are
scheduled to be held on Thursday, May 5, 2016 and Monday, May 23, 2016. He added that, because a lot of the
concepts and information being presented is deep, rich and complex, if, following further reflection after the
meeting, there are pieces of information that Directors feel should nuance some of the direction being seen from
leadership in some of the recommendations coming out, the Director can email those comments to Mr. Sewell,
with a copy to the Board Secretary. Mr. Sewell will be assisting staff in compiling all of this discussion into
what will be the final strategic plan document that is hoped to be presented for approval in June. If Directors
do send email comments to Mr. Sewell and the Board Secretary, Dr. Shannon requested that they not copy the
other Directors on the emailed comments, as that communication could be interpreted as a conversation being
held outside of a public meeting.

Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
Dr. Mason provided an overview of the presentation, which included information on the following subjects:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Brief History of Local Community Health Planning;
Other Community Health Planning Initiatives;
Prior Plans: Common Problems, Common Priorities;
Expertise and Opportunities for Alignment;
Current Community Health Planning Activities;
Opportunities for Alignment with Current/New Local and State Community Health Planning Efforts;
Impact Model for Action Planning;
CCHHS Strategic Objectives: Opportunities; and
Recommendations for Alignment and Partnership.

Additional information was provided by Steven Seweryn, EdD, MPH, Director of Community Epidemiology
and Health Planning Unit and Interim Director of the Prevention Services Unit at CCDPH.
Director Velasquez commented that collaborations are paramount. There is a whole system of entities with
which CCHHS could partner, such as federally-qualified health centers and city and community colleges,
including Malcolm X College, which focuses on health careers. She would like to see a greater sense of
creativity in determining how to maximize efficiencies - not only for CCHHS but also for those institutions.
With regard to the Health Impact Pyramid on slide 17, Dr. Shannon stated that CCDPH is integrated into
CCHHS; at the same time, the Cook County Commissioners have to have a role as the Health Board for a
certain level of issues. In looking at those base layers of socioeconomic factors on the Pyramid, he inquired
whether those issues are specifically in the purview of the CCHHS Board, and if not, what does Dr. Mason
recommend to the CCHHS Board how they should consider those factors when thinking about strategic
planning. Dr. Mason responded that, in looking at clinical interventions and long-lasting interventions, those
are areas where CCHHS has direct opportunities. When he thinks about the other four (4) areas indicated on the
Pyramid, CCHHS has opportunities to be involved in each of those areas.
Acting Chairman Estrada inquired regarding the role and responsibilities of CCDPH to communicate to the
Cook County Board the importance of the socioeconomic factors such as housing and job efforts. Dr. Mason
responded that, although CCDPH reports operationally to the CCHHS Board, it also has the obligation to the
Cook County Commissioners to advise them on that very topic. The Cook County Commissioners represent the
governance of that aspect, and that gives CCDPH a voice at that level with the rest of Cook County government
in discussing how Cook County leverages its resources – this is in addition to CCHHS, in those areas where
CCHHS does not have direct input.
Acting Chairman Estrada inquired regarding the common priorities of certified local health departments
referenced in the presentation; he asked whether CCDPH is working with the other public health departments to
develop common strategies and tactics for those priorities. Dr. Mason responded that, while those entities may
agree on the priorities, the difference becomes tactical in terms of the implementation point of view. For
example, Chicago has one (1) mayor, one (1) police chief, one (1) school chief, etc. Cook County has 130
municipalities and 93 different school boards. CCDPH works with all of these municipalities as best as it can,

Page 2 of 70

 II.

Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
but those municipalities each vary in their own economic stability and their ability to do this. Mr. Seweryn
stated that health departments have aligned around these priorities in terms of specific projects; they are
working together much more now than in the past, and things are coming together. He referenced the Health
Impact Collaborative of Cook County, as described in the presentation; this is a potential opportunity to bring
some of that together and develop some county-wide priorities and strategies that align. Acting Chairman
Estrada proposed that CCHHS be the dominant partner in that collaborative, and that even more leadership in
this area is exercised.
Director Wiese stated that, in looking at the relationship between health and socioeconomic factors, the “canary
in the mine” are American Indians. From many aspects, they have the poorest health in the country. 80% of all
American Indian people live in cities like Chicago, and are classified as Urban American Indians. The amount
of funding that Urban American Indians receive from the American Indian Health Services is only 1% of the
total funding for American Indians. There is only one (1) clinic with one (1) full-time doctor in the entire State
of Illinois for 100,000 people who are eligible for American Indian Health Services. Additionally, all of the
socioeconomic factors discussed today are also prevalent for Urban American Indians, because it has become
federal policy to turn over the care, not only for health, but also for housing and other services, to the counties
and states in which American Indians live; therefore, the federal government has really stopped funding
housing, education, and economic development initiatives for American Indians who live off of reservations.
There is a very small number of American Indians who live on the reservations, but the government is still
sending nearly all of the money there. She requested that, when the administration is in discussions at the
federal level, that they ask questions as to why this is, and begin that dialogue so it can be addressed.
Acting Chairman Estrada clarified the request from Director Wiese. He stated that Director Wiese would like to
have CCHHS’ legislative team begin to educate its Senators and members of Congress on the subject, to start
making the argument that a greater percentage, whatever that percentage may be, of resources should follow the
American Indian population into the urban setting. Director Wiese stated that, overall, the money has to follow
the patient, and that is not currently happening – this is a reality and nothing is going to improve for that whole
population until that is acknowledged and addressed.

Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. It was noted that request numbers 9 and 16 are being withdrawn
from consideration.
During the discussion of request number 5, which was a request to amend, extend and increase the contract
with Clayco, Incorporated, for development team services relating to the Central Campus Redevelopment, the
following individuals provided additional information and reviewed a slide presentation on the subject: Jessica
Caffrey, Director of the Department of Real Estate Management of the Cook County Bureau of Asset
Management; Elaine Lockwood Bean, Chief of the Cook County Bureau of Asset Management; Tim Brangle,
Senior Associate, Chicago Consultant Studio (CCS); and Ryan McGuire, representing Clayco, Incorporated.
Director Junge emphasized that CCHHS serves a very unique population that is different than that of most big
private hospitals. She urge the presenters to ensure that attention is paid to where these patients come from in
terms of the Blue Line and other public transportation. Mr. Brangle responded that a traffic and transit study
was recently completed; he would be happy to share that information. Dr. Shannon provided additional
information on the subject. The development of the Central Campus includes limitations in space and what
can be developed in sequence and time. The bifurcation of what has been traditionally been considered as the
Campus into the core medical portion to the west and the Market Rate Development, which is the part with the
old Cook County Hospital, the current parking lot, the Wood Street Lot, and Pasteur Park, is based on some
realities that the County has about available funds and potential for development of that area.
Dr. Shannon informed the Committee that, when discussing the decommission of Fantus Clinic, Hektoen
Building and the Administration Building and occupation of the new building, this means a reduction of more
than 50% in the overall square footage from the old buildings to the new building. Some of that loss can be
tolerated simply because the new building’s space will be much more efficient, for both clinical and
administrative office space. However, this means that the administration will not be able to office everyone in
the new building who are moving out of the other buildings. Sometime between now and 2018, the
administration will return to the Board with a recommendation to either rent or lease space for some staff.
With regard to a question from Director Velasquez regarding controlling cost overruns, Ms. Caffrey stated that
they are pretty confident about the budget set; she noted that both a design contingency and a contingency
from the County are included. Ms. Lockwood Bean stated that this project is being done a little differently
from the traditional design/bid/build process. For this project, the County contracted with a design builder.
The benefit of that is that the builder is at the table during the design process, so they are a part of the team;
and any issues they might have are being resolved in the beginning. In addition to that, the County has hired
an independent cost estimator, so every time a budget is received at all of the milestones, the independent cost
estimator reviews each and every detailed cost.
Acting Chairman Estrada inquired regarding efforts that will be made to ensure that the people around this
community have access to jobs related to this project. Ms. Caffrey stated that the developer has committed to
the full minority and women-owned business enterprise goals component. As it relates to job creation, a local
impact area has been created that encompasses a three (3) mile radius of the Campus; those residents living
within that radius will have the first right to get jobs related to the project.

 IV. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Acting Chairman Estrada inquired regarding whether job training initiatives can be established, such as
potential partnerships with Malcolm X College to help train people who would then be eligible for those jobs.
Mr. McGuire responded that there will be a number of opportunities to work directly with institutions like
Malcolm X College. They are also looking out into the local communities to identify high schools to partner
with to create potential internship opportunities.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 22, with the exception of request numbers 9 and 16, which are being
withdrawn; the recommendation for approval is subject to completion of review by
Contract Compliance, where appropriate.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Report of emergency purchases
Mr. Elwell reviewed the presentation that included information on Metrics and Financial Statements through
March 2016. The Committee discussed the information.
Mr. Elwell stated that the personnel/overtime cost continues to run high; expenses have exceeded the budget by
$20 million. The administration is working with the County to take $42 million out of CCHHS’ non-personnel
budget to bring this account into compliance. He noted that, although the revenue figures look good, inside of
that, there is a stressor that CCHHS is not capturing the CountyCare revenue that was anticipated; year to date,
CCHHS is approximately $40 million behind in capturing that revenue. Mr. Elwell stated that, on the positive
side, CCHHS captured additional Medicare patients, and captured additional patients from other Medicaid
managed care programs.

VI. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Acting Chairman Estrada declared the meeting

 CCHHS Strategic Objectives: Opportunities
•
•

•

•
•

18

Improve Health Equity
– Most CHIP plans include a focus on social determinants; need to focus beyond
clinical setting/medical model
Provide high quality, safe and reliable care
– ​Access to care assumes care is high quality and comprehensive - addressing
needs of whole person including preventive factors and community context
factors
Demonstrate value, adopt performance benchmarking
– Plans have population and impact benchmarks; tying process and
performance benchmarks to outcomes demonstrates value to those in the
community; connect internal benchmarks to larger population measures
Develop human capital
– Building staff capacity to address complex health conditions of patients and
to work more effectively in collaboration with partners and communities.
Lead in Medical Education and Clinical Investigation relevant to vulnerable
populations
– Community plans seek to create an expanded understanding of what
contributes to health and wellness including social stratification and
community conditions -- essential concepts for clinical staff.

 Recommendations
for Alignment and Partnership
• Utilize the existing assessments and community health data
analysis for strategic planning efforts
• Identify areas for strategic alignment and complementary
interventions with existing CHIP priorities and plans
• Build on existing partnerships and efforts - limited new
funds/state budget impasse make collaboration imperative
• Work collaboratively with CCDPH, CDPH and HICCC and
community partners to identify opportunities for CCHHS to
take on specific areas for implementation
