ALTERNATE TRAFFIC AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT SITE
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 19, 2000 from
CARL R. HANSEN and CALVIN R. SUTKER, County Commissioners
In accordance with the Rules of the Board please place the submitted communication on the agenda for
the Cook County Board Of Commissioners for its regularly scheduled meeting of June 20, 2000.
LETTER
June 16, 2000
Honorable Cook County President
John H. Stroger, Jr.
I 18 North Clark Street
Suite 567
Chicago, IL 60602
Re: New Court Facilities/Homan Square
Dear Mr. President,
Submitted please find our proposal for the new Traffic and Domestic Violence Court Facilities, which we
believe, should be built at Homan Square. I would like to address the points below to the County
Commissioners in order to show that these proposals will both qualify the property and justify this project
location.
The proposal, as you will see, is comprised of two prospective plans, to assure the proper fit and function
for the County. The first proposal, "A' ', is for the reconstruction of the existi ng structure and
redevelopment of the property. The second proposal, " B"', covers the construction of new buildings on
the same site.
PLAN "A"
I.

5.

The 3245 West Arthington Building referred to, as the " Allstate Building" is an existing 310,000
square foot facility that can be renovated to meet the requirements for the Traffic Court, and
Mi sdemeanor courtrooms.
The building and the site are bordered on the north Arlington Ave., the west by Homan Ave., the
east by Kedzie Ave., and the South by the railroad embankment. This geography offers both
security, and buffer to any other residents or businesses.
A new 90,000 square foot building would be constructed on the adjoining vacant property to
faci litate the Domestic Violence courtrooms. With the two structures, there will be clear
separation between the two functions of the faci lities, and assist in overall security issues.
There is an existing 1,082 car parking faci lity. This structure lends itself to the addition of
between 2 to 4 additional levels thus facil itating 2,200 parking places. There is a separate 225-car
parking lot at the rear of the building that can be designated fo r Judges, State' s Attorneys, and
clerical staff, again offering additional safety feat ures to these individuals from the general public
utili zing the facilities.
The existing building is connected to the new Homan Square Police Department fo r ease of
prisoner transport, cell housing, and police response to the facilities.

No housing or commercial buildings are effected by this building use, and therefore, there is no
displacement of residents or acquisition of land.
Work on the project can commence immediately, upon plan development and permit issuance
thus not delaying the County' s occupancy during the review process that the County would
undertake.
The property allows for an additional 3. 12 acre vacant area for future expansion of the facilit ies,
or additional adm inistrative or support structures.
The property is located within four short blocks of the rapid transit congress line, and three existing
bus Jines. The 200 I addition of the Homan Square shuttle service will allow train travelers to be
picked up at the Homan station and dropped at the entry door to the Court facilities.
The traffic impact to the area would be less than that which existed while Sears and Roebuck
operated these structures with thirty-five thousand employees.
Access to the fac ilities can be made from Homan Ave., or Kedzie Ave., onto Arthington occupied
only by the same building complex, and without impacting any surrounding homes or business.
The entire project is contained in a campus type setting with gardens, and tree lined walks.
The existing building is connected to an additional 700,000 square feet of professional office
space to faci litate both expansion and the addition of support offices including: The State's
Attorney' s offices, and court support personnel. The adjoining buildings currently faci litate many
governmenta l offices, such as the Attorney General, and General Administration Services, and
many social support agencies such as DCFS, LifeLink, and youth centers.
The infrastructures to the building are new, when the neighborhood was redeveloped.
State of the art communication li nes exist in the adjoi ni ng property already. Satellite placement
on the roof structure is unobstructed by any surrounding buildings.
The faci lity would be set in an Enterprise Zone, Empowerment Zone, and TIF District.
The entire construction and redevelopment project could be completed as a Tenant Build-out.
The County would not have the responsibility of funding the project except for the ir support
requirements such as administration and legal fees. The entire project cost is estimated at
approximately $ 11 2,000,000.00. A lease term for the facilities can be entered for a period of time
as little as 15 years to as Jong as 99 years. The lease pay ments would be offset by the interest
accrued on the savings to the County as shown on the s ubmitted breakdown exhibits.
The entire project can be completed and operating in as little as thirty months.
Change orders due to unforeseen conditions become the responsibility of the Landlord, thus
protecting the County from cost overruns.
Design criteria can be developed which will incorporate construction elements such as the support
columns into the concept design similar to the County Board Room where column distance is
approximately the same or smaller, creating state of the art court rooms at substantial savings.
Visibility of the property can be simply achieved by placement of the Cook County fl ag on the
existing tower, which is c learly visible from the 290 (Eisenhower) expressway, and the possible
incorporation of the County embl em or name on the same structure.
With the placement of the Court facilities at the Homan Square Complex, construction of an
add ition onto the tower, and the redeve lopment of the tower itself would create add itional office
space, Judges private offices and suppor1 facilities, all connected to the court faci lities by
underground walkways.

PLAN "B"
I.

2.
3.
4.

The Landlord will demolish the ex1strng Allstate building, and construct a new facil ity
comprising the entire 400,000 square foot project on the same footprint.
Items 4 through 20 remain the same as in plan "A".
Time frame remains the same.
Cost should remain approximately the same.

2009

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR J UNE 20, 2000
5.
6.

Amenities remain the same.
Expansion space remains the same, or is reduced only if the building design requires fewer floo rs,
and larger floor plates.

Please review the submitted documents. As you will see, we have a llocated generous budgets to
reconstruct the existing building for both appearance and technology. Further we have budgeted
substantial money's for the construction of the new add itional building which would be built on land that
is suited fo r this type of construction without acquisition costs, demolition of existing structures or major
excavation or alteration to the ground.
I am sure that as you look through these documents and have the fi gures reviewed and critiqued, you will
agree that this site is in so many ways suited for this facility, both in substantial savi ngs of money and
time. Thank you.

Best Personal Regards,

Ed Smith

President Stroger asked for leave to allow Earl Neal, General Counsel, Public Building Commission to
address the process of compensation for any land acquired for this project.
Mr. Neal stated that the only authority the city, county and Public Building Commission have in tenns of the
amendment offered by Commissioner Steele is that affected property located on the north side of Van Buren
Street to the south side of Jackson from Homan to Spaulding. He said the property south of Van Buren
Street is not affected and cannot be legally acquired, based on the proposal now before the committee.
Mr. Neal went o n to say that the acquisition includes residential, commercial, and vacant parcels. He said
the primary concern is how the fami lies wi ll be treated. He reiterated that the president and every
commissioner has told him that everyone must be treated fairly, must be compensated adequately and
relocation must be provided .
According to Mr. Neal, following is the process by which land acquisition will take place:
1. Notification to property owner that land has been designated fo r use by the county including a
req uest to allow appraisal of property. There will be two appraisals and one must be either a
broker or real estate person from the community.
2.

An offer on the property w ill be made based upon the two appraisals and will be based on the
highest amount determined.

3.

Relocation efforts will be made for property owners. A unique feature of this proposal is that if
the owner purchases a building in Chicago, they will be paid an add itional $5,000.00 above the
val ue of the property at closing.

2085

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 20, 2000
4. Tenants will be paid the actual cost of moving and an additional $ 1,500.00 to assist in obtaining a
new rental unit, security deposit and first month's rent.
A team of brokers will be available to assist in relocation efforts. He concluded by saying that his door
will always be open for anyone wishing to discuss relocation.
Commissioner Hansen asked if any appraisals have been conducted by the Public Building Commission
on the feasibility of locating the courthouse on some of the other sites proposed by the public today,
specifically, sites proposed by Luster Jackson and Reverend Steve Stultz.
Mr. Neal responded that studies have been conducted, but no appraisals have been prepared .
Commissioner Steele asked if low interest loans will be available in the event the appraisal sum is not
adequate to purchase a new home.
Mr. Neal responded that there are a number of subsidized City programs for mortgages or loans. He said
that the project team will make certain all home owners are aware of these programs.
In response to Commissioner Sutker's question regarding re-evaluating the other 8 acre sites, President
Stroger responded that comparison studies have already been completed.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding if there were any esti mates on the average
value of the homes in the targeted area, Earl Neal stated that no appraisals were done on individual
homes. However, he explained that based on estimated land values in the area, the total cost of land
acq ui sition is estimated at $6 million.
Commissioner Maldonado stated he hoped the Public Building Commission would consider the New
Homes for Chicago Program for the residents and tenants in the planned site area. The Commissioner said
the program will give the residents great opportunity to purchase a new home with a substantial subsidy.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the amendment under consideration to reduce the acreage from 13 to 8
acres is a positive change for the community and addresses the majority of the concerns expressed by the
residents in the Homan area south of Van Buren Street.
Commissioner Lechowicz gave background information on this issue. He stated that the Committee on
the Courts for the 2 1•• Century was charged with the responsibility of identifying the future needs of the
Cook County Circuit Court system. He said public hearings were held on August 2, 1999, the present
traffic court location was sold to private developers, the present domestic violence court location is
inadequate and recommendations have been rece ived from the Chief Judge leading to the collaborative
efforts outlined in the report before the committee.
Commissioner Collins stated her concern that the planning process did not have enough community
involvement and suggested that the committee delay taking action on approving the plan in order to
address the community's concerns and impact on the neighborhood .
Commissioner Hansen also stated his concern w ith approving the site plan without further study and
responses from the Project Manager and Public Building Commission.

2086

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 20, 2000
Commissioner Gos lin said he agreed with Commissioners Collins and Hansen and would like to see the
issue deferred for two weeks. He noted the recent zoning issue in Barrington Township where the Board
worked with the residents on a compromise between the township and the community. Commissioner
Goslin stated that he sees a similarity in the Garfield community's concerns of losing their homes.
In response to Commissioner Carr's question regarding if the proposed site would have adequate parking,
courtrooms and landscaping space, the Project Manager responded the building meets the courts' needs
and the space criteria for the project, including 32 courtrooms and 1900 parking spaces.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if there has been any discussion with the City of Chicago regarding the
possible danger of the angled corner at Fifth Avenue?
Mr. Szkatulski responded that there have been preliminary discussions with the Chicago Planning
Department to review the site and make certain that the proposal is not something that would be objected
to at a later date. Discussions have taken place regarding straightening out the angle at the Fifth A venue
intersection to which the City seemed to be receptive.
Chairman Daley asked if all ordinances will be complied with as required by the City a nd the County.
Mr. Szkatulski responded in the affirmati ve.

Commissioner Hansen moved to defer action on the Resolution, as amended (Communication
Number 236496), for two weeks to review other sites and report back to the Finance and
Construction Committees. Seconded by Commissioner Sutker.
Commissioner Hansen called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:
