revenues and expenditures.

Fiscal Year 2016 Year-End

For FY2016, DBMS anticipates a budget shortfall of $23 million in
the County’s General Fund and $24 million in the Health Enterprise
Fund.
At the end of the Þrst quarter, DBMS took precautionary measures
to restrict expenditures in the General Fund, which resulted in an

COOK COUNTY PRELIMINARY FORECAST   PAGE 2

The projected County FY2016 General Fund shortfall is driven
solely by revenue shortfalls, primarily a decline in revenues related
to court Þlings; unrealized reimbursements from the Administrative
OfÞce of the Illinois Courts (AOIC), a decline in Cigarette Tax, and
slower than anticipated growth in Home Rule Sales Tax revenue.
The AOIC provides salary reimbursement for certain probation staff.
In the 2016 budget, Cook County anticipated a reimbursement
amount of $49 million. However, absent appropriation in the State  

 budget, a court order allowed for reimbursement of only $42.5
million, leaving a shortfall of approximately $6.5 million. Home Rule
Sales Tax revenue is projecting a negative variance of $14.8 million;
Cigarette Tax and Other Tobacco Products Tax together are $9.6
million below budget expectations.
The remaining negative variance is attributed to the continued
decline in court case Þlings, impacting revenue in both the Clerk of
the Circuit Court and SheriffÕs OfÞce.
In the Health Fund, CCHHS is currently projecting a shortfall of $24
million, driven primarily by expenditures exceeding budget.
Though Managed Care (CountyCare) revenues are projected to
come in $46.3 million below budget, driven by lower than
anticipated enrollment, CCHHS expects Patient Fees to offset this
amount and that overall CCHHS revenues will come in greater than
budgeted.
However, expenditures, predominantly in the CountyCare Managed
Care Department, along with Overtime costs at Stroger Hospital are
driving expenditures that are projected to exceed budget by $45.3
million, for a net projected deÞcit at the Health Fund of $24 million.

Fiscal Year 2017 Forecast

The FY2017 outlook includes a $134.6 million shortfall projected in
the General Fund and a $40 million shortfall at the Health Fund,
creating a total operating funds projected deÞcit of $174.3 million.
This projection assumes a ßat operating tax allocation for the Health
System of $121 million, and includes an increase in legacy debt
service payments of $30 million. This projected operating deÞcit
also reßects increased funding for highway infrastructure of $54.5
million, and an increased appropriation of $350.4 million in funding
for pensions that will put the County on a path to address the
outstanding unfunded pension liability at the County Employee’s
and OfÞcerÕs Annuity and BeneÞt Fund of Cook County (the
“Retirement Fund”), consistent with the intention of the majority of
the Board of Commissioners when they raised the Home Rule Sales
Tax in 2015.
In the General Fund, projected expenditures of $1,920 million will
exceed projected revenues of $1,785 million with a tax allocation to
the Cook County Health and Hospital System assumed for these
purposes at $121 million, equal to the 2016 Þgure. The projected
shortfall is driven by an increase in estimated expenditures of $185
million and an increase in expected revenues of roughly $50 million
over the FY16 Adopted budget.

A holdback of $23 million in non-personnel expenditures was
undertaken earlier in FY2016, with further holdbacks in this area
anticipated to correct the deÞcit trajectory.

 PRELIMINARY FORECAST PUBLIC FORUM
A public hearing and online forum will be held on the preliminary
budget on July 19, 2016 at 6:00 p.m. in the Cook County Board
Room to obtain constituent feedback on budget priorities. The
Department of Budget and Management Services will work closely
with residents, elected ofÞcials, and County departments to review
potential efÞciencies and cost savings opportunities that will allow
for the presentation of a balanced budget recommendation to the
Board of Commissioners in October.
