ITEM #25

Transmitting a Communication from
RUPERT F. GRAHAM, JR., P.E., Acting Superintendent of Highways
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 06-45-569 with Bentley
Systems, Inc., Exton, Pennsylvania, for the purchase of MicroStation software.
Reason:

Bentley Systems, Inc. is the sole creator and sole distributor of MicroStation software. The
Highway Department uses MicroStation to produce and manage engineering drawings of
county roads and facilities. The Illinois Department of Transportation has chosen
MicroStation as its drafting and design software standard. A previous action of the board
allows the department to make all purchases of Bentley Systems, Inc.’s products under the
State of Illinois contract and discount.
By renewing under the terms of Contract No. 06-45-569, the county will save over
$10,400.00 this year in maintenance fees alone. These savings will be repeated and possibly
increased every year from now until either the State of Illinois or Cook County decides to
terminate the agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $25,970.00. Contract period: May 15, 2006 through May 14, 2007. (501-441
Account). Requisition No. 75011100.

WHEREAS, on January 9, 2007, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved Resolution 07-R45, Fee-Based Parking Initiative; and
WHEREAS, Resolution 07-R-45 requested that the Chief Financial Officer of Cook County work with
the Cook County Department of Facilities Management and the Cook County Department of Revenue to
“assemble a plan to create, implement and enforce fee-based parking for all Cook County owned parking
lots that do not already have such a program in place;” and
WHEREAS, the intent of Resolution 07-R-45 was to have a plan to generate additional revenue through
a fee-based parking initiative before the Cook County Board of Commissioners in time to help offset
some of the historic County deficit for fiscal year 2007; and
WHEREAS, Resolution 07-R-45 did not set a deadline for the fee-based parking initiative report to be
presented to the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, due to Cook County needing to generate revenue in fiscal year 2007, the fee-based parking
initiative plan needs to be delivered to the Cook County Board of Commissioners in time for the Board to
implement said plan in fiscal year 2007.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that the Fee-Based Parking Initiative Report to be generated by the Chief Financial Officer of Cook

PERFORMANCE-BASED SERVICE CONTRACTING INITIATIVE
WHEREAS, Cook County is faced with a historic budget deficit for fiscal year 2007 that exceeds $500

necessitated reductions in mission critical services and reductions in the workforce; and

WHEREAS, Performance-Based Contracting is tied to metrics and standards that can be measured and
audited; and
WHEREAS, for the past decade, the federal government, as well as many state and local governments,

WHEREAS, under performance-based contracting, Cook County would have the option of exercising
Gain-Sharing whereby zero payments would be made to contractors and they would instead share in
revenue gains; and
WHEREAS, an immediate benefit from Performance-Based Contracting is that it provides a proven
framework that enhances the outcomes associated with said contracts and helps to materially reduce
financial risk and cash outlays, which in turn save the County millions of dollars annually which
promotes transparency, accountability, and good governances.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests
that the Office of the Chief Purchasing Agent, under the direction of Cook County’s Chief Financial
Officer, shall formulate a phased plan to implement and enforce: Performance Based Contracting for

to her children the value of a strong work ethic; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Brown’s vibrancy is clearly the result of her natural “zest for life,” as well as her

workout at her local Y.M.C.A.; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Ruby Lee Brown is the consummate role model who continues to set a fine example
for all to follow.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
