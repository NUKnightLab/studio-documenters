OLD BUSINESS:

The Board discussed the purchase of a digital dog tag machine. The machine will be used at outreach
events to increase traffic. Similar machines have been used on hospice centers, etc. and have been shown
to have amazing results. It has helped veterans open up about their experiences. A resolution will be
presented at the next Board meeting for approval.

NEW BUSINESS:

The Executive Director discussed the option of making all board meetings open public meetings. Level
Appeal meetings will then take place after each open public meeting. This will reduce the time a
veteran must wait for a Level appeal. The Board agreed to begin this new format in October on a trial

basis.

The Executive Director stated that a ?yer will be included in the next mailing to the posts. It will ask
each post to report meeting dates, drawing nights, etc. so a calendar can be built for the outreach mobile
vehicle.
