The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The proposed amendment exercises the second year renewal option available in the Cook
County contract with Sentinel Offender services, LLC for electronic monitoring and Global Positioning
System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and Juvenile Probation and Court Services
Department minor and adult clients who are ordered by the court to wear electronic monitoring devices.
Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial defendants
in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the
monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS technology. The law allows the court to
order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored electronically by the Adult
Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation.
Offenders are
ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the
complaining witness, the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address
specified. There are currently more than 210 adults under GPS monitoring and 110 victims who carry
GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones.
Effective on 1/1/2015, new legislation (Public Act
98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for
GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.

GPS technology is also used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor
high-risk minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release
into the community.
These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from preadjudication through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. As of late December 2016, there are
more than 275 court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance, 60% of whom are on pretrial
status.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code.
Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria.
