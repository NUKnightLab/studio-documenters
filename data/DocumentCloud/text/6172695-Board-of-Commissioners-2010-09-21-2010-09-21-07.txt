 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited bids
for general contractors to perform renovation and ADA/504 compliance work at 1316-18 S. Sawyer
(IL2-064) as part of the CHA’s Scattered Sites program. The work is to be completed within ninety
(90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed except for work covered by Division
32 – 32 9200 Turf and Grasses and Division 32 – 32 9300 Plants. Work covered by Division 32 – 32
9200 Turf and Grasses and Division 23 – 32 9300 Plants must be completed by no later than June 1,
2011.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 0562 on July 6, 2010 for the renovation and
ADA/504 compliance work at 1316-18 S. Sawyer Ave. The IFB was advertised in the Chicago SunTimes, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA website and on BuySpeed Online.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on July 12, 2010. The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on
July 29, 2010. It changed the bid submittal date from August 2, 2010 to August 5, 2010, answered
Requests for Information, distributed revised drawings, technical specifications sections, revised BF
pages and updated Davis-Bacon wage decisions.
The CHA received and opened ten (10) bids on August 5, 2010 at 11:00 am.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and the
Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with All Chicago, Inc., the
apparent low bidder. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid and its capacity
to perform this work. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to meet the ninety (90) calendar
day timeline. Detailed information was also provided by the firm on its division costs.
Based on their submitted bid, the Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that All
Chicago, Inc. is the lowest responsive and responsible bidder at $1,765,936.00. All Chicago, Inc. has
previously performed work for the CHA as a prime contractor on several projects at Wentworth
Gardens.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to authorize
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with All Chicago Inc. in the amount
of $1,765,936.00 for the renovation and ADA/504 compliance work at 1316-18 S. Sawyer (IL2-064).
Work is to be completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to
Proceed except for work covered by Division 32 – 32 9200 Turf and Grasses and Division 32 – 32
9300 Plants. Work covered by Division 32 – 32 9200 Turf and Grasses and Division 23 – 32 9300
Plants must be completed by no later than June 1, 2011.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3
resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
