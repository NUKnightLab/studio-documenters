Re: Potential Conflict in Voting

lC Member Doris Ewing reminded the Committee that she is a former NEPC employee
and indicated her desire to address any Committee concerns in her participating in the
investment consultant search. Ms. Ewing noted that she is no longer an employee of
NEPC, and there would be no personal financial gain or impact in the event NEPC were
terminated, retained or selected. General Counsel also noted that Ms. Ewing?s prior
employment with NEPC was known at the time of her appointment to the investment
Committee. General Counsel stated his opinion that based upon Ms. Ewing?s
continuing disclosure and there being no personal financial gain or detriment related to
the Committee?s selection of the investment Consultant, there is no legal conflict which
would require her to recuse herself from the selection process. The Committee
members discussed this matter and concurred that there was no direct conflict of
interest and noted the value of Ms. Ewing participating in the selection process in light
of her extensive experience in this area. The Committee members also noted that in
the event of a split vote for the final selected consultant, due care should be utilized by
all Committee members during the search process to avoid the appearance of any bias
or conflict in the selection of the final candidate.
