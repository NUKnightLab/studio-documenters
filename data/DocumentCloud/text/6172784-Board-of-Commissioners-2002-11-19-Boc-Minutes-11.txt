entitled “Approval of the FY2003 Comprehensive Budget”;

1.
2.

3.

THAT,

“FY2003

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and economical
operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of serving lowincome families;
that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources
adequate to cover all proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use of
Federal funding in excess of that payable under the provisions of the
applicable Federal regulations; and
that all proposed rental charges and expenditures will be consistent with
provisions of law and the Annual Contributions Contract in accordance with
the Moving To Work Demonstration Agreement of the Chicago Housing
Authority with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute
and forward to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all
necessary budget documents and supporting information when applicable.

(Item A2)
In December 2000, the Board approved an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago
for the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to provide supplemental policing services. The
agreement provides for the following services: a customized policing plan for the CHA to reduce
the incidence of violent crimes, drug trafficking, substance abuse and drug related crimes;
enhancement of the Public Housing Section of the CPD; increased vertical foot and car patrol teams
in CHA developments and concerted patrol efforts within targeted developments. CPD’s initiative
to reduce crime includes working with CHA management, community groups, and other City
agencies to help improve the overall quality of life for CHA residents. Comparing the time periods
of January-June 1999 to January-June 2002, crime at CHA locations decreased by 40% as
compared to 16% citywide. Since 1999, narcotics related arrests at CHA locations increased by
64%. Since January 2002, the CPD Public Housing Section executed over 600 narcotics related
missions in or around public housing. The resolution for Item A2 approves an extension of the
current Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago Police Department.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-153
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated November 5,
2002 entitled "Authorization to Extend Intergovernmental Agreement with the City
of Chicago for Services Provided by the Chicago Police Department”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to execute Extension No. 1 to the Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the
City of Chicago acting through the Chicago Police Department to extend the IGA to
continue providing supplemental policing services to the CHA for an amount not to
exceed $13,600,000 for the period January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003.

(Item A3)
The Authority is entering into an agreement with Lake Park Crescent I LLC for the development of
Lake Park Crescent and is responsible for all environmental remediation and legal costs associated
with any potential liabilities from pre-existing conditions. In order to provide the CHA with
protection from any unforeseen environmental liability costs, CHA engaged its broker of record,
Near North Insurance Brokerage, Inc., to solicit competitive bids for environmental insurance.
Near North Insurance Brokerage solicited bids from the only six firms who participate in this line of
coverage. In response to this solicitation, two bids (XL Capital Group and Chubb Insurance Group)
and four declinations were received. Based upon the analysis of the CHA’s Risk Management
Department and the Office of Development Management, XL Capital Group was selected as the
recommended awardee. The resolution for Item A3 approves award of contract to XL Capital
Group.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-154
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the memorandum dated October 23,
2002 entitled "Authorization to Award Environmental Insurance Coverage for the
Lake Park Crescent Development to XL Capital Group.

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to procure a ten- year environmental insurance policy for the Lake Park
Crescent Development through its broker of record, Near North Insurance
Brokerage, Inc., to be written through XL Capital Group for a one-time premium
not-to-exceed $433,754 subject to HUD approval, if required.

(Item A4)
The CHA has begun replacing obsolete computer hardware and software that has been in operation
since 1995. In October 2002, an Invitation for Bid was advertised soliciting qualified firms who
could supply and deliver 90 E-4000 computers and 42 HP Laserjet 4100N printers. In November 8
bid proposals were received and opened by the Purchasing Department. The resolution for Item A4
approves award of contract to Insight Direct USA, who submitted the lowest total price proposal.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-155
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 4, 2002
entitled “Authorization to enter into a Contract with Insight Direct USA for supply
and delivery of Gateway E-4000 Computers and HP Laserjet 4100N Printers”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to enter into a contract with Insight Direct USA for supply and delivery of Gateway
E-4000 Computers and HP Laserjet 4100N Printers for a firm fixed price of
$187,440.00 for a one-year contract term, subject to HUD approval.

(Item A5)
A favorable determination letter for the Plan was issued by the Internal Revenue Service in
September 2002. This favorable determination letter is extremely significant because it entitles the
Plan, which is qualified under Internal Revenue Code selection, to continue with favorable tax
treatment, allowing participants to defer tax until a taxable distribution occurs, allowing plan
earnings to accumulate free of tax, and to comply with certain series of tax laws. The IRS favorable
determination is subject to the adoption of Amendment Five by the Board of Commissioners. The
resolution for Item A1, therefore, approves Amendment No. 5 to the Employee’s Retirement Plan
and Trust.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-156
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated October 21, 2002
Entitled “Authorization to Amend the Chicago Housing Authority Employees’

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to approve Amendment Five of the Chicago Housing Authority Employees’
Retirement Plan and Trust in the form and as of the effective dates indicated in the
attached Amendment.

anticipated portfolio of ongoing and new construction services and completes its assessment of the
nature and degree of managing owner’s representative services currently required, staff

month term. This contract was originally procured on a non-competitive basis approved by HUD.
In addition to the current services, a building permit facilitator component will be added, which was
initially included under a separate small procurement purchase order. Maintaining the current
permit facilitator at this time is essential for keeping the program on schedule. The resolution for
Item B1 approves an extension to Tishman’s contract.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-157
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated November 8, 2002

(Item B2)
The CHA designed up to 300 project-based vouchers for use in FY2003 to subsidize private
developments in specific geographic areas of the city. Accordingly, a Request For Proposal (RFP)
was released in January 2001 and Boulevard Realty Services, managing partner of Roosevelt
Tower – I, LLC, submitted a proposal. The first phase of the proposal is Roosevelt Towers – 1, a
126 unit – 8 story, senior high-rise building project which has been submitted to the City of
Chicago’s Department of Housing for 4% tax credits. The total project construction cost is
$18,039,300 and is scheduled for construction commencement in January 2003. Roosevelt Towers
- 1 will serve as a relocation site for CHA senior residents, particularly those from CHA family
developments. Project–based statutes and regulations will be followed to lease voucher-assisted
units solely to referrals from CHA’s waiting lists. The second phase of the proposal calls for the
utilization of 168 project based Section 8 vouchers and once financing and site control are finalized,
CHA will seek Board approval for Phase II. The resolution for Item B2 approves an Agreement
and a HAP contract with Roosevelt Towers – 1, LLC.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-158

(Item B4)
The 18.4 acre Cabrini Green Extension North site was awarded a $50,000,000 HOPE VI Grant by
HUD in 1994. A lawsuit filed by the Cabrini Green Local Advisory Council in 1996 precluded
CHA and the Habitat Company from implementing the redevelopment activities identified in the
Revitalization Plan. The Cabrini Green Consent decree was entered as a settlement of the lawsuit.
The Decree required the City of Chicago or its designee to issue a Request For Proposal for parcels
to be developed. The Decree also required the formation of a Working Group and Evaluation
Panel. The Evaluation Panel is responsible for selecting the developer to carry out the agreed upon
activities. In October 2001, an RFP was issued by the City of Chicago Department of Housing.
Four responses were received of which one was deemed non-responsive. The Working Group
evaluated and ranked the three remaining responses. The recommendation of Holsten/Kenard is
being made by consensus of the Evaluation Panel, including CHA, Habitat and the Resident
leadership. Holsten/Kenard is a joint venture with two principal partners: Holsten Real Estate
Development, headed by Peter Holsten, and The Kenard Corporation, headed by Hal Lichterman.
The partnership has identified team members qualified to carry out the essential aspects of the
development activities, including architects, urban planners, construction companies, financial
planners and social service providers. The Resolution for Item B4 approves Holsten/Kenard as the
Development team for the Cabrini Extension North property and gives authorization to enter into
negotiations with the Development Team for a Development Agreement.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-160

2002 requesting approval of the Cabrini Extension North Evaluation Panel’s
consensus recommendation of Holsten/Kenard as the Development Team for the
Cabrini Extension North Property and authorization to enter into negotiations with
the Development Team;

the Board of Commissioners hereby 1) approves the Cabrini Extension North
Evaluation Panel’s consensus recommendation of Holsten/Kenard as the
Development Team for the Cabrini Extension North Property; and 2) authorizes the
Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into negotiation with the
Development Team for a development agreement. If the parties cannot agree to
mutually acceptable terms, CHA shall terminate such negotiations and begin
negotiations with the second top-rated Development Team respondent based on the
Evaluation Panel’s ranking system.

Relocation and Good Neighbors program was rescheduled for presentation at the December
Committee Meeting.
Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of the resolutions for
Items C1 and C2 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services
Committee:
(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves a contract with Windows of Opportunity, in an amount not-toexceed $136,350, obtained through a non-competitive procurement, subject to HUD approval. This
award will allow Windows of Opportunity to continue performing the following services for the
CHA: raise funds for new and ongoing resident initiatives; serve as fiscal sponsor to
local/community based organizations that serve CHA communities and residents, serve as fiscal
agent to the CHA receiving grants or contributions whose acceptance requires a tax exempt
eligibility for tax deductible contributions; form and maintain partnerships/linkage with outside
community groups, service providers and work closely with CHA staff and residents to identify
gaps in services and seek resources to fill those gaps. As a new addition to the services Windows
currently provides, this award will allow Windows to become the administrator of the CHA’s
Section 3 Education Fund.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-161
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 12, 2002, entitled “Authorization to Enter into a
Contract with Windows of Opportunity, Inc.” and concurs with the
recommendations therein;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority hereby authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a Contract with Windows of
Opportunity, Inc. for fourteen months, November 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003, in
an amount not to exceed $136,350.00, with a one year option to extend, subject to
HUD approval.

7

 (Item C2)
In 1998, the Authority entered into five residential relocation services contracts, each for a base
period of two years with three one year options to extend. All five contracts were modified three
times. Due to addition of public housing move costs for moves within CHA developments due to
the expansion of Phase II buildings, the original planned and approved amounts allocated for two of
the five resident relocation contracts have been exceeded. The need to conduct internal public
housing moves arose to facilitate the closure of the public housing buildings. C&H Joint ventures
is no longer doing business with the CHA, so Reo Movers and Midway Movers were two of the
four contractors left who were willing and able to fulfill the expanded demand for moving services.
By conducting both Section 8 moves and public housing moves, the CHA has exceeded the original
projected amount of funds allocated on the contract with Reo Movers and Midway Movers. The
Resolution for Item C2 retroactively covers obligated costs and approves modification of existing
contracts with Reo Movers and Midway Movers to cover anticipated costs through December 31,
2002.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-162
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated November 5, 2002 entitled, “Authorization to enter into contract
modifications with Midway Movers and Reo Movers & Van Lines, Inc., for CHAwide Resident Relocation Services”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is hereby authorized to modify two
existing Resident Relocation Contracts with Midway Movers, for an additional
amount of $88,500 and with Reo Movers & Van Lines, Inc., for an additional
amount of $176,525, subject to HUD approval.

(Walk-On No. 1)
In March 2002, the Board approved entering into a Redevelopment Agreement with Lake Park
Crescent and in June 2002 approved the submission of a Mixed Finance Proposal to HUD. In
addition, in July 2002, the Board approved the submission of an application for the disposition of
land formerly known as Lake Michigan Homes and a portion of Washington Park Homes, and
granted approval to execute other documents as necessary to secure the Lake Park Crescent
Development Site. HUD approval of the disposition application was received in October 2002.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Board had previously authorized the execution of all other
documents necessary to secure the Lake Park Crescent Site, HUD has requested further clarification
that the Board has approved entering into a 99 year ground lease with Lake Park Crescent
Associates I LP. The resolution for Walk-On Item 1 accordingly approves a 99 year Ground Lese
with Lake Park Crescent Associates 1 LP for the Lakefront Redevelopment site.
A Motion to approve Walk-On Item No. I was then presented by Commissioner Gates.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-163
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 14,
2002, entitled “Authorization to enter into a 99-year ground lease with Lake Park
Crescent Associates I LP for the Lakefront Redevelopment Site for a portion of the
land to be developed as Lake Park Crescent Rental Phase I”.

 THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a 99 year ground lease with Lake Park Crescent Associates I

(Walk-On No. 2)
In September 1999, The Habitat Company and the City of Chicago Department of Planning and
Development issued a Request For Proposals for the Redevelopment of the CHA’s Lakefront Site.
To assist in that effort CHA and The Habitat Company, upon the recommendation of the Working
Group, selected the development team, Lake Park Crescent I LLC. On March 19, 2002, the Board
approved entering into a Redevelopment Agreement with Lake Park Crescent I LLC. Pursuant to
the Redevelopment Agreement, the CHA is required to fund the cost of site remediation for preexisting conditions (other than costs the developer would have incurred in any event) on a phase by
phase basis, subject to certain rights to terminate for infeasibility. HUD has indicated that since a
competitive process was engaged in to procure the Lakefront Redevelopment Team, and since the
engineered barrier approach to remediation involves construction elements to be performed postclosing, there is justification to enter into a contract for remediation activities with Lake Park
Crescent I LLC. The benefits namely are economy of scale, continuity of schedule and continuity
of activity. Accordingly, the resolution for Walk-On Item 2 approves award of contract with Lake
Park Crescent for environmental remediation activities at the Lakefront Redevelopment Site.
A Motion to approve Walk-On Item No. 2 was then presented by Commissioner Young.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-164
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 4,
2002 entitled "Authorization To Enter Into A Contract with Lake Park Crescent I
LLC for Environmental Remediation Activities at the Lakefront Redevelopment
Site”.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to enter into a contract with Lake Park Crescent I LLC (upon approval of
MBE/WBE and Section 3 compliance plans by CHA’s Compliance department) for
a total amount not- to- exceed $4,258,085 (the estimated remediation cost of Phase I)
for environmental remediation activities in support of the Lakefront Redevelopment
Site (also known as the Lake Park Crescent Project). The term of the Lake Park
Crescent I LLC contract shall be the earlier of, the receipt of a “No Further
Remediation” letter from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency with regard
to the Lakefront Redevelopment Site or two years, subject to a one year extension if
approved by HUD.

(Walk-On No. 3)
In the summer of 2001, the CHA issued a Request For Proposal to solicit firms to administer the
CHA’s Section 8 program. The sole respondent was Quadel, the CHA’s current administrator of
the Section 8 program. The CHA extended the previous contract with Quadel to ensure that there
was sufficient time to negotiate a new contract and over the last several months, the CHA has been
negotiating contract terms. The new contract will include expanded services and performance
standards as well as performance incentives. The expanded services are in the areas of mobility
counseling (moves to low poverty) focusing on residents in high poverty areas, better business
processes in inspections and customer service, higher percentages for achieving processing times
for relocatees, higher goals for homeownership and a marketing and outreach program for voucher
holders living in high poverty areas. New initiatives include a special process streamlining
initiative to attract and retain landlords with multiple units in low poverty areas. Performance
incentives are in the areas of de-concentration and business process improvements. The agreed
terms of compensation includes a cost-plus contract where Quadel will receive a budget and a
management fee to administer the program. Quadel will also have the opportunity to receive
additional fee if performance incentives are achieved. The resolution for Walk-On Item 3 approves
award of contract to Quadel.
A Motion to approve Walk-On Item No. 3 was then presented by Commissioner Harris.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-165
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated November 18, 2002
entitled "Authorization to enter into a contract with Quadel Corporation ("Quadel) to

to enter into a contract with Quadel Consulting Corporation and the Chicago
Housing Authority for a contract term of December 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004,
