Minutes of the meeting of the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System held Thursday, September 17, 2015 at the hour of 8:30 A.M. at 1900

III.

Report from Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (Attachment #1-presentation)
A. Corporate Compliance Report (Attachment #2-Report)
Cathy Bodnar, Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, and Ryan Lipinski, CountyCare
Compliance Officer, reviewed the information contained in the Report. The Committee discussed the
information.
With regard to the first bullet on Slide 5 of the presentation, Ms. Bodnar stated that the goal of maintaining
adherence to contractual requirements relates specifically to the Managed Care Community Network
(MCCN) agreement. The MCCN agreement is essentially a contract with the State, and there are different
parameters within the agreement that have a compliance aspect to them; it must be ensured that those
parameters trickle down to the delegated vendors’ contracts and that the delegated vendors are adhering to
those specific compliance parameters. Board Chairman Hammock suggested that the first bullet should be
stated as to be more specifically pertaining to the MCCN agreement.
During the discussion of Slide 6 of the presentation, Ms. Lipinski stated that the data on grievances and
appeals will be presented on separate slides in future presentations. Board Chairman Hammock requested
that the percentage of grievances to total members be included in the information provided in the future.

 III.

Report from Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (continued)
Director Junge inquired whether this data includes grievances or appeals from staff members. Ms. Lipinski
responded that there is a separate appeal track for matters such as billing dispute and coverage decision;
additionally, providers can serve as authorized representatives for members for an appeal - that is very rare
because of the time and administrative work that is required. Ms. Bodnar noted that, if an employee calls the
Compliance hotline to make an allegation of fraud, waste or abuse, or with regard to an issue related to
privacy, Compliance tracks all of those separately.

IV.

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
CountyCare Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – July 2014 through June 2015
I.

Introduction

CountyCare is a Managed Care Community Network (“MCCN”) health plan offered by Cook County Health &
Hospitals System (“CCHHS”) pursuant to a contract with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services
(“HFS”) effective July 1, 2014. The health plan is designed to simultaneously provide coverage for any Cook County
Medicaid eligible beneficiaries and transform CCHHS into a patient-centered continuum of care. The operation of the
CountyCare MCCN is facilitated through CCHHS and its various subcontractors.
In order to adhere to Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Managed Care Program Integrity requirements2,
contractual provisions in the MCCN Agreement with HFS, and the elements of an effective compliance program as
recommended in the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) Compliance
Program Guidance publications, CountyCare recently developed and implemented the CountyCare Compliance
Program. The CountyCare Compliance Program is designed to demonstrate the health plan’s commitment to
promoting ethical and lawful conduct consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements,
as well as CCHHS policies, procedures, and Code of Ethics/Standards of Conduct.
This Annual Report presents the activities of the first year of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS)
CountyCare Managed Care Compliance Program under the operational management of Cathy Bodnar, Chief
Compliance and Privacy Officer.
II. Building Blocks – Setting Program Infrastructure and Scope
The Annual Report begins with a look at the structure and implementation activities of the Program that are designed
to foster an infrastructure that produces a comprehensive compliance program for CountyCare and its affiliates.
The system-level Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, in consultation with Senior Leadership, the Compliance
Oversight Committee, and the CCHHS Board of Directors, through the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board
of Directors, are responsible for coordinating the implementation of the CountyCare Compliance Program. The Chief
Compliance and Privacy Officer is primarily supported by Ryan Tyrrell Lipinski, JD, the CountyCare Compliance
Officer, and external consultants. The consultants provide guidance in the development and implementation of the
program, as well as present expertise in particular compliance areas.

CountyCare Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – July 2014 through June 2015
CountyCare Compliance Program Scope
The CountyCare Compliance Program is tasked with outlining guidelines and providing insight to:
§ Comply with the CMS Managed Care Program Integrity requirements and the terms of the CountyCare
Health Plan contract with HFS;
§ Prevent, detect and eliminate fraud, abuse, and financial misconduct;
§ Protect health plan members, providers, CountyCare and the State from potential fraudulent activities;
§ Provide oversight of the health plan Grievances and Appeals Program; and
§ Understand and focus on high-risk areas that have the greatest potential for non-compliance with federal
and state regulatory and contractual requirements.
Further, the program aims to implement a working communication strategy to increase the CountyCare workforce
awareness, including vendors and subcontractors, of the following topics:
§ Code of Ethics;
§ Privacy, Confidentiality, and Security;
§ Accessibility of the Compliance Officer and Program;
§ Availability through multiple modalities;
§ Responsibility to report potential/actual issues;
§ Consequences of not reporting; and
§ Non-retaliation.
The following types of activities and issues fall into the CountyCare Compliance Program purview:
§ Accurate Books and Records
§ Anti-kickback Activities
§ Conflict of Interest
§ False Claims
§ Financial Integrity
§ Fraud, Waste and Abuse
§ Grievances and Appeals (Members and Providers)
§ Member Privacy, Confidentiality, and Security (HIPAA)
§ Interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations and organizational policy as they relate to health plan
Compliance
The CountyCare Compliance Program scope of work is subject to ongoing review and revision as deemed necessary
to ensure compliance. It is designed to accommodate future changes in regulations and laws and may be updated to
address issues not currently covered, issues related to new service offerings, or regulatory requirements.
III. Compliance Program Structure: Our Performance of the Elements
This section of the report serves to demonstrate the effectiveness and provide an assessment of program operations
using the seven (7) Compliance Program Elements of a comprehensive compliance program, as outlined in the CMS
Managed Care Program Integrity requirements3 and by contractual provisions in the MCCN Agreement.

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
CountyCare Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – July 2014 through June 2015
Element 1
The distribution of written Code of Ethics, as well as written policies and procedures that promote the health plan’s
commitment to compliance (e.g., by including adherence to compliance as an element in evaluating managers and
employees) and that address specific areas of potential fraud, waste and abuse. The CCHHS Code of Ethics applies
to all CountyCare personnel, providers, agents and subcontractors. The Code of Ethics, as well as CCHHS’ policies
and procedures, support CountyCare’s commitment to comply with all federal and state standards, including but not
limited to, applicable statutes, regulations and sub-regulatory guidance and contractual requirements.
A. Policies and Procedures
1. Developed an action plan to incorporate contractual language from the MCCN Agreement, IlliniCare’s
Third Party Administrator (TPA) agreement, and integrated governmental Managed Care Program
Integrity requirements, with the recommended elements of an effective compliance program. This
includes the oversight of the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse and the Grievances and Appeals programs.
2. Developed the CountyCare Compliance Plan that focuses exclusively on outlining the compliance
responsibilities of the health plan and the program design for implementation, as well as specific
CountyCare compliance policies for high risk areas focused on health plan operations.
3. Ensured that CountyCare personnel, providers, agents and subcontractors have access to compliance
documentation electronically and are provided with hard copies of compliance policies and procedures,
upon request.
4. Worked with operational areas to assess compliance with procedures and/or regulatory requirements
and, in certain instances, assisted in the development of new policies.
5. Where needed, obtained copies of compliance related policies and procedures from the CountyCare
TPA and the various delegated vendors providing services for CountyCare.
Examples of the specific policy and procedure activity follow:
§

Fraud, Waste and Abuse Policy
Partnered with the TPA, and its delegated vendors, to develop a robust Fraud, Waste and Abuse
(FWA) program policy, including methods to identify, prevent, review and take corrective action
against any provider or member who is suspected of participating in FWA activities.

§

Grievances and Appeals
Developed and finalized a comprehensive Grievance and Appeal Process for both Members and
Providers.

§

Conflict of Interest
Cross-referenced and amended the existing CCHHS Conflict of Interest policy to include
requirements specific to the MCCN Agreement with HFS.

§

Quality of Care Policies
Collaborated with operations and the TPA to review and edit the Quality of Care policies to ensure
that quality of care issues raised are routed through appropriate channels and addressed and
mitigated thoroughly.

B. Ad Hoc Activities/Guidance
   
In addition to policy and procedure activity, Corporate Compliance worked with operational areas to
assess compliance with procedures and/or regulatory requirements and, in certain instances, assisted
in the development of new policies.

Categories have been defined to allow CountyCare Compliance to most accurately measure general
compliance inquiries and issues. The inclusion of an issue in a specific category does not substantiate
the issue; rather it classifies the issue within a defined category. The issues addressed within the first
year of CountyCare as a MCCN fall into the following categories:
§ Accurate Books and Records
§ Conflict of Interest
§ Healthcare Fraud, Waste, and Abuse
§ HIPAA Privacy, Confidentiality and Security
§ Research Capacity and Capabilities

F. Enforcing Standards
Broadened the scope of Standards enforcement through:
1. Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Reviewing investigations initiated by the TPA’s Special Investigation Unit
(SIU) from referrals and data analytic software which identify providers with aberrant billing patterns.
Once identified, Compliance monitors the investigation and ensures that appropriate action is taken,
including reporting of suspected FWA to the State HFS OIG.
2. Breach Assessments. Reviewed investigations and provided remediation guidance to operational
areas to minimize and/or eliminate breaches in the future and, utilized the CCHHS sanction policy and
Personnel Rules, to provide leadership direction for disciplinary action.
3. Breach Notification. Responsible for the investigation of all instances of lost or stolen member
information, including paper and electronic. For all instances in which the data loss constitutes a
breach as defined by the Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information; Interim Final
Rule, the breach notification requirements to the patient, the Secretary of HHS, and the media are
completed. Corrective action plans are created and executed to improve the processes and counsel
the physicians and employees involved.
4. Investigations Resulting in Employee Related Corrective Actions. HIPAA and Conflict of Interest
complaints were investigated and resulted in employee guidance being provided.
5. Partnerships with Governmental Agencies. Corporate Compliance has partnered with the
Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Illinois’
Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).
Element 6
The use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist in the reduction of identified
problem area.
G. Auditing and Monitoring
   
An integral part of a FWA program is auditing and monitoring. This year CountyCare has developed a
strong partnership with the TPA’s Special Investigation Unit (SIU). The use of data analytic software to
identify anomalies and aberrant billing patterns is vital to the FWA and Compliance Program. Partnerships
with the State’s HFS OIG and MFCU enhance the program.
Additionally, the Compliance program conducts a variety of reviews to ensure adequate oversight of
operations performed by delegated vendors and MCCN contract compliance.
H. Risk Assessment
   
The program will continue to conduct risk assessment activities to identify outstanding risks and challenges
to meeting the standards of an effective compliance program. Risks identified through these activities are
minimized through the introduction and enforcement of policies and standards, monitoring and auditing,
education, and issue investigations with corrective action plans as appropriate.

CountyCare Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – July 2014 through June 2015
The course of activities in the past year have led to the identification of specific risks. Some of these risks
may affect our members. The following risks were identified for further assessment:
§ Vendor Compliance with Sanction Screening and Conflict of Interest MCCN Agreement
requirements
§ Disclosure and sharing of member sensitive health information
Element 7
The investigation and remediation of identified systemic problems and the development of policies addressing the
non-employment or retention of sanctioned individuals.
I.

Identification of Systemic Issues
Sanction Screening Checks
§ Addressed regulatory requirements to avoid employing, engaging, contracting or agreeing with any
individual or entity that is excluded or “sanctioned” from participation in a federal or state health care
program or who is debarred from participation in federal procurement or non-procurement programs for
the provision of goods or services.
Oversight
§ Developed processes to address contractual requirements and best practices for oversight of the
CountyCare Compliance Program.

IV. Looking Ahead
With an initial program foundation established, the CountyCare Compliance Program will focus on maintaining
adherence to contractual requirements and industry best practices as the program matures. As CountyCare
transitions to a new TPA, this adherence is critical to avoid sanctions that may result in monetary penalties. The
Program will continue ongoing activities related to risk reduction in the areas of compliance, policy implementation,
and the development and implementation of monitoring and auditing efforts.
Priorities for the Compliance Program:
§ Mature the CountyCare Compliance Program and incorporate best practices.
§ Maintain adherence to contractual requirements and industry best practices as CountyCare transitions to a
new TPA.
§ Continue to partner with operations and the TPA to fulfill contractual obligations relating to state required
reporting.
§ Establish a Policy Committee to ensure that health plan policies are developed, reviewed and updated, as
necessary to, promote compliance.
§ Strengthen Health Plan oversight in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, focusing
§ on vendor oversight.
‒ Ongoing partnerships with the HFS OIG and the State’s MFCU to develop best practices in
Corporate Compliance for CountyCare.
§ Improve education and training relating to the Grievances and Appeals process, collaborate with network
providers to increase the effectiveness of the grievance resolution process, and increase monitoring efforts
for all delegated vendors.
§ Continue to investigate all issues/complaints brought to the attention of the Program.
§ Continue to serve as a resource to our workforce and delegated vendors.
§ Strengthen CountyCare Compliance Program recognition from local to a national presence
