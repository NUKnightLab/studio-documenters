The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1. 1060 W. Addison
44th Ward
Wrigley Field
Proposed new concession stands: 4 portable and 2 permanent, located in the outfield
bleachers.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

1. Our current understanding is that the proposed portable concession stands are
moveable and do not require a building permit. However, to minimize their
visibility and reduce visual clutter at the upper bleacher decks (Platform
level), the portable stands should be stationed under existing signs. If, at some
point, any portable concession stands affecting the Protected Features of the
ballpark are modified to become permanent stands and/or do require a
building permit, their location and design shall be reviewed for approval by
the Permit Review Committee;
2. As proposed, the steel framing for the permanent concession stands located at
the main bleacher deck facing Waveland and Sheffield shall be painted
Wrigley Field green and the wood panels shall be painted with a whitewash
finish. Material samples shall be reviewed for approval by Historic
Preservation staff; and,
3. All conditions of approval from previous Commission reviews of the overall
master project will continue to be applicable.
2. 320-330 E. Cermak/2131 S. Calumet
3rd Ward
American Book Company Building
Continued Review: final design for exterior renovation of the 5-story masonry
building for use as hotel and office spaces on upper floors and commercial retail

 spaces on first floor with a new 4-story metal-and-glass link connection to hotel
complex at west facade.
Action:

Approved unanimously (Commissioner Wong recused) with the following
conditions:

1. The ABC Building’s masonry repair scope of work, as outlined by the Klein
and Hoffman report dated 4/28/15 is approved with repair/replacement details,
cleaning specifications, and approximate replacement unit quantities to be
included in the permit plans. As proposed, existing masonry units shall be
salvaged wherever possible for reinstallation. The repair/replacement
samples, including the proposed GFRC to match the terra cotta units, any new
brick, and new mortar shall be reviewed for approval by Historic Preservation
staff prior to order and installation;
2. Enlarged details of the new windows and doors for the ABC Building shall be
included in the permit plans. The new windows at the first-floor arched
openings and the new entrance doors shall match the historic configuration
based on historic documentation or any physical evidence uncovered;
3. The proposed infill masonry portions of the north wall shall be integral
colored or stained/coated to match the color of common brick; and,
4. The final design of the new hotel link portion of the overall project, and its
connection to the west elevation of the ABC Building as shown on plans dated
5/13/15 is approved as proposed. Enlarged details of the service access
garage door and the connections between the elevator enclosure and the west
façade of ABC Building shall be included in the permit plans with the
connections detailed to limit damage to the masonry façade. Material
samples, including the metal panel proposed to match the grey color of the
ABC Building granite base and the glazing proposed to be more grey than
blue tint, shall be reviewed for approval by Historic Preservation staff prior to
order and installation.
3. 539 W. Belden
43rd Ward
