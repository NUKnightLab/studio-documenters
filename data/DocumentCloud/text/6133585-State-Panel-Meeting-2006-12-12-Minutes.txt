BOARD ACTIONS (resumed)
2.
S-CA-05-155
Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council/Village of Calumet Park

General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that the issues presented were
whether Respondent Employer threatened an employee with retaliation for engaging in union activities,
thus violating Section 10(a)(1) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act), and whether Respondent
Employer suspended an employee in retaliation for engaging in union activity, thus violating Section
10(a)(2) of the Act. General Counsel Zimmerman noted that the ALJ determined that Respondent
Employer violated Section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Act, and she recommended that the Board uphold the

 S-CA-05-155/Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council/Village of Calumet Park (Continued)
ALJ's determination. Member Hade moved to accept the General Counsel's recommendation. Member
Piper seconded the motion, and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
3.
S-RC-05-079
Village of South Elgin/Metropolitan Alliance of Police, South Elgin Sgts Chapter No. 205
General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that therein, the ALJ determined
that the petitioned-for police sergeants employed by the Village are supervisory employees within the
meaning of the Act. The General Counsel recommended that the Board find the record evidence
insufficient to support that outcome, and instead, direct the certification of the petitioned-for unit.
Member Piper moved to accept the General Counsel's recommendation. Member Coli seconded the
motion, and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice vote.
4.
S-CA-05-098
Service Employees International Union, Local 73/Illinois Secretary of State
General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that no party filed exceptions to the
ALJ's RDO, and asked whether the Board wished to review the decision on its own motion. The Board
declined to do so.
5.
S-RC-07-007
Plainfield Fire Protection District/Plainfield Firefighters, IAFF/Metropolitan Alliance of
Firefighters
General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that the issue presented was
whether a certification issued pursuant to a unit clarification petition may bar a later filed representation
petition, seeking the employees that were the subject of the earlier petition. The General Counsel further
noted that the ALJ had dismissed the instant petition, concluding the earlier petition was indeed a bar, and
recommended that the Board uphold the ALJ's determination. Member Piper moved to accept the
General Counsel's recommendation. Member Coli seconded the motion, and the Board passed it
unanimously, by a voice vote.
6.
S-CA-06-181
Jerry Seeling/City of Des Plaines
General Counsel Zimmerman began by summarizing the case, noting that the Executive Director issued a
Dismissal on November 3, 2006, with an appeal filed. The General Counsel recommended that the Board
uphold the dismissal, as the charge was untimely. Member Coli moved to accept the General Counsel's
recommendation. Member Piper seconded the motion, and the Board passed it unanimously, by a voice
vote.
VII.
