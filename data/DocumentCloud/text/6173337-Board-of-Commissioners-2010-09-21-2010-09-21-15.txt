 GENERAL BACKGROUND
In September 2008, the CHA Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorized the CHA to enter
into a one year contract with E&ES to provide Good Neighbor workshops for residents currently
living in CHA developments and mixed-income communities, as well as former 10/1/99 CHA
residents who have temporarily relocated to the private market with a Housing Choice Voucher.
The Contact provided for an initial term of October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009, with
two (2) one-year option periods. In September 2009, the Board authorized the first one-year
option that extended the Contract through September 30, 2010. During the term of their contract,
E&ES has performed all its contractual obligations.
The Contract’s primary focus is to conduct workshops for CHA residents moving into family
housing, scattered sites or mixed-income properties, which will provide residents with the
necessary tools to maintain their household, their finances and foster positive and lasting
relationships within their communities. Participants will learn about social services and
resources in the community. Upon the completion of a workshop, each participant sets an
individualized goal to focus on one or more skills learned during the training. As needed,
participants may also receive a follow-up in-home visit to receive one-on-one hands-on
reinforcement of the skills learned in the workshop(s). E&ES provides the participant’s case
management provider with copies of every goal set by participants to encourage individual
follow through.
Based upon E&ES’s performance on the contract, CHA desires to exercise the second option
year of the Contract through September 30, 2011. The requested funding will allow E&ES to
continue to provide the current series of three workshops (Home Management and Maintenance,
Financial Literacy, and Community Building), as well as enhance these workshops and create
new workshops as needed. E&ES staff is dedicated to creating a continuum of workshops that
will continue to provide residents with information about maintaining their households and
available community resources and services.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee, to exercise the second option year of Contract No. 8065 with E&ES to
Good Neighbor services for the period of October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011, and to
increase the funding in an amount not-to-exceed $400,000. The Contract’s new total not-toexceed compensation amount will be $1,000,000.
