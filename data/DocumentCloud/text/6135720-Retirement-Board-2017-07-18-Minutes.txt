ADMINISTRATIVE REPORT
Updated 2018 Funding Resolution
Mr. Walsh reported that he, at the request of the Board, contacted Alexandra Holt, the City of Chicago’s now former
Budget Director, and Samantha Fields, the City’s now current Budget Director, to discuss the rationale behind the
LABF’s funding resolution adopted at the June 20, 2017 Board meeting prior to transmitting the associated funding
request to the City. Mr. Walsh reminded the Board that based on the conversations he had with Mses. Holt and Fields,
and due to the introduction of the ordinance seeking to amend the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago to authorize
the City to make additional employer contributions, he informed the Board via email following the June Board meeting
that he would temporarily refrain from sending the funding request and suggested the Board further discuss the matter
at its July 18, 2017 meeting. Additionally, on July 6, 2017, Public Act 100-0023 became law and altered the City of
Chicago’s statutory funding requirement, which required that the LABF’s funding resolution be revised.
Mr. Walsh reviewed two separate revised drafts of the 2018 Funding Resolution. The Board discussed what should
be included in the funding request. The Board then requested additional time to look into the matter further.
It was moved by Trustee Capasso, seconded by Trustee Joiner, to retract the motion to approve the 2018 Funding
Resolution that was approved at the June 20, 2017 Board meeting.
Roll-call:

For-- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Hamburger Capasso, Brown and Joiner.
Against -- None.

2017 Annuitant Member Election
Mr. Walsh reviewed a tentative election timeline and a draft of the 2017 Annuitant Member Election Rules. The
Trustees chose Trustees Roa, Hamburger and Joiner to serve as the members of the Election Committee for the
upcoming election.

July 18, 2017

It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Hamburger, to accept the 2017 Annuitant Member Election
Rules as presented in the meeting. See attached document.
Roll-call:

For-- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Hamburger Capasso, Brown and Joiner.
Against -- None.

Definition of Employer
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Donham discussed a memo prepared by Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP (“Taft”) reviewing the
definition of “Employer” under Article 11 of the Pension Code. Mr. Donham reviewed the entities that Taft believes
are “Employers” under Article 11.
It was moved by Trustee LoVerde, seconded by Trustee Hamburger, to accept Fund Counsel’s recommendation of
the definition of “Employer” as outlined in the memo reviewed in the meeting.
Roll-call:

For-- Trustees Roa, Keane, LoVerde, Summers, Hamburger Capasso, Brown and Joiner.
Against -- None.

Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh discussed the administrative challenges that the Fund faces as a result of Public Act 100-0023 becoming
law, of which he highlighted the following:
• An irrevocable election regarding new benefits will need to be made by certain members, however, LABF will
need to first address some inconsistencies in the law and more carefully determine the affected member
population. The Trustees acknowledged that the communication of the changes in law to the affected members
will require a high level of coordination between LABF and the City of Chicago. The Trustees gave staff direction
to create some administrative rules for review at the next meeting related to how the Fund will implement the various
changes required under the law.
• LABF may receive inquiries from members regarding the irrevocable election. The Trustees requested that staff
take a cautious approach so as to not give investment advice or legal advice as part of any communications to
or with members affected by the new law.
• Employee contributions will need to be changed as part of the new legislation for certain affected members. Mr.
Walsh mentioned that LABF would begin working with the City of Chicago to implement the required changes.
• The Fund will engage its outside software developer to begin making the necessary modification to the pension
administration system in order to administer PA 100-0023.
• There are several problems with PA 100-0023 with respect to treatment of reciprocal fund service. The Trustees
agreed that the staff should work with the Speaker’s Office on the trailer bill to address some of the ambiguities
in the new law.
Mr. Walsh and the Trustees agreed that this item should be more fully addressed in the August 22, 2017 Board meeting.
Disability Service Rule
This item was deferred to the August 22, 2017 Board meeting.
Fraud Matter
Mr. Walsh reviewed the status of the previously discussed fraud matter and the Trustees gave Mr. Walsh the authority
to move forward with criminal prosecution of the perpetrator(s) on the Fund’s behalf if the investigation leads in that
direction.

The first portion of the legal topics were conducted in executive session.

MEMORANDUM

July 17, 2017

TO: The Honorable Members of the Board of Trustees
Laborers? Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago

FR: Robert S. Molaro Associates

Spring?eld Update

After 2 1/2 years of political impasse, and two weeks of brinksmanship during a Special Legislative

Session, June 21 to July 6, the State of Illinois finally has a budget.

Between Saturday, July 2, and Thursday, July 6, the three?bill fiscal package was in quick succession
approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, vetoed by Gov. Rauner and then, in

turn, his vetoes were overridden by both Chambers, culminating in a final vote in the House.
The legislation enacted includes:

0 Senate Bill 9, House Floor Amendment 3/Publie Act 100-0022 - A $5 billion income tax
increase, which raises the rate form 3.75 to 4.95 percent on personal income and from 5.25 to
7 percent on corporations. However, a proposed expansion of the state sales tax to several
services was dropped from the final legislation;

0 Senate Bill 6, House Floor Amendments 2, 3 and 4/Public Act 100-0021 - A $36.1 billion
FY 2018 budget.

0 Senate Bill 42, House Floor Amendment l/Public Act 100-0023 A Budget
Implementation Bill, or BIMP bill;

The FY 2018 spending plan detailed in SB 6 is approximately $3 billion less than the $39 billion state
spent in FY 2017 through a mixture of court ordered spending, such as the mandate to pay state
salaries, and targeted appropriations, such as for education and transportation projects. The new
budget includes a 5 percent across the board cut for state agencies, and a 10 percent slash for higher

education.

SB 42 includes provisions to deal with state?s $15 billion bill backlog, including issuing $3 billion in
bonds and borrowing and/or sweeping another $3 billion from various dedicated state funds. In
addition, paying down the state?s Medicaid budget backlog would generate another $2 billion in
matching funds from the Federal government. It is anticipated $8 billion of the $15 billion arrearage
could be eliminated through this plan. SB42 also included the new funding language for the Chicago
Municipal and Laborers? Pension Funds (which was previously contained 11 SB14). SB 42 is now in

effect.

Fifteen House Republicans joined 57 Democrats in support of the SB 9, the tax increase bill, in the
initial vote. In the subsequent override, 10 Republicans and 61 Democrats provided the votes to push
the total to 71, or 60 percent of members, the minimum number required to enact the bill into law.
Many of the GOP legislators represent districts with public universities and other state facilities that
have been negatively impacted by the ongoing budget impasse. In the Senate, the vote was less bi?
partisan, with only one Republican joining 35 Democrats in passing/overriding the veto of the

revenue bill.

SB 9 passed by a larger bipartisan margin in the override vote, 74-37 in the House, and 39-15
in the Senate, while SB 42 was overridden with the minimum of 71 votes in the House and 36 in the

Senate.

SB 181 1, which contained the 911 surcharge that the City of Chicago indicated would help to finance
the Labors? Pension Fund, was passed by the Senate and the House. The Governor vetoed SB1811
on July 1, however, both Chambers voted favorably to override the Governor?s veto the same day. SB

1811 is now Public Act 100-0020.

Please be aware that SB 1 which contains the new funding formula for public schools, thru 12, has
passed both Houses. This bill needs to be signed into law for the schools to receive state funding for

FY 2018.

14. Spoiled Ballot. If a ballot is damaged by a voter, a replacement ballot may be requested from an
Election Judge. The original ballot will be deemed spoiled and invalidated. It will not be counted.

VOTING
15. Eligibility. Per 40 ILCS 11-182(b), all persons who are receiving a retirement (age and service or
prior service) annuity from the LABF at the time the election is held are eligible to vote.

6:00 p.m. The polls shall close for the receipt of such ballots promptly at 6:00 p.m., except for the
receipt of ballots as may be cast by persons who shall be in the building at such hour for the purpose
of casting such ballots.
17. Procedure. Participants requesting a ballot must identify themselves at the voter identification
check-in station by means of a valid driver's license, a valid State ID, or a valid Passport. Any form
of identification that is expired is not considered valid and shall not be accepted.

Eligible voters may cast one vote in the following manner: (1) select only one candidate on the
ballot, (2) insert the completed ballot into the locked ballot box.
Only votes cast on an official 2017 LABF Ballot will be counted.
18. Provisional Ballots. At times, questions may arise regarding who is or is not eligible to vote in an
Annuitant Member Election at the LABF. When eligibility is unclear, these individuals may receive
Rev. 7/28/2017

 a “Provisional Ballot.” The following are the rules and procedures established for individuals who
will be casting votes via a Provisional Ballot:
a. To cast a Provisional Ballot, a valid driver’s license, State ID, or Passport must be
presented to an Election Judge.
b. Provisional Ballots are sealed in an envelope bearing the voter’s name, address and the
last 4 digits of the voter’s Social Security Number as provided by the voter.
c.

Provisional Ballot envelopes are deposited into the locked election box with all regular
ballots.

d. After voting has ended, only Regular Ballots will be removed from the ballot box and
counted. The ballot box, still containing the Provisional Ballots, will be relocked.
e. In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates
is greater than the number of total Provisional Ballots cast, no Provisional Ballots will be
opened, and the candidate receiving the most votes will be declared the winner.
f.

In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates
is less than or equal to the number of total Provisional Ballots cast, all Provisional Ballot
Envelopes will be removed from the ballot box and separated into the following three (3)
categories by the Election Judges:
i. “Denied,” defined as ballots cast by individuals confirmed to be ineligible to vote.
ii. “Approved,” defined as ballots cast by individuals confirmed to be eligible to vote.
iii. “Undetermined,” defined as ballots cast by individuals for whom eligibility could not
be determined before closing of the polls.

g. The Election Committee will verify that all Provisional Ballots are classified correctly.
h. Provisional Ballots deemed “Denied” will be set aside. They will not be opened.
i.

In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates
is less than or equal to the number of remaining Provisional Ballots (“Approved” and
“Undetermined”), the “Approved” Provisional Ballots will be separated from their envelopes
(as to protect the anonymity of the voting member) and re-deposited into the locked ballot
box.

j.

Approved Provisional Ballots may only be opened by an Election Judge in the presence of
at least one other Election Judge and at least one member of the Election Committee.
Election Watchers may also be present.

k.

Once all Approved Provisional Ballots have been separated from their envelopes and
returned to the ballot box, the ballot counting process will proceed in the same manner as
with the regular ballots.

l.

In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates
is greater than the number of total “Undetermined” Provisional Ballots cast, no
“Undetermined” Provisional Ballots will be opened, and the candidate receiving the most
votes will be declared the winner.

m. In the event that the number of votes separating the leading and second place candidates
is less than or equal to the number of total “Undetermined” Provisional Ballots cast,
