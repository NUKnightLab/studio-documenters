Chairman Carvalho inquired whether proposed reductions to the System?s 2009 budget would be considered the

Questions concerning new Northwestern-Stroger OB-GYN
agreement 2tzotos

(1) How many GIG-residents do we have at Stroger now? Their source
Rush, others)?

We currentiy have 15 Stroger residents. For the past 10 years we have
had 20+ until this last year. A number of residents have left the program with the
recent accreditation dih?iculties. We have agreed with the ACGME that our OB-
GYN program will have a maximum of no more than 16 of our own residents
starting this academic year.

We have no other residents rotating horn other hospitals. We have
never had Rush residents in (or for at least 15 years). We have solicited
resident rotations lirom other hospitals including Rirsh, and Mt Sinai. Only
has showed interested in a very limited rotation for surgical experience.

(2) How many births do we do?

For the last three years, births have been trending down. in 2000, there were
about 1000 births, in 2007, 971. in 2008, there were 903 births. A high proportion
of these are high complexity, complicated deliveries, followed by our Maternal-
fetal medicine specialists and often referred ti'om our perinatal network. Our
prenatal clinics have been much busier but many of the pregnant women
followed here for prenatal care do not deliver here. Therefore, ?normal deliveries"
have decreased more than complex births.

What other volume measures of services (other than births} do we
have? -
There are multiple measures of OB-GYN services, the most important being 
latest yearly totals):

- Gynecologic surgery cases about 75? operations

- Outpatient Gyne clinic visits 9307 visits

. Family planning visits -- about 4000

0 Pregnancy termination services about 4000 visits
. Gyne visits about 2500

- OB outpatient visits 6630 visits

(4) How many residents will NW add? Will the Rush residents continue
and at what number? Do we have any other resident programs with 
Will any of our staff he securing academic appointments at Do any
have them now?

The plan is initially for 0.4 FTE residents tram Northwestern rotating on Stroger's
colposcopy service until July 2009. Starting 7709, 4 FTE NWresidents would
rotate here. Many would be senior residents who would be providing general
coverage. One (FTE) of our own residents would rotate on the OB service at
North western.

13

Starting 7/10, up to 8 TE would rotate here, depending on hiture plans to either
rotate more of our residents at Northwestern and/or further decrease the size of
our program.

There are no Rush residents here in OB-GYN. in tact, Rush has recently started
rotating their OB-GYN residents at Mt Sinai. in part, this is due to the fact that
both our Stroger residents and Rush residents are in need of more 05
experience. in return, Flush offers the Mt Sinai residents some advantages over
Stroger hospital for the gynecologic/laparoscopic experience that Mt Sinai?s
program needs. (Stroger is hiring a laparoscopic Gynecologist who will expand
the availability of the technique at SH.)

We currently have two programs with Northwestern. One is in EN T, the other in
OrthOpedics. We also have agreements with both UK) and Rush in Orthopedics
and with Rush in EN T. in all of these cases, medical center residents rotate here
as we do not have our own programs in those specialties.

One of our Attendings has a long-standing academic appointment at
Northwestern dating h'om when he worked at one of their ah?iliates. Several
Attendings have academic appointments at Rush. Others have appointments at
Chicago Medical School. Most have no current medical school faculty
appointments. Several Attendings who will be most closely involVed in
supervising Northwestern residents will be encouraged to obtain Northwestern
faculty appointments (as necessary to meet AOGME requirements).

Several of the Stroger EN faculty have Northwestern appointments. A few other
Attendings do, as well.

How many attendings do we have in 

We currently have 20 faculty in OhGyn, down from 25 two years ago. There is
one vacant position that we are attempting to tilt. We have contract services for
two FTE physicians in Maternal? fetal medicine. One of these FTEs is tilted by a
Rush faculty group. 

6) How have all the above items trended over the past few years? What
do we anticipate over the next 3 years?
The deliveries here have decreased in part due to demographics and in part due
to our neighboring hospitals successful efforts to attract these Medicaid- eligible
pregnant women. Outpatient clinic numbers have held steady with very recent
decreases. The wait for outpatient visits and for gyne surgery has increased
dramatically. This is because of the decrease in the of attendings and residents
in the last 2 years. There are nearly 1000 women on the waiting list for
gynecology appointments.
The trends over the next three years will almost certainly show increases in
demand for gynecologic appointments and surgery. Many of these women are
uninsured. The future trends in deliveries are hotly debated. The number of
deliveries here may decrease more if we do not make a major effort to attract the
Medicaid?eligible pregnant women. On the other hand, the demand for highly
complex perinatal care will stay the same or increase as many smaller hospitals
- are reluctant to care for these high-risk deliveries.

14

(7) What is the status of the accreditation issue regarding the (MG
program?

The ACGME recommended closure of the program a year ago. We were-able to
reverse that and we now have Fuii accreditation but with a very short review
cycle. The ACGME wiil return in summer of 2010. We must make more progress
in meeting the existing citations if we are to continue our program. Neariy all of
the citations have to do with inadequate numbers of procedures for our
graduating residents. The citations are in obstetrics, especialiy Caesarian
Sections, and in certain highly technicafiaparoscopic gynecoiogic procedures.
We cannot meet the required numbers of procedures through our residents?
experiences at Stroger Hospitain or Provident Hospitai. Northwestern is the best
situated to provide our residents with these experiences. it also provides a
simulation tab and other experiences unique in the city. Mt Sinai has the
necessary volume of deliveries (it?s about #3 of Northwesterns?) but it does not
provide the experiences needed in laparoscopic'and uro-gynecologic surgery.
On the other hand, at Stroger, many Operative gynecologic and outpatient
gynecoiogic procedures are here in abundance. These are precisely the needs of
the Northwestern residents.

(8) Are we still paying attendings (er residents) additional

compensation to attend to births? (Do attendings attend to births)?
Attendings are no ionger compensated at nights for attending to births. This was
stopped 2 years ago. However, now the overnight in-house Obstetric Attending
cat! is counted toward the weeldy total of 40?50 hours per week. This has led to
decreased numbers ofAttendings present in the clinic and the resultant
increased waits for appointments. Attendings are expected to be present at all
births. OB-GYN residents receive no additional compensation.

Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date ?nancial

results ?nishedthe Twelfth month of the ?scal year behind budget by
38.7%. The poorer than planned ?nancial performance was due to
lower Patient Service Revenue, IGT Revenue, and Non?Operating
Revenue. The overall revenue shortfall at the end of the Twelfth
month was $56,493,065. Expenses were also below budget by
$29,084,978. The favorable level of expenses was not enough to
offset the shortfall in revenue.

Operating Revenue

Fees at the end of November collected from patient services were
below budget year to date by $31,894,009 or 10.3%. The largest
source of unfavorable patient service revenue is from the shortfall of
Medicaid patient fees.

The Intergovernmental Transfer Revenue was below budget year to
date by $11,332,125 or This is due to the phase out of the 

Upper Limit program.

Other Revenue at the end of November is in excess of the budget by
$2,706,692 or 47.9%. 

Total Operating Revenue at the end of the ?scal year was below
budget year to date by $40,519,442 or 

Operating Expenses

Operating Expenses at the end of November were below budget by
$29,084.978 or This favorable expense performance was due
to positive variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities.
Salaries and Employee Bene?ts were over the budget by relatively
small amounts year to date.

19

Salaries and Wages ($10,768,989 or 

Salaries and wages continue to exceed the budget at the end of
November. The use of overtime and replacement time for the
holidays contributed to this unfavorable variance. Overtime is being
monitored by the System management and is used to ?ll staf?ng -
needs. There are a large number of staff positions that remain
un?lled and these vacancies create the need to use overtime.

Bene?ts - ($1,927,649 or 

The level of Bene?t expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Bene?ts for employees are over budget because salaries and
wages are also in excess of budget.

Supplies $9,595,843 or 6.5%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget
