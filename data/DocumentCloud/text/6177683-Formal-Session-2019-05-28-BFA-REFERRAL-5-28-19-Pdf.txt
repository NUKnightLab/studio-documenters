DATE: May 22, 2019

RE: Report on Gaming Tax Revenue through April 2019

For Council?s review, the attached schedules present the gaming tax revenue activity through
April 2019 and prior ?scal years.

Through the tenth month of the ?scal year the casinos reported a combined gross gaming
receipts increase of 3.24% compared to the same period in the prior ?scal year. Broken out by
casino, gross receipts are up by 4.66%, Motor City?s are up by 1.20% and Greektown?s
are up by 3.67%, compared with the ?rst ten months of the prior ?scal year.

In the tenth month of the ?scal year, the City collected $14.88 million in gaming tax revenue,
which was 0.85% greater than April 2018, as re?ected in Chart 1. Chart 2 Detroit
Gaming Tax Collections? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows an increase
of 3.15% since last April among the combined casino tax revenues. Based on existing data, there
is projected to be a surplus of $3.14 million compared to budget for the ?scal year for a gaming
revenue total of $183.92 million, a 2.76% increase over last year.

Adjusted gross casino gaming receipts were reported at $125.07 million for the month of April
2019 as shown in Chart 1A. This represented a 0.85% gain compared with April 2018. Chart
2A Detroit Gaming Receipts? through a twelve-month moving average trend line
shows growth of 3.12% among the combined casino receipts.

doc

MGM and Motor City are each paying 12.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the City,
while Greektown Casino is paying 11.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts and is broken out as
follows. By state law, all casinos are now paying 10.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the
City as wagering tax. The casinos also have an additional 1% payment because of the 2002
amended development agreement with the City. Additionally, if a casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year, like MGM and Motor City, then an additional
1% is paid to the City per the amended development agreement of 2002.

There is not a complete one?to?one relationship between the adjusted gross receipts and the tax
revenue collection increases when comparing prior years, due to two factors. First, there is the
fact that MGM and Motor City casinos began paying the City 1% less due to the permanent
casinos opening on October 3 and November 29 of 2007. This reduction to the City is part of
state Public Act 306 of 2004, when the legislature amended Public Act 69 of 1997, which was
the original casino gaming legislation. P.A. 306 increased the wagering tax by 6% of which 2%
went to the City of Detroit. PA. 306 also allowed that when the permanent casino had been
certi?ed by the state gaming board as having operated for 30 consecutive days and once the City
determined the project was complete, 5% of the 6% additional wagering tax would be
eliminated, with the remaining 1% allocated to the City where the casino is being operated.
Greektown continued to pay the 6% additional wagering tax 4% to the state, 2% to the City 
until its permanent status was agreed to by the Administration and approved by the State Gaming
Commission, which occurred on March 9, 2010.

Second, the amended development agreement of August 2002 between the City and the casinos,
which is separate from the state law, has all casinos, beginning in January 2006, paying an
additional 1% over the state law, plus another 1% when the casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year. For the thirteenth year, MGM and Motor City
each did exceed $400 million in the calendar year and increased gaming tax collections by
$11.09 million between August and December. MGM reached $400 million in August, a month
earlier than prior years, and Motor City reached $400 million in October similar to last year.
additional 1% totaled $6.19 million and Motor City?s totaled $4.89 million.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certi?cate Applications for one (1) rehabilitated
facility and one (1) new construction duplex home located at 2221 and 2225 Wabash
Avenue, respectively in the Corktown West Neighborhood Enterprise Zone area.
(RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

The of?ce of the City Flaming Commission (CPC) has received two (2) applications requesting
a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (N EZ) certi?cate forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk
for the rehabilitation of l) a single-family residential property and 2) the adding of an addition
resulting in the duplexing of the property located at 2221 Wabash Avenue. The new addition will
be identi?ed as 2225 Wabash Avenue. These applications correspond to a quali?ed site. The
project associated with 2221 Wabash Avenue consists of the rehabilitation of a 700 square foot
cottage with a 400 square foot addition at a cost of $246,116. The project associated with 2225
Wabash Avenue consists of the new construction of a two-unit duplex measuring approximately
11,000 square feet per unit at a cost of $250,000.

The subject properties have been con?rmed as being within the boundaries of the Corktown
West NEZ which was established by a vote of Council on November 18, 1999, and should be
eligible for NEZ certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently written. The NEZ
certi?cate applications appear to have been submitted prior to the issuance of any applicable
building permits.

Please contact our of?ce should you have any questions.

a In 2016, the Council developed a new system of review for the approval of
certain NEZ certi?cates:

LPD assisted in developing a system for which the Council applied a greaterlevel
of scrutiny at the NEZ Zone approval stage. The recent upswing in the use of NEZs
for the development of apartment buildings and condos downtown and in
?Downtown Revitalization Districts,? 1 instead of just neighborhood single family
residents, created a need for this review.

This Neighborhood Enterprise Zone was established in [?96 which is prior to the
development of a system of additional ?nancial review for NEZs in 2016, therefore there
is no additional ?scal review for this item.

0 In 2016, the Council developed a new system of review for the approval of
certain NEZ certificates:

LPD assisted in developing a system for which the Council applied a greaterlevel
of scrutiny at the NEZ Zone approval stage. The recent upswing in the use of NEZs
for the development of apartment buildings and condos downtown and in

?Downtown Revitalization Districts,

residents, created a need for this review.

instead of just neighborhood single family

This Neighborhood Enterprise Zone was established in 2 ?g which is prior to the
development of a system of additional ?nancial review for NEZS in 2016, therefore there
is no additional ?scal review for this item.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certi?cate Applications for two (2) newly
constructed condominium units located at 411 and 423 East Ferry Avenue in the
East Ferry Neighborhood Enterprise Zone area. (RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

One Tuesday, February 5, 2019 Your Honorable Body voted to approve the two aforementioned
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) applications based upon the recommendation of The City
Flaming Commission (CPC) staff. The of?ce of the CPC had received two (2) applications
requesting an NEZ certi?cate forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk for the construction of
new condominium units located at 411 and 423 East Ferry Avenue. These applications
correspond to a quali?ed site that will facilitate the new construction of two carriage house style
condominiums with attached garages. CPC staff had reviewed the applications and recommends
approval.

The subject properties have been con?rmed as being within the boundaries of the East Ferry
NEZ and should be eligible for NEZ certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently
written. The NEZ certi?cate applications appear to have been submitted within six months of the
development being issued building permits on June 15, 2018.

The State Tax Commission had received the developer?s NEZ exemption applications for 411
East Ferry and 423 East Ferry; citing that the ?les N2019-028 and N2019-029 were incomplete
and require the submission of additional information in order to continue processing the
applications.

The building permits submitting along with the applications show that the permits were issued on
June 15, 2018 and the applications were ?led with the City of Detroit Clerk?s of?ce on
November 26, 2018. MCL 207.774 states that the application must be ?led before a building
permit is issued or as otherwise provided by the local governmental unit by resolution if the
application is ?led not later than 6 months following the date the building permit is issued. This
provision within the NEZ statute states that an application can be ?led but not later than 6 
months following the date the building permit was issued if the local governmental unit has
speci?c language within the application approval resolution. The resolution adopted by the City
of Detroit did not contain language that approves the submission of the applications after the 
issuance of the building permit. 

In order to proceed the City of Detroit would have to approve the late submission and amend the .
resolution approving the application to include language accepting the applications being ?led no it
later than 6 month following the date the building permit was issued.
