PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
July 1, 2010

N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Eleanor Gorski, Assistant Commissioner
Dijana Cuvalo
Cynthia Roubik
Beth Johnson
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1401 N. Astor Street
(Astor Street District ‚Äì 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed modifications to existing rear garage addition including
alterations to the masonry window opening, new canopy, railing atop the
garage, and cladding changes and other alterations.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.

2.
3.

4.

The plans shall be revised to eliminate the proposed stone cladding
at the base of the west fa√ßade of the garage to be more compatible
with the character of the historic building;
The new metal canopy shall be of a simple design; dimensioned
drawings and details shall be included with the permit pla ns;
Should any new brick be required to complete the proposed work,
the new brick shall match existing brick of the garage in size,
color, and texture. Historic Preservation staff shall review a brick
sample prior to order and installation; and,
Information on the proposed new lighting fixture shall be included
with the permit application.

 2.

2325 N. Clark
(Reebie Storage Warehouse ‚Äì 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed interior tenant build-out for daycare center (designated interior
features).

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.
2.

3.

4.

3.

Attachment details of the new partitions and curtain rods shall be
submitted as part of the permit documents;
Details and additional information of the proposed modifications to
the north interior wall in order to meet building and fire code
requirements shall be provided;
The multi-colored Egyptian-themed plaster ornamentation which
appears to be the original colors shall not be repainted and shall be
protected. The ‚Äúfield‚Äù portion of the walls, ceiling, etc., currently

2045 W. Evergreen
(Wicker Park District ‚Äì 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Violation / Work done without permit: Proposed infill of original building
entrance opening with double-hung window and common-brick.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously to preliminarily find that the infill of
the original building entrance on the front fa√ßade without a permit did not
meet the Commission‚Äôs criteria, standards, and guidelines, and had an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district; and advised the applicant that the violation should be
remedied as follows:
1.

The two casement windows and wood-paneled knee walls
(resembling double-doors) shall be installed pursuant to permit
#100341167 or a comparable scheme to be reviewed and approved
by Historic Preservation staff. Any replacement window(s) or
door(s) should extend the full width of the opening from side-toside and from the sill to the underside of the historic lintel. The
design should be similar to a pair of double-doors, or a single-door
with a side- lite, consistent with the historic building entrances of
similar building types.

 Furthermore, the Committee voted unanimously to advise the applicant
that failure to remedy violations under the Chicago Building Code and
Landmarks Ordinance may incur fines assessed on a daily basis for the
period that the violations have existed.
4.

100-114 W. Germania Place
(Germania Club Building ‚Äì Proposed Landmark ‚Äì 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Continued Review: Proposed conceptual review and approval of the
following changes to identified exterior and interior significant historic
and architecture features and spaces of the building, depending upon
future tenant needs and uses:
1.
Insert new mezzanine floors within both the ballroom and the
dining room spaces. Construct a new ramp in the ballroom and
new stairs in the dining room.
Since the January 2010
presentation, the size of the mezzanine in the ballroom has been
reduced and the ‚Äòbridge‚Äô at the east end of the mezzanine has been
eliminated.
2.
Raise the roof to the top of the existing parapet to accommodate
new habitable space within the attic level; and new window
openings in the north and west elevations at the attic level.
3.
Create an accessible lobby at the first-floor east of the main
entrance stair, including a new elevator that would access all floors
of the building.
4.
Infill the existing north lightwell to create space for a new freight
elevator and mechanical equipment.
5.
Create an accessible lobby at the north of the Clark Street
elevation, to access a new elevator.
6.
Remove portions of walls in the three connecting rooms and the
enclosed porch on the mezzanine level (between the first and
second floors) and in the solarium on the second floor.

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that the proposed work meets, on a
conceptual basis, the Commission‚Äôs permit review standards and criteria
subject to further design development and review, and depending on the
ultimate design, dimensions, materials, details, and other information such
as programmatic and code issues that impact the proposed changes. The
Committee unanimously approved the project in concept, subject to the

adversely impacting the building (including during
construction);
The property owner has made ‚Äúcommercially
reasonable efforts‚Äù to market the space both with
and without the proposed inserted floors; and
‚ÄúCommercially reasonable efforts‚Äù have been made
to maintain the unobstructed visual openness and
character of the room as part of a new use for these
rooms, such as relative to any built- in fixtures or
other such changes.

(b) New elevator within the protected interior spaces on
existing mezzanine level (between first and second floors)
and in the second-floor solarium as it pertains solely to
location, dimensions and configuration, and provided that:
‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

‚Ä¢

As proposed, the elevator override and mechanical
room will not extend higher than the existing
parapet or otherwise affect the exterior appearance
of the building;
The insertion of the elevator will minimize any
impacts on historic features (e.g., ornamental
features, trim and molding, doors, etc.) within the
protected interior spaces; and
The property owner has made ‚Äúcommercially
reasonable efforts‚Äù to consider alternative locations
for the new elevator in the non-protected interior
spaces of the building.

habitable spaces, provided that:
‚Ä¢ As proposed, the new roof will not be higher
‚Ä¢ than the existing parapet or otherwise affect the
exterior appearance of the building;
‚Ä¢ As proposed, no major reconstruction of the
parapets will be necessary;
‚Ä¢ A structural analysis and code analysis both confirm
that the work can be done without adversely
impacting the building (including during
construction);
‚Ä¢ Any mechanical equipment and/or venting for the
new attic- level spaces can be accommodated
without adversely affecting the exterior appearance
of the building;
‚Ä¢ The domes will be protected as part of the new

 ‚Ä¢

attic-level use; and
Any skylights will not be visible, or only minimally
visible, from the public way.

Any rooftop mechanical equipment should be
located to minimize visibility from the public way
as much as possible, especially relative to the two
street elevations;

‚Ä¢ Any storefront changes beyond proposed new lobby
entrances;
‚Ä¢ Work to the protected interior spaces, such as new
