18-0627-RS4

If the Inspector General believes, in connection with a specific investigation, that
the duties of the Inspector General as outlined in the Illinois School Code, this
Resolution, and Board Rules are in conflict with the requirement that the Inspector
General shall report to the Board, the Inspector General shall report this matter to
outside legal counsel immediately upon identifying the potential conflict and shall
request that outside legal counsel prepare a legal opinion regarding whether there
exists a conflict that precludes the Inspector General from reporting the matter to
the Board. To the extent that the legal opinion indicates that there is such a conflict,
the Inspector General's outside counsel shall also advise the inspector General
regarding the legal requirements of reporting the matter at issue. If the legal
opinion does not indicate the existence of such a conflict, the Inspector General
shall report the matter to the Board as outlined above.

The Board also requests that the General Counsel provide legal counsel to the Inspector
General as required to assist the Inspector General in performing the duties outlined in the
Illinois School Code, this Resolution, and Board Rules, except in the following
circumstances:

If the Inspector General believes, in connection with a specific investigation, that
the duties of the Inspector General as outlined in the Illinois School Code, this
Resolution, and Board Rules are in conflict with the requirement that the General 
Counsel shall provide legal counsel to the Inspector General as outlined herein,
the Inspector General shall report this matter to the Board immediately upon
identifying the potential conflict. Based upon the inspector General's initial report
of such a matter, the Board will then provide additional direction regarding
subsequent retention of, legal counsel regarding reporting of the matter.

if the inspector General believes, in connection with a specific investigation, that
the duties of the Inspector General as outlined in the illinois School Code, this
Resolution, and Board Rules are in conflict with (1) the requirement that the
General Counsel shall provide legal counsel to the Inspector General and (2) with
reporting the matter to the Board as outlined in the preceding paragraph, the
inspector General shall report this matter to outside legal counsel immediately
upon identifying the potential conflict and shall request that outside legal counsel
prepare a legal opinion regarding whether there exists a conflict that precludes the
Inspector General from reporting the matter to the Board. To the extent that the
legal opinion indicates that there is such a conflict, the Inspector General?s outside
counsel shall also advise the Inspector General regarding the legal requirements
of reporting the matter at issue. If the legal opinion does not indicate the existence
of such a conflict, the Inspector General shall report the matter to the Board as
outlined above.

The Board further requests that the General Counsel represent the Inspector General in
all instances in which the enforcement of a subpoena issued by the Inspector General is
necessary. If the Inspector General believes there is conflict with the Board and/or the
Chicago Public Schools, including the Law Department, outside counsel may be appointed
to represent the Inspector General in such enforcement issues according to the conflict
provisions above.

The Board shall retain counsel acceptable to the Inspector General to provide legal counsel
in those circumstances where this Resolution authorizes the Inspector General to seek the
advice of outside legal counsel rather than the General Counsel.

This Resolution shall take effect upon adoption and shall remain in effect until amended or
rescinded by further Board action for the tenure of the Inspector General?s appointment
including any renewals thereof.

AMEND BOARD REPORT 01-1024-P02
POLICY ON HIGH SCHOOL PROMOTION

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education adopt the amended policy on high school promotion.
POLICY TEXT:

Introduction

The Chicago Board of Education believes that promotion from one grade in high school to the next must
indicate that students have passed a series of academically challenging courses in the core subject
disciplines of English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Sciences, as well as courses in other areas such
as world languages, fine arts, physical education, and career education that are aligned with the 
Learning Standards. Students who successfully earn course credits should display their understanding of
and competency in course subject matter through both standardized exams and appropriate assignments

- and assessments developed by teachers. 

--: .-

 

 

seheel?grade?This promotion policy requires that the city?s high school students demonstrate genuine
academic achievement and a commitment to learning in order to make progress toward earning their high
school diplomas.

I. Definitions

A. For purposes of this policy, a "unit of credit" is 120 hours of classroom instruction, unless
otherwise approved by the Chief Education Officer. A half unit of credit, which is 60 hours
of classroom instruction, represents the credit that students can earn for successfully
completing one semester of class work in a particular course. .,

B. For purposes of this policy, a ?core course? is any course in one of the core subject
disciplines of English, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences.

C. A passing grade for purposes of this policy means at least a average for the semester
in a course.

It. Promotion Requirements

The following guidelines regarding promotion shall apply for ninth, tenth and eleventh grade
students:

success in learning course subject matter. Teachers shall regularly use a variety of criteria in assessing
students? work, objective and essay tests, student portfolios, oral presentations, research
assignments, homework and classwork. These assessment criteria should be appropriate to the course
content and should provide students with a variety of means by which they can demonstrate their mastery
of the material covered In a class.

One important method of assessing student success in learning course subject matter is final end?
of?semester examinations. it is recommended as an educationally bene?cial practice that ?nal end?of?the-
semester examinations for students taking the same course at a school be developed collaboratively by
the course teachers working under the auspices of the department chair. Results on final end?of?semester
examinations shall constitute at least 10% of students? final semester grade.

AMEND BOARD REPORT 08-0227-PO1
AMEND BOARD REPORT 
RESIDENCY POLICY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That the Chicago Board of Education amend its policy regarding residency for all employees of the Board
of Education. This June 2018 amendment will allow teachers with a Special Needs waiver to become
Principals, Assistant Principals or Resident Principals without losinq their Residency Waiver.

PURPOSE: The purposes of this Policy are to establish consistent, equitable, and enforceable guidelines
concerning the Board?s requirement that all of?cers and employees of the Board of Education be
residents of the City of Chicago that are consistent with state law, 105 5/34-83. 1, and to establish
new provisions to the residency requirement.

 

HISTORY OF BOARD ACTION: On July 9, 1980, the Board adopted a ?Resolution to Require
Residency Within the City of Chicago Of all Personnel Employed by the Board of Education On or after
September 1, 1980? (See Resolution #80?149?2.) The Board subsequently adopted Board Report #83?
110, which superceded the previous resolution and which provided waivers to its residency policy under
certain circumstances. On April 18, 1990, the 1983 resolution was amended to provide waivers for
employees in "Special Needs? categories and for exemption of principals from the residency requirement 
(See Resolution On November 20, 1996, the Board adopted a residency policy (See
Board Report which exempted employees hired prior to September 1, 1980; allowed any
employees hired between September 1, 1980 and August 26, 1996, whose address of record with the
Department of Human Resources indicates that helshe resided outside the City of Chicago to continue to
live outside the City; and required all new employees to be City residents. _On August 27, 1997, the Board
amended the residency policy (See Board Report to aiiow a six?month grace period for
compliance with the policy for newly hired or rehired employees and for those employees formerly inia .
special needs exemption area. On August 22, 2001, the Board rescinded the residency policy' adopted
under Board Report and adopted its current residency policy which
requires at] full-time employees hired on or after November 20, 1996 to be actual residents of the City of
Chicago, sets forth disciplinary actions for teachers, principals and ail other employees and provides for
waiver of the policy upon Board action. The Board amended the policy in Board Report 
(Adopted October 27, 2004) to (1) identify responsible persons and offices for monitoring compliance with
new, non?resident employees? obligation to establish actual residence within the City of Chicago; (2)
identify responsible persons and offices for monitoring compliance with warnings and written reprimands
issued to non-compliant employees; (3) establish consistent discipline for non-compliant employees; (4)
reduce the compliance period for non-compliant employees from six (6) months to sixty (60) days; (5)
clarify the policy and the requirements and procedures for ?special needs waivers;? and (6) require
employees who must file Statements of Economic Interests under the Ethics Policy to annually certify
their compliance with the Residency Policy in the Statement of Economic Interests. The Board amended
the earrent policy in Board Report to define ?material omission of fact? and to make such
omissions with respect to an employee?s residency a violation of this policy. The Board amended the
policy in Board Report #08? 0227? P01 to 1) modify the timeline on which the Board annually desionates
special needs positions that are elioible for a residency waiver; and (2) modify the duration that special
needs waivers are granted from three school years to three calendar years.

 



POLICY TEXT:

I. Introduction. The boundaries of the schooi district under the charge of the Board of Education
of the City of Chicago are coterminous with the boundaries of the City of Chicago. It has been,
and continues to be, the belief of the governing board of the district that it is desirable to maintain
a policy requiring that its officers and employees maintain their residence within the City of
Chicago, and that its educational and governmentai purposes are best served by the
establishment of the residency policy contained herein.

The Board of Education, therefore, deems it proper and appropriate to maintain a residency
requirement for its officers and employees for reasons which include, but are not limited to, the
foliowing:

A. quality of performance of duties by officers and employees of the Board will be enhanced
by a more comprehensive knowledge of the conditions existing in the school system and
by a feeling of greater personal stake In the system' 5 progress;

B. resident officers and employees will be more likely to be involved in school and
community activities, thus bringing them into contact with community leaders and
citizens;

C. absenteeism and tardiness will be diminished;

D. economic bene?ts will accrue to the school system from local expenditure of salaries and

the payment of local sales and real estate taxes, and educational benefits will be derived
from residency by teachers, administrators and other employees in the City of Chicago.
The Chicago Board of Education, therefore, adopts without the necessity of annual re?
adoption the following residency policy.

ll. Definitions. For the purpose of this Policy only, the following de?nitions will apply:

A. ?Residency? means an employees domicile, the one actual place where an employee
lives and has his or her true, permanent home to which, whenever he or she' Is absent,
he or she has an intention of returning.

B. ?Employees? means all full?time employees as defined by the Rules of the Board of
Education of the City of Chicago and officers of the Board. "Employees? does n_ot include
the following: day- -to? ?day substitute teachers, part?time employees including part?time
Educational Support Personnel employees; full?time provisional substitute teachers;
individuals working in the Troops to Teachers program; miscellaneous employees;
interns working for the Board on a part-time or temporary basis; or those individuals
participating in professional training programs designed to prepare participants for full?
time empioyment as CPS educators- 

C. ?Continuously employed? means employment that has not been interrupted by a break in
service.
D. ?Break in Service? means a loss of employment as a result of dismissal, separation, and

resignation not followed by rehire within one year. ?Reassigned teachers? who are
appointed to full?time teaching positions within two years foilowing honorable termination
shall not have had a break in service for purposes of this Policy.

E. ?Academic year? means the regular school year commencing in August or September

lil.

IV.

VI.

F. ?Material omission of fact? means the employee?s intentional failure to disclose his/her
actual residence for purposes of concealing from the Board his/her non-compliance with
the actual residence requirements of this Policy.

Current Employees Hired On or After November 20. 1996. All employees hired on or after
November 20, 1996 will be required to be actual residents of the City of Chicago within six
months from the day their employment begins, except where the employee has been granted a
waiver in accordance with the provisions of this- Policy. This'residency requirement includes
principals. A Sworn Residency statement must be completed by each prospective employee by
the time his or her employment with the Board begins.

Employees who are hired without being actual residents shall have an af?rmative obligation to
notify their principal, area instruction officer, or department head and the Department of Human
Resources no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the six (6) month anniversary of their
date of hire that they have established actual residency. Principals, area instruction of?cers, and
department heads or their respective designees shall be responsible for monitoring compliance
by employees under their supervision with the obligation to establish actual residency within six
(6) months of hire. Principals, area instruction officers and department heads shall commence
appropriate disciplinary proceedings for those employees who are not in compliance with this
Policy. A principal?s, area instruction officer?s or department heads failure to monitor compliance
with the Policy shall not relieve employees of their obligation to comply with the Policy.

Current Employees Hired Prior To November 20, 1996. All employees hired prior to
November 20, 1996 - the date when the Board originally adopted a residency policy requiring
employees hired on or after November 20, 1996 to reside in Chicago - who have remained
continuously employed by the Board shall not be required to live within?the Chicago city limits
regardless of whether such employees have moved into the city since November 20,- 1996. Any
employee hired prior to November 20, 1996 who has had a break in service after November 20_,
1996 will be regarded as a new employee and will be required to reside in Chicago within six
months after returning to full-time employment with the Board unless the employee obtains a
waiver in accordance with Section of this Policy. 

Notification of Change of Address. All employees must notify the Board of a change in their
address within fourteen (14) calendar days of their change of address. Notification to the Board of
a change of residency shall be in writing or, if permitted by the Department of Human Resources,
electronically, and filed with the Department of Human Resources using the procedures, forms
and documentation established and provided by the Department of Human Resources. An
employee who represents to the Board that he/she resides in the City of Chicago at the time of
his/her hire or at any time thereafter and 1) who subsequently moves his/her actual residence
from the City of Chicago, and 2) fails to notify the Board of his/her change of address required by
this Section shall be deemed to have made a material omission of fact for the purpose of
concealing his/her actual residence.

Proof of Residency. For the purposes of this Policy, the question of an employee's residence is
principally one of where an employee intends to iive and have his or her one true, permanent
home or domicile to which an employee intends to return following an absence. The presumption
in this Policy is that the address an employee gives on a completed Residency Form is that
employee's correct address. in disputed cases, the burden of proof rests with the employee to-
show that his or her claimed residence is the one where the employee intends to live and have as
his or her one true permanent home or domicile. Because intent may be manifested in
innumerable ways, any residency inquiry, must consider all the pertinent factors on a case?by-
case basis. Such an inquiry shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: voter
registration, place of filing tax returns, property ownership, driver's license and car registration.





VII.



Penalties for Viol?ation of the Residency Policy.

A. Principals and 'Tenured Teachers. According to the Illinois School Code, tenured
. teachers and principals only may be dismissed for conduct deemed "irremediable,? or for
"remediable" conduct which employees have been speci?cally warned may lead to their
dismissal if repeated. The School Code defines "irremediable" conduct as conduct which
is cruel, immoral, negligent, or criminal or which in any way causes harm or
injury to a student. 105 ILCS 5/34-85. The Board shall Consider any tenured teacher or
principal to have engaged in irremediable conduct and subject to dismissal without prior
warning if he/she has intentionally misrepresented his/her actual residence, whether such
misrepresentation is made by active representations or by material omissions of facts,
with the intent to avoid the residency requirements set forth in this Policy. Other initial
violations of this Policy that do not involve such misrepresentations shall not be treated
as "irremediable" offenses.

Accordingly, in those cases where no misrepresentation occurs, a principal or tenured
teacher who is subject to this Policy may be dismissed for failure to comply with the
residency requirement if, after receiving a Warning Resolution from the Board, the
employee fails to comply with the warning and establish his or her residency in Chicago.

in addition, the ESL/Bilingual Endorsement Initiative is aligned to our district goals of ensuring that every
child has access to high quality teaching and learning In alignment with the Common Core State
Standards (CCSS). All teachers who enroll in these courses will benefit by developing their expertise in
using instructional strategies and providing support to ELs. This will provide students with access to
rigorous content in order to CCSS standards.
