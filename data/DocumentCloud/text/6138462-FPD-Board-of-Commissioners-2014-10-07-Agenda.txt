Summary: Building a Passion for Discovery Documentary outlines a great partnership between public television
and the Forest Preserves with a focus on highlighting the Centennial milestone and the Next Century Conservation
Plan.
Celebrating the visionary success of one of the largest and oldest forest preserves in the United States is a story with
great value. Capturing the important work critical to the preservation of Cook County’s natural resources will also
be coupled with the enhanced message that focuses on the rich history, educational value, health benefits and
recreational pleasure that the Preserves provide for people of all ages.
Content developed for interactive kiosks will provide visitors with the opportunity to learn more about the Forest
Preserves. The educational component beyond the broadcast will be repackaged as educational resources for
teachers, support for classroom curriculum and educational collateral that can be shared with area libraries to
engage a greater audience.
As a broadcaster reaching almost 1.4 million viewers a week throughout a four state area of Illinois, Indiana,
Michigan and Wisconsin, a marketing and advertising campaign developed simultaneously with the broadcast will
also provide the opportunity to kick-off an external campaign that builds greater community awareness about the
Forest Preserves of Cook County.
