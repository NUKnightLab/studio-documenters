COMMITTEE ON ADMINISTRATION

Approval of the Procurement Policy
The Detroit Public Library administration, in its efforts to improve efficiencies in the
Library’s Finance and Business office and follow industry best practices, is seeking to
update the existing Purchasing Policy. The existing Purchasing Policy was last updated
and approved by the Detroit Library Commission on December 15, 2009.
The following is a summary of the recommended changes to the existing policy by the
Chief Financial Officer and Finance and Business staff:
Change of the Department’s Name
This policy changes the name of the department from Purchasing to Procurement. All
references to Purchasing has been revised. The term procurement involves more than
just buying goods and services, but encompasses the process of selecting suppliers,
negotiating contracts and other aspects of the contract process, in which purchasing is
just one aspect.
Bidding Requirements
This policy provides for the following changes to the bidding process, in order to ensure
competition and best pricing for the Library.
Current Policy

Proposed Policy

Not Exceeding $3,000
Purchases made at department’s discretion

Not exceeding $5,000
Purchases made at department’s
discretion

$3,000 to $10,000

$3,000 to $10,000

Director for purchases $10,000 $24,999.99)

$3,000 or more
Formal bidding process

Approval Thresholds
The revised policy also provides for the following changes to the approval thresholds:
Proposed Change
Approval by Executive Director

$10,000-$24,999.99

Formal Approval by Commission

$25,000

Given the trend in public procurement, approval thresholds have been increased due to
greater transparency in the procurement process. All requests exceeding $10,000 will
go through a competitive process in order to award a purchase order and/or contract.
Debarment of Suppliers
The new policy adds the Library’s policy on debarment of suppliers for nonperformance. This provision is not a part of the current policy.
Disposition of Surplus/Obsolete Items
A policy for disposing of surplus/obsolete items has been added to this policy to give
direction under which items may be disposed of by the Library.
Removal of Procedures
All procedures have been removed from the new policy. The procedures for procuring
goods and services are a part of the procedures manual followed by the departments.

Purpose

The Procurement Department is responsible for the procurement of goods and services
excluding print and non-print material (books, videos, databases, DVDs), for the Library and in
accordance with the Library Commission Procurement Policy of October 1,1985.

2.0

Policy

The Detroit Library Commission requires approval of routine contracts in excess of
$25,000 to be awarded on the basis of competitive bid or Request for Proposal. In
addition, the Procurement Department reserves the right to solicit competitive bids at
any amount, whenever known competition exists.
Any contract between DPL and a non-DPL party is enforceable by law. No contract
may be signed on behalf of DPL unless it has first been approved, by the Library
Commission. The Detroit Public Library (DPL) Purchase Order (PO) is legal and
binding. The PO is an offer to buy the specific goods or services described therein. All
contract documents and agreements pertaining to a new or existing purchase order
shall be authorized, in writing, by Procurement.
It is the responsibility of all staff to take appropriate steps to ensure that the Library does
not knowingly enter into any procurement transaction which has not been authorized by
the Procurement Department, Executive Director or the Detroit Library Commission.
3.0

Definitions

The following definitions are for terms used within this procedure for clarification of the
form and process.
3.1

Credit Cards: DPL maintains credit cards for Library-related purposes
only. All purchases must be for the benefit of DPL.
The Credit Card Policy establishes guidelines for appropriate use of DPL
credit cards. The Policy is designed to clarify DPL credit card use and to
avoid violation of state mandates and IRS codes regarding credit card
use.
See Credit Card Policy Number # 300.B.003 (available upon request)

being excluded from procurement transactions with DPL for a period of up
to three (3) years due to allegations of fraud, mismanagement and similar
actions.

3.3

Emergency: A frequently used term with wide range meanings. For the
purposes of this procedure an Emergency is a situation or condition that
affects the health and safety of the staff and customers or has an
immediate impact causing the Library not to function.

3.4

Formal Bid: Formal Bids (Invitation for Bid (IFB), Competitive Sealed
Bids) are used to introduce open competition to the procurement process.
The document is prepared based on specifications prepared by the
requestor and distributed by the Procurement Department. Bids are to be
sealed by the Supplier and submitted at a specific time and place as
required by the document. At the stated time and date all bids received
are opened and read aloud in a public meeting room.

3.5

Professional Services: Services provided by an independent contractor
possessing an advanced, specialized type of knowledge, expertise, or
training customarily acquired by a prolonged course of study like

negotiations. Request for Proposals are coordinated and issued only by
the Procurement Department.

firms to submit their qualifications to be considered for a project. It is
applicable for professional services (similar to legal services). The intent
of an RFQ is to allow a selection based upon the most qualified for the
project. A contract may be awarded as a result of an RFQ or this may be
used as the first step, prior to issuing an RFP. It provides the ability to
negotiate a fee with selected company.

Specifications are divided generally into two main categories:
3.12.1 Performance specifications: conform to known customer
requirements within a specified range.
3.12.2 Technical specifications: express the level of performance of
the individual units.

Disposition of Surplus/Obsolete Property

From time to time, the Library finds it necessary to dispose of surplus/obsolete
materials, equipment, etc. because it is no longer needed or useful. Items shall
be disposed of using sound business practices, trying to get the highest value
for the Library, but also taking into consideration the cost and time associated
with the disposition. These surplus items:





have resale value regardless of dollar amount;
are not routinely discarded as waste;
are no longer in use;
are still functional for the purpose for which it was intended.

Detroit Public Library, acting through the Procurement Manager may:




periodically sell the surplus property by competitive bid or auction;
offer the property as a trade-in for new property of the same type, if that
action is in the best interests of the Library;
order any of the property to be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as
worthless if there was an attempt to sell the property and received no bids.
