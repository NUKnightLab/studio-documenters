EXPLANATION
ACE Coffee Bar, Inc. (“ACE”) was awarded a contract to install, supply and maintain vending

The vending machines offer soft drinks and snacks at competitive vending machine prices. The

convenience of the vending machines close to their places of residence.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to extend contracts with ACE Coffee Bar, Inc.
for the supply and maintenance of vending machines at CHA Developments for the one (1) year
option period.
