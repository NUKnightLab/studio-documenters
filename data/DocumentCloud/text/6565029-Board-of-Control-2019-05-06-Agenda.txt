Emergency Management Agency funds in the amount of $293,758.36 that were disbursed to Cuyahoga
County from the FY14 State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) for procurement of an Automated
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) equipment. The purpose of this request is to satisfy the
reimbursement of the aforementioned amount based upon the discovery that the equipment in question

Department of Public Safety and Justice Services requesting approval of a revenue generating agreement
with The Cleveland Clinic Foundation for the anticipated cost not-to-exceed $100,800.00.
The County will provide vendor-hosted next generation 911 services to the Cleveland Clinic Police
Department for a monthly fee. The anticipated start-completion dates are 04/22/2019- 01/31/2025.
5/6/2019 – 1/31/2025
The Clinic Police receive 911 calls transferred from Cleveland dispatch. They currently have no way of
identifying the location of transferred calls. The Motorola CallWorks System used by the County and by
Cleveland, has a plotting function and other features that will help the Clinic Police identify the location
of callers and dispatch officers to respond to incidents on Clinic property.
The Cleveland Clinic could contract directly with Motorola CallWorks but there are substantial set up costs.
This solution allows the Clinic to receive next gen 911 services for an affordable monthly rate and avoid
the substantial start up investment.

Scope of Work Summary
The Office of Homeless Services requesting approval to submit a Grant Application to the U.S.
Department of Housing & Urban Development for the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Project. The
Grant Application does not request a specific dollar amount at this time. The purpose of the Application
is to demonstrate to HUD that the Cuyahoga County Continuum of Care, in partnership with a Youth
Lead agency, “A Place 4 Me” is committed to conducting a community planning process which will result
in identifying projects that will prevent and end youth homelessness. If selected as a planning site, the
community would then be eligible to apply to HUD for funding to implement some of the identified
strategic projects.
The Office of Homeless Services is recognized by HUD as the lead agency for the Cuyahoga County
Continuum of Care. The lead agency is the only eligible applicant for the NOFA.
The primary goals identified in the NOFA are to:
a) convene youth serving systems, providers, and youth to identify an action plan to prevent youth
homelessness;
b) identify specific intervention points among the youth serving systems when housing instability can be
assessed and the youth stabilized;
c) focus existing resources on best practices that are youth centered;
d) describe and confirm a system that quickly identifies homeless youth and links them with stable
housing, permanency, education and/or employment.
The YHDP is a new opportunity. The County responded to this Opportunity in FY2016 and FY2017 but
was not successful.
The YHDP will provide funding to implement activities that are identified through a community planning
process that will reduce and end Youth homelessness. The application due date is 5/15/19. Successful
applicants will be notified in the Fall. The final plan will be accepted by HUD by early 2020.
The project has 3 phases.
29

 PHASE 1 – Apply and be accepted as a YHDP Site. If accepted, the community has an 8-month time
frame to confirm a plan and receive HUD approval.
PHASE 2 – Apply for HUD funding to implement aspects of the Plan that are eligible for HUD funding.
PHASE 3 – Continue implementation of all aspects of the Plan.
The Grant Application does not require the County to provide match.
Funding
The estimated cost of PHASE 1 of the YHDP is $120,305. The funding is sourced:
a) Federal Grant to the Office of Homeless Services
