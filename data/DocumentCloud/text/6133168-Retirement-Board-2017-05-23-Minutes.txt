Follow-up on MWDBE Policies
Mr. Walsh presented two additional reports requested by the Board at the previous Board meeting which outlined in
further detail the Fund’s spending in 2016 with MWDBE service providers and vendors as well as the diversity of the
Fund’s employees. Trustee Hamburger referenced a link on the City of Chicago’s website which lists MWDBE
companies for the Fund’s consideration. Trustee Summers recommended that the Fund begin requesting ownership
and senior staff diversity information from its vendors. The Trustees suggested additional actions staff can consider
to increase the use of MWDBE service providers and vendors.

Mr. Carroll reviewed the details of the Mathew Zwiesler matter which pertained to a beneficiary designation form that

MEABF. Mr. Donham referred to a memo he prepared and gave his recommendation that beneficiary forms filed with
another pension fund, such as the one filed by Mr. Zwiesler with the MEABF, be considered invalid for LABF
purposes. The Board agreed with Mr. Donham’s recommendation and determined that the beneficiary form that the
LABF had from MEABF for Mr. Zweissler was invalid. The Board directed staff to contact the family of Mr. Zwiesler
to discuss the next steps in the process.
Illinois Department of Public Health (Vital Records Data)
Mr. Walsh informed the Board that due to a new law that allows the LABF access to vital records of deceased Illinois

 Conclusion
Under the current statutory funding policy:
 Projected contributions and investment income are not
sufficient to cover benefits and expenses
 Assets are projected to be depleted by 2027
 The long-term investment return assumption of 7.5 percent
will become difficult to support
 The GASB 67/68 actuarial valuation reflects the depletion of
assets when developing the discount rate assumption
 Under the GASB 67/68 actuarial valuation, liabilities are
discounted at 4.17 percent and equal $3.69 billion
 Under the statutory actuarial valuation, liabilities are
discounted at 7.50 percent and equal $2.51 billion


9

 Conclusion (continued)
We strongly recommend that the statutory funding policy be
strengthened as soon as practical
 A reasonable funding policy
 Produces reasonable growth in the funded ratio and is not
“back-loaded”
 Finances the normal cost plus the amortization of the
unfunded actuarial liability over a reasonable period such
as 20 to 25 years
 Avoids or minimizes the negative amortization of the
unfunded actuarial liability

only at fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the provisions contained in P.A. 98-0043, the city
terminated health insurance supplement payments to eligible annuitants as of December 31, 2016, resulting in no
OPEB liability.

policy for pension benefits and includes the ARC under GASB Statement No. 43 for OPEB benefits, which was
determined based on a one-year closed level dollar amortization policy.
