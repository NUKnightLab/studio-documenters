URGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO REINTRODUCE THE VACANCY FRAUD ACT
19

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 7, 2017

WHEREAS, throughout Cook County there are over 1,900 vacant properties registered; and
WHEREAS, vacant buildings represent a public nuisance that can result in public health and safety issues
in our communities and place a financial strain on local government agencies; and
WHEREAS, a leading cause of high vacancies in communities are weak real estate markets, and today
property values in Cook County are still lower than 2007 values; and
WHEREAS, in addition to a weak real estate market, in some instances landlords may purposefully allow
buildings to remain vacant by not actively seeking tenants for their buildings in order to qualify for specific
financial incentives; and
WHEREAS, when property tax exemptions and financial incentives are obtained fraudulently for vacant
property, this halts economic development, contributes to further blight in these communities, and
significantly reduces the tax base in taxing districts; and
WHEREAS, during the 100th General Assembly the Vacancy Fraud Act received bipartisan support; and
WHEREAS, the Vacancy Fraud Act allows for taxing bodies to file a vacancy fraud complaint with the
county board of review, and if found to be fraudulently obtained, owners would be required to pay back
what is owed plus penalties; and
WHEREAS, the Vacancy Fraud Act would discourage owners from allowing property to sit vacant and
encourage owners to actively seek tenants, which would contribute to the growth of a community; and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
urges the General Assembly to reintroduce and pass the Vacancy Fraud Act; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be shared with the General Assembly and
the Governor of Illinois.

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of Berkeley
Volume and Property Index Number:
157, 15-07-310-022-0000.
Summary: Thank you for the opportunity to submit a request for assistance through the No Cash Bid
Program. We are pleased to submit one (1) parcel for your consideration.
This unoccupied commercial property is located in close proximity to the Village Hall, under 1/10th of a
mile
and comprises an estimated land square footage of 6,350 square feet. The existing structure has been
unoccupied with no water use since October of 2008. The Village will be exploring plans for usage by
Village sponsored clubs and organizations or possible expansion of Village offices for ease of providing
streamlined services. Therefore, the Village will file for tax exempt status on the property if tax deeds are
obtained. The Village also intends to retain ownership of the parcel and therefore will not be applying with
a Third Party.
The Village will retain legal counsel to assist with completion of the application, title search, tax deed
petition and will bear all other costs related to the acquisition of these parcels through the No Cash Bid
(NCB) Program and agrees to file NCB reports on the status of each parcel for five (5) years or until
development is complete, whichever occurs first.

Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”) hereby requests no-cash bid acquisition of

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 7, 2017

the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN referred to herein as the “Property.” The
Property is located at 8834 Ogden Avenue in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is improved with a
single-story commercial structure used as part of a retail facility selling custom countertops operating as
the Marble Place. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future
proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property. Acquisition of the
Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit the Village by potential
redevelopment of a commercial, tax-generating use of Property. Commercial development of the Property
will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property and sales tax base and by offering additional
employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for redevelopment. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a certificate of
purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance.

the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN and is referred to herein as the “Property.”
The Property is located at 9401 Henrietta in the Village of Brookfield. The Property is currently a vacant

Summary: Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2017 County Scavenger Sale for the parcels of property identified.
In the event these parcels are not eligible for the No Cash Bid Program, the Village is alternatively
requesting that an Over-The-Counter tax certificate be issued and assigned to the Village of Glenwood.
This request package is for the three (3) adjacent PINs listed above. The requested PINs are contiguous
parcels that contain a vacant dilapidated abandoned commercial site that was previously occupied by a
restaurant that has been closed for three (3) years. At the time the property was abandoned, the Village
attempted to work with the business occupying the parcels to see if it could utilize available TIF incentives
to improve the structure so that the restaurant can continue to operate. Ultimately, the Village concluded
that the costs of rehabilitating this structure so that it could continue to be useable as a restaurant was far
more than the value of the entire site. The structure on this property has continued to deteriorate and the
Village believes that it is now in a dangerous condition. It is the Village of Glenwood’s desire to obtain title
to this property so that it can demolish the hazardous structure located on this property so that the property
can be redeveloped by a private entity, returned to the property tax rolls and create additional employment
opportunities within the Village. This parcel is in the Village of Glenwood’s Main Street Tax Increment

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook County’s
No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of eighty-nine (89)
Parcels of vacant land listed in our request and they are as follows. The City’s request will be indicated in
our Resolution to be introduced at the April 10, 2017 Council meeting. The City of Harvey requests
eighty-nine (89) parcels of vacant land for the redevelopment of our major thoroughfares and Downtown
Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. There is no Third Party Requestors

statement. The City of Harvey will file for tax exempt status for each parcel granted in our request. The
City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually on each parcel
for five (5) years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the
lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook County’s
No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of twenty-three (23)
Parcels of non-occupied commercial structures listed in our request and they are as follows. The City’s
request will be indicated in our Resolution to be introduced at the April 10, 2017 Council meeting. The City
of Harvey requests twenty-three (23) parcels of non-occupied commercial land for the redevelopment of
our major thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. There is no Third Party Requestors
statement. The City of Harvey will file for tax exempt status for each parcel granted in our request. The
City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually on each parcel
for five years or until the development is completed, whichever occurs last. If a City of Harvey lien is
cleared by the no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the
City than the cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the
lien after the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.

Summary: The purpose of this letter is to inform you of the Village of Lansing’s desire to participate in

of five (5) permanent index numbers that are delinquent in real estate taxes or special assessments for two

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of South Chicago Heights
Volume and Property Index Number:
021; 32-33-102-019-0000.
Summary: Please find included in these materials the Village of South Chicago Heights’s no-cash bid
application. The Village submits this application in order to acquire property commonly known as 3244
Butler St., South Chicago Heights, IL 60411. There is only one PIN included in this request. This property
was previously used for industrial purposes as the site of the Chicago Heights Pattern & Model Works, Inc.,
which employed up to twenty people. Unfortunately, this business no longer occupies the building, and it
has been vacant and unoccupied since 2010.
The Village has retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal and other costs associated
with the acquisition of this parcel. If the Village is able to acquire this property, it plans to rehab the property
and market it to an investor in the hopes of bringing jobs and money into the community. However, there
is no investor or third party to whom the Village presently plans to deed the property, and there has been
no third-party request made to the Village to acquire the property. If the Village is unable to sell the
property, then it will use it as the home of its Public Works Department.
If the Village successfully acquires this property, it will file for tax-exempt status because it will retain the
PIN for municipal use. It will also submit to the Cook County Planning and Development Department
no-cash bid reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever
occurs last.

limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the
appearance of MBE or WBEPCE participation. If an MBE or WBEPCE subcontracts a greater portion of
the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to
perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBEPCE is presumed not to be performing a
Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or
supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry
practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services, unless otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(f)
One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Manufacturer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(g)
Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Distributor or Regular Dealer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(h)
If a PCE ceases to be certified for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted for the remaining term of the
Contract.
(i)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or
WBEPCE shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBEPCE.

Journal of Proceedings

Sec. 34-297. - Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall
be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the County,
the Utilization Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on the part of
the Contractor to each relevant PCE, and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a Utilization
Plan shall render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBEPCE in which the Contractor
requires that the MBE or WBEPCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine
whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or
proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more established
Project Specific Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will consider, at a
minimum, whether the Contractor has:
(1)

Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEsPCEs certified in the
scopes of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and
WBEsPCEs with timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and
requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEsPCEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs.

(2)

Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEsPCEs in order to
increase the likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes,
where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to
facilitate MBE and WBEPCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise
prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility
to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEsPCEs and to select those
portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability of MBEs and
WBEsPCEs to facilitate their participation.

(3)

Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs. Evidence of such
negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and
WBEsPCEs that were contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the
plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements
could not be reached with MBEs and WBEsPCEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs
and WBEsPCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough
investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using MBEs and WBEsPCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's
failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are reasonable. The ability
or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own organization does
not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 7, 2017

(4)

Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining bonding, lines of
credit, or insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.

(5)

Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.

(6)

Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women
community organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored
minority/women business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide
assistance in the recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEsPCEs.

(7)

Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or
more PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance
standards and outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the
PCE in acquiring additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term
success of the PCE consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).

(d)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of
other Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific
Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBEPCE participation obtained by other Contractors,
this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBEPCE, describing the work,
materials, equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBEPCE and the agreed upon
dollar value shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f)
The CCD shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEsPCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing
of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to
augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g)
If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Agency, the CCD
and User Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h)
If the CCD finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CCD
shall communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be
rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. - Contract administration procedures.
(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.

June 7, 2017

(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance
of the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CCD and the User Agency shall
monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely
access to the Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and
records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and
WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBEPCE performing any portion of the contract. This
provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the
Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.

June 7, 2017

(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or
WBEsPCEs named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CCD, in consultation
with the CPO and the User Agency. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this
subdivision and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or
cause termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the
Contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised
Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into the Contract as an amendment by the CPO. The CCD shall
promulgate policies and procedures with respect to changes to a Utilization Plan.
(1)

All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBEPCE Subcontractor(s) named
in the Utilization Plan shall be made to the CCD, CPO and the User Agency in writing, and
shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute
an MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or
WBEPCE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CCD, in consultation with
the CPO and the User Agency, approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall
not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until the CCD, CPO and the User
Agency have approved the substitution.

(2)

The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have
been known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor to
resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of
work, the MBE or WBEPCE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached
for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.

(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

(v)

Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation
where agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.

(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements;
or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)

The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of
any denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CCD.

(5)

Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 7, 2017

Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a
new MBE or WBEPCE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith
Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(6)

If the County requires the substitution of an MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization
Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and
Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified
Firm.

(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CCD to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEsPCEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Agency at the time they
arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBEPCE goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CCD shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the
contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's
scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBEPCE
commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of
the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.

Sec. 34-300.1. - Established business participation in the Program.
(a)

An Established Business may participate in the Program, as follows:

(1)

For a one-year period after the business has become an established business, only 75
percent of such business's participation in a County contract shall account for the MBE or
WBE, as applicable, aspirational and project specific goals;

an established business, only 50 percent of such business's participation in a County

(3)

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned commercial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 8; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 8 is necessary for development to occur on this specific real
estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of abandoned
with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS; commercial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying
commercial real estate eligible for the Class 8 can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment
from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned
property from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 8 will be assessed at 10%
of the market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County
of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed
abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 8; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a
certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.

ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE, PRESIDENT AND
JESUS G. GARCIA, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
AMENDMENT TO TAX INCENTIVE ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 Taxation, Article II
Real Property Taxation, Division 2 Classification System For Assessment, Section 74-71 of the Cook
County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71 - Laws regulating the payment of wages.
(a)

Living wage requirement.

(1)

Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that
receives a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial
property, or Class 9 multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living
Wage, as defined in the Cook County Procurement Code (COOK ,/COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch.
34, Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34-121), to each of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees’
Wages are governed by Federal or State prevailing wage law. For purposes of this Section,
the term “Employee” shall mean an employee who performs duties or services for an
Employer on average at least 30 hours per week in any two week period for which the
Employee is paid; “hours per week” shall mean hours for which an employee is paid or is
entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of time during which no duties are
performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness, incapacity, jury duty, military
duty or approved leave of absence.

(2)

On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

June 7, 2017

shall notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this
Section. Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that
receives a property tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the
municipality or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such
lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the requirements of this Section shall not
apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an owner-occupant of a property that
receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(23)

This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded
by Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a
property that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance.
Further, this Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County
Board that compliance with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer
to be in violation of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer
and a labor union.

(4)

Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living
Wage requirement and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the
Living Wage. In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee
contends that the Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this
section, that Employee may file a complaint with the Cook County Commission on Human
Rights ("Commission").The Commission shall investigate alleged violations of the Living
Wage Ordinance and is authorized to adopt regulations for the proper administration and
enforcement of its provisions. If at the conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the
Commission finds that the Employer has violated this section, it shall (1) in the case of an
Employer receiving a property tax incentive, notify the Assessor; or (2) in the case of a
Contractor or a subcontractor required to pay the Living Wage, notify the CPO, who shall
exercise such remedies as are in the best interest of the County, including ordering the
Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as provided in this section.

(35)

If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required
to pay back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to
$100.00 for each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such
penalties will not be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (COOK COUNTY, ILL.,
CODE, Ch. 2, Art. IX). Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section,
the property tax incentive for this property is subject to revocation.

(46)

If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer’s
property tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates
or compensates such Employee.

(57)

For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2
of this Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9
designation granted to supportive living facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing

Journal of Proceedings

home care for low income older persons and persons with disabilities under Medicaid and
which are certified by the State Department of Public Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this
Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use
Tax.
(68)

Living Wage Affidavit. Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a
Resolution or Ordinance or authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant
for a Class 6b industrial property or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall
maintain in its files and records documentation that such municipality or the County Board
received and filed the Living Wage Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such
property stating that such owner or lessee is paying a Living Wage to its Employees in
compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily
residential property tax incentive shall provide the municipality or the Cook County Board,
as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which shall be maintained by such
municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records.

(b)

State or Federal Laws.

(1)

Except where a Person has requested an exception from the Assessor and the County Board
expressly finds that granting the exception is in the best interest of the County, such Person
including any Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V
§ 34-367) shall be ineligible to receive any property tax incentive noted in Division 2 of
this Article if, during the five-year period prior to the date of the application, such Person
or Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367)
admitted guilt or liability or has been adjudicated guilty or liable in any judicial or
administrative proceeding of committing a repeated or willful violation of the Illinois Wage
Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/1 et seq., the Illinois Minimum Wage Act, 820
ILCS 105/1 et seq., the Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 820

Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 201, et seq., or any comparable state statute or regulation of any
state, which governs the payment of wages.

(2)

The Assessor shall obtain an affidavit or certification from every Person and Substantial
Owner (as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) who seeks a
property tax incentive from the County as noted in Division 2 of this Article certifying that
the Person or Substantial Owner (as defined in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V
§ 34-367) has not violated the statutory provisions identified in Subsection (a) of this
Section.

(3)

If the County or Assessor becomes aware that a Person or Substantial Owner (as defined
in COOK COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) has admitted guilt or liability or
has been adjudicated guilty or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of
committing a repeated or willful violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection
Act, 820 ILCS 115/1 et seq., the Illinois Minimum Wage Act, 820 ILCS 105/1 et seq., the

201, et seq., or any comparable state statute or regulation of any state, which governs the
payment of wages during the five-year period prior to the date of the application, but after
the County has reclassified the Person's or Substantial Owner's (as defined in COOK
COUNTY, ILL., CODE, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) subject property under a property tax
incentive classification, then, after notice from the Assessor of such violation, the Person
or Substantial Owner shall have 45 days to cure its violation and request an exception or
waiver from the Assessor. Failure to cure or obtain an exception or waiver of ineligibility
from the Assessor shall serve as grounds for revocation of the classification as provided by
the Assessor or by the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance. In case of revocation or
cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void for the tax year in
which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In such an instance,
the taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an amount equal
to the difference in the amount of taxes that would have been collected had the subject
property not received the property tax incentive.
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect upon adoption.
