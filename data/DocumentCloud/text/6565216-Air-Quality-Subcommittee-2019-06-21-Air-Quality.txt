ACTION ITEMS
Transportation Conformity Analysis for 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) Nonattainment Designation
Mr. Tim Kovach stated that NOACA is required to complete a conformity determination within
one year of nonattainment designation for NAAQS. He noted that Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake,
Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit counties are included in the designated marginal
nonattainment area for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS, effective August 3, 2018. Mr. Kovach stated
that the estimated emissions must fall within the budgets set by State Implementation Plans
(SIPs). He noted that the conformity determination receives final approval from the United States
Department of Transportation (USDOT) on August 3, 2019.
Mr. Kovach mentioned that NOACA participated in an interagency consultation (IAC) call with
local, state and federal partners on February 12, 2019. NOACA has been coordinating with the
Akron Metropolitan Area Transportation Study (AMATS) and the Erie Regional Planning
Commission (ERPC) since portions of those territories are part of the nonattainment area. Based
on follow-up discussions, all partners agreed that NOACA could advance the conformity
determination based on existing emissions analyses.
Mr. Kovach reviewed the following emissions and budgets:

1-1

 •

2015 8-Hour Ozone NAAQS
(VOC and NOx Emissions for 2020, 2030, and 2040; and budgets for 2020 and 2030)

that the consultant submitted to NOACA semi-final versions of both documents. She said the
documents will be reviewed, finalized and presented to the Air Quality Subcommittee before
implementation.
Air Quality Awareness Week and Gohio Commute Outreach Efforts
Ms. Burtzlaff stated that U.S. EPA’s Air Quality Awareness Week will be April 29–May 3, 2019.
The theme this year is “Check the Air Quality Index (AQI) & Get Outside.” Ms. Burtzlaff said the
big idea is to increase awareness of air quality and access to air quality information. She stated

1-2

 that NOACA will promote the AirNow website, NOACA’s Air Quality advisories/sign-up link, and
talk to people about how they can help protect their health and help clean the air.
Ms. Burtzlaff provided an overview of EPA’s AirNow website; showed a screenshot of NOACA’s
air quality advisory email; and discussed various communication / outreach tools that NOACA
will use, and events / activities staff will participate in to help improve the air quality in this region.
Mr. Schroedel stated that the City of Broadview Heights would be happy to promote Gohio
Commute and NOACA’s events on its website and social media. He suggested that NOACA
staff reach out to other cities, townships and villages to promote events and activities, as well.
Ms. Burtzlaff stated that staff will continue to do air quality outreach through Gohio Commute,
meet with employers, participate in outreach activities and events, use social media, and attend
speaking engagements.
Gohio Commute Update and Performance Measures
Mr. Kovach provided background on Gohio Commute. He stated that staff has created
performance measures to track the progress of Gohio Commute. The performance measures
cover four categories:

RE:

Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is included for information and presentation only. This item will be
considered by the Planning and Programming Committee at its July 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
In November 2012, ODOT directed the Ohio Association of Regional Councils (OARC) and its
eight large Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) members to develop a statewide CMAQ
Program. The intent of the statewide program, as directed by ODOT, is to reduce the amount of
unspent funds and advance projects of statewide significance. Up until the formation of the
statewide program, CMAQ funding was historically suballocated to the individual MPO programs
by ODOT using a formula based on population within the air quality non-attainment areas.
The statewide CMAQ program has replaced the individual programs historically administered by
the eight largest MPOs. These MPOs represent the greater regions of Akron, Canton,
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown. NOACA expects to receive
approximately $25 million for projects for implementation in SFYs 2024-2025.
NOACA staff has initiated evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in accordance with
the new statewide program policy project scoring criteria. The criterion includes:
1. Project Type (10 points)
2. Cost Effectiveness (15 points)
3. Other Benefits (15 points)
4. Existing Level of Service (15 points)
5. Positive Impact on Level of Service (15 points)
6. Status of Project (10 points)
7. Non-Federal Match Commitments (10 points)
8. Regional Priority (10, 7, 4, 2 points based on top four project priorities)
9. History of Project Delivery (up to -10 points)

5-1

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
Projects selected for the region will establish the initial CMAQ budgets for SFYs 2024-2025.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will finalize project evaluation and scoring and present the projects, along with
input from the subcommittee, to the Planning and Programming Committee for recommendation
at its July 12 meeting.
Staff will submit recommended applications to the Statewide CMAQ Program Committee for
evaluation against other statewide projects in October 2019. The Statewide CMAQ Program
Committee will then submit project recommendations to the OARC Executive Directors for final
approval at their November 2019 meeting.

RE:

Gohio Commute Update and Performance Measures

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
In partnership with the six (6) other largest Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in Ohio,
NOACA manages Gohio Commute, a multi-regional transportation demand management (TDM)
platform. Gohio Commute, which launched in April 2017, serves as a one-stop-shop trip planner
for the NOACA region, with connectivity throughout Ohio. NOACA has worked to engage
businesses, local governments, colleges, and other organizations to create their own subsites
through the platform. These subsites enable organizations to offer their employees (or students)
targeted incentives to choose healthier, more efficient modes of transportation.
In order to evaluate the success of Gohio Commute, NOACA staff have developed a set of
performance measures, which they track on a regular basis. These performance measures fall
within four categories:
1. User Metrics – e.g. number of registered users, number of logged trips
2. Outreach and Promotion Metrics – e.g. number of Gohio Commute workshops, number of
subsites created
3. Systemwide Performance Metrics – e.g. number of non-drive alone trips logged, amount
of carbon dioxide (CO2) saved
4. Platform Administration and Enhancement Metrics – e.g. number of map layers added,
number of events created
From March 1, 2019, through May 31, 2019, 126 new users have joined Gohio Commute from
the NOACA region, bringing the total number of users to 5,936. At the March Subcommittee
meeting, staff reported 6,045 members in the NOACA region. However, in April, NOACA removed
294 users the Toledo Metropolitan Area Council of Governments (TMACOG) had added
improperly to the platform. During the previous three months, users in the NOACA region logged
over 5,904 trips, of which 92.3% were via alternative modes. This count brings the total number
of alternative trips to more than 51,500 since the platform launched. Gohio Commute users saved

5-5

 more than $16,000 in commute costs and nearly 13 tons of CO2 emissions during this period
(more than $167,000 and 146 tons of CO2 saved since 2017). There are currently 88 subsites in
the NOACA region, representing 51 different organizations. Moreover, users have created 18
challenges, 40 incentives, and 94 events on the platform.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA will spend $7,500 on Gohio Commute during FY2019. Compared to OhioRideshare,
the agency will accrue a net savings in operational costs of about $4,000 per year.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to promote Gohio Commute to interested organizations. Staff will also
continue to work with RideAmigos to make additions/improvements to the user experience.

RE:

CY 2018 Air Quality Trends Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
In its role as the air quality planning agency for Northeast Ohio, NOACA tracks, and provides,
an annual update on the region’s air quality trends and its status for the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS). NOACA published the 2018 Air Quality Trends Report (CY 2017
data) in April. Staff will complete a draft of the 2019 Air Quality Trends Report (CY 2018 data)
before the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 2019.
By and large, air quality continues to improve in Northeast Ohio. Below is a list of relevant
updates to the NAAQS status and air quality trends for the three criteria air pollutants for which
portions of Northeast Ohio remain in, or were recently in, nonattainment:
•

Ground-level ozone (O3): The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US
EPA) designated Northeast Ohio (Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage,
and Summit Counties) as a “marginal nonattainment” area for the 2015 O3 NAAQS on
April 30, 2018. US EPA based its designations on 2014-2016 3-year average O3 data.
Both Lake and Geauga Counties had design values in excess of the NAAQS.
The fourth-highest eight-hour maximum O3 level in Northeast Ohio during 2018 occurred
in Lake County. The O3 value for Lake County was 76 parts per billion (ppb), above the
2015 NAAQS of 70 ppb. As a result, the three-year O3 value for Lake County from 20162018 was 75 ppb. The three-year O3 value for Geauga County and Cuyahoga County
were 74 ppb and 71 ppb, respectively, placing them above the standard as well.
Northeast Ohio experienced thirteen (13) days during which O3 levels exceeded the 70
ppb NAAQS in 2018, up from just six (6) in 2017. We have not yet had an exceedance
day through May 31, 2019.

5-7

 •

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5): PM2.5 levels improved again in 2018. The highest
monitored concentration in Cuyahoga County was 11.1 micrograms per cubic meter
(µg/m3), down slightly from 11.2 µg/m3 in 2017. This concentration brought the 3-year
average for Cuyahoga down to 11 µg/m3 from 2016-2018, keeping the county in
compliance with the 2012 NAAQS of 12 µg/m3. Because the region met the standard for
the first time from 2015-2017, U.S. EPA redesignated Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties
as maintenance areas on April 12, 2019.

•

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Lake County was designated as a nonattainment area for the
2010 SO2 NAAQS on July 25, 2013. The annual NAAQS states that a county’s
maximum three-year average of its 99th percentile of its daily maximum one-hour SO2
levels cannot exceed 75 ppb. Lake County’s annual SO2 value rose to 53 ppb from 29
ppb, in 2018. Nevertheless, the three-year average value from 2016-2018 fell to 54 ppb
from 66 ppb, ensuring the county remained below the 75 ppb standard. Ohio EPA
initiated a redesignation request for the nonattainment area on April 8, 2018.
Cuyahoga County’s annual SO2 value was once again 41 ppb in 2018. Because the
County experienced a significant spike during 2016 (370 ppb), its 3-year average of 151
ppb remained above the NAAQS. However, the region remains in attainment, as Ohio
EPA and U.S. EPA collaborated to address the cause of the 2016 emissions spike.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will complete a draft of the 2019 Air Quality Trends Report (CY 2018 data) this month.
Staff will also continue to provide relevant updates to the Subcommittee at future meetings.

BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
Each year, NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level ozone concentrations and fine
particulate matter concentrations. In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone began March 1 and will
conclude October 31, while daily forecasts for fine particulate matter continue year-round.
NOACA posts daily air quality forecasts through AirNowTech, in affiliation with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).
AirNowTech verification statistics show that NOACA staff categorical forecasts of fine particulate
matter for CY 2019 (through May 31) were 68% accurate (Good/Moderate threshold (12.5µm))
and 100% accurate (Moderate/Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) threshold (35µm)).
AirNowTech verification statistics also show NOACA staff categorical forecasts of ozone were
slightly less accurate than those of the NOAA 6Z and 12Z model runs against the
Good/Moderate threshold (50ppb) and equally accurate compared to the NOAA model runs
against the exceedance threshold (70ppb). Against the Good/Moderate threshold, NOACA staff
predicted ozone levels with 85% accuracy compared to 89% accuracy for the NOAA model
runs. Against the exceedance threshold, NOACA staff and NOAA predicted ozone levels with
100% accuracy. There have been no exceedances and no Air Quality Advisories issued to date.
For 2019, NOACA staff will provide NOAA personnel forecast verification statistics on NOAA
model performance throughout the ozone season (March 1-October 31). NOACA staff will also
monitor its own forecast performance through verification statistics and collaborate with other
forecasters to improve its forecast protocol.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will consult with and update the Air Quality Subcommittee throughout this process.

2019 Commuter Choice Awards

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
Since 2014, NOACA’s Commuter Choice Awards have annually recognized organizations in Northeast Ohio
that promote alternative transportation modes and foster behavioral change in their employees’ commute
choices. NOACA and its partners award top employers with Gold, Silver, or Bronze ratings based on
employer support (policies, facilities, and incentives), employer location, and (starting in 2017) employee
commuter behavior. NOACA also recognizes “best in category” winners: large business, small business,
large government entity or non-profit, small government entity or non-profit. In 2019, NOACA is partnering
with Sustainable Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA), and Laketran to
sponsor the awards.
NOACA is accepting applications for the 2019 Commuter Choice Awards from May 1 through July 24.
During August, participating organizations will compete in a month-long challenge on Gohio Commute
called the NEO Clean Air Challenge. This friendly competition, complete with an up-to-the-minute
leaderboard, measures and ranks actual commuter behavior at each organization. Organizations whose
employees log the most alternative commutes during August, on a per capita basis, will boost their overall
Commuter Choice score.
In the fall, NOACA and its partners will calculate scores and select award recipients. NOACA and its
partners will distribute awards at the City of Cleveland’s annual Sustainability Summit on October 16.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will provide updates on the 2019 Commuter Choice Awards as they develop.

RE:

Corridor Recommendations for STOP Program

ACTION REQUESTED
This item is included for information and input from the Subcommittee members.
BACKGROUND
Since fiscal year 2017, NOACA has administered a consultant contract to provide technical assistance to
Northeast Ohio agencies to improve traffic signal operation on congested roadways. Since then, four
corridors have been improved by retiming a total of 96 traffic signals in 12 different communities. The
benefits of these projects over a five-year period are estimated as follows:
• Reduction of 12,630 metric tons of carbon dioxide
• Reduction of 1,637,000 hours of delay
• Reduction of 1,416,000 gallons of fuel
• Provided an average benefit-to-cost ratio of 28:1
Currently, NOACA’s consultant is in the process of studying Chester Avenue between East 13th Street and
Euclid Avenue, then along Euclid Avenue eastward to East 123rd Street, including a large number of
adjacent intersections.
For the fiscal year 2020 Signal Timing and Optimization Program (STOP), the selection process has added
vehicle probe data (collected by INRIX) in the screening, as well as all criteria used in previous corridor
selections. Potential corridors for STOP consideration in fiscal year 2020 were identified using the following
methodology:
Potential Project Corridors Selection Filter:
1. All non-freeway routes within NOACA region screened for “bottlenecks” in calendar 2018 as
identified by INRIX, with the initial screening of the worst 100 locations further refined as follows:
a. Eliminated locations with less than 100 occurrences
b. Eliminated locations with excessive delays caused by known construction
c. Eliminated locations impacted by incidents
d. Excluded unsignalized bottleneck locations
2. Corridors were developed by starting with bottleneck locations identified above, then including
adjacent road segments considering segment volume-to-capacity ratios and common sense
5 - 13
3. Define corridors based on:

 a.
b.
c.
d.

Length (minimum length of one mile)
ADT (highest ADT within corridor at least 15,000 vehicles per day)
Number of signals (minimum of 7 and maximum of 25 per corridor)
Traffic signals per mile (minimum of 4 signals per mile)

Operational Ranking Criteria
• Average Daily Traffic (maximum within corridor)
• Volume-Capacity Ratio (maximum within corridor)
• Crash density per mile (based on all crashes over length of corridor)
Other Selection Considerations
• Average Daily Truck Traffic
• Potential for travel time improvement
o Period since signals were last re-timed
o Ability to coordinate existing equipment within corridor
o Current or future construction projects expected to improve signal operation
• Presence of transit facilities
• Corridor spanning multiple jurisdictions
• Arterial is alternative route for incident management
Based on these considerations, the top corridors are:

At the meeting, the results of the analyses will be presented. The final FY 2020 corridor(s) will be selected
based on the operational criteria, emissions reductions, and Subcommittee input.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the STOP program is provided from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ)
program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS

5 - 14

 NOACA will reach out to jurisdictions identified by the screening process to confirm interest and willingness
to participate in the STOP Program. An RFP will be developed to be advertised in September-October to
allow work to begin on the next corridors in the spring.
