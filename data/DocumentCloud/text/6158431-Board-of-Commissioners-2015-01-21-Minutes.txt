A RESOLUTION HONORING THE OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP AND
ACHIEVEMENTS OF JULIE E. HAMOS, DIRECTOR OF THE ILLINOIS
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTHCARE AND FAMILY SERVICES AND
THANKING HER FOR HELPING THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND
HOSPITAL SYSTEM
WHEREAS, as Director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, Julie E. Hamos has
been an advocate and supporter of healthcare in Illinois. She worked tirelessly to insure that Illinois
government was strong and smart enough to convert the noblest of aspirations into practical and sustainable
realities that have immeasurably improved the delivery of healthcare to all in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, as Director of the largest state agency in Illinois with a budget of nearly $20 billion and with
over 2,400 employees, Julie E. Hamos was a leader who was known as a champion of the poor and disabled
in the face of huge cutbacks, bureaucratic hurdles and constricting deadlines; as a thoughtful proponent of
programs to address social injustices and as a principled and innovative thinker who recognized that good
health policy did not have to be at odds with good government. Julie E. Hamos was so frequently ahead
of her time she came to be understood more as a statesman than a politician; and
WHEREAS, as Director of the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services she was responsible
for implementing Medicaid expansion under national healthcare reform and she worked in partnership with
the Cook County Health and Hospital System to improve Cook County. Because of that successful
expansion nearly one hundred thousand previously uninsured Cook County residents had early access to
preventive and emergency services, mental health care and prescription drugs under national health care
reform. Her term will inevitably be remembered for its launching of a major redesign of Medicaid with
care coordination for Medicaid clients that has led to the financial stability of the Cook County Health and
Hospital System; and
WHEREAS, a significant impetus behind Julie E. Hamos’ achievement and exceptional empathy can be
found in the story of her early life and emigration to the United States. Born in Budapest, Hungary to
Holocaust survivors, seven-year-old Julie, her brother and parents escaped at the height of the Hungarian
Revolution in 1956 and settled in Cleveland, Ohio. The courage and hard work necessary to adapt to a
new country and culture made an imprint and guided her to an education and later a successful career
dedicated to creating solutions to assist others who confronted struggles; and
WHEREAS, after receiving her law degree in 1975 from George Washington University, Julie E. Hamos
was chosen to be the first staff attorney for a newly formed Subcommittee on Oversight of the U.S. House
Committee on Ways and Means. In her early days she assisted with implementation of the nation’s first

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 21, 2015

Earned Income Tax Credit. Later, she became Legislative and Political Action Director for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees where she focused on policy issues affecting
working men and women; and
WHEREAS, Julie E. Hamos came to Illinois to advocate for social justice including the passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment; and
WHEREAS, Julie E. Hamos was an advocate for groundbreaking laws from 1981 to 1984. Hamos served
as Legislative Counsel and Policy Advisor to then State's Attorney Richard M. Daley, advocating for the
first ever laws and policies on domestic violence and sexual assault. She was appointed in 1984 as Director
of the Child Support Division, with oversight of 300,000 child support cases; and
WHEREAS, in 1988, Hamos founded Julie E. Hamos & Associates, a public policy and community
relations consulting firm and was the Federal Monitor in various Teamster Elections and the Community
Coordinator for Development of a Downtown Chicago Circulator Transit System; and
WHEREAS, prior to being selected by Governor Quinn to run the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Human Service, Julie E. Hamos was elected State Representative by the citizens of the 18th District. She
was a distinguished member for over eleven (11) years. When she began her work in Springfield she
brought with her to the office nearly two (2) decades of experience in public interest policies and
community issues as a public interest attorney, legislative counsel, community relations consultant and
advocate; and
WHEREAS, while a Member of the General Assembly, she served as Chief Sponsor for such key health
initiatives as the Illinois Health Information Exchange and Technology Act, the Consumer’s Guide to
Health Care, the Children’s Mental Health Act, universal hearing screening for all newborns and the Older
Adults Services Act; and
WHEREAS, Julie E. Hamos’ passion and visionary thinking regarding transit lead to major improvements
to transit in Illinois. She also delivered the direction and leadership that created superior alternatives to
nursing homes for seniors and the disabled and that ushered in the passage of rental housing subsidies that
encouraged innovative and affordable housing options; and
WHEREAS, while being consistently regarded as a hard worker and dedicated team player, Julie E.
Hamos’ exceptional abilities have singled her out for distinction. In addition to many other recognitions
and awards she has received the “Excellence in Public Service Award” by Motorola Solutions Foundation,
Norwegian American Hospital Innovative and Breakthrough Leadership Award, Equal Justice Under Law
Business and Professional People for the Public Trust Award, Paul Simon Courage in Public Service
Award, Threshold Hero Award, Chicago Women in Trades Award, AARP Senior Independence Award,
American Public Transportation Association Local Distinguished Service Award, Illinois Environmental
Council Leadership Award, Aaron L. Brown Memorial Public Service Award, she was also named by the
Chicago Tribune Business Section as one of the “People to Watch”; and
WHEREAS, Julie E. Hamos has the rare distinction of excelling in each of her pursuits and for which she
was regularly honored. She was named a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government for Senior
Executives in State and Local Government and named "Top Legislator" by over 50 organizations. Crain's
Chicago Business singled her out by including her in their "25 Women to Watch".

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE, ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AND MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE SUE BRADY
WHEREAS, Sue Brady, an exceptional woman whose life was devoted to family, social justice and her
community, died on December 15, 2014 leaving behind family, countless friends and a community
profoundly enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady represented the best qualities of humanity through her life-long work as an
advocate, activist and community leader. For nearly five (5) decades, the citizens of Cook County were
the beneficiary of her tireless efforts as an indefatigable advocate for housing and social justice; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady was a woman of unique focus who devoted a substantial portion of her life to
serving her community as an elected official, as a staffer for another elected official and later in an
auxiliary capacity to government as a community activist; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady grew up on Chicago’s North Side and graduated from Mundelein College. After
she married her husband Tony in 1946, they moved to Northbrook. They became parents during the early
days of the school desegregation movement of the 1960’s. Sue and Tony resolved that each of their five
(5) children should attend desegregated schools and so moved the family to Evanston where they became
major participants and leaders in the school desegregation movement. Sue Brady became a treasured
neighbor and PTA board member; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady volunteered for the campaign for Abner Mikva when he ran for the House of
Representatives from the 10th District and after his election served on his congressional staff. Her respect

Page 41 of 255

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 21, 2015

and admiration for Mikva was returned: Judge Mikva recently described Sue Brady as “one of the most
wonderful people I have known”; and
WHEREAS, after leaving Mikva’s office when he was appointed to be a federal judge, Sue Brady was
chosen to head the Housing Resource Center of Hull House, a position she maintained until she retired in
2000; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady’s tenure at Hull House will long be remembered for ushering in a major policy
change. It was her leadership and support that was instrumental in the Chicago Housing Authority policy
shift to turn over scattered sites to private managers. Never content to limit herself to just managing an
issue from a distance, she regularly became acquainted with and knew almost all of the residents by name;
and
WHEREAS, at the same time she was making major changes in how the Chicago Housing Authority
managed public housing, Sue Brady became a popular and well-respected alderman, who was elected to
two terms as Evanston’s Third Ward Alderman from 1985 to 1993; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady was a long-time member of the League of Women Voters of Evanston. For many
of her last years she focused her energies on local government. In addition to her decades working on
housing she put her knowledge and expertise acquired as Alderman to work for the Local Government
Committee of the League of Women Voters of Evanston. The absence of her advice, friendship, and sense
of humor has left a void there that cannot easily be replaced; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady and her husband Tony shared their commitment to social justice issues very early
with their children and in so doing created a family legacy of community service. She was the matriarch
of a mighty family who have all followed her example and become leaders themselves. The beneficial
impact the Brady family has had on the region cannot be overstated; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady was always willing to contribute her leadership skills to causes she cared about.
Throughout her life she devoted substantial portions of her time to a variety of organizations such as the
Public Service Challenge, Leadership Evanston, Evanston Housing Commission and Youth Organizations
Umbrella. Most recently, she was active in the Evanston League of Women Voters and Executive Service
Corps; and
WHEREAS, Sue Brady was beloved not just in her community she was also the doting mother of five (5)
children, Eileen Brady (Brian Rohter) of Portland, Oregon; Beth Brady Keating (Anthony) of Weehawken,

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 21, 2015

URGING THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO PASS HB 172 TO RESTORE JUDICIAL
DISCRETION IN THE TRANSFER OF JUVENILES TO ADULT COURT
WHEREAS, the nation’s first juvenile court was created in Cook County 115 years ago, based on the
understanding that children are different and should be treated differently than adults; and
WHEREAS, scientific research has proven that the adolescent brain is not fully developed in the areas
that regulate rational decision making and impulse control; and
WHEREAS, 705 ILCS 405/5-130 of the Juvenile Court Act, mandates that youth predominantly 15 and
older, but as young as 13, automatically be tried as adults, in adult court, facing adult sentences, based
solely on the charge brought, which is at the exclusive discretion of the prosecutor; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is one of only 14 states that do not require a hearing in front of a juvenile court
judge before a child is transferred to adult court; and
WHEREAS, according to a study by the Illinois Juvenile Justice Initiative (JJI), since the passage of the
Automatic Transfer statute in 1982, transfers to adult court have increased from 57 annually to 86
annually as of 2012; and
WHEREAS, the number of youth charged as Automatic Transfers increased dramatically after the
passage of “Raise the Age” legislation from 96 in 2013 to 178 in 2014; and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer of youth to adult court has a direct impact on the Cook County
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) in which the average daily population of transferred youth
has nearly doubled over the last year from 72 to 138; and
WHEREAS, according to the JJI study, the implementation of Automatic Transfer has resulted in more
children being transferred to adult court for less serious crimes as compared to when judges made the
transfer decisions; and
WHEREAS, Automatic Transfer has an extreme disproportionate impact on children of color. In a three
year sample of automatic transfers in Cook County, only 83% of youth transferred were African
American, and only one youth was white; and
WHEREAS, approximately 54% of Automatic Transfer youth in the three year study by JJI ultimately
pled guilty to lesser charges that if originally charged would have been prosecuted in juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, Adult court cases are processed at a much slower pace than juvenile cases with an average
time to disposition of 369 days for Automatic Transfer youth whose cases where disposed of in the last
year; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2007 survey by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention children
prosecuted as adults are 34% more likely to reoffend than children with similar criminal histories who
are prosecuted in juvenile court for similar offenses; and
WHEREAS, “The Consequences of Transfer” a study published by the University of Chicago Press,

Page 45 of 255

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

January 21, 2015

found that children prosecuted as adults are more likely to commit more serious new crimes at a faster
rate than those tried in juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, according to analysis by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice there is no correlation
between the transferring of juveniles to adult court and the drop in youth violence across the country; and
WHEREAS, the United Nation Human Rights Committee urged the U.S. to end prosecution of juveniles
in adult court; and
WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of Illinois in People v. Patterson, urged the legislature to reform the
automatic transfer statute in Illinois stating “While modern research has recognized the effect that the
unique qualities and characteristics of youth may have on juveniles’ judgment and actions, the automatic
transfer provision does not. Indeed, the mandatory nature of that statute denies this reality. Accordingly,
we strongly urge the General Assembly to review the automatic transfer provision based on the current
scientific and sociological evidence indicating a need for the exercise of judicial discretion in
determining the appropriate setting for the proceedings in these juvenile cases”; and
WHEREAS, automatic transfer prevents any consideration by a judge of the particular characteristics of
a child, the crime, or the child’s role in the crime in determining the appropriate venue for sentencing;
and
WHEREAS, automatically transferring youth accused of certain crimes ignores the scientific research
and the underlying philosophy of the juvenile court; and
WHEREAS, Every child in Illinois deserves a fair hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to determine
whether their case is more appropriately handled in juvenile or adult court; and
WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of justice to restore judicial discretion in all decisions relating to the
transfer of a child to adult court;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to pass HB 172, which ends the Automatic Transfer of youth
to adult court and restores judicial discretion, by requiring a hearing in front of a juvenile court judge to
determine whether a child is suitable for the rehabilitative focus of the juvenile court or should be
transferred to adult court and sentenced as an adult; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of the Resolution be tendered to the Speaker of
the Illinois House of Representatives and the President of the Illinois Senate.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR GENERAL INVESTIGATION OF THE COOK
COUNTY ANIMAL AND RABIES CONTROL DEPARTMENT
WHEREAS, during testimony at the public hearings for the FY2015 Cook County Annual
Appropriation Bill and through email correspondence sent to the Board of Commissioners by residents,
concerns arose about the handling of stray dogs and cats as well as the overall operation and the budget
appropriation of the department; and
WHEREAS, the recent tragic discovery of several dead dogs and a cat that later died as well as many
other dogs that showed signs of serious and life-threatening neglect at a Dolton animal hospital shed light
on the need to look at the policies in place at the Cook County Animal and Rabies Control department;
and
WHEREAS, Cook County does not have a holding facility for stray animals, unlike most Illinois
counties, requiring municipalities to impound and hold strays or to contract with a private facility for said
services; and
WHEREAS, because the county doesn’t have a facility nor a micro-chip database for animals chipped
through Animal Control, owners may not be able to find their stray pet and could possibly end up having
their pet euthanized; and
WHEREAS, due to Cook County Animal Control’s limited hours of operation, residents have
encountered difficulty in contacting and getting assistance from County Animal Control, and municipal
police and Cook County sheriff’s police often must act as police as well as take on the additional burden
of animal control warden for after hours and holiday animal related service calls; and
WHEREAS, it is the fiduciary duty of this government to ensure that each county agency is acquiring,

managing, protecting, and using its resources, including public funds, personnel, property, equipment,
and space, economically, efficiently, and effectively; and
WHEREAS, in order to assure the public that their taxpayer dollars are being budgeted and spent
appropriately and to assuage citizens’ concerns voiced during this year’s budget hearings regarding the
policies and operation of our Animal Control Department;
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does hereby
request an independent investigation of the Cook County Animal and Rabies Control Department be
conducted by the Cook County Independent Inspector General pursuant to the Cook County Independent

the assessment level for a qualified industrial facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous
months, have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest;
and
WHEREAS, in the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed qualified for purpose of Class 6b under the SER
Program; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b SER requires the validation by the County Board of the finding that the propertyis
deemed qualified for purposes of Class 6b SER; and
WHEREAS, the industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a

the purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of

value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.

PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
THEFT OF SERVICES
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 58 Offenses and
Miscellaneous Provisions, Article II Offenses Involving Property Rights, Section 58-47 of the Cook
County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 58-47. Theft of Services.
(a) Unlawful Act. A person commits theft when he or she knowingly obtains the temporary use of
property, labor or services of another which are available only for hire, by means of refusal, threat,
deception, or knowing that such use is without the consent of the person providing the property, labor or
services. Where compensation for service is ordinarily paid immediately upon the rendering of such
service or immediately upon the request for compensation by fare collectors, refusal to pay or absconding
without payment or offer to pay gives rise to a presumption that the service was obtained by deception as
to intention to pay.
(b) Penalty. Any person violating the provisions of this Section shall be fined $100.00 for each
offense.
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
Approved and adopted this 21st of January 2015.

1)

surplus lane mile of pavement of one mile or less in length; and/or

2)

any surplus parcel of land of one acre or less that is currently under the jurisdiction of the Cook

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

The transfer of lane mile of pavement may be effectuated through the creation of an

repair or reconstruct any lane mile of pavement that is to be transferred to a standard that is
mutually agreed upon by the municipality or township; and

If in the Director’s opinion the parcel is commercially marketable, the Director may proceed

set forth in the Local Government Property Transfer Act (50 ILCS 605/1), the municipality
may acquire such parcel for a nominal consideration, upon terms and conditions approved by
the Board of Commissioners. The Director’s determination that a property is not
commercially marketable will be reviewed in deliberations of the Asset Management
Committee prior to approving any conveyance.

Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
