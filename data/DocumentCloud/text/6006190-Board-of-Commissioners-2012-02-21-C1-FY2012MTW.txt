RECONINIENDATION TO APPROVE THE AMENDMENT TO THE FY2012 MOVING TO
WORK ANNUAL PLAN PLAN FOR TRANSFORMATION YEAR 13

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners

RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the Amendment to the FY2012 Moving
To Work Annual Plan Plan For Transformation Year 13 (FY2012 MTW Annual Plan).

EXPLANATION

On January 6, 2000, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) Board of Commissioners approved the
Plan for Transformation, which called for sweeping changes in both the administration and operation
of CHA. The Plan for Transformation was approved by the US. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) and incorporated into a Moving to Work (MTW) Demonstration Agreement,
which was executed on February 6, 2000. The Agreement was subsequently amended in February
2001, requiring CHA to submit an annual plan to HUD, describing anticipated activities that will
utilize MTW ?exibility.

On June 26, 2008, CHA executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated Agreement)
between itself and HUD, which supersedes the original MTW Agreement. The Restated Agreement
extends participation in the MTW Demonstration to the end of FY2018. continued
participation in the MTW Program is contingent upon adherence to the requirements set out in the
Restated Agreement, which includes submission of an Annual Plan. The document represents CHA's
FY2012 MTW Annual Plan and details anticipated activities for FY2012.

Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) submitted its FY2012 Moving to Work (MTW) Annual Plan to
HUD on October 24, 2011. CHA determined the need to amend the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan to
re?ect additional anticipated activity in FY2012.

0 An Amendment to the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan is necessary to obtain HUD approval for
additional disposition activity and potential redevelopment funding applications for Choice
Neighborhoods or other Federal Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs) released in
FY2012.

Prior to submission of the Amendment to the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan to the Board, a 30-day
public comment period was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to
submit comments orally and in writing, regarding the information contained in the proposed
Amendment to the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan. The public comment period ran from December 29,
2011 through January 30, 2012. During such time, on January 18, 2012, a public comment hearing
was held. Prior to ?nalizing the Amendment to the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan, CHA gave
consideration to comments received during the public comment period.

To this end, CHA has complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and HUD
regulations regarding annual plans. CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners approve the
Amendment to the FY2012 MTW Annual Plan.
