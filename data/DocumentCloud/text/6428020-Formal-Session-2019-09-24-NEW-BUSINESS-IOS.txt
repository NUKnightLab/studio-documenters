RE: MATERNITY PATERNITY LEAVE FOR EMPLOYEES

As per Crain?s Detroit Business 100 Cool Places to Work (CPTW), 71% of CPTW offer
fully or partially paid parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child. Crain?s. ?100
Cool Places to Work.? Cram ?3 Detroit Business 5 August 2019, pp. 19. In an effort to
ensure Detroit can compete for the acquisition of talent, I am suggesting Detroit adopt
paternity and maternity leave policies that place us in a competitive position. In order to
obtain a high level of competitiveness, please identify the cost to provide six months of
100%, 80% and 60% paid time off for birth or adopting parents of children. In addition,
identify how these three bene?t levels would impact the City?s general fund.

Provide this report and recommendation by 15 Oct 2019. If you have any questions do
not hesitate to contact my of?ce at, 313-224-1198
