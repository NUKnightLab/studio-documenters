III.

Report from System Chief Medical Officer (continued)
National Patient Safety Awareness Week
Dr. Claudia Fegan, Chief Medical Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, stated that the
first week in March is National Patient Safety Awareness Week. She stated that the intent is to have the
National Patient Safety Awareness goals and signage placed throughout the institution; badges that
providers can wear as a reminder of the goals are also planned to be purchased and distributed.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on nurse staffing. As reported at the
Committee Meeting in January, she indicated that there were a significant number of retirements in the month
of December that impacted the nursing units; twenty-four to twenty-eight beds in the Med-Surg units were
closed in order to provide safe staffing levels.
In response to this issue, Ms. Russell stated that an orientation program was provided for agency personnel;
additionally, other nurses in the System have been screened to see if they could meet some of the standards
needed, to ensure proper training and compliance with regulations. With the increased staffing personnel and
some overtime volunteers, fourteen of the twenty-eight beds have been opened. With regard to recruiting
efforts, recruitment for six of the categories of positions (total of eighty-five positions available) has been
posted on the website. The external posting timeframe is down for the end of this week; Ms. Russell expects
that there will be some screened applicants ready for interviewing fairly soon.
Chairman Ansell referenced previous Board discussions that took place during budget deliberations, regarding
nurse staffing and nursing hours standards. He inquired whether a dashboard can be provided on the subject,
and requested that the Committee receive further information on the subject, including benchmarks, so that
progress can be tracked. Ms. Russell noted that staff is working with several local benchmarks to see where
they are as compared to hours per patient day for the inpatient units. She added that management is awaiting a
final budget to return from the County containing the number of positions approved; a position summary report
was received last week and is currently being reviewed.

V.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety
Barbara Farrell, System Director of Quality and Patient Safety, presented her report; she briefly reported that
Joint Commission readiness and preparedness activities are currently ongoing. She noted that, on the subject of
National Patient Safety Awareness Week, in conjunction with awareness, this needs to continue to be brought
steps further. The System has begun a lot of that type of activity through the utilization of the Occurrence
Reporting System; this will allow management to track and report on trends up through the Committee.
A. Quality report from Cermak Health Services of Cook County (Attachment #2)
Dr. Avery Hart, Chief Medical Officer of Cermak Health Services of Cook County, presented the Quarterly
Quality Report, regarding Suicide and Self Injurious Behavior at Cook County Jail. Included in the
presentation was information on the following subjects: Distinctions and Definitions; Suicide Prevention
Program Improvement Initiative; Self-Injurious Behavior – Causes; Self-Injury as Instrumental Behavior;
Action Steps; and various data relating to the subject.

V.

Report from System Director of Quality and Patient Safety
A. Quality report from Cermak Health Services of Cook County (continued)
Patricia Merryweather inquired whether there has been an increase seen in behavioral health or mental
health patients entering the jail. Dr. Hart responded that the screening techniques have been changed,
because the percentage of people in an urban jail having a serious mental illness, based on national figures,
is believed to be somewhere between ten and fifteen percent. He stated that the first goal is to detect those
as early as possible in the jail stay; he added that this is a case finding issue. Additionally, Dr. Hart stated
that he believes the secular rise in mental health is happening as 1) the State mental hospitals have been
closing over the years (now facing two more probable closures under the State’s new budget), and 2)
resources for outpatient therapy are drying up in the community.
Chairman Ansell recognized and thanked Dr. Hart for his thirty years of service; it was noted that Dr. Hart
will soon be retiring from the System. Chairman Ansell recalled his experience working with Dr. Hart; he
indicated that the System has been fortunate to benefit from such a dedicated physician leader.
Dr. Raju congratulated Dr. Hart on the results related to this quality measure; he indicated that this should
be submitted for nomination for a Safety Award from the National Association of Public Hospitals and
Health Systems (NAPH).

VI.

A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County (Attachment #3)
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
presented a report on the following subjects: Emergency Department Virtual Bed Status Update; Dr.
Quick/Left Without Treatment (LWOT) update; and Report on Task Forces – Emergency Medical Service
(EMS) and Outpatient Surgery Capacity. Additionally, Dr. Wakim noted that the Bylaws Committee is
working on suggested changes to the Medical Staff Bylaws; once this work is completed, the suggested
changes will be brought forward.
Chairman Ansell inquired regarding Emergency Room volume at Provident Hospital. Dr. Wakim responded
that it is a little bit higher than it was in the past, minus the EMS runs.
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the Executive Medical Staff of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, presented his report. He stated that the Annual Meeting was recently held and was well attended;
