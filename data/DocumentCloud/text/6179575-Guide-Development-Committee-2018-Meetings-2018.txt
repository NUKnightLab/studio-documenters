1. Façade rebate application for 152-1550 N Milwaukee Avenue was reviewed and approved and
will be taken to the Commissioners meeting for motion.
2. We discussed the possibility to host a visual merchandising/window display training seminar for
interested businesses and then hold a competition for best window display – this will be
worthwhile exploring with the Chamber as a combined SSA/Chamber event and done two times
per year
3. The WPB Ambassador program is launching in the coming weeks, with the following steps to be
taken:
- Finalize policy, application form and other administration including insurance certificate etc
- Onboarding of new businesses to start now
- Training and welcome for ambassadors to start in 2 weeks with walk through routes
- Formal launch to occur early-mid April
- High resources will be required of WPB staff in March to April so we agreed to not put
forward any new initiatives until we launch the program.
