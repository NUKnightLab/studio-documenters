around the world to seek a better life; and
WHEREAS, the United States has an undocumented population of eleven million
immigrants, including half a million in Illinois, more than 300,000 of which reside in

neighborhoods and communities; and

WHEREAS, our current immigration system contributes to long backlogs, labor
abuses, countless deaths on the border and vigilante violence and is in dire need of
reform to meet the challenges of the 21st Century; and
WHEREAS, any comprehensive reform must involve a path to citizenship for these
hardworking immigrants, as well as reunification of families and a safe and orderly
process for enabling willing immigrant workers to fill essential jobs in our economy and
ensure full labor rights; and
WHEREAS, U.S. Representative Luis Gutierrez has joined with U.S. Senators Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts and John McCain of Arizona to offer a comprehensive
U.S. immigration reform law known as “The Secure America and Orderly Immigration
Act”; and
WHEREAS, the immigration initiative severely punishes illegal employment practices
while creating a path to earned permanent legal status for individuals who have been
working in the United States, paying taxes, obeying the law and learning English and
protecting workers by ensuring the right to change jobs, join a union and report
abusive employment situations; and
WHEREAS, modernizing our antiquated and dysfunctional immigration system will
uphold our nation’s basic values of fairness, equal opportunity and respect for the law.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the President and the Members of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby support comprehensive
immigration reform and memorialize the Illinois Congressional delegation to urge the
passage of “The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act of 2005 (SB 1033 and
HB 2330)” that allows every hardworking, law-abiding individual to achieve the
American Dream; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to
the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the
President of the Senate and the Illinois Congressional Delegation.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance Labor Subcommittee on 5/17/2005.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, the
Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House, and the Illinois
Congressional Delegation.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Vice Chairman Moreno, moved to Amend the Proposed
Resolution (Comm. No. 271173). The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen acknowledged that the U.S. Immigration System needs reforms. He further stated
that the current system demeans participants and breaks up families. He noted, however, that poorly
regulated immigration flow raises the unemployment rate.
Chairman Murphy stated that perhaps the Resolution can be a first step in immigration reform. She further
stated that any Congressional bill would prove most effective if it addressed immigration reform on a caseby-case basis.
Commissioner Sims voiced her support of the Resolution.
Commissioner Moreno voiced his support of the Resolution. He emphasized that undocumented workers
contribute to both the work strength and the tax wealth of the United States.
Commissioner Maldonado stated the following: There is bi-partisan Congressional support for this issue.
The issue contains enough common ground that a bill most likely will be enacted by next year. Anyone
eligible for this bill must have paid taxes, learned English and obeyed the law. The existing language of “The
Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act,” addresses the issue that foreign workers should not be
allowed to undercut job availability. He stated that 77% of Americans support this type of reform.
Commissioner Hansen introduced the following Amendment to the Proposed Resolution.
