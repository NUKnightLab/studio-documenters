PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO THE COOK COUNTY AMUSEMENT TAX
WHEREAS, it is the intent of the County Board to recognize and encourage both the artists who add to
our cultural identity as well as the venues that allow them to display their talents to crowds from around the
County and around the world by exempting them from the City and County’s amusement tax for live
performances; and
WHEREAS, it is not the role of government to restrictively decide and define what is and is not ‘music’;
and
WHEREAS, to single out one or any type of music genre performed at these types of venues as not
applicable to the small venue exemption clause is not in the spirit or purpose of the exemption clause nor
the expansive definition of music;
WHEREAS, as the recording industry and music genres have evolved, the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences has recognized although sometimes more slowly than society at large, that new music
genres evolve and form, such as Rock, Rap, Reggae, Metal, Roots, Electronica, New Age etc.; and
WHEREAS, DJ’s have been considered an art form for many years now and in fact the National Academy
of Recording Arts and Sciences’ Grammy Awards created the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year,
Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously
recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance; and
WHEREAS, the first Grammy Award for such category was presented to Chicago’s very own Frankie
Knuckles whose key role in developing and popularizing House music into an internationally recognized
musical genre during the 1980s led to him being referred to as the "The Godfather of House Music."; and
WHEREAS, in 1998, the Cook County Board created an exemption to the Amusement Tax for small
venues with a maximum capacity of not more than 750 persons, and in 1999 the County Board further
amended said ordinance by defining live performances by examples giving several genre examples and art
forms including live musical performances, but does not restrict it to only those examples by including the
encompassing term “music”; and
WHEREAS, the current language contained in the County Code has created unintended and unnecessary
confusion as to what constitutes ‘music’ and has created undue burdens on venue operators who are being
required to comply with inconsistent definitions, restrictions and exemptions by the County and the City of
Chicago; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
74 Taxation, Article X, Amusement Tax, Sections 74-391 and 74-392 of the Cook County Code of
Ordinances are hereby amended as follows:
Page 64 of 73

 Sec. 74-391. - Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them
in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
Amusement means any exhibition, performance, presentation or show for entertainment
purposes, including, but not limited to, any theatrical, dramatic, musical or spectacular performance,
promotional show, motion picture show, flower, poultry or animal show, animal act, circus, rodeo, athletic
contest, sport, game or similar exhibition, such as boxing, wrestling, skating, dancing, swimming, riding
on animals or vehicles, baseball, basketball, softball, soccer, football, tennis, golf, hockey, track and field
games, bowling, or billiard and pool games. For purposes of this article, the term "amusement" shall not
mean any recreational activity offered for public participation or on a membership or other basis, including,
but not limited to, carnivals, amusement park rides and games, bowling, billiards and pool games, dancing,
tennis, golf, racquetball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding or similar activities. For purposes of this
article, the term "amusement" shall not mean raffles, as defined in 230 ILCS 15/1 (Raffles Act-definitions),

amusement, whether or not registering a score, and includes, but is not limited to, such devices as jukeboxes,
marble machines, pinball machines, video games, movie or video booths or stands and all games, operations
or transactions similar thereto under whatever name by which they may be indicated.
Charges paid means the gross amount of consideration paid for the privilege to enter, to
witness or to view an amusement, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise, including
cash, credits, property and services, determined without any deduction for costs or expenses whatsoever,
but not including charges that are added on account of the tax imposed by this article or on account of any
other tax imposed on the charge.
Department and Department of Revenue means the County Department of Revenue.
Live theatrical, live musical or other live cultural performance means a live performance in
any of the disciplines which are commonly regarded as part of the fine arts, such as live theater, music
(including disc jockey (DJ) activities as further prescribed in Sec. (d) (1), opera, drama, comedy, ballet,
modern or traditional dance, and book or poetry readings. The term does not include such amusements as
athletic events, races, or performances conducted at adult entertainment cabarets (as defined in Section
14.2.1 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance).
Maximum capacity means the persons that an auditorium, theater or other space may
accommodate as determined by the local fire department or other appropriate governmental agency;
provided, however, that maximum capacity shall not exceed the maximum number of tickets or admissions
that may be made available for sale to a performance as stated in any binding written agreement relating to
that performance. If the number of tickets or admissions actually sold to a performance exceeds the legally
permissible limit, then, for purposes of determining the applicable tax, the term "maximum capacity" shall
mean such greater number.

such place;
(2) With respect to the owner of an amusement, any person which has an ownership or
leasehold interest in such amusement or any person who has a proprietary interest in the

property.

recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties. The masculine, feminine, singular and plural are
included in any circumstance.
Resale means the resale of a ticket or other license to an amusement after the ticket or other
license has been sold by the owner, manager or operator of the amusement, or by the owner, manager or
operator of the place where the amusement is being held, to an independent and unrelated third party.
Reseller means a person who resells a ticket or other license to an amusement for
consideration. The term includes, but is not limited to, ticket brokers and applies whether the ticket is resold
by bidding, consignment or otherwise and whether the ticket is resold in person, at a site on the Internet or

Page 66 of 73

 (b) The tax imposed by subsection (a) of this section may be waived for the following
persons or privileges, after approval by the Department of Revenue or, if applicable, the Cook County
Board of Commissioners:
(1) The privilege of witnessing any stock show or business show that is not open to the

Page 67 of 73

 g.

Societies or organizations conducted for the sole purpose of maintaining symphony

Receives substantial support from voluntary contributions;

2.

Is a not-for-profit institution where no part of the net earnings inure to the
benefit of any private shareholder or person; and

3.

Either (i) bears all risk of financial loss from its presentation of the amusement,
where the amusement takes place at a venue that is owned or operated by a notfor-profit institution, no part of whose net earnings inure to the benefit of any
private shareholder or person, and where the amusement is limited to an
engagement of not more than four calendar days over the course of a calendar
year, or (ii) is substantially and materially involved in the production and
performance of the amusement. Where an amusement is sponsored or
conducted by two or more artistic societies or organizations, the requirements
of subsections (b) (3)g.1. and 2. of this section must be met by each of such
artistic societies or organizations, but the requirements of subsection (b)(3)g.3.
may be met by any of such artistic societies or organizations, individually or in
combination.

(c) None of the exemptions contained in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be granted
unless a written application for exemption is filed with the Department at least 45 calendar days prior to the
amusement event or 15 calendar days prior to the date that admission tickets to the amusement are first
made available for sale, whichever is earlier. The application shall be on a form prescribed by the Director
of Revenue and shall contain all information necessary to permit the Department to determine whether the
exemption claimed by the applicant is applicable. If the department determines that by granting the
exemption the potential loss of tax revenue will be greater than $150,000.00 the application shall be
submitted to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for final approval. The County Board may deny
the exemption application if it finds that the exemption is not in the best economic interest of the County.
(d) The tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to or be imposed upon:
(1) The admission fees to witness in person, live theatrical, live musical or other live
cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in the
County, whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is not
more than 750 persons.
a. For purposes of subsection (d)(1), the Department will assume that the activities of
the DJ qualify as a live cultural performance where both of the following conditions
exist:
1. The pre-recorded material used by the DJ was recorded by the DJ. This may be
original work composed by the DJ or the work of other artists that the DJ has mixed
or otherwise modified.
Page 68 of 73

 2. The DJ is paid substantially above the rate that would be paid solely for the service
of playing the pre-recorded material of other artists. The Department will assume
that the payment of $2,000 or more for a single performance qualifies the event for
this provision.
b. Where the activities of a DJ do not qualify for the provision set forth in Subsection
(d)(1)a. 1. and 2. of this section, they may nevertheless qualify as a live cultural
performance if at least four of the five following factors apply:
1. The DJ is featured in advertisements for the venue.
2. The DJ is visible to patrons of the venue, who spend a substantial amount of time
observing the DJ’s performance.
3. The DJ is featured more prominently than other amusements or activities available
at the venue.
4. The patrons are charged substantially above the amount that would be paid for
entry into the venue in the absence of the DJ. For purposes of this provision, the
term “substantially above” means at least one and a half times the amount that
would be charged without the DJ.
5. The DJ is represented by a manager and/or agent.
(2) Initiation fees and membership dues paid to a health club, racquetball club, tennis club
or a similar club or organization, when such club or organization is organized and
operated on a membership basis and for the recreational purposes of its members and
its members' guests, shall be exempt from the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this
section. This exemption shall not be construed to apply to any fees paid or based upon
a per-event or a per-admission basis.
(3) Fees or other charges paid by a patron for the privilege of witnessing, viewing or
participating in an amusement, solely within the confines of such patron's home, shall
be exempt from the imposition of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section. For
purposes of this exemption, the term "home" means the permanent dwelling residence
of the patron. For patrons who live in condominium buildings, apartment buildings or
other multiple-unit structures, the individual dwelling unit the patron occupies shall be
considered the patron's home.
(e) For the purpose of determining the amount of the amusement tax due under this article,
admission fees or other charges shall be computed exclusive of:
(1) Any Federal, State or municipal taxes imposed upon the amusement patron.

Page 69 of 73

 (2) Any amounts subject to other Cook County taxes (with the exception of County
Retailers' Occupation Tax), provided such County taxes are separately listed on the
ticket of admission and the corresponding Cook County tax has been paid on that
separately stated amount.
(3) Any separately stated optional charges for nonamusement services or for sales of
tangible personal property.
(f) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present or conduct any amusement without
collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
(1) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be one percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
more than 750 persons and less than 5,000 persons.
(2) The rate of the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section shall be 1.5 percent of the
admission fees or other charges to witness in person live theatrical, live musical or other
live cultural performances that take place in any auditorium, theater or other space in
the County whose maximum capacity, including all balconies and other sections, is
5,000 persons or more.
(g) It shall be presumed that all amusements are subject to tax under this article until the
contrary is established by books, records or other documentary evidence.
(h) It is unlawful for any person to produce, present, conduct, or resell tickets to, any
amusement without collection of the tax, except as provided in this article.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.

skill, experience, or ability possessed by a particular source. The Using Agency must submit a letter to
the CPO justifying the sole source Procurement, and provide any other documents or information
required by the CPO. At least 30 days prior to concurrence with any proposed contract, the CPO shall
provide such letter to the Board of Commissioners.
Sec. 34-140. - Comparable government procurement.
If a governmental agency has awarded a contract through a competitive method for the same or similar
supplies, equipment, goods or services as that sought by the County, the Procurement may be made from
that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as that obtained by that government agency without
utilizing a competitive procurement method set forth in this Procurement Code. Prior to the award of any
contract pursuant to this section, the contracting agency shall provide to the CPO a detailed summary
setting forth the justification for use of such reference contract including, but not limited to: the date,
scope, subject matter and pricing of the original contract; a summary of the bid procedures of the original
contracting authority; the basis for the County not entering its own competitive bidding process, as well
