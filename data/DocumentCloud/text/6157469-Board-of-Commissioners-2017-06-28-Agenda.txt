BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 38 Health and
Human Services, Division 1, Sec. 38-113 through Sec. 38-144 of the Cook County Code, is
hereby amended as follows:
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY
***

Sec. 38-113. - Duties.
The Medical Examiner has and shall exercise the powers, duties, responsibilities, functions
and authority provided by ordinance for those purposes and functions. Any abuse by the Medical
Examiner of the authority contained in this ordinance [article] shall be deemed cause for
removal.
***
Sec. 38-132. - Identified body; public disposition.
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and an authorized
person cannot or will not assume responsibility for final disposition of the decedent within 30
days of the death of the decedent, the Medical Examiner shall have the authority to dispose of the
body by public disposition. Notwithstanding the above, where the decedent's next of kin objects
to public disposition by donation to science prior to transfer of the body, the Medical Examiner's
Office shall have the authority to dispose of the body by cremation. Disposition of fetal remains
may be by burial when available or by cremation.
***
Sec. 38-136. - Permission to embalm.
In the interest of public health and hygiene and the preservation of the dignity of the

deceased, anybody any body that is stored in the facility more than three days after death may be
embalmed at the discretion of the Medical Examiner without the permission of the deceased
person's next-of-kin.
***
Sec. 38-139. - Permit required for cremation.
(a) Where the remains of any dead human body are to be cremated, thus becoming
unavailable for later examination, it shall be the duty of the funeral director or person having
custody of the dead human body to obtain from the Medical Examiner a Ppermit to Ccremate.
(b) The Medical Examiner may deny a Ppermit to Ccremate, if it is necessary to preserve
the body for law enforcement purposes.
(c) The Medical Examiner's Ppermit shall be presented to the local registrar in applying for
the permit for disposition of a dead human body provided for in 410 ILCS 535/21 of the "Vital
Records Act," as heretofore or hereafter amended.
(d) No crematory shall cremate a dead human body unless a permit for disposition of a dead
human body with an attached Medical Examiner's Ppermit to Ccremate has been furnished to
authorize the cremation.
***
Sec. 38-144. - Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section
32-1 of this Code.
(1) Autopsy report.
(2) Toxicology report.
(3) Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.
(4) Permit to Ccremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical
Examiner, by facsimile or electronic filing, unless the Medical Examiner determines that
the decedent and the authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or
other special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's discretion.

(5) Return fee. The return fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after
determining that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of
the burial shell and the burial cost.
(6) Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one
year of the person's death (due to a return by Ffuneral Hhome). The Office of the
Medical Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for
amendments made to a death certificate after one year of the death.
(7) Storage fee. This fee covers bodies returned (by funeral homes) to the Office of the
Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and bodies
brought to the Medical Examiner's Office from hospice, nursing homes, and hospitals
for cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Section 38-118.
The ability to accept cases for storage will be at the discretion of the Medical Examiner
and will depend on the current and anticipated morgue census. This "storage fee"
discourages the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a storage location for
non-Medical Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from the Medical
Examiner's Office to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify that
families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical
Examiner. In the cases of funeral homes, this "storage fee" would replace the "return
fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body
being stored is not picked up within ten days from the date of storage, the body will be
disposed of in accordance with Sec. 38-132. held and buried by the County according to
the standard operating procedures of the Medical Examiner
(8) Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.
(9) Charge to non-County owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains not falling
under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.
(10) Confirmation of death letter.
(11) Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or program
seeking to procure tissue from bodies located at the Medical Examiner's Office. The
fee covers tissue procurement per body by a tissue procurement facility or program
authorized by the Medical Examiner.
(12) Student and resident rotation fee. Fee charged to institutions outside of Cook County
providing student and resident rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the
County's costs for disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the rotation.

(13) Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review
slides, images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for
supervising such review.

Toxicology send-out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and
specimens to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next-of-kin for testing.

(15) Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical Examiner and
County Board to use the Medical Examiner's Office and supplies for teaching
purposes.
(16) Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for case review, expert
consultation and trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner, Assistant Chief
Medical Examiner Assistant Medical Examiners, and Toxicologists for Medical
Examiner cases leading to civil litigation. The Chief Medical Examiner shall be
authorized to waive or reduce said fees where warranted and shall be authorized to
issue regulations regarding expert witness fees. Such fees will not apply to criminal
proceedings related to Medical Examiner cases.
(17) Cremation Ffee. Fee charged for cremation and storage of decedents cremated and
stored by Cook County. Cremation fees shall be paid to the Cook County Medical
Examiner prior to the release of the cremated remains, unless the Medical Examiner
determines that the decedent and the authorized person is indigent and unable to pay
the cremation fee, or other special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical
Examiner's discretion.
