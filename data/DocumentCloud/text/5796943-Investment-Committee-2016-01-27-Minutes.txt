Re: CEM Benchmarking Retention
Resolution Moved By: Trustee Cetlinski – Supported By: Trustee Higgs
WHEREAS, the Executive Director presented a proposal to the Board from CEM
Benchmarking which sets forth various benchmarking objectives and tools regarding
the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the operation of the Retirement System of the
City of Detroit (“RSCD”), and
WHEREAS, the Executive Director and senior management believe such benchmarking
will assist management in streamlining operations and gauging cost effectiveness and
efficiency related to the RSCD operations, and
WHEREAS, the Board has considered the recommendation of the Executive Director
and agrees that benchmarking performance is in the best interest of the RSCD.
Following discussion of the foregoing motion, the motion failed, due to lack of support:
Yeas: Anthony, Cetlinski, Hatty, Naglick, Higgs - 5
Nays: Benson, Cowan, Johnson, Nickleberry and Sheehan - 5
Trustee Cowan was not in support of this motion because:
1. A Request for Proposal was not sent out for advertisement.
2. Other companies were not given the opportunity to submit a proposal.
3. I don’t feel that this is the appropriate time to have this done.
“My focus is to keep in mind, as a Trustee, the importance of fulfilling my fiduciary
responsibility to be prudent in utilizing the funds wisely and providing restoration to our
retirees pension check as soon as possible.”
