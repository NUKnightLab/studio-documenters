Project Introduction
Palace Sports and Entertainment (“PSE”) and Henry Ford Health System are the project
developers (the “Developers”) for the Plan which entails the construction of a corporate
headquarters and practice facility for the Detroit Pistons National Basketball Association
team. The facility is expected to include approximately 128,000 square feet of office
space, locker and training rooms and a practice facility, all within a single facility (the
“Pistons Facility”). The Pistons Facility is expected to include ground-floor retail or
commercial space for uses that may include a team store, restaurant and/or bank.
The Plan also includes an approximately 25,000 square foot sports medicine and medical
office building to be constructed, owned and operated by HFHS. The Pistons Facility and
the HFHS Facility will be joined by an approximately 400 space above-grade parking
structure. It is estimated that 120 temporary construction jobs will be created at the overall
property and 150 permanent jobs will be created in connection with the Pistons Facility.

buildings. The project proposes the reuse of the Herman Kiefer complex buildings and
the former Crosman and Hutchins schools into commercial uses. Residential homes will
be rehabilitated to the extent possible and leased or sold. Vacant land will be put into
productive reuse.
The total investment is estimated to be approximately $143 million. The Developer is
requesting $47,767,473.00 in TIF reimbursement.

1110 Clairmount and 8700 Byron, the Hutchins School at 1501 Hazelwood and the
Crosman School at 9027 John C Lodge have all been declared facilities pursuant to Part
201 by the MDEQ. The 510 surrounding residential parcels (see Attachment B in the
Plan) have been initially determined to be blighted per Act 381 via an initial determination
of blight letter from Detroit City Planning Commission staff. Documents supporting these
determinations can be found in Attachments B, G and H of the Plan.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out in four (4) phases at the Property

response activities, environmental insurance, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement,
site preparation, infrastructure improvements, preparation of a brownfield plan and work
plan, a 15% contingency as well as 5% simple interest after expiration of tax abatements.
