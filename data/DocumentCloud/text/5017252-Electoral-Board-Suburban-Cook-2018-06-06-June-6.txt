ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Asset Management, Department of Capital Planning and Policy
(“BAM/DCPP”) seeks to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions at County facilities; and
WHEREAS, to promote a healthy environment and the use of clean energy sources, BAM/DCPP
purchased electric charging stations for the charging of electric vehicles that are utilized for County
operations and the public at large; and
WHEREAS, the Master Services and Subscription Agreement (“Agreement”) that was entered into in 2017
as a result of the purchase of ChargePoint, Inc. charging stations provides for the charging station
subscription services for the one vehicle installed ChargePoint Level II station at six County sites including
Bridgeview, Markham, Rolling Meadows and Skokie Courthouses and at Des Plaines and Riverdale
Department of Transportation & Highways locations; and
WHEREAS, ChargePoint has the nation’s largest network of electric vehicle charging stations with about
47,800 charging spots throughout the country; and
WHEREAS, as of 2017, ChargePoint has averaged nationally, over one million charging events per month,
that’s equivalent to the emissions avoided from almost 670,000 gallons of gasoline saved each month; and
WHEREAS, the ChargePoint network is available to all users; and
WHEREAS, the County through BAM/DCPP has a ChargePoint Assure Full Service and Maintenance
Support Program (“Maintenance Plan”) with ChargePoint Assure for each County owned charging station
that will continue for three years from the activation date for each station; and
WHEREAS, the Maintenance Plans for the Bridgeview, Markham, Rolling Meadows and Skokie
Courthouses; and the Des Plaines and Riverdale Department of Transportation & Highways locations began
in August 2017 and provide for two one-year renewal options; and
WHEREAS, BAM/DCPP’s Agreement with ChargePoint activates vehicle owner accessibility to the
County’s charging stations and allows for the collection and processing of any station charging fees
established by BAM/DCPP; and
WHEREAS, BAM/DCPP established minimal charging session fees to help cover the County’s costs; the
daily rates set were $0.99 for one (1) hour, $1.98 for two (2) hours, $3.98 for three (3) hours and $5.98 for
four (4) hours of charging; and
WHEREAS, ChargePoint receives 10% of all session fees and in return ChargePoint processes all forms
of payment and reimburses the County 90% of all session fees; and

 WHEREAS, ChargePoint began collecting charging fees at the six (6) County owned stations as of August
28, 2017 and has collected $288.97 in session fees; and
WHEREAS, since the August 2017 start dates and through April 2018, the Cook County stations have
been used 316 times, saving an estimated 695 kilograms of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to 1,708
miles driven by an average passenger vehicle or 73 gallons of gas avoided; and
WHEREAS, the County has used the ChargePoint network to help vehicle owners locate the stations and
check availability, collect payment for charging if it is desired, provide support to station users and owners,
and access to the dashboard to see if stations are being used, in need of repair, and functioning efficiently.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County recognizes
BAM/DCPP’s implementation of the minimal session fee and authorizes BAM/DCPP to modify the hourly
charging session fees commensurate with market conditions; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in an effort to recognize National Drive Electric Week, which occurs
annually in September and is a nationwide opportunity to heighten awareness of the benefits of all-electric
and plug-in hybrid-electric cars, trucks, motorcycles, and more, the President and Board of Commissioners
authorizes BAM/DCPP to waive the County’s charging session fees during the annually recognized
National Drive Electric Week and provide free charging sessions at the County’s Bridgeview, Markham,
Rolling Meadows and Skokie Courthouse charging stations and the Des Plaines and Riverdale Department
of Transportation and Highways charging stations.

RESOLUTION

LARRY SUFFREDIN AND JEFFREY R. TOBOLSKI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS HOUSE BILL 4634
SENATE BILL 3228 TO OFFER OPPORTUNITY FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS
SERVING LIFE SENTENCES THE CHANCE FOR PAROLE
WHEREAS, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled six years ago that sentencing schemes that require life sentences
with no hope of parole for crimes committed by juveniles violated the U.S. Constitution; and
WHEREAS, on May 6, 2018, the Injustice Project, in partnership with the Chicago Sun-Times, published
an article stating that in Illinois more than 160 prisoners are serving life sentences for crimes they committed
as juveniles, with virtually no hope of parole or early release under current law; and
WHEREAS, using Illinois Department of Corrections data, Injustice Watch examined the number of
prisoners serving 50 or more years in prison who were taken into custody before their 18th birthday; and,
WHEREAS, because Illinois almost entirely abolished parole in 1978, the 167 juvenile offenders do not
get the same chance to show rehabilitation and change that they might get in other states. The only juvenile
offenders with parole opportunities are the aging handful who were convicted before the law changed four
decades ago; and
WHEREAS, courts across the country varied standards on what length of a prison term can legally be
considered a life sentence, and whether and when they should be eligible for parole; and
WHEREAS, at least 13 other states and Washington, D.C., have passed laws giving young offenders a
chance to ask for parole release or a sentence reduction after first serving as few as 12 and as many as 35
years in prison, depending on the state and severity of the crime; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Senate Criminal Law Committee last month sent to the full Senate a bill that would
permit inmates who committed crimes before the age of 21 the periodic chance to ask for parole, after first
serving 10 years for lesser crimes and 20 years for first-degree murder or aggravated sexual assault; and
WHEREAS, research indicates that incarceration has a jarring effect on life expectancy, a study by
Vanderbilt University Professor Evelyn Patterson found each year of incarceration likely reduces a
prisoner’s life expectancy by two (2) years.

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
support and encourage the 100th General Assembly of the State of Illinois in the passage of Senate Bill
3228.

WHEREAS, the Chicago region is rich in assets, including diverse industries, a highly skilled workforce
and essential infrastructure; has the potential to perform better by working collaboratively and collectively

leading to growth, investment and the creation and retention of quality jobs; and
WHEREAS, after working collaboratively and cooperatively together for four years, said leaders deemed

of this initiative and launched the Chicago Regional Growth Corporation (CRGC) in January 2018 with a
founding board of directors; and
WHEREAS, CRGC now provides the organizational infrastructure for the group’s ongoing collaboration
and will coordinate development opportunities in northeastern Illinois, creating programs, building
networks and providing more efficient economic development tools and resources to grow the region’s
economy, including, but not limited to:


the region's freight transportation system by standardizing truck permitting.



Advancing these efforts in the region's economically distressed communities to create high- quality,

contribute $75,000.00 annually to CRGC for the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years for a total of $150,000 and
recognizes that evidence of Cook County’s financial support will assist CRGC in securing additional public
and private funding; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, through its Bureau of Economic Development, desires to enter into an
agreement with CRGC to participate in and financially support CRGC; and
WHEREAS, Cook County through the Bureau of Economic and CRGC share the common goals of
promoting economic development and creating economic opportunities for local residents and businesses.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
authorize the Chief of the Bureau of Economic Development, or his or her designee, to enter into an
agreement with CRGC, including payment of $75,000.00 for fiscal year 2018 and an additional $75,000.00

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF SHERIFF'S OFFICE CONDUCTING
COOK COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT’S BACKGROUND CHECKS
WHEREAS, An investigative report recently exposed multiple counts of sexual abuse of Chicago Public
School (CPS) students at the hands of staff and teachers; and,
WHEREAS, Ineffective background checks or the disregard of negative background checks exposed
students to educators and staff with criminal convictions and arrests for sex crimes against children; and,
WHEREAS, Although all school districts require potential school staff, volunteers and contract workers
to pass a background check before they work with students, the report cited a lack of control over
commissioning, receipt, and action of information received from background checks; and,
WHEREAS, Currently the Chicago Police Department, like CPS a department of the City of Chicago,
conducts criminal background checks on all CPS potential staff; and,
WHEREAS, The background check function could be directed to an outside vendor, however, such a
contract would still be under the management and control of a department of the City of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, As is best practice in law enforcement, currently the city and the county operate a separation
of powers in law enforcement functions; and,
WHEREAS, It is imperative to have separation of power to ensure all units of government are performing
its core functions to the highest standard; and,
WHEREAS, The Cook County Sheriff’s Office has the ability to conduct in depth criminal background
checks, including criminal records, educational credentials, and prior employment on potential staff and
conduct random checks to catch the arrests of current staff; and,
WHEREAS, It is the first duty of any unit of government to ensure the protection of children, especially
those entrusted in the care of such government.
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall direct
the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to explore the feasibility of conducting background checks for school
districts in the County of Cook; and,
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners directs the
Cook County Sheriff’s Office and all other various stakeholders to work together to suggest any necessary

 public policy determinations or procedural changes necessary to allow the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to
conduct such background checks.
