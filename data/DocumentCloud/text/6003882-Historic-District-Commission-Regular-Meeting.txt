STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6181
ADDRESS: 2081 VERMONT
HISTORIC DISTRICT: CORKTOWN
APPLICANT: JIM KORF
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 5-2-2019

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
Erected ca. 1900, the dwelling at 2081 Vermont is a 1 1/2–story, wood-frame shotgun-plan dwelling.
The home features a front-gabled roof which is covered with asphalt shingles. An historic brick chimney
tops the roof. Exterior walls are covered with aluminum siding at the front/east and south/side
elevations. The original lapped wood siding is visible at the rear and north elevations. A small portion
of the original siding can be viewed at the front elevation as several sections of the aluminum siding
have fallen off. The original brick foundation wall is visible at the rear elevation and the rear ½ of the
side elevations. A wood skirting is at the front elevation and wraps around the front ½ of the side
elevations. A concrete block foundation is located to the rear of the building. The front porch features
a flat roof, turned wood supports/columns, and a wood deck and stairs. The porch roof intersects with
a projecting flat-roof, three-window bay. Original 2/2 wood windows (with associated wood trim)
remain at the side and rear elevations, while 1/1 wood sash (with associated wood trim) are found at
the front elevation bay window. A single fixed wood window is located at the front elevation, attic story.
The existing front entrance is a non-historic metal door.

With the current submission, the applicant is seeking this body’s approval to rehabilitate the home.
Specific work items which have been submitted to this body for consideration include the following:
Front/East Elevation
• Replace existing aluminum siding and original lapped wood siding underneath with new lapped
wood siding (dimensions and reveal to match original) and new wood 1x4 trim (to match
existing). Note that the historic wood siding is currently covered with aluminum. The condition
and detailing of the siding, to include the corner trim, is not visible/discernable

• Please see the attached, which outlines the proposed color scheme. A cream color is
proposed for the body, a light brown color is proposed of the trim, and a light blue color
new window sash. Note, that neither the cream nor the brown color appears in the
property’s assigned color chart B. Also, while the blue color does appear in color chart
B, it is only prescribed for use on the house body.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Please note that staff conducted a field visit to the site and found that the visible (the areas not covered
with aluminum siding) original lapped wood siding appeared to be in a condition which does not merit
a wholesale replacement. Also, if replacement of the original siding, corner boards, and window trim
is necessary, staff feels that the current application does not adequately indicate that the elements will

 be replicated. Much of these details are currently covered with aluminum and the submitted drawings
do not provide details re: the existing condition of the elements and the proposed replacement elements
so that it is clear that the new will be an exact replication. Finally, please note that the following
proposed work items do not exactly replicate the existing/historic:
•
•
•
•

The existing front porch roof is flat. The proposed/new front porch roof is hipped
New wood skirting is proposed to clad the brick at the rear ½ portion of the side elevation
foundation walls and the rear foundation will
The brick chimney is proposed to be removed
The existing original 2/2 wood windows at the side elevations are proposed to be replaced
with new 1/1 wood windows

•
It appears that the roof will be raised as the new windows proposed for the front and rear gable ends are
larger than the current windows. However, this work item is unclear as the current application does not
provide height dimensions and pitch for the existing vs the proposed. Staff did pose this question to the
applicant, but has not received an answer as of the date of this report’s completion.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. Most residential buildings in the district range from one story to two and one-half (2
1/2) stories tall, with a four-story apartment building on Porter. Commercial buildings and
industrial buildings range in height from one to five (5) stories tall; the Victorian commercial
buildings are between two (2) and three (3) stories tall. Institutional buildings range from one to
three (3) stories.
(2)

Proportion of buildings' front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the age,
style, and type of building. One story workers' cottages are slightly wider than tall to the peak
of the gable; two-story pre-1880's residential buildings are generally taller than wide. Side-byside duplexes are either wider than tall or square in proportion; terraces or attached rowhouses,
when grouped together, are substantially wider than tall, although the individual units may appear
taller than wide. Queen Anne style residences are generally slightly wider than tall or as tall as
wide to the eaves to their roofs. The church buildings in the district are taller than wide, and
other institutional buildings are generally wider than tall. Victorian commercial buildings are
generally taller than wide, while newer commercial buildings in the district may be wider than
tall. Multistoried industrial buildings in the district are usually taller than wide while one- or
two-storied industrial buildings are wider than tall. The fire station on Bagley at Sixth is wider
than tall.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facades. Window openings are usually taller than wide but
square openings and transom window openings which are wider than tall also exist. Several
windows are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window openings are
almost always subdivided, the most common window being the double-hung sash, whose sashes
are generally further divided by muntins, resulting in two-over-two, four-over-four, or six-oversix lights. There are a great variety of sizes and shapes of window openings in the Queen Anne
style buildings, while there is a more regular arrangement in the earlier pre-1880's buildings.
Facades have approximately five (5) percent to seventy-five (75) percent of their area glazed;
residential buildings generally fall into the thirty-two (32) to thirty-five (35) percent range.

 (4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Pre-1880's buildings in the Italianate and Greek
revival styles display a great regularity in the rhythm of solids to voids, with one opening placed
directly above the other. The post-1880's Queen Anne style buildings exhibit a greater freedom,
with their bay windows and combinations of windows in gables.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The original pattern of spacing of buildings on streets
was the of houses placed very close together. Most houses were situated on twenty-five-foot lots,
the major exceptions being in the Lognon Farm where most lots were thirty-three feet wide and
where a house was infrequently placed on an undivided fifty-foot lot. Houses on narrow lots
were usually placed on or closer to a side property line, providing more space on one side of the
building. Rhythm has been interrupted by vacant lots due to demolition of buildings almost
throughout the district.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most houses in the district have projecting front
porches, usually on one side of the front facade and sometimes wrapping around to the side,
especially on corner lots. Some Victorian houses have a secondary porch at the side.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The great majority of buildings in the district are wood frame structure
originally clad in clapboard with wooden skirting or brick foundations. Some have more recently
been sheathed in aluminum, vinyl or asphalt siding, and original skirting has often been replaced
with metal skirting or concrete block foundations. Window sash and functional and decorative
trim are in wood, and wood is frequently the only material below the eaves of a building, except
for the window glass. There are some brick residential buildings in the district, the majority of
these being duplexes and multi-unit dwellings. The small commercial buildings the industrial
buildings, the fire station, and most of the institutional buildings in the district are brick. Roofing
material is primarily asphalt shingles, although a few wood shingle roofs and one slate roof exist
in the district.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of
clapboard to the smooth surface of wood trim. Aluminum or vinyl siding of the same width as
the original clapboard siding that does not alter the relationship of the siding to the functional
trim and architectural detail of the building can sometimes contribute to textural relationships.
Porches are usually in wood, although some have brick piers. Steps are either in wood which
was the original material, or concrete. Where wooden shingles, carvings, or other decorative
wooden detail exists, it adds significantly to the textural interest of the building. Asphalt shingles
or rolled asphalt roofs generally have little textural interest while wood shingle has considerable
interest. Detailed brickwork on brick buildings contributes to textural interest when it exists.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Paint colors in the district generally relate to style. Earlier buildings
usually display muted colors, such as earth tones and shades of yellow, while Italianate and
Queen Anne style buildings sometimes display richer and darker colors, such as browns, golds,
grays, and blues. Common trim colors are in shades of cream, yellow, gray, brown, green, and
white, and window sashes are frequently painted white, deep red, brown and gray. Asphalt siding
is either red or brown brick color. Wood shingle roofs are a weathered cedar tone, while most
asphalt shingled roofs are either in light colors, such as sand, light gray, light brown, or light

 green, or darker colors, such as dark gray, black, or dark green.
(10)

Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style, and the styles in Corktown
run from early Victorian to late Victorian and Colonial Revival. The earliest houses in the Greek
Revival and vernacular styles contain a minimal amount of architectural detail. Functional detail
includes the wooden cornerboards, wide cornices with brackets supporting the eaves, and
window frames and sills. More ornate details of the Italianate or Queen Anne styles include
paired brackets, window and porch hoods, wooden carvings sunburst patterns, fishscale shingles,
and vergeboards in gables, and spindlework or balustraded porches. Some buildings, especially
those on Church Street, have leaded glass windows. The late Victorian commercial buildings
sometimes have decorative cornice work, corbeltables, and pediments or parapet walls. In
general, Corktown is rich in its diversity and quality of architectural styles and detail.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Pitched roofs with frontal gables predominate in the district although
pitched roofs with side-facing gables, hip roofs, and hip roofs with intersecting gables also exist.
More complex roof shapes occur primarily on Church Street. Commercial buildings generally
have flat roofs. St. Peter's Episcopal Church has a steeply pitched roof with frontal gables. Rear
additions to houses, such as kitchens, frequently have shed roofs.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their fairly
uniform setbacks within blocks. Mature and recently planted trees along the tree lawns create a
secondary wall of continuity.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of
individual properties is a shallow flat front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a concrete walk
leading to the front entrance and sometimes a concrete walk leading to the side entrance. Short
concrete walks from the curbline to the public sidewalk are also frequent in the district.
Foundation plantings and evergreens are typical plantings in front yards. Hedges are occasionally
planted along the side lot lines in the front yards and sometimes along the front lot line; this
treatment usually on comer lots when it exists. Chainlink fences predominate as rear yard
enclosures; few continue into the front yards. Wood posts and rails with wire mesh is also a
common fence type found in the district, and a few of these enclose the front yard as well as the
rear. Many rear garages with alley entrances exist; concrete side driveways, where they exist,
interrupt the succession of front yards and are not the original treatment of the property. Curbs
are cut red-brown stone in the majority of the district, with the primary exceptions of Porter,
Labrosse, Leverette, and Michigan Avenue, Alleys in the district are paved in concrete. Vacant
lots are either paved over or gravelled as parking lots or are unkept. Light fixtures are elevated
on wooden telephone poles in most parts of the district.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Open space occurs in the form of vacant land, a
playground, and parking lots, and frequently occurs on corner lots. Open space in the form of
front yards to buildings is generally very shallow. Some buildings are situated on the front lot
line or very close to it; this usually occurs on north-south streets east of Rosa Parks Boulevard,
and on Porter Street.

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. The majority of buildings in the district are small in scale,

 with the exceptions being multistory industrial buildings and apartment buildings, which are
medium to large in scale and therefore not in keeping with the original scale of the neighborhood.
Facade elements, such as bays, steep roofs, gables and/or verandas, are moderate in scale. Details
within these elements are generally small in scale.
(16)

Directional expression of front elevation. One story residences are usually slightly wider than tall
but their directional expression is vertical due to the gable of the steeply pitched roof. Two-story
Italianate and Greek Revival single-family residences are vertical in directional expression, while
duplexes in those styles are usually neutral. Two-story Queen Anne buildings are either neutral
in directional expression or have vertically expressed front facades, depending on the projection
of gables and/or roof slopes. Terraces are horizontal in directional expression, churches are
emphatically vertical, and industrial buildings are either vertically or horizontally expressed,
depending on the number of stories. Individual Victorian commercial buildings are usually
vertical but may form a commercial row that is horizontal.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks vary from area to area within the district, although they
are usually consistent within blocks. In general, buildings have very shallow front yards,
although buildings may relate to the building lines differently due to porch projections and bays
where they exist. Buildings on the north-south streets and corners are very close to front lot lines.
Some industrial and commercial buildings are situated directly on the front lot line.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage Lot coverage ranges from zero percent to one hundred (100) percent,
the average residential coverage being approximately forty (40) percent. Industrial buildings are
in the upper range, as are some corner stores and some houses on north-south cross streets.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the facade- Early buildings are simple and straightforward; Queen
Anne style buildings are more complex in massing and detail but are not overly complex.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. In general, buildings are oriented towards the east-west streets,
with Trumbull Avenue and Sixth being exceptions. Garages are oriented towards the alleys.
Commercial buildings tend to occupy corner lots and Michigan Avenue. There are vistas of
downtown Detroit and Tiger Stadium from the Corktown District. The general overview is that
of a small scaled mixed use neighborhood with major thoroughfares and major landmarks, such
as Tiger Stadium and Most Holy Trinity R.C. Church surrounding it.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Most buildings in the district are asymmetrical in
appearance, but result in balanced compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. The Corktown Historic District, with its narrow lots, shallow
front yards, and small-scaled buildings, -has a low-density, urban, mixed use character of a preautomobile city. Its original cohesiveness has been eroded by housing demolition over the years.
Anchored by Tiger Stadium on the north, light industrial buildings on the west, Most Holy Trinity
Church and the John C. Lodge Expressway on the east, and the West Side Industrial Park on the
south, the neighborhood is set apart from its surrounding environment, resulting in a definable
community in the shadows of Downtown Detroit. (Ord. No. 605-H, § 1(28A-1-49), 12-12-84)

 RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the proposed work is generally in keeping with the building’s historic
character. However, it is unclear to staff that the existing historic siding, corner boards and
window trim are deteriorated to the extent that their replacement is merited/required. Additionally, a
number of the new elements do not replicate the historic feature they are proposed to replace. Therefore,
staff recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed project
because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standard number 6)
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence
However, staff recommends that the above-noted COA be given with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•

The new front porch roof shall be flat/shed to replicate the existing
The existing wood siding, corner trim, and window trim/brickmould at the front and side
elevations shall be retained and repaired where necessary with new to match the existing in
material, dimension, reveal, and detailing
The new wood sash at the front and side elevations shall match the existing/those proposed for
replacement in light configuration and operation
The existing brick chimney must be retained or replicated (if replacement is necessary)
The existing roof height and pitch shall be maintained

Motion DRAFT
I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed project
because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standard number 6)
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the
severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the
old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of
missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. This approval
has been issued with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•

The new front porch roof shall be flat/shed to replicate the existing
The existing wood siding, corner trim, and window trim/brickmould at the front and side
elevations shall be retained and repaired where necessary with new to match the existing in

Re:

Building Rehabilitation
2081 Vermont
Detroit, Michigan

Ms. Ross:
The work proposed at 2081 Vermont, and shown on the submitted drawings, is as follows:
1. Roof replacement: All existing asphalt shingles are to be removed; any rotted or damaged roof
decking replaced with ½” osb, 15# building felt and Certainteed 30yr shingles. Weathered wood
2. The existing roof structure is framed with scabbed together 2 x 4 rafters, which are considerably
past any recommended structural spans. (even if they were continuous members instead of
pieces of rafters that are nailed together). The roof structure will be replaced with new 2 x 10
rafters,with collar ties.
3. Siding replacement: All existing wood siding to be removed, any rotted or damaged sheathing to
be replaced with ½” osb, new vapor barrier, and new wood siding (same 4” reveal) All existing 1
x 4 corner trim is to be replaced with new 1 x 4 corner trim.
4. There is an existing foundation and floor structure on the west side of the building, shown in
pictures. A portion of the foundation will be replaced (5’-7 ¼” x the width of the building), and
the addition rebuilt in that area only. The owner has chosen to rebuild only a portion of the
existing addition in order to preserve open space in the backyard.
5. All windows to be replaced with Pella architect series custom wood windows – all are double
hung to match existing. Existing 1 x 4 wood window casing is to be replaced with new wood
casing of the same size and profile.
6. South elevation –
a. New skylights (24” x 42”) on the south elevation to be Velux –skylight.
b. There is one new window located on the south elevation. See drawings for location.
7. East elevation –
a. Existing porch floor to be removed, floor joists replaced as required, and new 4” tongue
and groove wood porch floor to be installed to match existing.
b. Existing decorative porch columns are to be repaired and painted.
c. All wood fascias at porch roof perimeter to be repaired and painted, unless extent of
degradation requires replacement. If replacement is required, new fascias are to match
existing.
d. The extent of the structural damage to the porch roof is unknown until further
demolition is complete. The low slop hip roof over the existing porch and bay window
will be built identically to the original construction.

e. The existing 1 x 4 porch ceiling is visible beneath the existing aluminum ceiling. Existing
1 x 3 tongue and groove materials will be repaired and repainted if possible. If the
extent of the degredation is such that the ceiling material cannot be repaired, new
material will match the original 1 x 4 ceiling.
8. West Elevation:
a. The existing foundation and floor structure of the l-shaped addition will be removed and
apportion of the addition rebuilt.
b. The existing roof line will be extended over the rebuilt addition area.
c. A new rear entrance with a new 4’-0” x 9’-0” back porch, and steps is to be installed.
New porch columns, flooring, rails, fascias, and hipped roof is to match the repaired roof
on the east elevation identically. The new rear entrance porch is a smaller version of the
front porch, which is 5’-0” x 13’-6”
d. New windows at new gable end are to match the size and style of the existing east
elevation
9. North elevation:
a. There are 4 existing windows on the north elevation, all will be replaced with new
windows of the same size. The window located on the north eastern most corner will
be relocated approximately 3’-6” to the west from its original location.
10. Existing 3” vertical wood slats at building perimeter to be removed and replaced with new 3”
wood slats to match existing, and painted.

Please let me know if you require any further information.
Thank you for your time.
