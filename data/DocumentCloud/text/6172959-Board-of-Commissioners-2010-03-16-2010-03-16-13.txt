EXPLANATION
The CHA plans to open the General Family Public Housing Wait List in FY2010. The CHA is
required to duplicate and distribute applications and related materials to approximately 500
locations. These locations include all property management companies, partners, external
stakeholders, and a variety of public venues including libraries and community centers.

60 East Van Buren Street, 12th Floor Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282· www.thecha.org

 Examples of these documents include Public Housing Wait List Applications and Frequently
Asked Questions materials.
Pitney Bowes was selected by exigency and sole source due to inadequate competition. Only
one vendor submitted a proposal for review, in response to RFP 10-00476. The vendor has
extensive experience with scanning documents through Optical Character Recognition. They
have committed to duplicating and distributing materials within a rapid development timeframe
in conjunction with the needs of the project. Additionally, the company has the equipment and
infrastructure that will meet the high volume demands of the project.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
On January 27, 2010, the CHA advertised a Request for Proposal (RFP), No. 10-00476. The
bidding period was open to interested vendors for a period of 21 days. The RFP was advertised
in the Chicago SunTimes, Chicago Defender, and El Dia newspapers, as well as notification
posted on the CHA website and in BuySpeed. In addition, notification was sent to 44 Assist
Agencies for provision to their member list. Three (3) separate Addendums to the solicitation
were issued on January 29, February 4, and March 8, 2010, respectively. A pre-proposal
conference was held at the CHA on February 2, 2010, at which a discussion of the requirements
and scope of services was held. One (1) proposal was received on February 22, 2010, and was
evaluated and scored by a designated team of CHA employees. A discussions and clarifications
meeting was held with the Respondent, Pitney Bowes Management Services on March 3, 2010,
after which a Best and Final Offer (BAFO) was requested and received on March 4, 2010.
Following review of the BAFO submitted by Pitney Bowes, additional discussions took place
regarding the length of the contract term and pricing for the option period, and the Respondent
was asked to revise their previously submitted BAFO. The revised BAFO was received on
March 8, 2010.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a service agreement with
Pitney Bowes Management Services, Inc. for duplication, distribution and Optical Character
Recognition services for a one year period, in an amount not to exceed $608,290.00 with one, 1year option.
