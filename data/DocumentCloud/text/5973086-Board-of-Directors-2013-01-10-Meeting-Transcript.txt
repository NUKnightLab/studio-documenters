ALDERMAN POPE:

Good morning, everyone.

2

It's a little bit after 10:00 o'clock so we're

3

going to call the meeting order.

4

We do have present today all the

5

Board Members.

6

Chairman Bell present.

7

James, can you here us?

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes, I can.

9

ALDERMAN POPE:

I just wanted to ensure

10

By telephone, however, we have

that you were present.

James, can you hear us?

Very good.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I'm here.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

Welcome, everyone.

13

Happy New Year.

14

and safe holiday.

15

Hope you have a very productive

The first agenda item is

16

organizational matters and approval of the

17

minutes from December 6th, 2012.

18

I believe everyone has a copy of the

19

minutes, had a chance to review those.

20

corrections?

21

Any

I think I did notice the absence of

22

Board Member Ramirez's name from Page 1, so if

23

we can add that minor correction.

24

were present.

I know you

 3
1

MR. RAMIREZ:

2

ALDERMAN POPE:

3

I had mentioned that.
Any other suggested

changes?

4

(No response.)

5

Do I have a motion to approve?

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

7

MS. FERGUSON:

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

9

So moved.
Seconded.
The ayes have it.

The next item on the agenda is the

10

announcement and introduction of Advisory Board

11

Members.

12

consists of the five Members here today, in

13

addition to six other Advisory Board Members,

14

Board Members who do not have voting privileges,

15

but I think, James, you're going to speak a

16

little bit about this matter, if you would.

17

Just as a reminder, the Board formally

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I think all I'd

18

like to say is that we are delighted to have the

19

other Members from business that will augment

20

the talents that are currently on this

21

Infrastructure Board to help us to really work

22

hard on trying to figure out how to be

23

innovative and find new ways to accelerate the

24

financing of the infrastructure activities here

 4
1

in our City.

2

And with that, I just want to

3

welcome all the Board.

4

over to you since you're there to actually

5

introduce them.

6

John, I'll turn it back

ALDERMAN POPE:

Well, thank you, James.

7

With us today we do have three of the Advisory

8

Board Members, Tom Villanova, Latasha Thomas and

9

Mary Sue Barrett.

I would like to personally

10

thank you and welcome you for your time, your

11

effort and your ongoing commitment.

12

strangers to work here in Chicago.

13
14
15

You're no

If you have any comments, you're
more than welcome.
MR. VILLANOVA:

16

for welcoming us.

17

be on the Board.

Thank you.

Thank you

Thank you for allowing me to

18

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Tom.

19

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

I just look forward

20

to the hard work and getting things done for our

21

communities.

22

MS. BARRETT:

23

comments.

24

Planning Council.

I would echo those

Mary Sue Barrett, Metropolitan

 5
1

Our mission includes working on

2

solutions that make this region more competitive

3

and livable so finding funding for modernization

4

of infrastructure is a top priority.

5

ALDERMAN POPE:

Again I thank you and

6

thank you for your very direct comments.

7

also have three other Members who are not with

8

us today, Damon Silvers, David Dohnalek and

9

Stephanie Neely who serves as the City

10

Treasurer.

11

Advisory Board Members.

12

So that would comprise the six total

MR. RAMIREZ:

Mr. Chairman, do we have

13

any of those Members participating

14

telephonically?

15
16

ALDERMAN POPE:

19
20
21

No, James is the only

one participating telephonically today.

17
18

We

MR. SILVERS:
Silvers.

I'm sorry, this is Damon

I'm on the phone.
ALDERMAN POPE:

Damon, welcome.

Damon, I apologize.

Would you like to say anything?

MR. SILVERS:

Only that I'm very

22

honored to be asked to help with this project

23

and like the other Members of the Advisory Board

24

am deeply committed to making this a great

 6
1

success.

2
3

ALDERMAN POPE:
Damon.

4

Any other questions or comments
regarding that matter?

6

MS. FERGUSON:

7

ALDERMAN POPE:

9

Thank you,

Appreciate it.

5

8

Very good.

Welcome.
Let's get to work,

right?
The next item is the status of the

10

directors and officers liability insurance.

11

believe, Diana, you have an update for us.

12
13
14

MS. FERGUSON:

I will take that.

I

Thank

you, Mr. Chairman.
Since the last meeting we have

15

continued work with our insurance underwriter,

16

Risk Strategies.

17

for information from potential underwriters and

18

believe we're in a position to move to a firm

19

quote and negotiate the actual terms and

20

conditions in the next couple of weeks.

We have responded to requests

21

So we have made good progress and

22

believe we will be in a position to implement

23

the policy in the next couple of weeks, and

24

importantly, it will include -- both the Board

 7
1

Members and the Advisory Board Members are

2

included in our D&O policy.

3

in place in the next couple of weeks.

4
5

ALDERMAN POPE:

So that should be

Very good.

Any

questions for Diana?

6

(No response.)

7

Excellent.

8

The next agenda item is approval of

9

payment for transaction services for the

10

December 6th, 2012 meeting, I think specifically

11

the court reporting.

12

Diana?

MS. FERGUSON:

Mr. Chairman, I am in

13

receipt of an invoice for the court reporter

14

services from the last meeting, and with the

15

Board's approval, it is an invoice that I

16

believe is reasonable and customary, and we will

17

proceed to payment.

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

Motion.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Second.

20

ALDERMAN POPE:

21
22

Motion and seconded.

All in favor?
(A chorus of ayes.)

23

The ayes have it.

24

The next item on the agenda, Item 3,

 8
1

is Retrofit Chicago update.

2

recall at least month's meeting we had a very

3

informative presentation about the various

4

projects under consideration for the retrofit,

5

including speaking points by the Department of

6

Law, the Water Department and FFM.

7

As most of you

I believe at this point we have Tom

8

Morsch, one of our advisors, from PFM to give us

9

an update on that matter.

10

MR. MORSCH:

11

Thank you very much.

Good morning, everyone.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

13

MR. MORSCH:

Good morning, Tom.

As you indicated, at the

14

December meeting the City I think provided a

15

very extensive and exhaustive review of the

16

potential project to fund energy improvement

17

projects via the Trust, if possible.

18

At the last meeting we indicated

19

that we would be proceeding forward with the

20

process to engage potential investors and

21

private parties in that process.

22

working with the City of Chicago to develop some

23

solicitation documents.

24

We've been

The Advisory Board Members I don't

 9
1

believe received those, but the Board Members

2

all received documents, draft documents back in

3

December, at least they are in draft form.

4

welcome any of your comments on those documents.

5

I'm happy to kind of give you a quick overview

6

of what they are.

7

We

There's an RFQ that asks investors

8

to provide -- demonstrate the level of interest

9

in the projects, No. 1; and, No. 2, to give us

10

specific feedback with respect to the proposed

11

projects and how they might be engaged with the

12

Trust and with the City to effectively finance

13

those projects.

14

So we're doing this in a very kind

15

of open and public manner to get that input.

16

We'll be getting those -- it's our proposal if

17

you approve the RFQ that we would be posting

18

that on the Infrastructure Trust website and we

19

will -- we will also be developing a press

20

release to make sure that we can disseminate

21

this really far and wide to potential parties,

22

interested parties and investors to get their

23

feedback from the project and see what we might

24

do about moving forward with something in the

 10
1

future.

2

With that I'm happy to field

3

questions from Board Members who have reviewed

4

documents or any questions they have about the

5

documents.

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

Tom, can you remind us

7

of the partners or investors who will be part of

8

this and the diversity that we're targeting and

9

maybe not the traditional partners and other

10
11
12
13

type of projects, ESCOs for example?
MR. MORSCH:

Yes, very good point,

Alderman.
Yes, traditionally these have been

14

targeted towards companies that are specifically

15

involved in the energy efficiency projects.

16

this case, we have a very broad list developed

17

of potential investors that include everything

18

from private equity investors to foundations and

19

not-for-profits and others.

20

In

We also are adhering to all the

21

goals of the City with respect to diversity, and

22

we really want to go on the record here to make

23

sure that we're underscoring that as an

24

important component here and that I think is

 11
1

built into the document as well.

2

So we're going to be looking for

3

that kind of diversity both from investor based

4

as well as talents of firms and companies to

5

respond to provide feedback.

6

Now, this isn't an official

7

solicitation that we're -- you know, we're not

8

picking somebody.

9

the beginning of a process and we're at the

10

beginning of the process to help formulate a

11

structure that multiple parties would have an

12

interest in providing proposals to down the

13

road.

14

What we're doing is we're at

ALDERMAN POPE:

And it's my

15

understanding that as much as we're looking to

16

solicit them to participate, we're looking to

17

gain information and knowledge about best

18

practices of how to make this Trust as effective

19

as possible; is that correct?

20

MR. MORSCH:

21

ALDERMAN POPE:

Any other questions?

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

John, I have one

23
24

Absolutely.

comment I'd like to make relative to this RFQ.
ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes.

 12
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think that the thing

2

that we all should be aware of is that

3

essentially this RFQ has in it the mandate

4

that's in the ordinance for the Trust in terms

5

of what, you know, our limitations are and

6

things that we need to comply with.

7

embedded in this document.

8

of it in terms of the deal structure.

9

That's

So that's one piece

The second piece of it has the

10

desires of the City which have been public --

11

the public comments on what they're looking for

12

to transfer the risk of some of these projects

13

and doing it in a way though that makes good

14

business sense.

15

And so what we've tried to do is

16

working together with the City and our advisors

17

is to prepare a document that would go out to

18

the market and really do two things.

19

One, hopefully identify those

20

investors that are really qualified to

21

participate in programs like this; and, two,

22

this is important, you know, to help us decide

23

if the definition of the deal that is embedded

24

in this document is one that would bring market

 13
1

interest; and, if not, they will provide us

2

feedback on what we need to do to modify it as

3

we move to the next step so that it does

4

generate the kind of market interest we'd like

5

to see.

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

I agree, and I'd like

7

to add, I'm sure I get compliance with Alderman

8

Latasha, or concurrence, that it's in our

9

interests to remind everyone that these assets

10

would remain with the public sector.

11

We're not selling off any assets.

12

They remain the asset, for example, of the City

13

of Chicago or the Chicago Public Schools.

14

Certainly I know Latasha and I are very happy to

15

hear that all the City requirements will be met

16

in terms of minority and disadvantaged

17

businesses, et cetera.

18

And, of course, we'd like to shift

19

some of the risk that the City has traditionally

20

incurred with these projects on to the private

21

sector.

22
23
24

Any other questions or comments of
Tom?
MR. HOFFMAN:

I've got some questions.

 14
1

First let me say to you and the folks at PFM and

2

the folks at Kirkland and the folks at the City

3

and Akashia (phonetic) who we know have worked

4

very hard together over the last month or so to

5

put this document together that we appreciate

6

these efforts, especially the collaboration.

7

think that was great.

8
9

I

Let me echo a comment that John made
about the dual purpose of this both to seek

10

qualifications from potential investors and also

11

to seek information.

12

As you know from our conversations,

13

the seeking of information here is really

14

important to me, and I would ask that when the

15

Trust and the City issue a press release or any

16

sort of public statement that accompanies the

17

issuance of this, we should stress that.

18

In addition to the fact that it's an

19

RFQ, we should stress that we are soliciting, as

20

the document clearly sets out, information, and

21

I noted and I agreed that in one of the

22

statements here that says that that is the

23

primary purpose, the principal purpose for the

24

RFQ then is to solicit information.

 15
1

Since this is a relatively

2

unprecedented thing we're doing, that

3

solicitation of information from a wide variety

4

of sources can only help us.

5

important at this stage.

6

that's in there and I ask that you stress it.

7

I just want to ask some questions

It's really

So I appreciate that

8

about the -- to clarify the qualifications

9

process and what will help next.

So it's my

10

understanding that this lays out for potential

11

investors who are interested, they are going to

12

be submitting qualifications and then there's

13

going to be some sort of joint process between

14

our advisors and the City to judge those

15

qualifications; is that right?

16

MR. MORSCH:

Yes.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

road we'll be issuing an RFP?

19

MR. MORSCH:

Okay.

And then down the

If we determine that there

20

is a transaction that could occur that could

21

meet the goals of the Trust and the City then we

22

would move to the next step.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:
RFP?

And that would be an

 16
1

MR. MORSCH:

That would be an RFP or

2

something similar to an RFP.

3

would be a bid document, yes.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Potentially it

And that document, an RFP

5

or something like that, would be much more

6

concrete and specific about what a transaction

7

would likely look like and it would go to

8

potential investors?

9

MR. MORSCH:

Very much so.

That's the

10

purpose of this document is to see if we can

11

combine the ideas of both the -- ideas that meet

12

the Trust's objectives and the City's objective

13

as well as investor objectives to see if we can

14

bring that kind of structure together.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

And that RFP would only

16

be people who have been -- only firms who have

17

been qualified pursuant to our RFQ process at

18

some point would be able to respond to that RFP,

19

is that correct, or could anyone in the world

20

respond to the RFP?

21

MR. MORSCH:

This document does not

22

address what would be the requirements on a

23

further RFP, but I think that best practices are

24

and certainly our discussion is to be as

 17
1

inclusive as possible here.

2

to, you know, set rigid rules that prohibit

3

people that have good ideas to bring to bear to

4

the process.

5

We're not trying

So as we're conducting this process

6

in an open and transparent manner, we'll

7

continue to do future, you know -- we're not

8

going to close the door on a certain day and say

9

you can't talk to us anymore.

We're just going

10

to keep that door open, but what's not going to

11

change is the requirements, so people need to

12

have minimum requirements to engage with us in

13

this dialogue.

14

They need to meet financial

15

requirements, they need to have technical

16

capability, and they need to make -- they need

17

to meet disclosure requirements with the City

18

and diversity requirements first and foremost

19

and the other things that Alderman Pope has

20

indicated.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me just ask some

22

questions to make sure that the public, the

23

market and I sort of understand the process.

24

So on Page 7 there's a category of

 18
1

establishment of pool of qualified financial

2

partners, and it says, "the Trust plans to

3

establish an open pool of qualified financial

4

partners, known as the pool.

5

this RFQ, potential financial partners included

6

within the pool will be invited to participate

7

in information sessions conducted by the Trust

8

and the City.

9

As a result of

You'll get access to a data room.

"Subsequent to initial establishment

10

of the pool, admission to the pool will be

11

permitted for additional qualified financial

12

partners using the same application and approval

13

process described within this RFQ.

14

preestablished end date for admission to the

15

pool following its initial establishment."

16

So let me just tell you what I

There's no

17

understand.

18

just want to make sure for purposes of clarity

19

publicly I thought it would be helpful to say

20

that.

21

I may have misunderstood it, but I

So what I understand is if you -- in

22

the future if you want to bid on or respond to

23

an RFP or something similar, at some point

24

you've got to get into this qualified pool.

 19
1

One way to do that is to respond to

2

this document, this RFQ and see if your

3

qualifications are accepted, but even if you

4

don't, if you decide not to respond now, there

5

would be an opportunity in the future to go

6

through that same RFQ process, but at some point

7

you have to get into the pool in order to be

8

able to respond to the RFP; is that right?

9

MR. MORSCH:

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

MR. MORSCH:

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

MR. MORSCH:

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

MR. MORSCH:

17

19
20

Okay.

Great.

You described it very

well.

13

18

Yes.

Okay.

Good.

And that's the intent.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

Any other questions by the Board
Members?
(No response.)
I think it's safe to say, I mean,

21

Kirkland and -- both Kirkland & Ellis and

22

yourselves have reviewed the documents.

23

are in draft form and what you got is draft

24

form, so I would encourage any of you in your

They

 20
1

fine reading of the document, if there are any

2

comments that you want to make, you still have

3

an opportunity to make that as Board Members.

4

I would suggest though that the

5

material terms of the document are probably

6

pretty well good, not hearing any other

7

objections or discussion from Members.

8

We'll be moving over the next day

9

or so to finalize this document, develop the

10

press documents that I talked about, and move

11

forward with getting this out into the

12

marketplace.

13

We're excited to be anticipating

14

responses and being able to come back and chat

15

with you about what it is, in fact, the

16

marketplace is saying about this and how we're

17

positioned.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

Should we --

19

Mr. Chairman, should we move to accept this?

20

You know, this has been provided to us in

21

advance.

22

as clarified by Tom, I'm certainly comfortable

23

with it being sent out.

24

I've had the chance to review it and

Obviously they'll have the

 21
1

opportunity to fine tune it as they see fit

2

before it gets out publically, but would it be

3

helpful for them to have our approval to go

4

forward with it as long as it doesn't change in

5

any material way?

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

I think so.

That

7

sounds like that's a motion to accept the RFQ as

8

it's written along with the term sheet and allow

9

it to be moved forward with our partners.

10

MS. FERGUSON:

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

12

I'll second it.
Seconded.

All in favor

say aye.

13

(A chorus of ayes.)

14

Against?

15

(No response.)

16

Motion carries.

17

Tom, one last question regarding

18

that.

19
20
21
22

I'll hold that question.
MR. MORSCH:

Okay.

Thanks.

Thank you very

much.
ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Tom.

The next item on the agenda is the

23

opportunity for public comment.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Before we move to that, I

 22
1

didn't -- is there -- are we hearing from the

2

City at all today on retrofit?

3

ALDERMAN POPE:

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't believe so.

Let me -- Before we get

5

off this agenda item though let me have a

6

little quick colloquy with Lois and David on

7

something.

8

So the last time one of the City

9

agencies that appeared before us was CPS, and

10

one of the things that both Diana and I asked

11

them about was any information that had been

12

provided to potential bond investors or to

13

ratings agencies relating to this, and Pat

14

Taylor said yeah, we'll send you anything that's

15

been provided.

16

I don't think we've been -- we've

17

received anything from them, and if that means

18

that the answer is that nothing has been

19

provided to rating agencies at all or to

20

potential bond investors, great, but if --

21
22

MR. WINTERS:

We'll verify that one way

or the other.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm sorry?

24

MR. WINTERS:

We will verify that or

 23
1

we'll get you the information that you have

2

requested.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Would you?

If you

4

wouldn't mind giving us a response by the end of

5

next week.

6

MR. WINTERS:

Absolutely.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

If there's a need for

8

more time, let us know.

9

Similarly let me just state that you

10

may recall I asked her some questions about

11

whether there were any statements, assumptions,

12

promises in their budget about whether

13

infrastructure funds were going to be used and

14

she said they were not.

15

Shortly after I got an email from a

16

reporter saying that wasn't the case and their

17

budget did, in fact, contain that information.

18

I was a bit dismayed to have to get that from a

19

reporter.

20

In the spirit of just being

21

productive, constructive, if you could pass on,

22

since they're not in front of us today, that we

23

would like them to correct whatever information

24

they need to regarding what's been put in their

 24
1

budget, and then in the future if they're asked

2

questions about their budget that we expect them

3

to be ready to answer those questions about what

4

they have said about the Trust, the Trust

5

financing in their budget.

6

MR. WINTERS:

Absolutely.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

If you can tell them

8

that's a related question to the information

9

provided to the rating agencies and the

10

potential bond investors.

11

I want to make sure we're informed

12

about what statements the agencies who come

13

before us have previously made about us and our

14

financing.

15

MR. WINTERS:

Understood.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you very much.

17

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

18

ALDERMAN POPE:

19
20

Thank you.

Again any other questions before we
move to the opportunity for public comment?

21

(No response.)

22

There's one individual who has

23

signed on for public comment.

24

Tresser.

Tom, are you here?

I believe Tom
Do you wish to

 25
1

speak?

2

MR. TRESSER:

Yes.

3

ALDERMAN POPE:

Please approach the

4

microphone.

5

introduce yourself, your name and any

6

organization that you're with for the court

7

reporter.

8
9

Again if you can for the record

MR. TRESSER:
Tom Tresser.

Good morning.

My name is

I'm a volunteer with the Civic

10

Lab, and I'm an organizer and educator in

11

Chicago.

12

Trust and whoever is on the phone.

13

Good morning to the Members of the

So one question I have about this

14

public process is the record that's being

15

created here by the stenographer, is that

16

something that's available online for free as a

17

pdf?

18

ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes, it is, Tom.

The

19

Trust has a website, ChicagoInfrastructure.org

20

and on that are the minutes, the agendas, a

21

variety of information.

22

sorry.

23
24

MR. TRESSER:

Approved minutes, I'm

Awesome.

One of the things that seems to have

 26
1

come up in the creation of this Body is the

2

question of what services are going to be

3

rendered by the investors depending on the

4

project.

5

So whatever it's going to be, if

6

it's the retrofit or the rapid transit bus line,

7

I guess what I'm looking for at some point is an

8

articulation of what exactly the public is going

9

to get for this exchange.

10

We're potentially giving monopoly

11

rights to some set of vendors or owners for

12

providing services to us, whether it's the rapid

13

transit bus line or some other project down the

14

line.

15

In return, those investors

16

presumably are going to be making profit, and

17

what I'm looking for is some kind of an easy to

18

understand understanding of what it is being

19

given to us and what it is these investors are

20

going to be making, what are they getting

21

guaranteed.

22

I have heard a lot about risk, that

23

we're transferring risk, but the recent

24

financial collapse has shown us that the private

 27
1

sector doesn't seem to be bearing much risk.

2

When they need help, we, the public, bail them

3

out.

4

There's a lot of I think uneasiness

5

or I don't want to say distrust of this process,

6

and I'm hoping that as you guys deliberate and,

7

you know, figure this stuff out and put it on

8

the web, it will be easily understood by

9

citizens who, after all, we're going to have to

10

pick up the tab down the line as you make your

11

decisions.

12

So that's what I'm hoping.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I appreciate the comment.

13

I'm sure we all do.

14

you'll see on the website, once it's finalized,

15

the document that we were just discussing, the

16

RFQ.

17

I would say, Tom, that

And while you individually and

18

others may not be a qualified firm that might be

19

an investor, it's certainly open for anyone to

20

provide comment, information, expertise about

21

potential pitfalls, about good ideas and things

22

of that sort.

23

But as you heard from Tom, I mean,

24

one of the things I think that's beneficial of

 28
1

this process is we're moving in a proper,

2

deliberate fashion to figure it out.

3

step in this RFQ process is we're going to get

4

information.

5

One good

Once we issue an RFP or something

6

similar, if we do, that will be probably the

7

first concrete point at which the public and

8

others see our thought process about what a

9

potential deal might look like, but then there

10

will be flushing out, there will be hearings and

11

so on relating to who responds to that.

12

So this is going to develop over

13

time, but I know for one I appreciate, and I'm

14

sure we all do, the notes of caution, and it's

15

something I think we all share and we're looking

16

forward to trying to get to a point where the

17

articulation of how it's in the public interest,

18

if such a deal exists, is clear.

19

ALDERMAN POPE:

20
21
22
23
24

Any other responses by

Board Members?
(No response.)
Any other comments from the public?
Scott Falk, would you like to speak?
MR. HOFFMAN:

You're not a member of

 29
1

the public.

2
3

You are beyond the

ALDERMAN POPE:

Scott Falk from

public.

4
5

ALDERMAN POPE:

Kirkland & Ellis.

6

MR. FALK:

The only thing I wanted to

7

add, I guess two things.

Number one, with

8

respect to the RFQ, as you just -- as you

9

authorized your advisor to finalize the

10

document, one thing that needs to get buttoned

11

down is the response date for the RFQ, and the

12

staff working together with the City might be

13

consulting with you to agree on that final

14

date.

15

We want to make sure that whatever

16

the data response is feathers nicely in with

17

other responses that the City is getting and

18

analyzing in connection with other projects that

19

are out there.

20

don't have a cavitated, you know, colliding

21

responses all at one time.

22

We want to make sure that we

So we need to work on the right time

23

frame and give people enough time to understand

24

the RFQ and respond adequately but not have it

 30
1

drag out so long that we are delaying a process

2

unnecessarily.

3

recommendations on the duration that the RFQ is

4

staying out there waiting for responses.

So we'll come back to you with

5

The second point in response to

6

Mr. Tresser's comment that I think is worth

7

noting is that the executive order adopted in

8

connection with the Chicago Infrastructure Trust

9

requires an independent review of every project

10

before it gets recommended to City Council for

11

funding and finalization.

12

And so there will be engaged by the

13

Trust Board an independent advisor to look at

14

each project and confirm its financial adequacy

15

and the protection of the taxpayers prior to its

16

being approved by the City Council.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

Scott, one

18

question about the first part, about the

19

deadline.

20

be a response period and there should be end

21

date.

22

It makes perfect sense, there should

On the other hand, as the

23

questioning with Tom shows, it's not a deadline

24

that means that people can't therefore seek to

 31
1

be qualified after that.

2

So since the document is going to be

3

tweaked to put a response date in, I would

4

suggest that there maybe a sentence or two

5

that's added that makes that -- it says it now,

6

but since there's going to be an end date, there

7

will need to be some explanation that this is an

8

end date but yet you can do it after that.

9

You know, we don't want to -- I

10

understand that that could mean that the end

11

date is not respected, so people can be

12

encouraged to do it before the close date, but I

13

also think you'll need to make it clear that

14

there will be an opportunity for people who

15

either once they see the RFP or at a later date

16

if they want to come forward and seek to be

17

qualified, they will be able do that.

18

MR. FALK:

Okay.

We'll take a look at

19

the text of the instructions and make sure it's

20

clear.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thanks.

22

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yeah, I'm just curious as

23

to how that would play out.

I mean, I would

24

hate it if somebody waited to see what comes in

 32
1

and then puts their stuff together.

2

know --

I don't

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, you know --

4

MR. RAMIREZ:

I mean, end dates are

5

good sometimes because then they give finality

6

to that.

7

closed so we can proceed with the next one.

8
9

At some point this stage has to be

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree, although I think

the advisor's decision jointly in terms of

10

leaving it open was in part because it's still

11

relatively open ended about what a potential

12

deal might look like, and it may turn out that

13

our best potential financial partner may be

14

someone who looks at the current document and

15

says I can't tell and then looks at the RFP and

16

says now I can see that this is something that

17

I'd like to do and they may be -- you know, they

18

may have to do two steps at the same time.

19

may have to seek to get qualified and also be

20

bidding, but it's probably in our interest and

21

the public interest to make sure that we're not

22

closing off that possibility.

23
24

MR. RAMIREZ:

They

Well, I think it would --

I could see a scenario where they might do that,

 33
1

but they should at least come to us and say

2

look, here's what going on, we're thinking about

3

jumping in.

4

is somebody just comes out of nowhere at the

5

last minute and says hey, boom.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Why?

7

MR. RAMIREZ:

Well, you delay.

That's fine.

What you don't want

You

8

know what I mean?

It's not to say that -- I

9

mean, the whole point isn't just to rush it

10

through.

11

notice and time like you would in any other

12

thing.

13

You're giving everybody adequate

You should leave it open.

You

14

should have the ability for somebody to come in

15

and put it together, but at least give notice to

16

us that that's what you're trying to do.

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

At the time you mean?

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yeah.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree.

20

MR. RAMIREZ:

I mean, I think that's

21

fair to us and it's fair to everybody else

22

because then you just don't have somebody come

23

riding in at the last minute.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think the procedural

 34
1

protection on that is that it's going to be more

2

burdensome for them to do then because they will

3

still have to, as I understand it, it's still a

4

two step -- to get through you've got to do a

5

two step process.

6

You got to get through the

7

qualification process, and then you have to

8

explain what your response to the RFP is.

9

you want to do both of those at once, that's

10

going to be burdensome for the firm, and so

11

they have an incentive I think to do that

12

earlier.

If

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

Right.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And so I think we'll

15

most likely flush out people early rather than

16

later, but I think we want to -- and I'm guided

17

in part by what our advisors are saying.

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

You know, it's in our

20

interest to make sure that if as it turns out

21

the best answer is for us is someone who comes

22

in late then we should make sure we consider

23

it.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

We should get the best

 35
1

deal or try to, but I would say no matter what,

2

we got to have some -- I don't want the process

3

to be delayed just for the sake of, you know,

4

somebody coming in and saying hey, we think we

5

can do this and we're going to put it together

6

and now we're going to -- it's going to matter

7

how we do it and when we do it.

8

You know, if it's something, maybe

9

not with this project but with future projects,

10

construction seasons matters when you get things

11

started, and the delay of a couple months could

12

actually delay you for a year.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, maybe one -- This

14

is way down the road, but it seems to me in

15

talking to our advisors that, you know, what

16

this delay point goes to is at some point if an

17

RFP is issued, it will have a response due date,

18

and it could be that for anyone who wants to be

19

a respondent to that --

20
21
22

MR. RAMIREZ:

That I'm comfortable

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- who is not yet

with.

23

qualified, so they will have to now goes through

24

both phases, they may have an earlier response

 36
1

date of a week or two in advance because they

2

will be requiring us to do more work in advance

3

of that.

4

I would make sure that we both hear

5

from whoever might be qualified but yet nothing

6

is delayed.

7

now, but I think that's a thought for the

8

future.

9
10

I know that we don't have to decide

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

I'm going with

that.

11

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

13

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

Mr. Chairman.

Alderman Thomas.
When Mr. Tresser was

14

speaking something that came to mind that I

15

wanted to make sure that the public is reminded

16

of is that the Trust has no power to pledge the

17

full faith and credit of the City, nor can any

18

project have the general obligation of the City,

19

and I think that the public needs to be reminded

20

of that because I got the feeling that he felt

21

that anything we're doing here will obligate the

22

taxpayers for the G.O. on the full, faith and

23

credit of the City.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Good point.

Very good

 37
1
2

point.
And as a reminder, as I know you're

3

well aware, Latasha, matters will have to come

4

back before the City Council, those dealing with

5

the City of Chicago in particular.

6

will be a very public forum through committee

7

and Council meetings to have public input in

8

that as well.

9

So there

Tom, just one other question.

We

10

were talking about the RFQ process.

11

ensuring that we're going to get the most -- the

12

widest range of respondents available?

13

fashion are we going to alert the public and

14

potentially interested parties about how to

15

respond to this?

16

How are you

In what

We've got our website which we

17

mentioned earlier.

18

periodically so we certainly look forward to

19

their participation, but what other venues or

20

mediums are we using to get the word out?

21

The press has been here

MR. MORSCH:

Well, in addition to the

22

press release that I referred to, I mean, we

23

have developed a list for the course of -- since

24

the Trust was established, there's been

 38
1

interested parties reaching out to the City and

2

others.

3

We've been keeping a list, a

4

database of interested parties.

5

going to target some very specific

6

infrastructure related publications.

7

going to inform those parties that this is out

8

there and going.

9

We are also

We're

You know, it's really, as you

10

indicated, it's really in our interest to create

11

as much activity as possible and as much

12

interest level as possible.

13

Jorge, your point about

14

qualifications.

The quicker people are going to

15

get in, the better it's going to be for them.

16

They're going to get more bites at the apple.

17

The quicker they get in, the quicker they engage

18

in the process, the more informed investors and

19

others are going to be.

20

encouraging that very much.

So we're really

21

That's what we're doing.

If anybody

22

has any additional ideas, we are certainly open

23

to those ideas to make sure because that's the

24

objective.

 39
1

ALDERMAN POPE:

And those publications

2

would not be limited to the locale or region, it

3

will be national?

4

MR. MORSCH:

They will be global

5

publications.

6

related publications are global, and this has

7

been hotly, you know, looked at by a number of

8

media and other persons.

9

call us.

10

going on.

11
12

They're calling.

They

They call the City and they say what's
So we're encouraged by that.

ALDERMAN POPE:

Very good.

Any other

comments or questions from the Board?

13

(No response.)

14

From the public?

15

(No response.)

16
17

Many of these infrastructure

This will end the public comment
period at this point.

18

The next agenda item, Item No. 5, is

19

the executive director search, and this actually

20

calls for a closed meeting, so in the spirit of

21

transparency and following the letter of the

22

law, pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Open

23

Meetings Act, we will now go to a closed

24

meeting.

I ask that all non Board Members exit

 40
1

the room.

2

We'll reconvene following that.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm sorry.

Let's do two

3

quick things in advance of that.

4

discussion of what we're going to discuss, and

5

the second is I do think we need to take a vote

6

on that just so it's clear what we're going to

7

discuss is that, as has been publically said,

8

we have hired an executive search firm who's

9

been -- the position that was posted on the

10
11

One is a brief

website.
We've received applications for an

12

executive director.

13

that process of choosing the executive director.

14

There have been second round interviews, and

15

this closed meeting is for the purpose of

16

discussing the applicants.

17

We're close to the end of

MR. YONOVER:

Before you get to that, I

18

would suggest that you discuss the next meeting

19

date while the group is here and then go into

20

closed session.

21
22

ALDERMAN POPE:

Do we have a next

meeting date?

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Has it been set?

24

MR. YONOVER:

It has not been set.

 41
1

MR. MORSCH:

2

MR. YONOVER:

Do we have a suggestion?
Since we're looking at a

3

return date of middle of February or early

4

February for the RFQ, tentatively we might

5

suggest a meeting date for the Trust in 30 days

6

from now, middle of February.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

8
9

It seems a little soon.

Scott?
MR. FALK:

I think we need to discuss

10

it further, but my sense is we're going to need

11

a couple days to button down the RFQ and get it

12

final before it's even ready for mailing and

13

distribution, and then, you know, we need advice

14

from both advisory firms as to how long we're

15

going to let it circulate before people can

16

realistically be expected to provide us with

17

meaningful responses.

18

February frankly is too soon.

19

MR. YONOVER:

20

MR. FALK:

My sense is early

Middle of February.

I don't think there's any

21

particular connection between the date of the

22

RFQ response and the date of your next meeting.

23
24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I would suggest if it's

going -- let's say it goes out the door Monday,

 42
1

which would be pretty quick because that's two

2

business days.

3

Even if it's 30 days which will also be pretty

4

quick, and I'm not sure that's the right period,

5

it's February 14th, I think if we go a couple

6

weeks -- This isn't pulling up right away.

7

Maybe the week right after the

That would be January 14th.

8

President's Day weekend which is around the

9

20th, so that's probably around the Thursday,

10

22nd, 23rd.

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

21st.

12

MS. FERGUSON:

13

MR. MORSCH:

That might be a good time.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's the Thursday after

21st is Thursday.

15

the President's Day weekend?

16

MR. MORSCH:

17

ALDERMAN POPE:

18
19
20

It is.

Board?
MR. HOFFMAN:

MR. RAMIREZ:

22

MS. FERGUSON:

24

I suggest that as a

possibility.

21

23

Any discussion by the

The 21st -Thursday, the 21st of

February.
MR. RAMIREZ:

That's a bad day for me.

 43
1

I can't do that.

2

MS. FERGUSON:

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

Thursdays?

5
6

The 28th?
Are we locked into

Is that tradition?

ALDERMAN POPE:
historically.

It's just been

Wednesday the 20th?

7

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

City Council.

Tuesday the 19th.

Are you guys in all day

10

on that Wednesday or at least in the morning,

11

right?

ALDERMAN THOMAS:

We're not even sure

13

if there's City Council that day but if we -- if

14

it's a hot day, it will go until about 2:00.

If we have

My thinking is you might

22

want to hear at your next meeting the initial

23

reaction to the input that's been analyzed from

24

the RFQ responses, and so, you know, unless you

 44
1

have urgent business that needs to get resolved

2

in the next four weeks, why wouldn't you

3

schedule your meeting with enough cushion to

4

allow your advisors to at least give you a

5

preliminary response?

MR. HOFFMAN:

How about Thursday, the

MR. HOFFMAN:

Then as

Any other

Scott, was there

14

anything else you thought we should do before we

15

closed?

16

MR. YONOVER:

No.

17

ALDERMAN POPE:

We're again going to

18

suggest or I'll make a motion that we move to a

19

closed meeting pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of

20

the Open Meetings Act, and at that point we

21

would ask that the public leave the room and

22

only the Board Members and Advisors and court

23

reporter remain in the room.

24

on that?

Do I have a motion

MR. RAMIREZ:

Seconded.
All those in favor?

I think you're supposed

to do a roll call vote.

8

Seconded.

(A chorus of ayes.)

6
7

I so move.

MS. FERGUSON:

Go ahead.

We can do it

individually.

10

ALDERMAN POPE:

We'll do a roll call

11

vote for the consideration of going to closed

12

session.

13
14

James, can I get a vote from you,
please?

Chairman Bell?

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

16

ALDERMAN POPE:

Member Ramirez?

ALDERMAN POPE:

12:00 noon.

7

back to open session.

8

It's approximately

The Infrastructure Trust will come

The last matter that we were

9

discussing during the closed portion was the

10

executive director search, and I think as a

11

result of that we have come to the conclusion

12

that we've done extensive work, we worked

13

diligently to identify the best candidates,

14

relied on some of the support systems in place

15

in terms of a search firm, and there are several

16

outstanding issues, but we think we're getting

17

comfortable and close to selecting the actual

18

executive director.

19

We would like to have a quick

20

turnaround on this matter, and I'm suggesting or

21

looking for a motion to authorize Chairman Bell

22

to go ahead and authorize the selection of that

23

executive director subject to the Members

24

providing to you, James, additional information

 48
1

and input to allow that selection to be

2

complete.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

I would so move.

And

4

what that means to me is that we will be giving

5

you, James, in short order our approval to go

6

forward, and once you receive that -- once you

7

receive it then we're giving you the authority

8

to proceed and you're simply waiting to hear

9

from us pending the final steps that need to be

10

taken.

11
12

With that understanding, I make a
motion for the Board to do so.

Do I have a second?

The ayes have it.

The motion

Is there any other business?
(No response.)
Again I would like to thank everyone

and remind us the next meeting has been
