materials that meet current requirements, looping water lines in buildings, replacing existing fire hydrants,
and winterizing fire protection to unheated buildings). The proposed contract extension is due to the
changes in project scope as detailed above.

wetlands, is estimated to be $317,161.00. The Forest Preserves is responsible for 51.5%, or $163,337.00,
of the total. This project is a collaborative effort and will involve the Chicago Park District, the Illinois
Department of Natural Resources, US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Wetland Initiative, the Field
Museum, and Audubon Chicago Region. Contributions from each of these partners are anticipated and
could ultimately reduce the amount of funds expended by the Forest Preserves to $15,000.00.

PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to 13500 S. Harlem Ave., LLC, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain an
existing steel and wood retaining wall, pavement, light poles and appurtenances. The existing wall and
improvements were inadvertently installed at an angle to the property line approximately 15 years ago,
resulting in much of the wall encroaching on FPCC property. The 15.5 foot high wall supports FPCC
land behind it; removal would leave an unstable slope subject to erosion and collapse, and the land
containing mature oak trees unsupported. No additional land other than what is occupied by the
encroachment is requested. In addition to the Licensing Fees, the applicant will contribute $20,000.00
toward restoration activities in the FPCC.
Term: 10 Years
License Fee:

$3,500.00 (minimum license fee)

License Application Fee: $1,000.00
YELAR Fee: $3,500.00
Total one-time upfront fee of $8,000.00 for the term of the License
(Sec. 5-2A-4 and 5-2B-4)
Tree Mitigation Fee: None
The area of the License is: 0.024 Acre
Concurrence(s):
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
Grantee has met the insurance requirements under the License Agreement.
The Forest Preserves staff has reviewed this license application and plans and have found them to be
acceptable; therefore, it is recommended that the Forest Preserve District Board of Commissioners
approve the issuance of this license.

REPORT
Department: Resource Management
Request: Receive and File
Report Title: Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan
Report Period: N/A
Summary: In October of 2013 the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) partnered
with the University of Illinois’s Prairie Research Institute (“PRI”) for the purpose of developing a
Natural and Cultural Resources Master Plan (the “Plan”) as part of the celebration of the 100th
Anniversary of the Forest Preserves. The Plan was designed to establish a logical framework to identify
and prioritize management of the Forest Preserves’ natural and cultural resources. The Plan will help
guide the allocation of resources and inform strategies to accomplish the ambitious goals set forth in the
Next Century Conservation Plan, including the goal to restore 30,000 acres within 25 years. Moreover,
the Plan provides targeted insight into the development of the rhetorical narrative needed to
communicate the aforementioned goals to the people of Cook County and beyond.
Legislative History: 2/11/15 Item was withdrawn by the Sponsor.
