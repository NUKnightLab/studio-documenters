parking area has been abandoned for more than a year and is currently blighted.
With the recent road work improvements in this area this property has been
reduced and is deteriorating at a rate that makes it difficult to encourage new

business tax income. East Hazel Crest is a small land locked community with a
small business base. This particular property would benefit by the addition of
adjoining property (requested in a second No Cash Bid application) if it were
combined to make a more marketable site. It would assist the Village in maximizing
the sales tax potential.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the
requested property until that time a developer is located.
There is no Third Party Request, proposal or agreement by a developer,
organization or other private party for this no-cash bid request.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner,

The City of Markham, Illinois would like to take advantage of the no-cash-bid

parcels from 161st Street to 162nd Street between Dixie Highway and Leavitt

I therefore respectfully request that the Cook County Board consider and approve

sought to be acquired. The parcels are listed by Volume and Property Index

In further support to this request, please find submitted herewith a certified copy of
Resolution No. 10-R-429 passed by the City Council formally requesting
participation in the No-Cash-Bid Program.
The City intends to offer the seven (7) properties acquired to a developer for
commercial/industrial use. Such development will serve to restore these properties
as viable tax revenue-producing sources, contribute to an increase of the tax base
of the City and contribute to an increased flow of State sales tax with its
concomitant benefit to the City.
The City does not have a third party developer to transfer title at this time. The City
will file for tax exempt status on all properties because it will retain the PINs until
the tax deeds are conveyed to a developer.
Additionally, the City will benefit through the elimination of eyesores scattered
around the requested parcels and a hope for revitalization of the quality of life in the
community.
The proposed development will also generate employment
opportunities for City residents.
The developer (to be determined) will be responsible for all legal activity and
expense necessary to obtain tax deeds to the property and will bear all legal and
other costs associated with the acquisition.
The City will submit to the Cook County Department of Economic Development
annual reports on the status of acquired property for five (5) years after acquisition
or until development of those properties is complete.

CITY OF ROLLING MEADOWS (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a
Communication from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee,
submitting a request from Sarah Phillips, City Manager, City of Rolling Meadows.
Re: No Cash Bid Request Package for the City of Rolling Meadows.
I am writing to state the City of Rolling Meadows’ interest in receiving a No Cash
Bid for the following one (1) Property Index Numbers (PIN) for No Cash Bid
purchase and approval by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
CITY OF ROLLING MEADOWS
VOLUME

PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

150

02-36-100-010-0000

This request package contains one (1) PIN.
The property is a swath of green space that is situated in the heart of the City of
Rolling Meadows’ downtown area. The property is sandwiched between the Rolling
Meadows Shopping Center and Salt Creek and leads directly into Kimball Hill Park
to the north. The property was originally platted and designated for storm water
detention for the development of the shopping center. A large majority of this
parcel is located within the 100 year floodplain with much of that floodplain in
designated floodway. Consequently, this parcel is land-locked, inaccessible and
undevelopable and will remain green, open space. It is anticipated that the parcel
will remain City property whether it be retained by the City of Rolling Meadows or
be conveyed to the Rolling Meadows Park District. The parcel itself will remain and
be maintained as green space and added to the Salt Creek green belt that
traverses through the heart of the City of Rolling Meadows.
The City of Rolling Meadows will file for tax exempt status for this property while the
City retains the property or the Park District when and if it is conveyed the property.
