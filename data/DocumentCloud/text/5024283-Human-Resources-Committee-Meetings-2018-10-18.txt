Report from Interim Chief Human Resources Officer (Attachment #1)
Barbara Pryor, Interim Chief Human Resources Officer, reviewed her report, which included information on the
following subjects:
Using Technology to Bridge the Gap between Human Resources and Employees
• Cloud-Based Technology to Transform Transactional HR to Strategic HR
• HR ServiceLink Portal and Rollout
Absence Management
• Absence Management Compliance
• Assessment for Change
• The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) / Leave Process Flow
• Reporting and Analytics
• What’s Next
Metrics - HR Activity Report:
• Improve / Reduce Average Time to Hire
• HR Activity Report – Open Vacancies
• Hiring Snapshot
• Licensed Nurses Hiring Snapshot
• Revenue Cycle Hiring Snapshot
Feroze Khan, Leave Administration Officer, reviewed the information on absence management. During the
discussion of the information, Acting Chair Thomas inquired as to the number of different ways this data can be
sorted - by job classification, department, job title? Ms. Pryor responded in the affirmative; she stated that they do
have those data points, and they plan to come back to the Committee in the coming months with information on
how it can be sorted. Board Chair Hammock recommended that a new metric be created in the coming months to
reflect the number of days or hours in the month in which employees are absent. Acting Chair Thomas stated that,
in the future, it would be interesting to review an overlay of the absentee data against data on usage of registry and
outside personnel used to fill these holes.
During the discussion of the Licensed Nurses Hiring Snapshot on Slide 19, which reflected that 244 nursing
positions are in process, Director Driscoll inquired regarding the total number of nursing positions in the System.
Ms. Pryor responded that she did not have that number at hand, but would provide the information after the
meeting.
