Proposal for Recycling, Clean Up, and Waste Removal Services
Event: Cannabis Cup Vegas

Dates: Sept 9?10

Location: Russell Industrial Center, Detroit, MI

Date Submitted: July 26, 2017
Attn: Sameen Ahmad

Companv Overview and Historv

Clean Vibes is a company formed and dedicated to the responsible on-site waste management of
outdoor festivals and events. Our mission is to actively encourage and promote composting, recycling
and proper waste disposal. We hope to educate and inspire a new generation of responsible stewards.
We have a documented record of diverting high levels of festival generated waste from landfills by
increasing the amount of material that is recycled and composted, thereby greatly reducing the
ecological footprint of outdoor festivals and events. With over a fifteen years of experience, Clean Vibes
has a consistent track record of providing results.

Clean Vibes, LLC is a company based in North Carolina with a branch in Vallejo, CA. We are now in our
fifteenth year as an independently owned corporation. The company is fully insured and carries a
general liability policy, a commercial auto policy and a workers compensation policy for the state of
California.

Value to Cannabis Cub

 

First and foremost, Clean Vibes is committed to providing festivals with a comprehensive waste
management system. Our goal is to ensure that all facets of the event?s waste collection and cleanup
are effectively managed so that event production staff do not have to worry about this component of
the event. We bring with us the experience of having successfully handled the waste management at
over 250 previous events, ranging in size from less than 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees.
Clean Vibes knows how to clean a site in a cost efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly manner.
We also understand how important the maintenance and cleanup of an event is to its continued
success, as well as to the relationship the event has with the local community.

At the core of the mission and work of Clean Vibes is a genuine dedication to providing substantial and
measurable results when it comes to diverting waste from the landfill. Our focus is not on merely
creating an appearance or image of a ?green' festival. Our focus is on ensuring that there is real
substance behind the waste diversion efforts of every event we work. All Clean Vibes employees are
equally passionate about minimizing the waste footprint of the events that we work, while at the same
time educating attendees about responsible waste habits.

Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590? (707)563-9232

Based on our previous work at music festivals, Clean Vibes has developed a high level of positive name
recognition and respect among the attendees of these events. The attendees associate Clean Vibes with
a commitment to environmentally responsible waste management, and a commitment to
environmental stewardship. They know that having Clean Vibes involved in an event means that the
waste will be handled in an environmentally responsible manner.

Another value that Clean Vibes brings to a festival is the ?vibe.? Attendees appreciate seeing our crew
having fun while working hard. The 'vibe? that our crew brings to an event helps to actively engage the
attendees in the clean up process significantly minimizing the grounds cleanup. In addition, the
systems that we put in place at each event help to spread awareness about diversion efforts in general,
while also increasing the efforts of attendees to take responsibility for their own waste.

In summary, Clean Vibes will make valuable contributions to the Cannabis Cup in each of the following
ways:

0 Extensive experience with music food/drink festivals handled waste management at over 250
events, ranging in size from 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees

- Dedication and documented success in achieving high levels of waste diversion

- Commitment to educating attendees about responsible waste management
0 Positive name recognition and respect within the festival community
0 The ?vibe' we bring to an event

0 Ensuring the event is recognized as an event that is committed to minimizing its ecological
footprint

Proposed Scope of Work
Set Up and Implementation of Waste Management Collection System

Clean Vibes proposes to implement a comprehensive waste management plan for the festival site.
Attendee participation in the maintenance and clean up of the event grounds will be a top priority for
our crew and work plan.

Clean Vibes will set up and strategically place up to 300 recycling and trash collection containers in
groups as necessary. All collection stations will be clearly marked with signage as to the appropriate
receptacle for each type of material (recycling or landfill). We will routinely patrol the festival site and
empty containers as necessary, as well as cleanup trouble spots. Clean Vibes will thoroughly clean the
site of the previous day?s waste in time for the opening of the venue on Sunday. After the event, Clean
Vibes will thoroughly clean the site in as timely a manner as possible. Staff members will hand pick the
site, bag loose litter, and collect all bags of waste for proper disposal.

Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590? (707)563-9232

Clean Vibes will provide a small crew on 9/7, full crew on 9/8?9/11, and an final sweeps small crew on
9/12.

Increasing Awareness and Marketing of Sustainability Efforts
lf desired, Clean Vibes management will work with High Times to:
II Develop appropriate advance messaging strategies to attendees about responsible waste

management using the festival website, mailing lists, press releases, etc.

I Provide input on any possible ?greening' related components of the event in order to develop a
comprehensive and coordinated sustainability initiative

0 Work with the festival team to help create onsite messaging and creative ways of educating
attendees about their waste footprint

- Help communicate to all festival staff and vendors about appropriate disposal of waste and how
they can work as a team to minimize the overall waste footprint of the event

Cost for Clean Vibes? Services

Below is a breakdown of costs for Clean Vibes? services for the Cannabis Cup Detroit in 2017. it is our
hope that, when the various bids for this event are evaluated, more than just the bottom line cost of
services will be taken into consideration. We hope that the substance and quality of each bidder?s
waste diversion efforts will be seen as a source of added value and that the various bidders? track
records on this source of value will also be taken into account. There are certainly other companies that
are able to setup the appropriate collection containers and clean the festival site. However, Clean Vibes
is the only company that has the skills and experience to achieve high levels of waste diVersion through
recycling. We have a proven track record of achieving unparalleled diversion rates and the ability to
provide clients with documented results. If High Times is committed to taking its sustainability efforts
to the next level by diverting a substantial amount of festival waste from the landfill while ensuring a
thorough and timely cleanup of the site, choosing to work with Clean Vibes will prove to be a
investment.
