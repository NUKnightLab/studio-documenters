**Report from System Human Resources Department (Attachment #1)
A. Report from Interim Director of Human Resources
Gladys Lopez, System Interim Director of Human Resources, provided an update on the following subjects:
CCHHS Employment Plan; Organizational Transformation; Cook County Department of Public Health-Human
Resources; Recruiting Update; 2012 House Staff; and Vacancies Filled Through August 20, 2012. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee further discussed the subject of organizational transformation. Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive
Officer, indicated that this transformation will reorganize the organizational structure to fit a more outpatient
model. There will be a group that is in charge of inpatient services and a group that is in charge of outpatient
services. With regard to the Shared Services model, this would include those services that are shared by
inpatient and outpatient services; Human Resources, Information Technology, Finance, and General Counsel’s
Office are examples of those departments that would fall under the Shared Services model. Dr. Raju added that
staff is also in the process of changing some of the job classification descriptions; this will help to make this
organization more flexible and nimble. He noted that when this reorganization plan is finalized, it will be
brought before the Committee for review prior to implementation1.
