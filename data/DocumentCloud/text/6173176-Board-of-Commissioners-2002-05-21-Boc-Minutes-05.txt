MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING

OF THE

COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

May 21, 2002
The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular meeting on Tuesday, May
21, 2002 at 8:30 a.m. at Lathrop Homes, Boys & Girls Club, located at 2915 N. Leavitt Street in
Chicago.
The meeting was called to order by the Chairperson, and upon roll call, those present and absent

Sharon Gist Gilliam
Hallie Amey
Dr. Mildred Harris
Sandra Young
Earnest Gates
Leticia Peralta Davis

Absent:

Michael Ivers

Also present were Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer; Gail Niemann, General Counsel;
Chicago Housing Authority Staff Members and the General Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as follows:
The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and the
public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Per Mr. Peterson, one of the core goals of the Plan For
Transformation is to improve the quality of life for residents, even in buildings slated for
demolition. According to Mr. Peterson, since private property managers were hired two years ago,
the vast backlog of work orders have been eliminated. In addition, the response time required for
non-emergencies has been cut to an average of 30 days and for emergencies to 24 hours. Mr.
Peterson then continued by highlighting the recommendation scheduled for Board approval
whereby seven new property mangers were pre-qualified to compete in the new round of
management contracts. Mr. Peterson concluded his report by informing the Board and public at
large that property management will be especially important in the coming years as CHA
continues to expand relocation and redevelopment, therefore, all property managers have been
asked to go the extra mile, not only for residents but also to advance the Plan For Transformation.

(Item A1)
The Authority’s Employee Policy Guide requires that in the event an employee claims an on-thejob injury, management must respond by obtaining immediate medical attention for the employee.
The employee is also required to submit to a drug and alcohol testing as immediately as possible.
Since 1995, CHA has used MercyWorks to provide these services. MercyWorks notified CHA of
outstanding invoices dating back to 1995. These invoices were for the initial chemical screening
for new employees and for treating and testing of CHA employees injured on the job. The CHA
Risk Management Department has reviewed the invoices submitted by MercyWorks and verified
the legitimacy of the invoices. The Resolution for Item A1 approves payment of $180,000 to
MercyWorks for the period 1995 through 2001.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-53
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated April 18, 2002

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer, or his
designee, to pay $180,000.00 to MercyWorks for the provision of CHA employees
for work related injuries for the period 1995 through 2001.

(Item A2)
A Request for Proposal was issued in March soliciting qualified firms and/or individuals who
could provide strategic technology planning services for the CHA. The CHA directly solicited 170
firms, including 57 MBE/WBE firms. 134 firms picked up the bid document. The Evaluating
Committee selected Bronner Group as the most qualified firm due to their ability to meet the
CHA’s needs at a competitive price. The Resolution for Item A2 approves award of contract to the
Bronner Group.
RESOLUTION NO. 2002-CHA-54
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the

(Item B2)
In March 2001, the Board authorized the execution of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between the CHA and Department of Environment (DOE) to perform all environmental reviews
and prepare all necessary documentation for the Plan pursuant to the MTW Agreement. As part of
the development plans created for implementation of the Plan for Transformation, there will be an
occasional need for targeted remediation activities to be performed to prepare sites for
development. In order to timely perform these targeted environmental remediation activities, the
CHA subsequently determined that it would be beneficial to employ the services and expertise of
DOE. DOE has developed a thorough and detailed program for the remediation of environmental
contamination in real property and has staff in place with experience and expertise for the effective

remediation projects. The resolution for Item B2 approves Amendment No. 1 to the IGA with

the qualifications of private property management firms. In April 2002, the authority advertised a
