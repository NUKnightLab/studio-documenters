RE: Petition No. 147 Intersection Consulting Group, request the vacation of the
north-south alley between Hendricks and the east-west alley west of Chene
and dedication of property for 23? wide alley for continuation of existing
east-west alley.

Petition No. 147 of Intersection Consulting Group on behalf of Ciena Healthcare and the
Eastwood Skilled Nursing Home Replacement project, request for the vacation of the
south 1/2 of the north-south public alley, 18 feet wide, in the block bounded by Hendricks
Avenue, 50 feet wide, Hunt Street, 50 feet wide, Dubois Avenue, 50 feet wide and Chene
Street, 60 feet wide; also for dedication of an alley outlet onto Chene Street in the same
block.

The request is being made to consolidate parcels of land and to accommodate a new
development consisting of a 100,000 square foot skilled nurse facility and associated
campus.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation
(utility review) and report. This is our report.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the vacation
provided certain provisions are met. The DWSD provisions are a part of the attached
resolution.

Flaming and Deve10pment Department reports involvement and has provided a
recommendation of approval to Building and Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department with the condition that the consultant continue to confer with 
regarding color palette before the ?nal permits are pulled. (Special Land Use Hearing 
18-17)

Comcast reports involvement with for removal and relocation of their facilities. Comcast
has received payment and is in the process of rerouting ?bers, and scheduling the ?bers
splicing for a later date as dispatch allows to splice in the new ?bers.

DTE Energy Electric Division (DTE-E) reports being involved with electric facilities in
the vacation area. The estimated cost for removing and rerouting their services is
$19,570.61 to remove 2 poles, 3 spans of primary conductors, 1 span of secondary

conductors, 1 span of secondary neutral, 1 transformer, 1 street light; and to install down
guys anchors and rebuild 2 poles. A provision for DTE Energy is made a part of thei
resolution.

DTE Energy Gas Division (DTE-G) reports being involved with the removal of the gas
facilities in the vacation area or a grant of easement. A provision for removal of DTE-G
facilities at cost to be borne by the petitioner or the granting of an easement for DTE-G is
a part of the resolution.

All other involved City departments and privately owned utility companies have reported
no objections to the vacation and dedication. Provisions protecting the rights of the
utilities and the City are a part of this resolution.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Respectfully submitted,

RE Vacation of Alley between Hendricks and Alley West of Chene, and
Dedication of property for 23? wide Alley for continuation of existing Alley

On behalf of Ciena Healthcare and the Eastwood Skilled Nursing Home Replacement project, we
respectfully request approval for the vacation of the 18? public alley beginning at Hendricks St,West of
Chene, and tracking North to the existing East/West alley North of Hendricks. In addition, Ciena would
like to dedicate land over the northerly 23 feet of Lot 12 of Block 23. This dedication and repurposing as a
public alley, will prevent the existing East/ West alley from incurring a ?dead end? and will allow users
continued access. These actions are requested in conjunction with establishment of a new 100,000 square
foot skilled nursing facility (under construction) and associated campus.

This $15 million project will be the first new construction, skilled nursing facility built in the City of
Detroit in over forty years.
The site plans and ALTA surveys have been included with this petition request. Please feel free to contact

me with any questions.

RE: Wayne County Community
College District

Request to Outright Vacate Utility Easement
On the Block Bounded by
Fort, Sixth, John C. Lodge, and Congress

Project:

Project Number: 19160.00D
Wayne County Community College District as owner of the property located at 971 Fort
Street, has authorized Giffels Webster to request and facilitate the vacation of an utility easement on the
subject property. Giffels Webster, headquartered at 28 W. Adams, Suite 1200, Detroit, Michigan 48226,
therefore respectfully requests the City of Detroit outright vacate the following utility easement:

Outright vacation of an 20? wide utility easement within the previously vacated [with easement]
alley extending east from Sixth St, adjacent to the proposed Health and Wellness
Education Center. . Approximate limits of the vacation can be found in Exhibit 1, enclosed herein.

Giffels Webster has been authorized to facilitate the requested vacation. We will be working with the City
of Detroit?s Department of Public Works?City Engineering Division and all stakeholders to achieve
vacations that are satisfactory to all interested parties.

The requested vacation will neither impede pedestrian and vehicular traffic, nor will it interfere with the
maintenance of the public rights-of?way, including utility company and Fire and Police Departments access.
Furthermore, the existing sewer located within this easement does not service other properties and can be
removed without negative impact on the community. Please refer to the supplemental information enclosed
for details.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Darga by phone, at
313.962.4442, or by email, at mdarqat?lqiffelswebstercom.

Respectfully,

The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution.

Comcast reports having a relocation cost associated with the request; and the petitioner
has made arrangements with Comcast for their relocation. A provision for Comcast is a part of the

Honorable City Council:

RE: Wayne County Annual Special Events Permit

An Annual Permit granting permission to temporarily close a County road for a reasonable
length of time for a parade, marathon, celebration, festival or similar activity, or to use a
County road as a detour for traf?c around such activity taking place on a non-County road
may be issued by the Wayne County Permit Of?ce to the City of Detroit.

As a condition of the annual permit, the County requires that the governing body pass a
blanket resolution, effective for all permitted road closures for Special events and installation
of banners planned throughout the year which:

1) Agrees to ful?l all permit obligations and conditions for the current year.

2) To the extent allowed by law, hold harmless and defends Wayne County and its of?cials
and employees against any and all damage claims, suits or judgments of any kind or
nature arising as a result of the permitted activity.

3) Designates and authorizes an appropriate of?cial of the requesting municipality to sign
the permit on its behalf.

A resolution based on the Model Community Resolution Authorizing Execution of Wayne
County Permits for the year of 2019 is attached.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

obligations or liabilities byvendors and contractors of the City, or their subcontractors.

The City shall take no unlawful action or conduct which arises either directly or indirectly out of its

damages.

With respect to any activities authorized by Permit, when the City requires insurance on its
own or its contractor's behalf, it shall also require that such policy include as named insured the

necessary police supervision, establish detours and post all necessary signs and other traf?c
control devices in accordance with the Michigan Manual of Uniform Traf?c Control Devices.

be cancelled or otherwise terminated by the City with regard to any Permit which has already
beenissued or activity which has alreadybeen undertaken.

signed by the City's authorized representative.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following individual(s) is/are authorized in their of?cial
capacity as the City's authorized representative to sign and so bind the City to the provisions of
any and all permits applied for to the County of Wayne, Department of Public Services Engineering

A RESOLUTION CREATING THE DETROIT CITY COUNCIL RETURNING CITIZENS
TASK FORCE

PRESENTED BY: COUNCIL MEMBER AYERS

WHEREAS A returning citizen?s success outside of prison is dependent on the quality
and quantity of support received in the first few months after being
released. Often times, especially in low?income urban areas such as
Detroit, an individual?s family and community do not have the means or
desire to provide this support. This leaves returning citizens in hopeless
economic and social situations that quickly lead to criminal activity out of
necessity; and

WHEREAS Every year, between 3,000 and 5,000 returning citizens are released back
into Detroit communities. The Returning Citizens Task will work to help
these men and women adjust to the numerous aspects of life necessary to
be successful, both personally and professionally. The task force will bring
together entities that are already helping returning citizens, ensuring that
quality services are offered and fostering collaboration between service
providers. NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED That the Detroit City Council hereby creates the Detroit City Returning
Citizens Task Force until January 1, 2020. The task force will provide a
central governing body and location for willing service providers to
collaborate and provide returning citizens easy access to a wide range of

services; AND BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED That the Returning Citizens Task Force will be chaired by Council
Member Ayers; AND BE IT FINALLY

RESOLVED That the Returning Citizens Task Force meetings are open to the public,
with dates, times, and locations to be noticed by the Detroit City Clerk.

 

.MISSION STATEMENT:

It is the mission of the Returning Citizens Task Force to pr?vide a variety of services to people
returning to their communities after serving time in services will help them adjust
to numerous aspects of life necessary to be successful, both personally and professionally.
Offering a diversity of services at one location will make it easier and more efficient for our
citizens to get a majority of their often neglected needs met. Bringing together entities that are
already helping returning citizens will ensure that the task force offers quality service and will
allow these entities to collaborate to provide more effective service.
