A motion was made by Mr. Foley to place the above-referenced items on the Board
agenda for June 14, 2019. The motion was seconded by Commissioner Lundy.
Commissioner Lundy asked staff to present to the Executive Committee in the future the
names of the firms and the proposal amounts submitted to NOACA.
Commissioner Lundy stated that he would like information on how the Regional Strategic
Transit Plan will be paid. He said he would assume the voters would have a say in how
the plan gets funded.
Commissioner Lundy suggested that NOACA accelerate the schedule of the Regional
Strategic Transit Plan so information can be provided to taxpayers within the presidential
voting year, 2020.
Ms. Susanna Merlone stated that the consultant team chosen is AECOM, its partner is
WSP, and its DBE is Mr. Peter Lawson Jones, who will be handling the outreach
component. Ms. Merlone stated that both bids submitted to NOACA were under $150,000
and were scored by a team of five people. She noted that AECOM was determined to be
more qualified because of its experience working with transit strategic plans.
Ms. Kathy Sarli stated that NOACA set the schedule at 18 months to ensure more thought
went into the research and other work. She said the plan could be completed a little
sooner.
Ms. Gallucci stated that staff will look at the project schedule to see what can be done
sooner.
Ms. Merlone stated that NOACA allowed 18 months to ensure all miscellaneous items are
completed. She said staff could produce a report or provide recommendations sooner
than 18 months.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that the study was delayed to ensure alignment between this study
and the study being done by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA).
Commissioner Lundy commented on the importance of seeing what the plan looks like,
finding out how much it will cost, and what information should be discussed with taxpayers.
He suggested that NOACA set a tighter timeline.
Chief McCall stated that GCRTA’s strategic plan focuses on the needs in Greater
Cleveland / Cuyahoga County, while NOACA’s Regional Strategic Transit Plan focuses
on what can be done in the region to have better connections. She said NOACA’s plan
provides an extra layer of support for what should be done by each county.
Chief McCall stated that the consultant team should provide regular updates on their work.
She noted that 18 months is not a long time for a regional strategic transit plan and
8240c

1-2

 cautioned staff against shrinking the schedule too much and having the consultant do the
work too fast.
Chief McCall mentioned that some things could be done simultaneously, such as counties
in the region working together to address transit borders. She said NOACA’s strategic
plan will help counties to better align their resources.
Ms. Gallucci stated that staff will talk to the consulting team about consolidating the
schedule. She noted that a new schedule will be presented at the next Board meeting.
Chief McCall stated that AECOM and its partner have probably done a lot of the work.
Ms. Gallucci stated that staff will see if pieces of the study can be extracted and done
sooner than 18 months.
Mr. Foley stated that the Ohio Revised Code (ORC) needs to be changed in order for a
regional transportation system to be considered. He suggested that staff gets input from
AECOM.
Ms. Gallucci said she believed there was a change made to the ORC giving counties the
ability to work together on transit. She said information will be included in the report.
The Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
ODOT- NOACA Interagency Agreement
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA receives approximately $3.3 million in federal
transportation funds annually for its planning efforts. She noted that NOACA and ODOT
share the responsibility of the 3-C planning process and must work cooperatively to
advance the planning process and comply with all state and federal requirements.
Ms. Gallucci presented a list of items that are addressed in the 2020-2021 NOACA-ODOT
Interagency Agreement.
Chief McCall asked if there was anything new in the agreement. Ms. Gallucci said no.
Chief McCall asked the meaning of 3-C.
cooperative, continuing and coordinating.

Ms. Gallucci stated that 3-C stands for

A motion was made by Mr. Foley to put the ODOT- NOACA Interagency Agreement on
the Board agenda for June 14, 2019. The motion was seconded by Commissioner Lundy.
The motion passed by voice vote.
NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD Project
Ms. Gallucci provided background on the NOACA Geauga County Amish Safety BUILD
project. She noted that Board approval is needed so $1.5 million in Transportation
Alternatives Program (TAP) funds can be used for the project. Ms. Gallucci stated that
the BUILD program requires that all funds be obligated for construction prior to
September 30, 2020. She mentioned that NOACA funds are planned for preliminary
engineering and design phases, so activities must begin as soon as possible for
completion prior to the obligation deadline.

8240c

1-3

 Ms. Gallucci stated that the $1.5 million funding request is planned for inclusion in with the
development of the SFY 2021-2024 TIP, which was originally planned for Board approval
in June 2019, but was delayed due to the postponement of the Statewide Transportation
Improvement Program (STIP). She noted that the delay will allow more time to complete
the engineering and design phases prior to the BUILD program deadline.
Ms. Gallucci stated that pending Board approval, the NOACA TIP will be amended to
incorporate the recommended project funding and project development and design
activities will be advanced.
Commissioner Lennon asked if NOACA will miss the June deadline. Ms. Gallucci said
NOACA will miss the internal deadline, not the project deadline, which is in three years.
She said the internal deadline is set for encumbering the funds that will be used for
ODOT’s purposes. She noted that ODOT does not want to wait until September because
it would put the project behind schedule.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that funding will be advanced through NOACA Surface
Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program authority in SFY 2019 and returned to STBG
program from TAP program in SFY 2021, with no impact to existing SFY 2018-2021 TIP
projects.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lennon to move the NOACA Geauga County Amish
Safety BUILD project to the Board agenda for June 14, 2019. The motion was seconded
by Commissioner Lundy.
Commissioner Lundy stated that the Amish safety project is an example of how to address
safety concerns in rural areas. He said it is important to educate communities about the
work being done by NOACA. He suggested that NOACA publicize the project in rural
communities so people are made aware of the value of NOACA. He also suggested that
Geauga County Commissioners provide a platform for NOACA to make a presentation in
their county. He stated that everything needs to be looked at through the lens of safety
and the project is going to make the roads safer for a lot of people in Geauga County.
Chief McCall suggested that NOACA staff work with Geauga County to do some outreach
to the Amish community to get their thoughts on the project.
Commissioner Lennon suggested that NOACA set up a forum or a series of meetings to
meet with the Amish community. He suggested holding meetings early in the process.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Amish community was included in the safety study and will be
included in the project planning.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA’s $1.5 million is leveraging the $9.6 million BUILD grant
from the Federal Government, which would not have happened if NOACA had not put up
its own money and had not headed up the process to get the grant.
Chief McCall stated that she did not believe the Geauga County project would have been
considered for the BUILD grant under the previous NOACA committee structure. She
congratulated NOACA and Geauga County leadership on getting the grant for this project.
The Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.

RE:

State Fiscal Year 2019 Overall Work Program Completion Report

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item for placement on the Board of Director’s
September agenda. Specifically, this item approves NOACA’s State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2019 Overall
Work Program (OWP) Completion Report. The activities outlined in this work program occurred between
July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019. ODOT requires a Board-approved Completion Report by September 30,
2019.
The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of August 23, 2019.
BACKGROUND
NOACA’s many accomplishments during SFY 2019 were achieved through the leadership of its Board of
Directors, the dedication of its Committees, and the contributions of staff.
Federal law requires that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) develop a unified planning work
program each year that describes all federal-aid planning activities. In Ohio this work program is called
the Overall Work Program (OWP). NOACA develops its OWP consistent with federal and state
transportation and environmental planning guidance.
The completion report outlines staff activities as outlined in the SFY 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP).
It also includes a year-end funding table. The report was prepared for NOACA funding agencies, the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
The SFY 2019 OWP comprises 31 projects comprising 114 individual work products. NOACA spent 83
percent of funding in SFY 2019 to achieve an average project completion rate of 97 percent. Unspent
Consolidated Planning Grant funds have been carried forward into the current fiscal year. A detailed
project level table is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this document.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the 2019 OWP Completion Report will be forwarded to state and federal officials
for review.

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

Budget and Contract Amendment – Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item for placement on the Board of Director’s
September agenda. Specifically, this action would amend the budget from $650,000 to $750,000, and
amend the Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) contract for The Great Lakes
Hyperloop Feasibility Study in the amount of $84,600.
The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of August 23, 2019.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board of Directors, through Resolution 2018-019, authorized a budget of $600,000 and awarded a
contract to Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the development of The
Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study. The Board of Directors also, through Resolution 2019-028,
increased the contract to TEMS from $550,092 to $585,485 for the extension of the corridor from
Youngstown to Pittsburgh. Since the last Board meeting, The Richard King Mellon Foundation has granted
NOACA $100,000 for further analysis of the Cleveland to Chicago and Pittsburgh corridor, which includes
the analysis of an additional representative route to the Pittsburgh airport, station analyses in Cleveland,
Chicago and Pittsburgh, modal split refinement, and project meetings.
A time extension to December 31, 2019 is needed to complete the additional work and outreach efforts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This project is budgeted for expenditure in FY 2019 for $650,000 and is funded through revenues totaling
$750,000 earmarked for the Hyperloop initiative from various partners of NOACA (Cleveland Foundation $200k, ODOT - $250,000, Ohio Turnpike - $100,000), the RK Mellon Foundation - $100,000, as well as
NOACA ($100K). This action would increase the consultant contract from $585,485 to $670,085, and the
budget from $650,000 to $750,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will amend the budget, OWP and the contract with Transportation
Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS).

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the September 2019 Board of Directors’
agenda. Specifically, the item proposes that the projects have completed the Project Planning Review (PPR)
process.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee support this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff, Board (including committees, subcommittees, councils,
which provide intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC)) and public involvement. The end product
of PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The first quarter PPR covers a roadway project in the City of Solon, a bridge project in the Cities of Fairview
Park and Cleveland and a transit project in Lake County. Detailed information about the project can be
found at:
•
•
•

Reconstruct SR-43 in Solon
Bridge Painting on IR-480 and SR-10 in Cleveland and Fairview Park
Laketran Electric Bus

As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

RE:

Plan and TIP Amendments – 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the September 2019 Board of
Directors’ agenda. Specifically, this item directs that NOACA’s long-range transportation plan
(Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
be amended to include the proposed projects as indicated.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee support this
recommendation.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Transportation Plan (Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018
– 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) are being processed through project planning
review (PPR). The projects includes a roadway project sponsored by the City of Solon, a bridge
project sponsored by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and a transit project
sponsored by Laketran.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the proposed projects being amended to the Plan and TIP is $43.0 million. Funding
for these projects is committed and/or planned from a variety of federal, state, and local sources.
Federal funding is provided by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit
Administration and administered through the Ohio Department of Transportation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or
statewide TIP amendment in October 2019.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

NOACA SFY 2021 – 2024 TIP Development – Recommended Projects for
NOACA Controlled Funds

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the Board of Directors’
September agenda. Specifically, the item recommends approval of the projects to be funded
with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds and STBG setasides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the SFY 2021 – 2024 Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP).
The Planning and Programming Committee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA is developing its Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for State Fiscal Years (SFY)
2021-2024, which will be in effect from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024. The TIP will contain
road, bridge, public transit, and other transportation projects scheduled for implementation within
NOACA’s five counties. The TIP will include projects supported by NOACA administered funds
and by other federal funds controlled through ODOT, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), or
by other governmental agencies.
NOACA’s estimated available budget for SFYs 2021 – 2024 is $100 million, which includes
$90.0 million of STBG funds and $10.0 million of TAP funds. The TIP universe of identified
needs included approximately 700 projects totaling more than $1 billion needed for
implementation through the next 2021-2024 TIP timeframe. Given limited resources, the
projects that are recommended for NOACA funding best represent priorities contained in the
AIM Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan while also aligning with established State and
Federal transportation performance management initiatives.
The methodology to filter and evaluate projects was recommended by Transportation
Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee. The projects have been evaluated
by staff against the recommended regional significance and planning criteria and considering
geographic equity and whether they are located in an Environmental Justice, Urban Core, or
Disadvantaged Community. The input received from committees was utilized by staff along with
4 - 11

 other information and data points to develop the project recommendations for NOACA
administered funding.
The project funding recommendations were recommended by the Planning and Programming
Committee at its July 12, 2019 meeting.
The project funding recommendations will be presented to the Board of Directors at its September
13, 2019 meeting for approval.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule
and budget for incorporation into the draft 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded
projects. The final draft TIP will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for
recommendation at its January 17, 2020 meeting and to the Board of Directors at its March 6,
2020 meeting.
Projects recommended for NOACA Administered Funds are attached.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item for placement on the Board of
Director’s September agenda. Specifically, the item proposes the regional priority of projects to
be implemented in SFY2024-2025.
The Planning and Programming Committee has recommended the Regional Priority below as
well as the attached list of project recommendations. A summary of project applications was
provided to the NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee and Transportation Subcommittee at their
respective meetings on June 21, 2019.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program provides funding for transportation
projects and programs that reduce congestion and improve air quality for areas that do not meet
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particular matter.
NOACA expects to receive approximately $30 million for SFY 2024-2025 based on historical
funding allocations.
NOACA announced the solicitation for new projects in April 2019 and applications were due
May 31, 2019. NOACA received 10 applications totaling over $30 million. NOACA staff has
initiated evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in accordance with the statewide
program policy project scoring criteria. The criterion, developed by the eight large MPO’s
comprising the statewide program, includes:
1. Project Type (10 points)
2. Cost Effectiveness (15 points)
3. Other Benefits (15 points)
4. Existing Level of Service (15 points)
5. Positive Impact on Level of Service (15 points)
6. Status of Project (10 points)
7. Non-Federal Match Commitments (10 points)
8. Regional Priority (10, 7, 4, 2 points based on top four project priorities)
9. History of Project Delivery (up to -10 points)
Criteria # 8, Regional Priority, is the only one in which NOACA has the ability to control the

4 - 19

 assignment of points. As previously directed by the Committee and Board, these points have
been applied strategically by staff to maximize CMAQ funding to the region. Based on that
approach, staff is recommending that the bonus points be assigned to projects that provide the
greatest, furthest reaching benefits to the region’s air quality and multimodal transportation
system. It would not be effective to assign bonus points to projects that would already score
well, for example bus replacements. In accordance with this approach, our preliminary analysis
demonstrates that bonus points would be assigned to the following four projects:
10 points – REGIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS
7 points – GCRTA BLUE/GREEN RAIL LINE SHELTER IMPROVEMENTS
4 points – SOM CENTER RD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, WILLOUGHBY
2 points – RICHMOND ROAD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, BEDFORD
Proposed regional priority bonus points have been incorporated into the preliminary draft
evaluation scores for all projects. A summary of the applications received with preliminary draft
evaluation scores is attached to this memo.
The Planning and Programming Committee has recommended the Regional Priority above as
well as the attached list of project recommendations. Staff presented a summary of project
applications to the NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee and Transportation Subcommittee at their
respective meetings on June 21, 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Projects selected for the region will establish the initial CMAQ budgets for SFYs 2024-2025.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Upon Board approval, projects will be submitted to the Statewide CMAQ Program Committee
for evaluation against other statewide projects in October 2019. The Statewide CMAQ Program
Committee will then submit project recommendations to the OARC Executive Directors for final
approval at their November 2019 meeting.

MEMORANDUM

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

August 16, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Revision Request: Transfer of one (1) parcel from the
Lorain County FPA to the Avon Lake/Lorain County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO)
Phase I FPA in Columbia Township

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item for placement on the Board of Director’s
September agenda. Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (1.0 acre) from the Lorain County FPA
to the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I) FPA in Columbia Township.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Water Quality Subcommittee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN) 1200099000009 in
Columbia Township to connect to the LORCO sewer line along Hawke Road (Attachment A). The parcel
currently resides in the Lorain County FPA. In order to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, the parcel must be
transferred to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). Under the federal Clean Water Act, all sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO. To allow for Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road to connect to LORCO’s sewers, an agreement was reached between Lorain County, LORCO, the City
of Avon Lake and Columbia Township in 2016. Under the agreement, upon a written request from a
landowner along Hawke Road to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, all parties agree to give their approval for
the FPA change to transfer the requesting parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. The
agreement also reaffirms Lorain County’s sewer planning authority as the Designated Management Agency
(DMA) for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road.
LORCO requested letters of support from the City of Avon Lake, Lorain County and Columbia Township on
April 1, 2019. Despite the agreement between these entities, comment letters are still required to fulfill the
notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan. All affected jurisdictions submitted letters of support
for the FPA modification (attached).

4 - 23

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

 Staff Comments:
Hawke Road is on the boundary between Eaton Township and Columbia Township in
Lorain County. It is also on the divide between the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I)
FPA and Lorain County FPA. Eaton Township is a member of LORCO and within the
Phase I FPA. Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO and within the Lorain
County FPA. LORCO has a sanitary sewer line that runs along Hawke Road and
Brokaw Road. Due to the current FPA boundary, only the properties along Hawke Road
in Eaton Township can connect to LORCO’s sewer. All sanitary sewer connections must
be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
In 2016, LORCO, Lorain County, City of Avon Lake and Columbia Township signed a
sanitary sewer service agreement for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road, which would like to connect LORCO’s sewers. The agreement stipulates that if a
property owner along Hawke Road requests in writing to be connected to LORCO’s
sanitary sewers, the affected jurisdictions would all support the proposed FPA
amendment to transfer that parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. In
the agreement, Lorain County would remain as the sewer planning Designated
Management Agency (DMA) for all Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road
regardless of the FPA.
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN)
1200099000009 to connect their planned home, currently under construction, to
LORCO’s Hawke Road sewer. The landowners included a Columbia Township building
permit application, a photo of the home at the time of the request, and a letter from
Lorain County Public Health that does not object to the connection of this home to
sanitary sewers (attached). The 1.0-acre parcel on which the home resides is within the
sanitary sewer service agreement area between LORCO and the affected jurisdictions.
The current FPA boundary has the parcel within the Lorain County FPA (Attachment A).
LORCO has requested an FPA modification to transfer this parcel from the Lorain
County FPA to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). No prescription changes are
requested.
Even with the sanitary sewer service agreement between LORCO, City of Avon, Lorain
County and Columbia Township, NOACA’s FPA modification policy still requires LORCO
still must solicit support from the affected jurisdictions to satisfy the notification
requirements in Policy 4-6 of the Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All affected
jurisdictions support the FPA boundary modification request.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the requested FPA boundary modification between
the Phase I FPA and the Lorain County FPA. LORCO has an existing sanitary sewer
along Hawke Road and Brokaw Road with the capacity to accept the flow from the
proposed development. The request also satisfies the provisions in the sanitary sewer
service agreement between the affected jurisdictions to provided sewers, upon request,
to the Columbia Township property owners along Hawke Road. Lastly, the request is
supported by all the affected jurisdictions and Lorain County Public Health.
