research of several options, the Kayak Dock system is recommended based on cost, ease of installation,
and maintenance. The same system is in use at Maple Lake and Bullfrog Lake. Staff is seeking approval
of Kayak Dock as a sole source supplier, because the patented design of the system is only distributed by
Kayak Dock.

Summary:

The Cook County Sheriff’s Office has a program to train inmates and participants from the

Vocational Rehabilitation Impact Center to provide deconstruction and building material salvage services.
Upon completion of the program, each participant will receive basic carpentry and building material reuse
training and an OSHA 10-hour safety certificate. The Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest
Preserves”) seeks authorization to continue use of this program to remove unneeded buildings from
recently acquired properties and on sites intended for redevelopment as needed.
Forest Preserve staff are seeking to extend an on-going partnership with the Cook County Sheriff’s
Office for a fifth year to continue deconstruction and demolition of additional vacant Forest Preserve
buildings at various locations.

Work in the first two (2) years focused primarily on removal of old

campground cabins with an original amount of $84,839.00.

On June 7, 2016, the agreement was extended

again to allow removal of buildings at other sites with an increase of $100,000.00 (Agenda Item 16-0234)
and was extended again on June 6, 2017 for time only (Agenda Item 17-0229).

Three (3) non-camp

buildings were removed in 2017 after asbestos removal and utility disconnections were completed by
others.

Remaining funds are expected to be sufficient to cover the costs for the removal of 4-5 additional

buildings in 2019. This fourth renewal is to extend time for an additional year.
