MINUTES OF THE REGULAR MEETING
OF THE
COMMISSIONERS OF THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
November 18, 2008
The Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority held its Regular Meeting on Tuesday,
November 18 2008, at 8:30 a.m. at LeClaire Courts Park District Fieldhouse, 5120 W. 44th
Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairperson Nesbitt called the meeting to order and upon roll call, those present and absent were
as follows:
Present:
Martin Nesbitt
Hallie Amey
Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers
Samuel Mendenhall
Bridget O’Keefe
Sandra Young
Absent:

Carlos Ponce

Also present were Lewis Jordan, Chief Executive Officer, Kris Warren, Executive Vice
President, Asset Management; Scott Ammarell, General Counsel; Chicago Housing Authority
Staff Members and the General Public.
There being a quorum present, the meeting duly convened and business was transacted as
follows:
Upon Motion made and properly seconded the Commissioners adjourned to Executive Session.
The Chairperson announced that pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board
would adjourn for approximately one (1) hour to possibly discuss pending, probable or imminent
litigation, personnel related matters, collective negotiating matters, purchase sale and lease of
real estate property; establishment of reserves and settlement of claims.
At approximately 9:10 a.m., Commissioner Ponce joined the meeting in session.
At approximately 9:55 a.m. the Commissioners subsequently reconvened in Open Session and
Chairman Nesbitt thereupon convened the Public Hearing portion and Business Sessions of the
meeting.
Mr. Lewis Jordan, Chief Executive Officer, commenced his report by reporting on a series of
events including update on HCV Program, Landlord Symposium, Leasing Activities, CHA’s
Homeownership Program, and distribution of winter coats to CHA residents. Mr. Jordan then
informed the Commissioners that based on extensive analysis of crime statistics in CHA’s
portfolio it was clearly evident that crime rates and the relocation process cannot be linked. Of
the 70 communities that CHA residents have relocated only six have seen crime increases and
these appear to have no correlation to the number of former CHA residents living there. Mr.
Jordan then provided the Commissioners with additional data to support his position. Mr. Jordan
concluded his report by proudly announcing that CHA and Holsten’s Real Estate Corporation
were recipients of the prestigious Chicago Architectural Foundation Patron of the Year Award
for the preservation and rehabilitation of Hilliard Homes.
The Chairperson then convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents
and the public at large to address the Board. Immediately following the Public Hearing portion of
the meeting, the Chairman introduced the Resolutions discussed in Executive Session.
Immediately following Public Hearing, Commissioner Young presented an Omnibus Motion for
the approval of resolutions for Executive Session Items 1 thru 4.

report. Per Commissioner O’Keefe the Finance & Audit Committee held its regular meeting on
Wednesday, November 12, 2008 at approximately 1:15 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren Corporate
Offices. The Chief Financial Officer and staff presented the Committee with the Treasury &

Commissioner O’Keefe then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for

(Item A1)
The resolution for Item A1 ratifies the expenditure of $93,000 for postage for CHA and its
Housing Choice Voucher contractors for the period covering May 1, 2008 through October 31,
2008 and grants approval of $606,000 for the expenditures anticipated for postage expenses for
the period covering November 1, 2008 thru April 30, 2010. The CHA entered into a two year
contract with three one year options with Pitney Bowes Management Services, Inc. to manage all
mailroom services for the Chicago Housing Authority and its Housing Choice Voucher
contractors. The consolidation of mailroom services for these entities resulted in an annual
increase in postage expense of 437% over CHA’s postage expenses the previous year. Postage is
purchased through “Postage By Phone,” a subsidiary of Pitney Bowes, without any markup or
handling charges. It is the only source that can electronically add postage to the postage meter
supplied by Pitney Bowes as part of its agreement with the CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-139
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 12,
2008, entitled “RATIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION OF POSTAGE
EXPENSES FOR THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY AND ITS
HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER CONTRACT”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratifies the expenditure of $93,300.00 for postage
used for the period covering May 1, 2008 through October 31, 2008 and
authorizes the anticipated expenditure for postage expenses in the amount of
$606,006.00 for the period covering November 1, 2008 through April 30, 2010
for the Chicago Housing Authority and its Housing Choice Voucher contractors.

(Item A2)
The resolution for Item A2 approves contract award with Piocon Technologies for the
development and implementation of the CHA’s Data Mart Initiative. To support the Plan for
Transformation, the CHA’s federated data warehouse system and its component Data Marts are
intended to serve the Authority as a repository for important data for the purposes of analysis and
reporting across various periods. It contains raw data and information for management’s
decision support systems, and allows the Authority to perform complex queries and analysis on
the information without impacting the performance of CHA operating systems. The Data Marts
will be defined and implemented to meet the immediate and specifically identified CHA
3

 requirements for HUD regulatory reporting, Hope VI reporting, Property reporting and Financial
reporting. The CHA advertised a Request for Proposal in July 2008 in area newspapers and on
the CHA website. The CHA also directly solicited sixty-five vendors, and the solicitation was
sent out to seventeen Assist Agencies as well. Based on the five proposals received one was
deemed non-responsive. After review of the proposals and presentations Piocon was determined
to be the most responsive, responsible vendor whose proposal was found to best satisfy CHA’s
requirements. Piocon’s proposed solution would be advantageous to the CHA since it better
leveraged systems, software, applications and represented a more robust and more compatible
option that could be readily integrated with the CHA’s many existing Oracle systems.
Commissioner Ponce Abstained from voting on Item A2.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-140
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated November 12,
2008, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
PIOCON TECHNOLOGIES, INC., FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND
IMPLEMENTATION OF CHA DATA MARTS TO BE INCORPORATED
INTO THE CHA’S FEDERATED DATA WAREHOUSE”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a contract with Piocon
Technologies, Inc., for the development and implementation of the CHA’s Data
Mart Initiative, including provision of RDM-Regulatory, Hope VI, Property and
Financial Reporting Data Marts to be incorporated into the CHA’s Federated Data
Warehouse in a total amount not-to-exceed $2,123,563.00, which includes
funding for the base phase of development and implementation of the Data Mart
Foundation and initial Data Marts in the fixed fee amount of $1,403,960.00, with
an option for additional development and implementation of second phase Data
Marts for Property and Financial Reporting, in the fixed fee amount of
$719,603.00.
It is further recommended that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes funding for the necessary Oracle software and support in the amount of
$662,163.00, and further authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
contract for the provision of the necessary Oracle software and support for the
Data Mart Initiative from either Piocon or Oracle Corporation, whichever is
determined to be the most efficient and cost-effective source in the CHA’s
exercise of reasonable discretion.

 (Item B1)
The Asset Management Department analyzed the scavenger services being provided across the
developments and found that the service and cost varied from development to development, even
within the same management company’s portfolio.
Therefore, with expectations of
standardizing the performance and the cost of services being provided by portfolio, the Asset
Management Department required each property management company to contract with one
waste removal vendor for all sites within its portfolio. Based on the Request for Proposal
advertised in area newspapers, three proposals were received, however, one respondent was
deemed non-responsive. Based on the evaluation criteria, Independent Recycling was ranked the
highest and deemed the most responsive and responsible vendor. Accordingly the resolution for
Item B1 approves award of contract to Interstate Realty Management Company.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-141
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated November 12, 2008, entitled “Authorization for Interstate

 There being no questions or discussion, the Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried
and said resolutions adopted. The Operations and Facilities Committee report was also accepted
in total.
Commissioner Young, Chairperson of the Tenant Services Committee, then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner Young the Tenant Services Committee held its regular

Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items C1 and C3 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services
Committee.
(Item C1)
The resolution for Item C1 approves exercising the first one-year option and amends Contract
No. 7078 with Illinois Action for Children (ILAC) to provide enhanced child care resource and
referral services for CHA families. The Contract was initiated in 2007, and extended through
December 2008, to satisfy the Building Code Violation Settlement Agreement between the CHA
and the City of Chicago, which requires the CHA to fund administrative support and a childcare
referral programs for CHA residents through 2009. One component of the program includes
making enhanced referrals for families to child care and/or early childhood education programs
based on their specific needs and eligibility for various programs. Additionally, IAFC program
staff conducts home visits and provide personal support to parents and licensed exempt child
care providers in order to develop parenting skills and improve young children’s language and
literacy, and enroll those CHA residents who elect intensive assistance in their Parents as
Teachers® program. As the ACOP’s work-requirement is more stringently enforced and begins
to impact more CHA families in January 2009, accessibility to childcare will become an
increased need for these families. To meet this need, IAFC will be continuing its current
program, including additional resource/referral staff at public health clinics. These continued
efforts should provide more enhanced referrals and allow IAFC to assist the greatest number of
CHA families possible.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-143
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated November 12, 2008, entitled, “AUTHORIZATION TO

designee to exercise the first one-year option and amend Contract No. 7078 with
Illinois Action for Children (“Contract”) to extend the Contract’s term for the

enhanced child care resource and referral services for CHA families. The
Contract’s new aggregate total not-to-exceed compensation amount will be
$1,000,000.00.

(Item C3)
The Golden Diner Program is designed to address the problem of poor nutrition among many
elderly who may be unable to select and/or prepare well balanced meals. The Program provides
full course meals that meet the recommended dietary allowances for older adults to help them
stay healthy. The Program also directly addresses isolation by providing the venue for
socialization and physical activities for seniors to engage in before and/or after meals are served.
In December 2007, the Board authorized a one-year intergovernmental agreement with Chicago
Department of Senior Services (CDSS) to provide two staff supervisors required to oversee the
daily on-site operations and administrative tasks performed by Hospitality Workers to continue
the Golden Diner’s Program at twenty CHA senior buildings. Accordingly, the resolution for

discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services Committee.
(Item C2)
Since 2002, CHA has partnered with CPD to jointly fund the provision of safe, positive and
structured activities for children of CHA residents during the summer months when they are
most at risk. In 2007, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into an IGA with CPD for a base
term of one year with three, one-year options. In 2008, the Board authorized the CHA to
exercise the IGA’s first option covering the period of January 1, 2008 through December 31,
2008. The IGA has had a positive impact on thousands of CHA youth who otherwise may not
have been able to participate in CPD programs due to cost. In 2008, CHA and CPD expanded
the existing programming by creating a year-round voucher program for Children. In addition to
summer programming, the expanded services allow the Children to participate in CPD’s
recreational after-school and weekend programs in the fall, winter and spring. Accordingly, the
resolution for Item C2 approves the second-one year option of the IGA to ensure that the
children of CHA residents will have continued access to these programs. Since 2002 more than
13,000 CHA children have been served by CPD. It is estimated that 2,000 CHA youth will have
participated in CPD summer and fall programs that were made available through this IGA in
2008.
