PROPOSED RESOLUTION
HONORING THE REDEDICATION OF EBENEZER PRIMM
AND HONORING THE LEGACY OF REVEREND JACOB S. BLAKE

TOWERS

IN

EVANSTON,

WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers was the first church sponsored federally funded housing project in
a major suburban area. It was rededicated on Sunday, July 30, 2017. At its rededication, the community
honored the Reverend Jacob S. Blake’s pivotal role in making Ebenezer Primm Towers a reality and the
powerful legacy of Reverend Blake and Ebenezer AME Church; and
WHEREAS, for decades, prior to arriving in Evanston, Reverend Blake was a leader and a major force
for good in the region battling profound injustices, such as redlining, housing discrimination, education
inequity and busing. In Evanston, in addition to so many other issues, he worked tirelessly to establish
affordable housing for the senior citizens in Evanston, where rents were rising rapidly. The result was the
establishment of Ebenezer Primm Towers, which has a proud history that is a reflection of Reverend
Blake and his intense determination and strong leadership; and
WHEREAS, Ebenezer Primm Towers came about in an unprecedented real estate deal with
Northwestern University.
Reverend Blake and Ebenezer AME Church purchased land owned by the
university at 25% below market value for $75,000. According to university officials, Northwestern sold the
land to the church to foster good community relations and to dispel the notion that the university only
expanded in black communities. The Northwestern Black Student Union, the Black Ensemble of
Northwestern and the African American Community in Evanston put pressure on the University to sell the
land. But there was a catch to the deal, if construction didn’t start within 24 months of the sale,
Northwestern University could buy the property back. With the clock ticking, funds were raised via
several sources. The church got a loan to buy the land and received a grant from the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development to help finance the $500,000 construction project. The rest was raised
by the community that pulled together to make the dream a reality; and
WHEREAS, Joseph Levy, owner of a Buick car dealership at the time, donated a brand new Buick to be
auctioned off to raise money for the project. The church held fundraisers which included selling dinners,
hosting basketball tournaments, and events at the Ebenezer AME Church 90th Anniversary Gala.
To
ensure that housing for the elderly remained a priority in Evanston, John Young, Urban Planner of
