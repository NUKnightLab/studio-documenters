PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX

WHEREAS, just two short years ago, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners made good
on the pledge to taxpayers and businesses by repealing the last 25% of the so-called ?Stroger sales tax?; and

WHEREAS, the decision and votes to cut taxes on everyday items a majority of residents need to help working
families, toothpaste, milk, baby formula and other everyday necessities, was made as a means of lessening the
burden on them and stimulating the economy; and

WHEREAS, the tax rollback fulfilled a pledge we made to businesses that were concerned their customers would
buy goods outside Cook County and as such, not only bene?ted Cook County shoppers, but also the retailers that
serve them; and

WHEREAS, economic development also bene?ted as the tax climate is one of the many variables that
businesses consider when deciding where to create jobs; and

Page 69 of 80

WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of the sales tax rollback yielded roughly $440 million in annual savings for
taxpayers; and
