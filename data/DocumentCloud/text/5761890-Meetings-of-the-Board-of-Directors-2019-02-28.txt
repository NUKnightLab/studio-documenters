Impact of Mergers, Consolidations,

Acquisitions

COOK COUNTY

HEALTH

 

Acute care hospital business is low margin
Illinois Health and Hospital Association data
• 42% of Illinois hospitals operating in red or on margin <2%
• Higher proportion in Chicago area

4

 Consolidation is a dominant motif in the current
Hospital landscape
The most vulnerable are most impacted by these changes

The major private systems focus on geographies with a better payer mix for
populations
• AdvocateAuroraHealth (27 hospital system)
• Northwestern (Centegra, Cadence-10 hospital system)
• Trinity (Loyola/Gottlieb/MacNeal/pending Palos; Mercy)

• AMITA (Ascension, inc. former Presence/Adventist)
• University of Chicago Medicine (Ingalls)
• Franciscan Health
5

 Recent Hospital Acquisitions
January 2019: for-profit Tenet Healthcare sold Westlake (Melrose Park),
Weiss (Uptown), and West Suburban (Oak Park/Austin) hospitals to forprofit Pipeline Health.
Pipeline subsequently announced Westlake will close by July 2019.

SerVIce Accessibility Issues For

Vulnerable Communities

COOK COUNTY

HEALTH

 

Consolidation effect
The most vulnerable are most impacted by these changes
System consolidation is creating “access deserts” in vulnerable communities.
Independent hospitals struggle
• Decreasing trends in inpatient utilization
• Community choices

• Funding streams changing
• larger systems show no interest in acquiring them

9

 FQHC Locations in
Cook County
Access to primary care is generally
available through federally qualified
and CCH health centers
Better in city, suburbs still
challenging esp. with limited public
transportation

Cook County Zip Codes Inpatient Capacity is more than sufficient
 In line with the national trend, inpatient utilization for all Illinois hospitals has declined
steadily.
 Inpatient utilization dropped across all Illinois hospitals dropped from 2013 -2017.

• 4% for all IL hospitals
• 12% for Safety Net hospitals
 Median inpatient occupancy of staffed beds across all hospitals in Illinois is 46% (2016).

 Safety net occupancy rates are similar despite significant recent reductions in staffed beds.
 Academic health centers and large non-profits have seen higher occupancy rates

IL Hospital Assessment
Program Transformation

COOK COUNTY

HEALTH

 

Hospital Assessment Program
History
• Since 2014, a portion of those funds flow through Managed Care
Organizations (had been in add-ons under fee-for-service)
• Significant proportion of state payments in Medicaid program
generated by the program
• Why CMS wanted it to change

• Since 2018, significantly more dollars flowed into rate payments from
MCOs

14

 Shifting Assessment Dollars to Claims Payment
Impact of the 2018 spring assessment law
• The law allowed the Department of Healthcare and Family Services to convert $635
million in hospital assessment-funded static payments to claims based payments
effective July 1, 2018 (“Phase I”).
• For some low Medicaid-volume safety nets, this resulted in a net reduction of millions of
dollars in revenue.
• The law authorizes the Department to move additional dollars from program to claims
based payments effective July 1, 2020 (“Phase II”).

• Additional transformation will move increasing amounts of dollars to claims-based
payments (“follow the patient”).
• These challenges pose significant challenges to low volume hospitals.
15

 The Hospital Transformation Fund
Another dimension of the 2018 assessment law
• $262 million dollars of current Medicaid funds currently go to a subset of hospitals as static “transition
payments”
• The law designated these dollars be available as a transformation pool hospitals may apply for receiving
in 2020
• The strategy is that safety net hospitals would transform in ways that bring value to CMS and the
community
• Criteria for transformation funding discussed but currently at a standstill
• Providers, IL Health and Hospital Association, IL Healthcare and Family Services, legislative workgroup
will need to find consensus
16

 What is a Safety Net Hospital?
Defined by 305 ILCS 5/5-5e.1
(Criteria for safety-net hospital status)
A Safety-net hospital is an Illinois hospital that:
• (a) Is licensed by the Department of Public Health as a general acute care or pediatric hospital, and
• (b) Is a Disproportionate Share hospital, as described in Section 1923 of the federal Social Security Act
and
• Meets one of the following criteria:
• (c) Has a Medicaid inpatient utilization rate (MIUR) of at least 40% and a charity percent of at least
4%, or
• (d) Has a MIUR of at least 50%
• “Beginning July 1, 2012 and ending on June 30, 2018, a hospital that would have qualified for the
rate year beginning October 1, 2011, shall be a Safety-Net Hospital.“
*MIUR=Medicaid inpatient utilization rate

(Medicaid insured days/total inpatient days)

 The Net Impact of Trends
These trends will combine to severely threaten independent safety nets:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The ongoing national decline in inpatient services
Lack of outpatient capacity
Movement of funds to claims based payments
Very low number of staffed beds
Challenges with maintaining a deep medical staff
Alternative payment models based on outcomes
Emphasis on the full continuum of care including social determinants

The only system with a willingness to embrace these communities is CCH.

Strategic Recommendations

COOK COUNTY

HEALTH

 

What is Needed? What can CCH uniquely provide?
• We have a broad, deep, dedicated medical staff that is mission-aligned
• We have a shared, mature electronic health record, and increasing ability to
integrate within that system.

• We have invested in technology over time.
• We have a well of trust in the communities we serve.

22

 What is Needed? What can CCH uniquely provide?
CCH can provide the full continuum of care
• Specialty care
• Chronic disease management
• High end diagnostics
• Addressing the social determinants of health
• Robust care coordination

23

 Multi-Specialty Practice Groups
On the rise nationally-why?
1. Better communication among your physicians. Seeing aligned doctors promotes collaboration and ensures more
efficient care. Medical groups utilize a common EHRs that facilitate sharing of information. Improved communication helps
improve outcomes.
2. Access to new treatments and technology. Not only will do MSPGs provide access to additional physicians and
experts, but increased access to new treatments and technologies as well. Integrated medical groups combine the assets of a
particular health care organization.
3. Coordinated care. Integrated medical groups employ physicians who practice in hospital and ambulatory settings,
mitigating potential disruption in care when being admitted or discharged. Working as a team improves efficiency and
quality.
4. Higher standards of quality monitoring. Integrated medical groups have more resources to devote to monitoring
and improving the care provided.
5. Additional clinical resources. As part of a broader health system, physicians in an integrated group can draw on a
wider array of clinical services. These may include things like home care, diabetes education, smoking cessation, cardiac
rehabilitation, and others. It's no longer just visiting your doctor when you are sick.

24

 Strategic Recommendations
Where do we go from here?
• We must be prepared for stressors in hospital environment.
• Economics of Medicaid will continue to cause challenges for privates and not-for-profits, but in
perhaps unpredictable ways.

• The communities with vulnerable populations more likely need access to specialty and diagnostic
services (perhaps Urgent Care) more than acute care hospital beds.
• We will need to significantly improve access to specialty and diagnostic services.
• We will need to develop technologic innovations to assist in services to patients in areas
poorly served by public transportation, including telemedicine and care coordination.
• We must improve the patient experience as we must have revenue from insured patients to
offset the costs of our system.

• We do not have an infinite capacity for Charity Care
