Article III. - County Board, Division I. -- Generally, Section 2-77 is hereby amended as follows:
Section 2-77 Fiscal impact review.

(a) Short title. This Section shall be known and may be cited as the Fiscal Impact Review Ordinance.
(b) Impact note required.
(1) Every measure before the County Board including, but not limited to, any ordinance,
resolution, motion, contract approval, or any amendment thereto (collectively and individually
"measure"), except those measures making a direct appropriation or approving a contract for a
specified amount to be expended within one fiscal year, the purpose or effect of which is to
expend any County funds or to increase or decrease the revenues of the County, or to require the
expenditure of their own funds either directly or indirectly, shall have prepared for it a brief
explanatory statement or note ("fiscal note") which shall include a reliable estimate of the
probable impact of such measure upon the County's annual budget. The Cook County Chief
Financial Officer shall prepare a fiscal impact statement for all ordinances or resolutions that
propose to or would otherwise:
i) expend any funds or increase or decrease the revenues of the County, either directly or
indirectly; or
ii) appropriate funds; or
iii) increase or decrease existing appropriations; or
iv) increase or decrease the fiscal liability of the County; or
v) sell or lease any County asset, including revenue streams from that asset, if the
anticipated revenue from the sale or lease of the asset is greater than $5,000,000,00.
(2) If an ordinance authorizes capital expenditures or appropriates funds for capital expenditures,
a fiscal note shall specify by year any principal and interest payments required to finance such
capital expenditures. In addition, increased operational costs, by year, shall be specified. In no
event shall a fiscal note be required to estimate out-year costs for more than five years.

NOTICE AND AGENDA

November 14, 2018

(c) Responsibility and deadline for furnishing the fiscal note.
1.

The Secretary of the Board chief sponsor of the item under consideration shall request, promptly
after the introduction of the measure before the County Board, the Chief Financial Officer of the
County to prepare a fiscal note impact statement promptly after the introduction of the measure
before the County Board setting forth the information specified in this Section regarding any
measure.

2.

The fiscal impact statement shall be provided to all Commissioners at least 72 hours prior to the
consideration of the ordinance or resolution by the Board of Commissioners; provided a request
by a Commissioner to prepare the fiscal impact statement is made earlier, the Chief Financial
Officer shall prepare the fiscal impact statement and provide it to the Commissioner within 48
hours of such request.
(2) (3) No measure may be called for a final vote by the County Board until delivery of the fiscal
note according to the provisions of this Section, except that whenever, because of the complexity
of the measure, additional time is required for the preparation of the fiscal note the Chief Financial
Officer shall provide each member of the County Board and the President of the County Board
with a statement of reasons why the fiscal note cannot be supplied in seven business days, and
request an extension of time not to exceed five additional business days within which such fiscal
note is to be furnished. Such extension shall be granted only with the consent of the majority of
the members of the County Board and shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year in which
the request was made. In no event may such extensions be used to unduly delay or hinder the
consideration of the measure by the County Board. The County Board shall authorize the drafting
of any rules of regulations which shall be subject to County Board approval, to ensure compliance
with this Section.
(3)(4) In connection with the preparation of the fiscal note, all County officials and employees
shall upon request cooperate with the Chief Fiscal Officer in providing information.

(d) Form and content.
1.

The fiscal note shall be factual in nature, as brief and concise as may be, and shall provide as
reliable an estimate, in dollars, as is possible under the circumstances. The fiscal note shall include
both the immediate effect, and if determinable or reasonably foreseeable, the long-range effect of
the measure.

2.

If, after careful investigation it is determined that no dollar estimate is possible, the fiscal note
shall contain a statement to that effect, setting forth the reasons why no such estimate can be
given. A brief summary or work sheet of computations used in arriving at the fiscal note figures
shall be included.

(e) Preparation of fiscal note.
1.

No comment or opinion shall be included in the fiscal note with regard to the merits of the
measure for which the fiscal note is prepared; however, technical or mechanical defects may be
noted.

2.

The work sheet shall include, insofar as practicable, a breakdown of the costs upon which the
fiscal note is based. Such breakdown shall include, but need not be limited to, costs of personnel,
materials and supplies, and capital outlay. The fiscal note shall also include such other information
as is required by the rules and regulations which may be promulgated by the County Board with
respect to the preparation of such fiscal notes. The fiscal impact statement shall, to the degree
possible, consist of an estimate in dollars of the anticipated change in revenue, expenditures, or
fiscal liability under the provisions of the ordinance or resolution. It shall also include a statement
as to the immediate effect and, if determinable or reasonably foreseeable, the long-range effect of
the measure. If after investigation, it is determined that no dollar estimate is possible, the fiscal
impact statement shall contain a statement to that effect, setting forth the reasons why no dollar
estimate can be given. The fiscal impact statement shall include an explanation of the basis or
reasoning on which the estimate is founded, including all assumptions involved. A copy of the
fiscal note shall be delivered to each member of the Board and the President of the County
Board, according to the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section.

heard in support of or in opposition to the measure.
