281408

A RESOLUTION REAFFIRMING ITS OFFICIAL SUPPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR OF
PRIVATE BILL HR 3856, THE FAMILY UNITY ACT (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County
Commissioner.
I am submitting the attached Resolution as a New Item at the September 7, 2006
Board meeting to be referred to the committee on Law Enforcement and Corrections
for a public hearing. The Resolution declares Cook County ”A Sanctuary County”, a
county that defends that basic human rights and dignity of undocumented immigrants
and stands in solidarity with local governments across the nation who have declared
themselves “Sanctuaries.” Furthermore, the Resolution prohibits Cook County
Departments and the Sheriff’s Office from inquiring about immigration status and
unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions, to the extent allowed by law.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook be declared “A
Sanctuary County,” a county that defends the basic human rights and dignity of
undocumented immigrants and our democratic principles of life, liberty, and justice,
and all those who, as Emma Lazarus wrote in her famous sonnet that now is engraved
on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty, are “tired…poor…[and]…yearn to breathe free…”
and recognizes that much of the historical and moral tradition of our nation is rooted in
the provision of sanctuary to those seeking a safe haven from oppression; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook supports the humanitarian
efforts of Reverend Walter Coleman, who, in good faith, has opened the doors of the
Adalberto United Methodist Church in Cook County to provide sanctuary to Elvira
Arellano and her U.S. citizen son and who are prepared to accept the penalty for this
act of civil disobedience in the hope that this violation of current immigration law will
lead to comprehensive immigration reform that respects the rights of immigrants as
families, workers, and human beings; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook stands in solidarity with local
governments across the nation who have declared themselves “Sanctuaries”
upholding the basic human rights of immigrants, including the cities of San Francisco,
Maywood, Huntington Park and Coachella in California and the City of Cambridge in
Massachusetts; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook joins several major cities,
including Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, and
others who have official policies prohibiting their municipal agencies from inquiring
about immigration status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions, and
hereby requires that no Cook County employee or department, to the extent legally
possible, will request information about or otherwise assist in the investigation of the
citizenship status of any County resident, will disseminate information regarding the

citizenship of a County resident, or condition the provision of County of Cook services
or benefits on matters related to citizenship; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that requiring, or promoting, local enforcement of
immigration laws gives rise to an increased threat of immigrant and minority profiling
and harassment and, therefore, it is the policy of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office not
to become involved in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws to the extent
legally possible; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and
the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement be called upon to issue a moratorium
on raids until the U.S. Congress comes to an agreement on comprehensive
immigration reform so that the debate can be carried out in good faith, rather than
against a backdrop of fear, repression and intimidation; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County of Cook rejects the use of the word
“illegal” to describe human beings and the use of the word “aliens” to describe
immigrants, which has a dehumanizing effect and helps justify policies that seek to
criminalize and exclude immigrants, and hereby adopts the language “undocumented”
when referring to those who do not have federally recognized resident status and
“immigrant” to refer to those who have migrated to the U.S. from another country; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
reaffirms its official support earlier this year of private bill HR 3856, the Family Unity
Act, which protects 35 Illinois families from being torn apart by our broken immigration
laws, and reaffirms its official support in 2005 of “The Secure America Act” which
allows families to be reunited more quickly through the family immigration system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be submitted to the Illinois
Congressional delegation and to President George Bush on behalf of the entire Cook
County Board.
*Referred to the Committee on Law Enforcement and Corrections on
September 7, 2006.
