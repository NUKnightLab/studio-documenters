Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) / Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
1st Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020
Mr. Mike Kubek provided background on PPR and reviewed the following projects:
•

8213c

CUY - 43-1.98 (Widening Aurora Road from Solar Shopping Center Drive to Liberty
Road) - This project involves the following roadway improvements: pavement
resurfacing, minor widening, new traffic signal at Portz Parkway, multi-use path on the
south side, bike lane westbound (5’ sidewalk) on the north side, new water line and

1-1

 storm sewer. The total cost of this project is $8.1 million. No NOACA funds will be
used. Construction is expected to begin in FY 2021.
Mr. Kubek reviewed comments made by the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Council
(BPAC).
Mr. Cross asked if the sidewalk planned for the north side will be at the right of way
line; if not, the sponsor should move the sidewalk back to make the buffer wider from
the face of the curb to the walk or path.
Mr. Joseph Beno suggested that the sponsor not reduce the eastbound travel lane as
some cyclists may still choose to use the road rather than the side path.
•

Laketran Bus Replacement – Laketran is planning to purchase a new 35-foot zero
emissions battery electric transit bus. The total cost of the new bus is $783,500.
Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant (DERG) program and Laketran funds will be used
to purchase the bus. No NOACA funds will be used.

ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan
Mr. Brian Blayney stated that the project team held the second ITS Stakeholder Workshop in the
cities of Independence, Brunswick and Mentor on May 7, 8 and 9.
Mr. Blayney mentioned that the draft ITS Architecture update and Strategic Plan can be found on
AECOM’s website. He provided an overview of topics discussed at the workshop related to the
Strategic Plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Information management
Traffic management
Public transportation
Traveler information
CVO and freight management
Maintenance and construction

•
•
•
•
•

Incident and emergency

Mr. Blayney provided an overview of the following items related to the ITS Architecture update:
•
•
•

Service package diagram
Inventory by stakeholders on the NOACA website
ITS project schedule

Mr. Blayney stated that NOACA staff and the consultant team will work with stakeholders to
incorporate their feedback into the draft ITS Strategic Plan and updated ITS Architecture. He
noted that the final versions of both documents will be completed later this summer.
TSMO Freeway Incident Arterial Management Workshop Update
Mr. Blayney stated that Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) consist of
a set of strategies to optimize performance, preserve capacity, and improve reliability.

8213c

1-2

 Mr. Blayney mentioned that a TSMO workshop was held on March 14 to further develop enhanced
TSMO business processes in Northeast Ohio. The workshop, sponsored by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), and conducted by the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), was designed to educate participants on tools and resources
for improving TSMO business processes, and engage participants in collaboratively developing
a business process for managing arterials during freeway incidents. Mr. Blayney reviewed two
scenario maps: I-90 WB in Lorain County (PM) and I-480 WB in Cuyahoga County (AM). He
mentioned that over 30 people participated in the workshop.
Mr. Blayney reviewed the recommended process (diagram), considerations, and develop/
implement the process.
Mr. Blayney mentioned that the TSMO workshop is offered free of charge to NOACA and
participants. NOACA staff will add the business process to NOACA’s web page to serve as a
reference for future TSMO planning throughout the region. He noted that staff will participate in
further planning studies and Traffic Incident Management meetings hosted by ODOT to promote
and support the integration of TSMO into businesses practices of local agencies throughout the
region.
Mr. Blayney passed around a copy of the business process and the ITS Strategic Plan and ITS
Architecture Update for SOC to review.
Mr. Cross asked how NOACA will use social media to notify people about incidents; how will
NOACA determine whether or not someone is on the road when they receive a message on their
cell phone; and has staff thought about the application to use to notify people. Mr. Blayney said
staff has thought about the app and noted that some workshop attendees said they have had
some success using Twitter.
Mr. Beno and Mr. Blayney discussed different apps to alert drivers of traffic incidents.
Mr. Ciupa asked if any studies have been done on variable message signs for incident
management. Mr. Blayney mentioned that workshop attendees discussed having a dynamic
message sign (DMS) in the short term, which can be challenging, and a permanent sign in the
long term. Mr. Ciupa said the structure needs to be permanent in order to be effective.
Mr. Blayney mentioned that the Ohio Turnpike manages signs remotely. Mr. Ciupa said with the
Turnpike, there is limited access to the signs; and he noted that it would be beneficial to have a
few more dynamic message signs.
Mr. Keith Hamilton mentioned that the ODOT Traffic Management Center provides regular
updates; unfortunately, information is not making its way to the motorists.
Mr. Ciupa said cell phones are a great way to go until there is a better solution in the future.
Mr. Cross asked what gaps were identified by NOACA staff. He mentioned that traffic reports are
announced regularly on TV and radio stations.
Mr. Hamilton stated that TV and radio stations have been identifying the locations of the incidents,
but motorists may not know the alternate routes to use.

8213c

1-3

 Mr. Cross asked if NOACA is trying to provide motorists with information so they can avoid an
area where an incident has occurred.
Mr. Blayney stated that the information part of the business process is to try and have better
control of traffic demand, prevent trips, get people to delay their trips, get people to use a different
route, and to better manage traffic on local roads.
Mr. Ciupa stated that detection equipment could be placed up the ramp to tell signals down the
line about the backup so vehicles can be managed better on the ramp. He noted that NOACA
would need to work with the communities to get the signals reprogrammed. Mr. Blayney stated
that NOACA is taking the lead in terms of the planning process, but it is more feasible for ODOT
and the city to have an agreement in place on certain conditions to have one jurisdiction to
temporarily operate signals of another jurisdiction.
Safety Funding Applications
Mr. Blayney stated that ODOT accepts safety funding applications twice a year (due dates are
April 30th and September 30th). ODOT provides up to $150 million throughout the state for projects
that address safety problems. Mr. Blayney provided an overview of the criteria that need to be
met in order to receive the funds. He mentioned that a lot of work goes into project planning and
coordination with the ODOT Districts.
SOC received information on safety funding applications for the following projects:
•

MED-18-12.99 (District 3) – This project is located on Alber Drive to Nettleton Road and
SR 18. District 3 previously secured approximately $8 million from TRAC for engineering
and right of way phases and received $5 million of Major 2 funds for construction. An
additional funding application will be made to TRAC to cover the remaining funding
needed for construction. ODOT District 3 is requesting funding for signals, multi-use path
and access management items. The safety funding request is $2,842,000.

•

CUY-43 10.61 (District 12) (Cleveland) – This project is located on Miles Avenue in the
City of Cleveland. The city will cover the local share using the general fund and other
potential future funding. This project will include a road diet and resurfacing along Miles
Avenue and the entire study corridor, adding bike lanes on both sides of Miles Avenue
from East 131st Street to Broadway Avenue, removing six (6) unwarranted traffic signals,
reconstructing six (6) warranted traffic signals, and rehabilitating four (4) traffic signals
along the corridor. The safety funding request is $4,355,000.
Mr. Jacob VanSickle stated that Miles Avenue and East 131th Street are 2 of the 15 streets
that account for 43% of the City of Cleveland’s serious and fatal crashes. Mr. VanSickle
asked if there was an opportunity to reduce 3, 12-foot lanes; 2, 12-foot travel lanes; and
1, 12-foot turning lane to reduce speed and create a buffered bike lane.
Mr. Cross said adjustments could be made during the design process. He noted that the
center turn lane could be 11 feet instead of 12 feet and the buffer could be totally driven
by the access point density. He said the bike lanes could be widened or a hybrid could
be created. He noted that if there is a long section with no access points, a left hand buffer
could be added.
Mr. VanSickle asked if the buffered bike lanes could be addressed later in detailed design.
Mr. Cross said yes.

8213c

1-4

 •

LOR-CR657 (Elyria) (District 3) - This project involves applying a road diet treatment to
the East Bridge Street and Cleveland Street and East Bridge Street corridors. The City of
Elyria intends to apply for CMAQ funding through NOACA. Additional OPWC funds may
be pursued. The safety funding request is $4,405,000 and local funds in the amount of
$1.5 million.
Mr. VanSickle stated that 4-foot bike lanes are pretty narrow. He asked if there is an
opportunity to reduce the turn lane to 9 feet, take a foot from one of the travel lanes and
add it to the bike lanes to make them 5 feet.
Mr. Cross recommended having 3, 10-foot lanes and 2, 5-foot bike lanes.

•

CUY-71-18.29 (District 12) - This project involves restricting a 3-lane weave from SB CD
Road to the SR-176 exit ramp on I-71 by adding an additional barrier wall and rumble
strips, revising the configuration of the CD Road just south of the I-90 ramp merge to 3
lanes, improving the ramp from Valentine Avenue / 14th Street to SB SR-176 to mitigate
capacity constraints to the north, and reconstruct/revise overhead guide signs on the CD
Road. This project received $6.5 million in TRAC funds in 2018. The safety funding
request is $4,375,000.
Mr. Ciupa recommended more signage and possibly pavement markings for the left lane.
SOC members talked about the benefits of a deceleration lane on I-71. Mr. Cross talked
about queuing issues of I-71.
Mr. VanSickle commented that freeway signs would be added over 14th Street South. He
noted that MetroHealth is looking to utilize the bridge to connect to the Towpath Trail. He
asked if it would be possible to make the connection from the neighborhood to the Towpath
Trail by 14th Street.
SOC members discussed possible changes that could be made to create a connection
from the neighborhood to the trail. Mr. Blayney mentioned that the project will go through
the NOACA PPR process.

•

LOR-254-7.75 (Avon) (District 3) - This project is located at the SR 254 and Nagel Road
roundabout in the City of Avon. This project involves converting a four-leg signalized
intersection into a roundabout that will improve operations and decrease delay and reduce
rear-end crashes. The safety funding request is $2,909,000.

•

LOR-83-18.04 (Avon) (District 3) – This project is located at the SR 83 and SR 254
intersection. This project involves upgrading traffic signage and signalization with
overhead signage, advanced dilemma zone detection, emergency vehicle pre-emption,
signal head backplates, new and reconstructed traffic signals at Healthway Drive, Avon
Police-Fire and Avon Commons, adding lanes on SR 254 east-westbound, SR 83
southbound, and a right turn lane on SR 83 northbound. The safety funding request is
$4,832,000.
Mr. Beno asked if the two Avon projects are a capacity improvement or a safety
improvement or both and is there any effect on the sprawl away from Cuyahoga County
to Lorain County.

8213c

1-5

 Ms. Farley stated that when there are a lot of vehicles at a location and there is congestion
there is also accidents. Roundabouts are a known safety improvement for accidents that
happen in the area. She noted that the intersections of both Avon project locations were
included on the statewide ranking.
•

MED-3-16.22 / 17.40 (District 3) – This project is located at SR 3 and IR 71. This project
involves re-striping and installing signing to maintain one through lane on SR 3 through
the interchange, extending the left turn lanes at Hamilton Road and West 130th Street,
adding an additional right turn lane at each IR 71 exit ramp at the interchange, re-phase
the southbound ramp signal to maximize southbound right-turn green time. The safety
funding request is $1 million.
Mr. Cross asked if the right turn onto Hamilton Road is incredibly heavy. Ms. Farley said
it is a large movement. Mr. Cross said he was concerned that the right hand of the two
right turn only lanes would either be underutilized or people will use it and then turn right,
gun it and make a quick lane change to the left. He suggested keeping a through right
lane. He said the left lane merges to the right west of Hamilton, which is unusual. You
could flip it to make the right lane merge to the left down stream of Hamilton Road. Mr.
Blayney mentioned that options were vetted thoroughly by District 3 staff. Ms. Farley
stated that there was some discussion about closing Hamilton and rerouting motorists to
another intersection.
Mr. Beno suggested that ODOT increase the amount of signage on the bridge.

•

CUY-322-15.59 (Gates Mills) (District 12) – This project is located at U.S. Route 322 and
SR 174. This project involves reconstructing and upgrading the traffic signal, lengthening
the median opening on U.S. Route 322 at the study intersection, converting the eastbound
and westbound left-turn phasing at the study intersection from protected/permissive to
protected-only. The safety funding request is $417,000.
Mr. Cross asked if ODOT has considered shifting the left turn lanes to the left to get a
neutral offset or a positive offset and to eliminate the need to use protected only signal
phasing. Mr. Hamilton said it could be considered.
Mr. Blayney mentioned that the left turn was discussed at the District Safety Review Team
meeting and the District felt full left turn lanes would be safer.
Mr. Cross asked if the speed limit in the area is 50 miles per hour (mph). Mr. Blayney said
the speed limit is 45 mph.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Safety and Operations Council

FROM:

Kathleen Sarli, Director of Planning

DATE:

August 9, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation
(IGRC); 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed projects to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

 RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program
Sponsor: RTA
Estimated Total Cost: $54,519,373
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
History/Background: RTA reports that its original state fiscal year (SFY) 2020 grant program is
listed in the NOACA SFY 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program and the majority of
the program is as originally proposed in the TIP. RTA is adding four new projects to its FFY 2020
program and the TIP. RTA is also seeking to revise and amend five existing grants to address
under-runs, over-runs, and revised priorities in its capital program impacting eleven TIP projects.
RTA’s revisions to the FFY 2019 and 2017 Capital Formula and FFY 2016 State of Good Repair
grant programs reflect these revisions.
Proposed Project: RTA is applying for various sources of funds including Section 5307 Capital

projected under-runs, over-runs and revised priorities in its Capital Program as described below:
•

2019 Section 5307 Capital Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and amended to
account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Bus Preventive Maintenance and
NOACA Unserved Area funding, shift Bus Vehicle Type funding, fund the West 117th Street
Track Bridge and its Rail Car Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5337 State of Good Repair Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for decreased funding as well as to decrease Rail Preventive
Maintenance and West 117th Street Track Bridge funding and fund the Rail Car
Replacement Program.

•

2019 Section 5339 Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Grant – The grant is being revised and
amended to account for increased funding and to increase the funding for Bus

RE:

SAVE: NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA has recently completed SAVE Plan; NOACA’s Plan for Transportation Safety. The purpose of the
SAVE Plan is to save lives in the NOACA region by identifying actions to reduce the most severe crashes
that too often result in fatalities and serious injuries. The SAVE Plan was developed with the vision that traffic
deaths and injuries can be prevented with appropriate planning, policies and programs, with a long-term goal
of reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries by 50% by the year 2040. The SAVE Plan provides
direction that will enable NOACA and others to work together to set goals and work toward the vision this
Plan establishes for the region.
Achieving a safer transportation network requires addressing the interaction among the infrastructure,
vehicles and the skill and behavior of travelers. The SAVE Plan incorporates a “6 E’s” approach into the safety
planning process, acknowledging the key roles that engineering, education, enforcement, emergency
response, evaluation, and equity all play in preventing severe crashes and saving lives. After evaluating 10
years of crash data to identify trends, ten emphasis areas associated with fatal and serious injury crashes
were identified.

RE:

2017 NOACA Safety Priority Lists

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
One of the important elements of each year’s Regional Safety Program is the identification of regional
safety priority lists. NOACA safety priority locations were developed by evaluating historical crash
performance at intersections and along roadway corridors. The safety priority lists consider the total
number of all crashes and the combined number of just fatalities and serious injuries (FSI’s) that have
occurred at intersections or along one-mile defined-length corridors that make up the region’s non-freeway
road network.
Emphasis is placed on prioritizing safety at locations that experience fatalities and serious injuries, in order
to align NOACA’s priorities with the safety performance measures established under the current federal
transportation funding bill (the FAST Act), which requires states to measure progress in reducing the
numbers of fatalities and serious injuries.
Priority lists were developed in five specific areas on review of crashes occurring during the five-year period
from 2013 to 2017:
1. Intersection FSI (based on a minimum of 4 or more FSI crashes)
2. Intersection Frequency (based on all intersection-related crashes)
3. Corridor FSI (based on a minimum of 5 or more FSI crashes over a one-mile defined length)
4. Corridor Frequency (based on all non-intersection related crashes over a one-mile defined length)
5. Pedestrian and Bicycle Corridors (based on a minimum of 3 or more FSI crashes over a one-mile
defined length)

5 - 19

 The locations identified on these safety priority lists can be view in a map-based format from the GIS Portal
on NOACA’s website and by selecting the “Safety” layer. The full list is available in PDF format on
NOACA’s website at this link.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to prepare regional safety priority lists on an annual basis to identify intersections and road
segments that exhibit a high need for improvement due to the frequency and severity of crashes within the
NOACA region.

RE:

Evaluation of 2018 Safety Performance Targets

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
Safety Performance Management (Safety PM) is part of the overall Transportation Performance
Management (TPM) program, which FHWA defines as a strategic approach that uses system information to
make investment and policy decision to achieve national performance goals. It establishes safety
performance measure requirements for the purpose of carrying out the State’s Highway Safety
Improvement Plan (HSIP) and to assess fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.
The federal Safety PM Final Rule established five performance measures as the five-year rolling averages
to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of Fatalities
Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Number of Serious Injuries
Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

The Safety PM Final Rule also establishes the process for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to establish and report their safety targets.
State DOT’s are required to adopted targets annually. MPOs are required to establish targets within of 180
days and shall represent the anticipated outcomes for the same calendar year as the State DOT target (23
U.S.C. 134(h)(2)). MPO targets can be established through one of two options:
1. Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State
DOT safety target for a safety performance measure, or
2. Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance measure for the metropolitan planning area.
5 - 21

 NOACA adopted ODOT’s calendar year 2018 target of a 1% reduction for each of the five performance
measures consistent with the first option above. For calendar year 2018, NOACA’s 1-year performance in
each of the 5 performance measures is presented in the table below. It can be seen that fatalities, serious
injuries, and non-motorized fatalities all declined versus the previous three years, reversing the prior trend
of increasing FSI’s since 2014.

NOT MET

Within the NOACA region, frequency targets for Fatalities and Non-Motorized FSI’s were not met, in spite of
significant reductions in fatalities and serious injuries in 2018. This is because the targets are established
and reported using 5-year rolling averages, not annual crash frequencies, and the frequencies included in
the rolling averages for 2018 were greater than the ones replaced from 2013.
The performance measures related to rates of fatalities and serious injuries could not be evaluated yet
because the combined calculated VMT’s for all roads by county for 2018 are not available.
At the June 18, 2019 Strategic Highway Safety Steering Committee meeting, ODOT staff stated that the
Department was considering raising the state’s targets for the five safety performance measures from a 1%
reduction to a 2% reduction. ODOT informed the steering committee it believed a more aggressive goal
was needed to galvanize action, and because additional resources supporting safety initiatives were
available with the passage of the gas tax increase. In anticipation of this change for state CY2020 safety
target setting, NOACA staff recommends resetting NOACA’s targets to a 2% reduction for all five areas.

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will track safety performance measures in support of state targets and report on performance to keep
NOACA’s safety stakeholders informed of the region’s progress toward state goals.

RE:

Corridor Recommendations for the STOP Program

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and input from Council members.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Since fiscal year 2017, NOACA has administered a consultant contract to provide technical assistance to
Northeast Ohio agencies to improve traffic signal operation on congested roadways. Since then, four
corridors have been improved by retiming a total of 96 traffic signals in 12 different communities. The
benefits of these projects over a five-year period are estimated as follows:
• Reduction of 12,630 metric tons of carbon dioxide
• Reduction of 1,637,000 hours of delay
• Reduction of 1,416,000 gallons of fuel
• Provided an average benefit-to-cost ratio of 28:1
Currently, NOACA’s consultant is in the process of studying Chester Avenue between East 13th Street and
Euclid Avenue, then along Euclid Avenue eastward to East 123rd Street, including a large number of
adjacent intersections.
For the fiscal year 2020 Signal Timing and Optimization Program (STOP), the selection process has added
vehicle probe data (collected by INRIX) in the screening, as well as all criteria used in previous corridor
selections. Potential corridors for STOP consideration in fiscal year 2020 were identified using the following
methodology:
Potential Project Corridors Selection Filter:
1. All non-freeway routes within NOACA region screened for “bottlenecks” in calendar 2018 as
identified by INRIX, with the initial screening of the worst 100 locations further refined as follows:
a. Eliminated locations with less than 100 occurrences
b. Eliminated locations with excessive delays caused by known construction
5 - 25

 c. Eliminated locations impacted by incidents
d. Excluded unsignalized bottleneck locations
2. Corridors were developed by starting with bottleneck locations identified above, then including
adjacent road segments considering segment volume-to-capacity ratios and common sense
3. Define corridors based on:
a. Length (minimum length of one mile)
b. ADT (highest ADT within corridor at least 15,000 vehicles per day)
c. Number of signals (minimum of 7 and maximum of 25 per corridor)
d. Traffic signals per mile (minimum of 4 signals per mile)
Operational Ranking Criteria
• Average Daily Traffic (maximum within corridor)
• Volume-Capacity Ratio (maximum within corridor)
• Crash density per mile (based on all crashes over length of corridor)
Other Selection Considerations
• Average Daily Truck Traffic
• Potential for travel time improvement
o Period since signals were last re-timed
o Ability to coordinate existing equipment within corridor
o Current or future construction projects expected to improve signal operation
• Presence of transit facilities
• Corridor spanning multiple jurisdictions
• Arterial is alternative route for incident management
Based on these considerations, the top corridors are:

The draft FY 2020 corridor(s) have been selected based on the operational criteria, emissions reductions,
and Air Quality Subcommittee input in June. The draft corridors recommended for improvement on the next
STOP contract are Bagley Road and Ridge Road.
5 - 26

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the STOP program is provided from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ)
program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA will reach out to jurisdictions identified by the screening process to confirm interest and willingness
to participate in the STOP Program. An RFP will be developed to be advertised in September-October to
allow work to begin on the next corridors in the spring.

RE:

ITS Architecture Comprehensive Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
In fiscal year 2018, NOACA entered into an 18-month contract with AECOM to perform a comprehensive
update of the regional Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) architecture and its strategic plan. NOACA
last updated the regional ITS architecture in 2010. The purpose of the ITS architecture is to support
interoperability among ITS systems and jurisdictions, and to ensure that ITS elements of projects proposed
in the region are eligible for federal funding. In conjunction with the update of the regional architecture,
NOACA is also updating the region’s ITS strategic plan. The strategic plan identifies needs for ITS-related
infrastructure improvements and establishes the time frames for their implementation.
In September 2018, two surveys were distributed to over 150 stakeholders throughout the NOACA region
regarding ITS. The first survey focused on gathering input on participants’ transportation needs and
challenges; and the second survey focused on understanding each agency’s capabilities and plans for future
ITS deployments. In addition, stakeholder workshops were also held to provide local agencies with a better
understanding of ITS, and for the project team to learn more about local needs and capabilities.
Based on this input, the project team performed an analysis of stakeholder needs and, based on stakeholders’
current ITS capabilities, identified gaps and opportunities to further regional ITS deployment to address those
needs. The findings of the analysis were documented in a series of technical memos that served as working
drafts of the ITS architecture report and strategic plan, which were shared with stakeholders for review and
comment in February, March and April.

5 - 29

 A second series of stakeholder workshops was held in May 2019 at locations in Independence, Brunswick,
and Mentor. At these meetings, the project team met with participants to review the components of the ITS
architecture, to confirm that identified needs are accurately captured and addressed, to verify that planned
and potential future improvements are included in the ITS strategic plan, and to review how to use the
architecture in project planning.
The project team developed the following items for use in regional intelligent transportation systems
planning, with hyperlinks to the current versions on the AECOM’s ITS project website:
1. 2019 NOACA ITS Architecture Report: This document supports the integration of regional ITS
systems to allow planning and deployment to occur in an organized and coordinated process.
2. NOACA ITS Architecture Website: This website provides information for intelligent transportation
project systems engineering following USDOT’s Architecture Reference for Cooperative and
Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) framework.
3. User’s Guide for ITS Architecture Website: This brief two-page document serves as a layperson’s
guide to using the architecture website for ITS planning and reference.
4. Northeast Ohio ITS Strategic Plan: This document establishes the region’s vision for ITS
implementation, identifies regional ITS gaps and needs, and presents feasible ITS projects to
consider for short, medium, and long-term implementation.
A final project coordination meeting is scheduled for August 28 at 10 am at NOACA to present the final
results of the project to the NOACA ITS Steering Committee. At this meeting, DriveOhio will also present
information on ODOT’s planning for connected and autonomous vehicles, as part of ODOT’s effort to
develop a statewide ITS architecture for reference and use throughout the state as technology continues to
mature and potential applications for connected and autonomous vehicles near deployment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the ITS Architecture Update and Strategic Plan is provided in the 2019 and 2020 Overall Work
Programs.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will work with stakeholders and the consultant team to implement the ITS Architecture Update and
Strategic Plan.

RE:

ODOT/OSHP Safety Calendar

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The Ohio Traffic Safety Office (OTSO) and ODOT work together to develop a rolling calendar of safety
campaign messaging to raise public awareness on specific emphasis areas and initiatives promoted by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Typically these campaigns involve messaging
pushed out via social media and press releases, supported with messaging by ODOT on freeway message
boards, and often coupled with increased enforcement. The full OTSO safety calendar may be viewed on
their website at this link.
NOACA supports the outreach efforts of these agencies by reinforcing messages issued through its Office of
External Relations.
Upcoming events prior to next Safety and Operations Council meetings are as follows:
• August: Back to School Safety Month
• August 14–September 2: Impaired Driving
• September 15-21: Child Passenger Safety Week
• September/October Varies: Homecoming Blitzes
• October 2: Walk to School Day
• October 20-26: National Teen Driver Safety Week (Occupant Protection)
• October 25-31 (Halloween): Impaired Driving
• November 28 (Thanksgiving): Occupant Protection
• November 30 (OSU-Michigan football game): Impaired Driving
Continuing support of education and outreach programs is necessary to make and continue positive changes
in behavior of the traveling public. At the national level, significant reductions have been made in reducing
the rate of fatalities for unbelted motorists (reduced from 54% to 48% between 2007 to 2016) and alcohol5 - 31

 impaired driving fatalities (reduced from 32% to 28% between 2007 to 2016); however, both emphasis areas
still comprise a large fraction of all crash fatalities. (Source: Terry Shelton, Associate Administrator, National
Center for Statistics and Analysis, “2016 Fatal Crash Overview” presented on December 14, 2017.)
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Agencies within the NOACA region are encouraged to assist the Ohio Traffic Safety Office with maximizing
impact of statewide message campaigns by cross-promoting these messages at the community level.
