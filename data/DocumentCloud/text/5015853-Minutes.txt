4. Items for Discussion

Dave Price discussed the vacant lot clean up proposals and estimates he received
regarding the two worst lots. Dave Price informed that the estimates are to clear and
clean up the lots in order to plant grass or flower gardens. Dave Price shared that
renting the City owned lots is a way to beautify those lots and seems easier than
trying to find owners of privately owned lots (to gain approval to transform). A motion
to accept the estimate from Delandis Ducan to clear and clean up the two lots was
made by Alex J. Alemis, seconded by Robert Loncar. It was suggested that Dave
Price make certain the company clearing the lots has insurance and workman?s
compensation coverage.

Chicago stated the funding will be up to $15,000.00 max per project (75% of
