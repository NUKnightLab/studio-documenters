Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the request presented
for the Board’s consideration. The Board reviewed and discussed the request.
Douglas Elwell, Deputy CEO of Finance and Strategy, provided additional information. A recent Request for
Proposals (RFP) yielded only one response, despite the fact that staff reached out to a number of vendors when it
was posted. Staff are evaluating the RFP results; they are also looking to see if the System has the flexibility to
bring the services in-house.
In response to a question regarding the reason why there was only one vendor who responded to the RFP, Mr.
Elwell stated that the RFP was considered to be a bit complicated. The System has always done a number of
things both internally and externally in terms of taking applications - a group of employees who took care of
CareLink applications; a vendor who primarily was responsible for Medicaid applications; and a call center and
vendor who were responsible for CountyCare applications. The administration tried to take the two pieces that
were outsourced and bring them together. There are several possible reasons why other vendors did not respond to
the RFP. Some vendors may have assumed that the incumbent had a lock on the contract; some may not have
bothered because they thought that the System was going to bring the services in-house.

Action Items
A.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
The Board discussed the subject in relation to quality and financial performance. Mr. Elwell stated that he
believes that if the services were performed in-house, the cost will come down significantly; he also believes they
can meet the quality standards. There are a few issues that will need to be resolved with the labor partners
regarding work rules associated with this; a meeting is scheduled to discuss these with the labor partners in the
upcoming week. The discussion is going to be a fair discussion – if they can help the System to resolve the issues
around the work rules that will allow the System to do this, the administration believes that it can bring this inhouse. If they cannot do that, then the System will have to go in the direction of the RFP.
Director Lerner stated that there cannot be anything more important than how well the System performs on the call
center. Whether those services are performed in-house or by an outside vendor, he indicated that he was much
more concerned about the performance and hitting the targets that are set. Chairman Hammock encouraged the
administration to make a quick decision; if the decision is to go the RFP route, the administration should be able to
go to those vendors who they think are capable of meeting or exceeding the quality needed, and let them know that
the services are not being brought in-house - they have a chance to be selected but if they do not bid, they will not
be selected. He noted that, at some point in the future, he would like to go over in some detail the efforts to follow
that pattern, to review the administration’s efforts to get the best cost price response on this.
Mr. Elwell stated that, if the administration comes to the conclusion with its labor partners that these services can
be performed in-house, and they can put together a plan that will ensure that the System will have the level of
quality needed and will be able to handle this, the decision will be made to bring the services in-house. Following
the meeting with the labor partners, if the administration determines that the labor partners are not comfortable
giving the level of flexibility in the work rules necessary to be successful at this, then an RFP will be posted with
plenty of time for response. The administration hopes to make that decision in December; if an RFP needs to be
posted, it will be posted in January.
In response to a question from Director Velasquez regarding how long it would take to implement if the decision is
to provide those services in-house, Mr. Elwell stated that he expected it to take four (4) months to implement; this
is the reason why this contract extension is timed to expire on April 30th.
Director Collens commented regarding the aspects of performance management when receiving services
contractually; if the System was not satisfied with individual performance metrics, it could ask the contractor to
get someone else who can meet the targets set in the contract. He asked whether the System would have the same
flexibility if the services were provided in-house, or whether it would be much more complicated, in terms of
performance metrics and replacing people whose performance did not meet the targets. Mr. Elwell responded that,
theoretically, the System has a policy for progressive discipline today; if the System has an employee that is not
performing, and the System re-trains and makes those efforts but the employee does not improve to the level
required, the System has the ability to remove that person. With regard to the changes to the work rules that are
needed, he noted that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) normally requires the ability to
listen into a call for quality assurance. It has been the position of the labor partners that that is inappropriate – that
issue is one of the matters to discuss with the labor partners. If their answer is no, the administration will be
outsourcing it, because it has no other choice.
Director Lerner stated that if these services are brought in-house, the System has the potential to meet or exceed
the performance levels and reduce expenses. He stated that he would appreciate receiving information on the
outcome of the meeting with the labor partners and the action plan going forward1. He would be interested in
learning what the labor partners have to say; if for some reason they choose not to want to allow the System to
have the oversight that other places normally have for call centers, he would like to understand the reason for that.

Action Items
A.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of request number 1 under
the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Proposed Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the CCHHS Board of Directors
(Attachment #2)
Chairman Hammock stated that, with the dramatic transformation that the System is undergoing around
CountyCare and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), its managed care program has become a
dominant force for the Board in its deliberations. The best way to manage that is to establish another Standing
Committee that would have the responsibility of focusing on the managed care services programs related to it. To
that end, he recommended an Amendment to the operating Rules of Organization and Procedure to establish that
additional Standing Committee, effective immediately. He noted that it is not intended to be duplicative of other
responsibilities held by other Standing Committees.
During the review of the proposed Amendment, Director Collens noted that an outdated title was included in the
Rules within the description for the Finance Committee. Elizabeth Reidy, General Counsel, stated that staff will
review the Rules for any other changes that are needed in addition to the one mentioned by Director Collens, and
will prepare the appropriate amendments for consideration by the Board at its January meeting2.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved the approval of the proposed
Amendments to the Rules of Organization and Procedure of the CCHHS Board of Directors.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
C. Proposed reappointment of Julio Rodriguez to the CORE Foundation, submitted by Cook County Board
President Toni Preckwinkle for approval by the CCHHS Board of Directors (Attachment #3)

UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Hammock stated that effective December 1st, new Committee assignments are in place. In addition to
appointing the membership of the Standing Committees, he appointed the following Directors as Chairs of the Standing
Committees: Director Velasquez - Audit and Compliance Committee; Director Collens – Finance Committee; Director
Wiese - Human Resources Committee; Director Lerner - Managed Care Committee; and Director Gugenheim - Quality
and Patient Safety Committee. He stated that each Director will serve on one or two of the Committees; in addition,
Directors are always welcome to attend any Committee Meeting. As the Board moves into the new year, he asked the
Committee Chairs to have more robust discussions like the Board had earlier in the meeting on the contractual matter.
The Board will look to the Chairs to guide it and be the experts on the topics for which their Committee is responsible,
and to bring to the Board those issues it should discuss as a whole and lead it in robust discussions so the Board can
work effectively as a team.

VI.

Report from Chairman of the Board (continued)
Chairman Hammock stated that, beginning with the January Board Meeting, the Board will begin to see a set of metrics
from each of its Standing Committees on the appropriate areas of the System. He noted that may take several months to
get them perfected; he asked the Chairs of each of the Standing Committees to look at the metrics under their
responsibility and determine which ones the Board should be seeing.
Chairman Hammock stated that he is changing the start time of the Board Meeting from 8:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M.; he
expects that the meetings will last two to three hours.
Chairman Hammock stated that, after consulting with Dr. Shannon, he has selected Mr. Elwell to be the System’s
representative on Governor-Elect Bruce Rauner’s transition team committee relating to health care. Mr. Elwell’s
extensive experience in seeing and understanding what other states are doing, as well as Illinois, makes him an excellent
representative for the System in this capacity.
Chairman Hammock extended his thanks to all of the Directors, staff and others who attended the recent Cook County
Health Foundation dinner, where Commissioner Butler and the family of Ruth Rothstein were honored for their long
and important contributions to the System. He stated that it was a great evening with a large turnout; this was the first
event like this for the Foundation, and was a terrific first effort.

VII. Report from Chief Executive Officer (Attachment #4)
Dr. Shannon provided an update on several subjects; detail is included in Attachment #4. The Board reviewed and
discussed the information.
Dr. Shannon recalled that there were a number of bargains that went into the ACA, including future date reductions for
disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding. He believes that, particularly with the rising issue of relative
underinsurance that will happen because of high deductible plans, there is a very strong case for maintaining DSH
funding. He added that, at Cook County, and at most urban centers, they are still finding very significant numbers of
individuals who are not touched by the ACA expansion. Following the discussion, Dr. Shannon recommended that a
more detailed discussion about the subject and background of DSH payments take place in the near future, at either the
level of the Board or at the Finance Committee.
Mr. Elwell announced that Donna Hart has been selected to be the new Chief Information Officer for the System. He
provided information on her background and accomplishments; the Board congratulated her and welcomed her to the
new role. Dr. Shannon stated that in the context of taking on this role, she has agreed for some important reasons to
take on the responsibilities of telecommunications and biomedicine under the fold of Information Technology (IT).
Director Lerner requested that the Board receive an update/status report in the near future from Ms. Hart on her
assessment of IT, to educate the Board3.

contribute to the community in which she lives. Dr. Deamant has been a force at for many years building
a nationally recognized palliative care program that has nurtured patients and staff through end-of?life care. Last
year, Dr. Deamant received the Hastings Center Cuniff-Dixon Physician Award for her outstanding work.

. Congratulations to the Pediatrics, Neonatology, Obstetrics and Gynecology and Perinatal Network teams at
Stroger led by Drs. David Soglin and Alok Rastogi and Omar LaBlanc on achieving re?designation both as a Level
NICU and as an Administrative Perinatal Network hospital from the Illinois Department of Public Health.

. The American Burn Association has verified the Stroger Burn Unit as a certified burn unit in the state of Illinois.
This three year certification is indicative of the excellence in burn care provided at Stroger. Congratulations to
Drs. Stathis Poulakidas, Faran Bokhari, and nurse leaders June Gerdes and Rhada Nair. The Burn unit sees
approximately 300-350 burn and wound care patients annually. We perform more than 120 major operations

outpatients and more than 2,000 inpatients getting the vaccine through 

As of December nearly 90% of employees were in compliance with the Flu policy. Disciplinary
actions have been initiated for non-compliant employees. Special thanks to the teams in Employee Health

units will provide state-of?the-art radiation services to cancer patients and will service the entire system. A
ribbon cutting will be scheduled after the holidays.

Client Enrollment Services

0 Call Center abandonment rates and wait times have grown in the last few weeks, which has resulted in HFS
pushing back the mailing schedule for the remaining mandatory managed care regions of Illinois, including Cook
County.

0 HFS had been issuing 50,000 letters per week. They have adjusted that number down to 35,000 per week. As a

result, the final mailing will not be sent out until the end of February 2015. The original target date was
December 2014.

Navigators

HFS plans to issue guidance around how Navigators, ln-Person Counselors, and Certified Application Counselors
may (and may not) assist with the Medicaid plan choice process. These are all entities that are registered and
receive some training from Get Covered Illinois. HFS will also clarify how providers may or may not be involved in
this process, especially when they may serve as both a Medicaid provider and an enrollment assister.

Federal

The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, recently withdrew a proposed rule that would have established comprehensive 340B Drug Pricing Program
regulations for participating covered entities and manufacturers. It is expected HRSA will re-issue the proposed rule in
the near future that will also address, among other things, patients to be served and dispute resolution guidelines.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently issued a
Final Rule pertaining to Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH). The rule addresses the hospital-specific
limitation on Medicaid (DSH) payments under the Social Security Act. The Rule is effective December 31, 2014.

Under this limitation, DSH payments to a hospital cannot exceed the uncompensated costs of furnishing hospital
services by the hospital to individuals who are Medicaid-eligible or "have no health insurance (or other source of third
party coverage) for the services furnished during the year.? This rule provides that, in auditing DSH payments, the
calculation of uncompensated care for purposes of the hospital specific DSH limit will include the cost of each service
furnished to an individual by that hospital for which the individual had no health insurance or other source of third party
coverage.
