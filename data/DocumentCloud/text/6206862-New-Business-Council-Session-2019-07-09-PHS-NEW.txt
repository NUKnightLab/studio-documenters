Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590* (707)563-9232

Proposal for Recycling, Clean Up, and Waste Removal Services
Event: Cannabis Cup Vegas

Dates: Sept 9-10

Location: Russell Industrial Center, Detroit, MI

Date Submitted: July 26, 2017
Attn: Sameen Ahmad

Company; Overview and History

Clean Vibes is a company formed and dedicated to the responsible on-site waste management of
outdoor festivals and events. Our mission is to actively encourage and promote composting, recycling
and proper waste disposal. We hope to educate and inspire a new generation of responsible stewards.
We have a documented record of diverting high levels of festival generated waste from landfills by
increasing the amount of material that is recycled and composted, thereby greatly reducing the
ecological footprint of outdoor festivals and events. With over a fifteen years of experience, Clean Vibes
has a consistent track record of providing results.

Clean Vibes, LLC is a company based in North Carolina with a branch in Vallejo, CA. We are now in our
fifteenth year as an independently owned corporation. The company is fully insured and carries a
general liability policy, a commercial auto policy and a workers compensation policy for the state of

California.

Value to Cannabis Cup

First and foremost, Clean Vibes is committed to providing festivals with a comprehensive waste
management system. Our goal is to ensure that all facets of the event?s waste collection and cleanup
are effectively managed so that event production staff do not have to worry about this component of
the event. We bring with us the experience of having successfully handled the waste management at
over 250 previous events, ranging in size from less than 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees.
Clean Vibes knows how to clean a site in a cost efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly manner.
We also understand how important the maintenance and cleanup of an event is to its continued
success, as well as to the relationship the event has with the local community.

At the core of the mission and work of Clean Vibes is a genuine dedication to providing substantial and
measurable results when it comes to diverting waste from the landfill. Our focus is not on merely
creating an appearance or image of a ?green? festival. Our focus is on ensuring that there is real
substance behind the waste diversion efforts of every event we work. All Clean Vibes employees are
equally passionate about minimizing the waste footprint of the events that we work, while at the same
time educating attendees about responsible waste habits.

 

Clean Vibes, LLC PO Box 3265 Vallejo, CA 94590? (707)563-9232

Based on our previous work at music festivals, Clean Vibes has developed a high level of positive name
recognition and respect among the attendees of these events. The attendees associate Clean Vibes with
a commitment to environmentally responsible waste management, and a commitment to
environmental stewardship. They know that having Clean Vibes involved in an event means that the
waste will be handled in an environmentally responsible manner.

Another value that Clean Vibes brings to a festival is the 'vibe.? Attendees appreciate seeing our crew
having fun while working hard. The 'vibe? that our crew brings to an event helps to actively engage the
attendees in the clean up process significantly minimizing the grounds cleanup. in addition, the
systems that we put in place at each event help to spread awareness about diversion efforts in general,
while also increasing the efforts of attendees to take responsibility for their own waste.

In summary, Clean Vibes will make valuable contributions to the Cannabis Cup in each of the following
ways:

I Extensive experience with music food/drink festivals handled waste management at over 250
events, ranging in size from 1,000 attendees to over 100,000 attendees

Dedication and documented success in achieving high levels of waste diversion

0 Commitment to educating attendees about responsible waste management
0 Positive name recognition and respect within the festival community
0 The 'vibe' we bring to an event

0 Ensuring the event is recognized as an event that is committed to minimizing its ecological
footprint

Progosed Scoge of Work
Set Up and Implementation of Waste Management Collection System

Clean Vibes proposes to implement a comprehensive waste management plan for the festival site.
Attendee participation in the maintenance and clean up ofthe event grounds will be a top priority for
our crew and work plan.

Clean Vibes will set up and strategically place up to 300 recycling and trash collection containers in
groups as necessary. All collection stations will be clearly marked with signage as to the appropriate
receptacle for each type of material (recycling or landfill). We will routinely patrol the festival site and
empty containers as necessary, as well as cleanup trouble spots. Clean Vibes will thoroughly clean the
site of the previous day's waste in time for the opening of the venue on Sunday. After the event, Clean
Vibes will thoroughly clean the site in as timely a manner as possible. Staff members will hand pick the
site, bag loose litter, and collect all bags of waste for proper disposal.

Cost for Clean Vibes? Services

Below is a breakdown of costs for Clean Vibes? services for the Cannabis Cup Detroit in 2017. It is our
hope that, when the various bids for this event are evaluated, more than just the bottom line cost of
services will be taken into consideration. We hope that the substance and quality of each bidder?s
waste diversion efforts will be seen as a source of added value and that the various bidders? track
records on this source of value will also be taken into account. There are certainly other companies that
are able to setup the appropriate collection containers and clean the festival site. However, Clean Vibes
is the only company that has the skills and experience to achieve high levels of waste diversion through
recycling. We have a proven track record of achieving unparalleled diversion rates and the ability to
provide clients with documented results. If High Times is committed to taking its sustainability efforts
to the next level by diverting a substantial amount of festival waste from the landfill while ensuring a
thorough and timely cleanup of the site, choosing to work with Clean Vibes will prove to be a
investment.

Neighbors of the Foxtown area:

As the District Detroit continues to grow and the city is beginning to bustle with summer
festivities. We all appreciate the energy these events bring to our community, as well as
the positive economic impact for local businesses. Olympia Entertainment understands
that events in the Foxtown area, affect our neighbors with additional traffic and heavier

than normal crowds, and we thank you for your patience.

On Tuesday, July 30 and Wednesday, July 31, CNN will be hosting the DNC and the
Democratic Debates here at the Fox Theater. The parking lots directly across
Woodward from the Fox, will also be home to the CNN broadcast stage for the days
leading up to and during the event. Hockeytown Cafe will also host post event, media
coverage.

To accommodate the event, the right lane of the eastbound l-75 service drive will be
closed, between Park and Woodward to stage media trucks. On the day of the debates
(7/30 7/31), Montcalm will be closed completely, between Park and Woodward from
12:00 noon until 12:00 midnight.

As safety is a top priority, the roads will be opened to emergency vehicles if necessary.
All roads will reopen at the conclusion of the event.

Please plan accordingly for these traffic disruptions, as well as, the other activities
outside the theater. If you have questions, you may contact District Command Center
24 hours a day at (313) 471-6490. We truly appreciate your patience during the

Debates.

PARTNERSHIP

 

June 3, 2019

The Honorable City Council

Office of the City Clerk

2 Woodward Ave. Suite 200

Detroit, MI 48226

Dear Council President Jones,

The Downtown Detroit Partnership (DDP) is eager to update you on an exciting project that

We believe will greatly enhance the experience of those who work, live and visit the City of
Detroit. Working with vendor, IKE Smart City, DDP is able to bring IKE interactive
digital kiosks to Downtown and the neighborhoods. IKE kiosks are a cutting edge two-way

communication platform that provides free access to information, such as: transit options,

supportive services, business locations, directions, events and more.

These 8-foot tall, digital IKE kiosks:

Provide free, high-speed, public WiFi access, helping to connect those that don't
otherwise have access.

Communicate with local transit systems to tell you when the next bus or train will arrive
or how many bikes are available at the nearest MoGo station.

Improve public safety and have the capability to connect to the DPD Greeniight
network, instantaneously broadcast emergency alerts, and offer pUSh-b?utton 911
connections.

Give instant walking or driving directions, with the ability to send those directions to
your phone for navigation.

Include applications for real-time public polling, community announcements, job
boards, homeless shelters, and more.

Offer dozens of languages and are ADA compliant for the disabled.

Tap into the internet to provide up-to-date business listings and timely local event
information.

In addition to the benefits described above, the IKE project promotes the opportunity to
partner with other civic organizations and coordinate impact. DDP has participated in many
positive conversations with community partners and has received support from the Detroit
Police Department, local community development groups and business leaders.

Among the following documents are:

0 An IKE permit application for a location near the Downtown YMCA at John and
Broadway (This application is indicative of how permits applications for the other
locations will be developed, along with any additional documentation the Public Works
Department requires).

. A map of areas that we are considering for installation. In addition to' the Greater
Downtown, we are exploring the potential to align with Strategic Fund
Neighborhoods.

We appreciate Council's consideration of this request and we look forward to answering any

mix of both interactive and commercial content.

 

PASSIVE MODE

pedestrian has not engaged with IKE's interactive
features. The entire screen is occupied by a

9:16 [portrait] layOut showing an ad loop of ciiy.

inteiactive user experience IS launched. In
Engaged Mode. the application dashboard
displays on the bottom two-thirds of the
screen, and the ad loop is :esizeo? to a 16:9
landscape iayout as the {op ofihe screen.
