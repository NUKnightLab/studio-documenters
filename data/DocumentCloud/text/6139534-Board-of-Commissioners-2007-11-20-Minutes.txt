Tax imposed.

(a)
Except as provided in Section 74-273, every user of tangible personal property which is
purchased at retail on or after December l, 1995, from a retailer and which is titled or registered at a
location within the corporate limits of the County with an agency of the State government, shall be liable
for a tax on the privilege of using such property in the County at the rate of ti:i.ree qt:larter one percent
(I%) of such property's selling price (as the term "selling price" is defined by 35 ILCS l 05/2 (use
defined). The tax imposed by this article and the obligation to pay the same is upon the user. The tax
imposed by this article shall be collected from the purchaser by the tax collector as defined by Section 74271, and remitted to the Department as provided in this article. The tax collector shall be liable to the
County for the amount of tax that it is required to collect. Retailers shall collect the tax from the users by
adding the tax to the selling price of tangible personal property when sold for use in the County, in the
manner prescribed by this article and the Department. The tax imposed by this article shall, when
collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the selling price of tangible personal
property. The tax hereby imposed and not paid to a retailer pursuant to this section shall be paid to the
Department directly by any person using such property within the County pursuant to Section 74-277. If
any retailer, in collecting the amount which purports to constitute use taxes measured by receipts from
sales which are subject to tax under this article, collects more from the purchaser than the actual use tax
liability on the transaction, the purchaser shall have a legal right to claim a refund of such amount from
such retailer. However, if such amount is not refunded to the purchaser for any reason, the retailer is
liable to pay such amount to the Department.
Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County and making sales of tangible
(b)
personal property for use in the County shall, when collecting the tax as provided in Section 74-272 from
the purchaser, give to the purchaser a receipt for such tax in the manner and form prescribed by the
Department. Such receipt shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to
which such receipt may refer.
(Ord. No. 92-0-2 8, § 3, 5-4-1992; Ord. No. 92-0-46, § 1, 9-1-1992; Ord. No. 92-0-53, art. Ill, § I (3), 1116-1992; Ord. No. 94-0-44, § 1, 11-30-1994.)

(b)
The Department may require an applicant for registration to furnish, within 30 days after
commencing to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, a bond from a surety
company authorized to do business in the State, or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or
certificate of deposit, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the County all moneys becoming due
under this article. The Department shall fix the amount of any such security in each case, taking into
consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The
amount of any security required by the Department shall be as such as, in the Department's opinion, will
protect the County against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this
article. The amount of any security required by the Department shall not exceed three times the amount of
the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remittance liability or $50,000.00, whichever amount is
lower. A retailer that fail s to furnish security required by the Department in accordance with this section
shall not be permitted to register as a tax collector.
(c)
A tax collector which has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and continuously
complied with the conditions of its bond or other security under the provisions of this article for a period
of three consecutive years, shall be entitled to a release of the bond or other security and shall be exempt
from all requirements of furnishing a bond or other security as a condition precedent to registration under
this article. Such exemption shall continue until such time as the Department shall determine that the tax
collector is delinquent in the filing of any return or is delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax
under this article.
(d)
With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the Department may sue in the
event of a forfeiture), if a tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security
guarantees, the Department shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the
Department through issuance of a final assessment that has become final under the law, convert or cause
to be converted the security which the tax collector bas furnished, into money for the County after first
giving the tax collector ten-days' written notice by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or
forfeit such security to the Department. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the
Department shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank
certificate of deposit from the bank which issued the certificate. If the Department realizes more than the
amount of such liability from the security, plus the expenses incurred by the Department in converting the
security into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such
security, and the balances thereby received on behalf of the County shall be paid into the corporate fund
of the County.
(e)
A retailer maintaining a place of business in the County who fails to register as required
in this article shall be guilty of violating this article and shall be fined $ 1,000.00 for each offense. Each
sale at retail conducted by an unregistered retailer shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. No. 92-0-28, § 5, 5-4-1992; Ord. No. 92-0-53, art. Jll, § 1(5), 11-16-1992.)

same period, the retailer shall attach to its annual return a schedule showing a reconciliation of the two
amounts and state reasons for the differences. The retailer's annual return to the Department shall also
disclose such additional reasonable information as the Department shall require to enable the Department

TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to apply for a grant in the amount of $749,091.00 from the Redeploy Illinois
initiative of the Illinois Department of Human Services. Redeploy Illinois is a state-wide initiative that
targets high-risk juvenile offenders who face incarceration because they are no longer eligible for
detention alternative programs. The program helps divert this population by funding expansion of
community-based sanctions and treatment alternatives. In Cook County, the grant would fund the
diversion of 30 minors from detention to residential treatment programs which are under the supervision
of the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department's Intensive Probation Supervision (JPS) unit.
Funds would be used exclusively for treatment services.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $749,091.00. Funding period: October 1, 2007 through
June 30, 2008.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.

GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 16, 2007 from
TIMOTHY C. EV ANS, Chief Judge, C ircuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to accept a grant award in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant would expand funding for gender responsive treatment
services to felony offenders that have significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders who are
referred to the court's Mental Health Treatment Court. The Cook County Board approved the grant
applications at its meeting on January 9, 2007.

In April 2004, the Circuit Court of Cook County launched the Mental Health Treatment Court pilot
program in the Criminal Division to enhance court supervision of mentally ill offenders by improving the
delivery of mental health care. The ultimate goal of the program is to reduce incarceration of mentally ill,
nonviolent felony offenders. In its first two years of operation, the program has received 180 referrals
and has 70 active participants, both male and female. Most participants have substance abuse disorders in
addition to chronic mental illness and other health concerns, such as positive tests for HIV. Early
program results are encouraging, with recidivism for participants substantially reduced. The grant funds
will be used to increase the participant capacity of the program by an additional 25 offenders, or 75 per
year.
The authorization to apply for the original grant was given on January 9, 2007 by the Cook County Board
of Commissioners in the amount of $200,000.00.

THE HOMEOWNER AND BANK PROTECTION ACT (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Joan Patricia Murphy and Roberto
Maldonado, County Commissioner~.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

THE HOMEOWNER AND BANK PROTECTION ACT
WHEREAS, the onrushing financial crisis involving home mortgages, debt instruments of all
types, and the banking system of the United States threatens to set off an economic collapse
worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s with millions of Americans faced with
foreclosure and loss of their homes over the coming months; and
WHEREAS, this financial crisis threatens the integrity of both Federal and State chartered
banks, as typified by the run on deposits of Countrywide Financial Corporation in California
on August 16, which could wipe out the life savings of too many American people and
drastically undermine the economic stability of our states and cities; and

4363

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 20, 2007

WHEREAS, under similar circumstances in the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
successfully intervened to protect banks and homeowners, addressing Congress with a
"declaration of national policy" on April 13, 1933, which stated "that the broad interests of
the Nation require that special safeguards should be thrown around home ownership as a
guarantee of social and economic stability, and that to protect homeowners from inequitable
enforced liquidation in a time of general distress is a proper concern of the Government."
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
calls upon Congress to take emergency action to protect homeowners and banks by enacting a
Homeowners and Banks Protection Act specifically to:
1. Establish a Federal agency to place Federal and State chartered banks under protection,
freezing all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjusting mortgage values to
fair prices, restructuring existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates and writing off
speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities, financial derivatives and
other forms of financial pyramid schemes that have brought the banking system to the
point of bankruptcy; and

2.

Declare a moratorium on all home foreclosures for the duration of the transitional period,
allowing families to retain their homes. Monthly payments, the equivalent of "rental
payments", shall be made to designated banks, which can use the funds as collateral for
nonnal lending practices, thus recapitalizing the banking system. These affordable
monthly payments will be factored into new mortgages, reflecting the orderly deflating of
the housing bubble, the establishment of appropriate property valuations and reduced
fixed mortgage interest rates. No homeowner shall be evicted from his or her property,
and the Federal and State chartered banks shall be protected so that they can resume their
traditional functions, serving local communities and facilitating credit for investment in
productive entities; and

3. Authorize the state government to assume the administrative responsibilities for
implementing the program, including the "rental" assessments to designated banks, with
the Federal government providing the necessary credits and guarantees to assure the
successful transition.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to the
President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of
Representatives, and to each member of the Illinois congressional delegation and that this text
be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable Body.

*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations on
November 6, 2007.
Commissioner Murphy requested that Commissioner Maldonado be added as a sponsor of
Communication No. 290375.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved the approval of
Communication No. 290375. Commissioner Peraica called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays
being as follows:

REPORT OF THE TASK FORCE ON HOSPITAL GOVERNANCE

The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

Also Present:

Commissioners Peraica, Quigley and Suffredin (3); Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr. - Deputy

the President; and Dr. Robert R. Simon - Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Task Force on Hospital Governance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Tuesday, November 13, 2007 at the hour of 11 :00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
The purpose of the meeting was to take testimony from various individuals on the topic of an Independent
Governance Board for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services. Invited to speak were Cook County
Commissioner Larry Suffredin and Interim Bureau Chief Dr. Robert R. Simon.
Chairman Goslin gaveled the meeting to order, and called upon Commissioner Suffredin.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that a concept on a temporary trusteeship would be presented. He
requested that the individuals from the Emergency Network to Save Cook County Health Services be
allowed to speak first.
Mr. William McNary, Co-Director of Citizen Action/Illinois and a member of the Emergency Network to
Save Cook County Health Services, described the Emergency Network to Save Cook County Health
Services as a coalition of health care policy experts dedicated to reforming and restoring the Cook County
health care safety net. Close to seventy (70) groups comprise this coalition, which includes nurses,
doctors, other health care workers, community organizations, faith-based organizations, labor unions,
consumer advocates and elected officials.
Mr. McNary offered testimony in support of a temporary trusteeship. He stated that the crisis is real, and
the mission of the County health care system is at risk. Furthermore, he believes that current governance
and oversight is not adequate. He cited key points to emphasize his comments which were included in the
October 2007 Report of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services Review Committee (also referred to
as the Goodman Report) by the independent Blue Ribbon Panel appointed by President Todd H. Stroger.
Mr. McNary stated that the first step to refonn the County health system and to restore public confidence
is the immediate creation of a temporary board of trustees that can provide independent oversight.
Mr. McNary spoke in favor of a draft proposed ordinance, sponsored by Commissioner Suffredin, which
lays out an actual blueprint on how to move forward, and addresses a majority of the recommendations
given in the Goodman Report. This proposed interim trusteeship creates a board consisting of nine (9)
members and is composed of independent health care professionals and advocates, members of the
private hospital community and a representative of the system's employees. It also includes the
Chairpersons of both the Health & Hospitals and Finance Committees of the Board of Commissioners.

4366

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 20, 2007

Dr. Quentin Young, M.D., Chairman of the Health and Medicine Policy Research Group and a member of
the Emergency Network to Save Cook County Health Services, spoke in favor of the interim trusteeship.
He stated that demand is constantly increasing, and the formula to get resources lies in creating
independent governance. Not only is the public system in jeopardy, but the private sector is also under
threat if the service mission of the County is not resolved.
Ms. Leatrice Berman Sandler, Vice President of the Health and Medicine Policy Research Group and a
member of the Emergency Network to Save Cook County Health Services, also spoke in support of the
interim trusteeship. She stated that the interim trusteeship provided the most effective way to respond to
the urgent needs of the citizens of Cook County by stabilizing safety net health services. In addition, she
stated that the trusteeship is intended as a direct extension of the Board's power. It does not call for an
entirely new and independent governance structure; instead it calls for the Board of Commissioners to
delegate a governance authority to a board of health experts. The powers of the trusteeship would be
subject to the appropriate level of approval by the Board of Commissioners; the trusteeship would not
really be changing the powers of what the Bureau Chief has today. Finally, she stated that this concept
represents the most effective placeholder while the Board of Commissioners conducts a thoughtful review
of long-term governance options.
Commissioner Suffredin distributed copies of the draft proposed ordinance creating the interim
trusteeship. He stated that it has not yet been introduced to the Board, as negotiations and discussions are
still ongoing, however he believed it could be viewed as a starting point. He added that the draft includes
a member which represents the system's employees, as the cooperation of the labor unions will be
necessary. He explained that the Board of Commissioners needed to review both short and long-term
levels of governance. Long-term governance issues will require action by the General Assembly and
cannot be expected to be resolved quickly. There needs to be a step before that permanent governance
resolution, which could be a temporary trusteeship.
Commissioner Suffredin explained that this draft was modeled after actions with regard to the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center that the Board has previously taken. He stated that the interim trusteeship
was necessary to re-establish to the overall community confidence in the health administration of the
Bureau of Health Services. He added that the Board needed to state clear purposes as to why this health
system needed to be kept going. Furthermore, he believed that the revenue source cannot be only tax
dollars; funding sources should include a mix of federal and state programs. Commitments from the
elected officials at the federal level should be obtained to assist in securing this funding.
Dr. Joseph Flaherty, Dean of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago and UrbanaChampaign, spoke in favor of an independent board that would advise the Board of Commissioners. He
stated that the University is willing to work with the Bureau of Health Services, and he elaborated upon
many similarities between the two entities. The University is a first-class research university that receives
$350 million in research money annually. Additionally, they are a recipient of intergovernmental transfer
funds, they use the Cerner system and have the same mission as the Bureau of Health Services.
Commissioner Collins asked how the proposal solves the immediate problem of funding the system.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that the proposal would create credibility in the general and health
communities.
Commissioner Collins stated that she supports the basic concept, but had concerns because she felt that
the responsibility needed to move away from the Board of Commissioners. Under the proposed interim
trusteeship, there is no independent funding source and the trustee board would not take full responsibility
for the health care system.

4367

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDING S FOR NOVEMBER 20, 2007

Ms. Berman Sandler stated that there were many different models to review, including those that create a
truly independent taxing authority body.
Commiss ioner Silvestri felt that the public's lack of confidence in the Bureau of Health Services stems
from the perceived failure to collect revenues from the indigent and uninsured. He felt that public
perception is not negative in regards to quality of health care provided.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Dr. Flaherty whether the University had the same clientele and
constituency, and what percentage of the patients were uninsured.
Dr. Flahery replied that forty-two percent (42%) of their clientele were Medicaid patients. He stated that
fifty-two percent (52%) were under- or uninsured, and seven percent (7%) of that total was totally
uninsured.
Commissioner Silvestri had concerns about changing the governance of the health care system on a
temporary basis, as opposed to a permanent delegation of some powers. He believes that the Board of
Commissioners, under its home rule authority, has the ability to create an independent governing board,
short of giving it the power to tax people. He stated that he preferred this method, as opposed to a
temporary trusteeship.
Commissioner Daley echoed the concerns stated by Commissioner Collins with regards to funding
problems. He requested a clarification by Dr. Flaherty on the total number of self-pay patients that the
University serves.
Dr. Flaherty responded that seven percent (7%) of their patients are self-pay.
Commissioner Daley stated that the Bureau of Health Service's percentage of self-pay patients is fortyseven percent (47%). He hoped that as the Board of Commissioners reviews the issue of governance, that
the University could participate in the ongoing discussions relating to taking some of the County 's selfpay patients.
Commi ssioner Daley stated that he was in favor of a totally independent board, with separate taxing
authority, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Board of Commissioners. He stated that the
President should introduce legislation in Springfield to do so, and that the Board should collectively work
together to get the legislation passed.
Cha irman Goslin recollected a recent meeting with Susan White, the Coun ty 's representative in
Washington. It was her opinion that in the next year and a half, the County will probably lose another
$I 00 mil lion in funding from Washington, regardless of the Bureau 's perfonnance.
Commissioner Moreno be lieved that the County should network with other area providers and community
groups to address the issue; there is a resolution that was sent to the Health & Hospitals Committee to
establish a regional metropolitan Cook County network. He agreed that funding is the immediate
problem.
Commissioner Butler was concerned with some sections of the draft ordinance that would seem to
contradict a trusteeship's independence, particularly those involving funding.

4368

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 20, 2007

Dr. Robert R. Simon, Interim Chief of the Bureau of Health Services, addressed the members of the Task
Force. He stated that he was strongly opposed to a three year trusteeship, and noted that the Goodman
Report does not even discuss that. He emphasized that the funding problem is paramount, regardless of
the governance model. Critical services will be cut if revenue is not brought in for the Bureau of Health
Services.
After surveying a number of other public institutions that have independent governance boards, Dr.
Simon developed recommendations on his vision for an independent governance board. These included
his recommendations on the size of the board , term and term limits, criteria for board membership, the
role of ex-officio members on the board, the removal process for a board member, the dissolution of a
board if the board is not performing as the Board of Commissioners has directed, the appointment of a
chairman, conflict of interest policies and the explicit powers granted to the board. It was his opinion that
the Board of Commissioners should retain approval of annual budgets and audits. Additionally, he
believes that the independent governance board shou ld include a finance oversight committee, an
operations oversight committee and a quality and patient safety committee which would include nursing
representation, medical staff representation and other workers.
Dr. Simon also recommended that the Board of Commissioners bring in Larry Gage, President of the
National Association of Public Hospitals. Mr. Gage has helped a number of other boards develop
independent governance boards and has indicated his willingness to assist the County.
Dr. Simon envisioned a three step process toward an independent governing board. First, a budget should
be approved with appropriate revenues to support the existing Bureau of Health Services. Second, by
January 15, 2008, the Board should appoint an independent governance board under the existing Jaws.
The third step is to ask the state over a two year process for the independent taxing authority.
Commissioner Silvestri asked whether an independent governance board would recommend drastic
measures with regards to Provident and Oak Forest Hospitals.
Dr. Simon replied that in the past, that has been an option. His predecessors had recommended the
closure of Provident Hospital of Cook County and the closure of the clinic system. He has tried to
preserve as much as possible. He stated that an independent governance board would probably have
brought in industrial engineers to review and restructure as much as possible. Dr. Simon has done a
complete restructure in two areas, Nursing Administration and Pathology.
As a result of the
restructurings, Nursing Administration was downsized by over $ 1.5 million; Pathology reduced their
overtime by fifty percent (50%), reduced their leadership staff by $1.4 million and improved the
turnaround time for tests.
Additional discussion followed regarding review and restructure, under its present authority and under an
independent governance board, of departments and hospitals under the Bureau of Health Services.
Vice Chairman Murphy asked Dr. Simon how many nurses lost their jobs at the hospital.
Dr. Simon replied that seven nurses had lost their jobs, and that the rest were relocated to other positions.
Add itionally, all seven of those nurses chose to retire rather than be reassigned. There were
approximately sixty to seventy doctors laid off, a lthough two-thirds of those were part-time. Before the
Fiscal Year 2007 Budget was passed, there were 750,000 primary care visits, and after the budget there
were 665,000 primary care visits.
Commissioner Peraica expressed support for preventative health care programs such as Access to Care.
He was in favor of first examining infrastructure reorganization, then addressing funding issues.

Chairman Goslin asked Dr. Simon to clarify the industry term " self-pay."
Dr. Simon explained that self pay means no insurance whatsoever. The patient does not qualify for
Medicaid or any other insurance, and they generally have no personal money with which to pay medical
bills. He added that self-pay really means no-pay.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Vice Chairman Murphy, moved to adjourn.

appropriation authority previously granted to the budgetary unit(s) of the Elected Official

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF THE ILLINOIS COALITION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
AND PASSAGE OF FEDERAL LEGISLATION REGARDING RENEWABLE ENERGY
AND FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS
WHEREAS, in the summer of 2007, both the United States House and Senate passed bills that, in
combination, will make a down payment on the fight against global warming, reduce America 's
dependence on oil, diversify our energy supply and create thousands of new, good-paying jobs in the
United States; and
WHEREAS, in the Midwest, and Illinois in particular, we have an important role to play in moving the
U.S. toward energy independence as the Illinois General Assembly took a major step toward clean energy
by adopting a state renewable energy standard requiring utilities to derive 25% of their electricity from
clean wind and solar power, and setting aggressive efficiency goals for electric utilities; and
WHEREAS, a national renewable electricity standard would expand markets for clean wind power and
spur the development of our vast wind energy potential, creating jobs and revenues throughout the state;
and
WHEREAS, making our cars go further on a gallon of gas would also create enormous benefits to both
the environment and the economy as fuel economy standards would save Illinoisans millions at the pump
each year, keeping our hard earned dollars at home instead of flowing out of state to import oil; and
WHEREAS, Environmental lllinois, the Respiratory Health Association of Metro Chicago, League of
Conservation Voters, the Environmental law and Policy Center, Faith in Place and the Union of
Concerned Scientists have formed a coalition in our state to support passage of two important legislative
initiatives to promote a better environment.
