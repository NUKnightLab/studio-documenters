EXPLANATION
The Humana Healthcare Contract (medical) covers eligible participants of the CHA and eligible
participants of the CHA’s affiliates for the benefit year of January 1, 2009 through December 31,
2010. Humana offers a full comprehensive medical plan with prescription drug coverage as part
of the plan. This vendor was chosen due to the fact that Humana provides: 1.) a comprehensive
and extensive PPO and HMO hospital and physician network for CHA; 2.) overall employee
satisfaction with service; and 3.) competitive quotes among other large insurance carriers.
On October 15, 2008 the board authorized the CHA to enter into a contract with Humana
HealthCare for the CHA’s Employee Health Benefit Plan for medical benefits covering eligible

 participants of the CHA and eligible participants of the CHA’s affiliates for the benefit year of
January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 for an amount not-to-exceed $4,800,000 for the
base term and an amount not-to-exceed $5, l00,000 for the option year January 1, 2010 through
December 31, 2010.
On September 8, 2009 the broker for our employee benefits, Mesirow Financial, presented a
renewal for Humana’s 2010 medical rates that showed an increase of 5.75%. The estimated
combined annual premium for HMO and PPO enrollees, based on the number of employees and
current enrollments at the time, was approximately $5,070,000 and did not exceed the amount
authorized by the Board. The census in July 2009 (count 451) was utilized as the current
population to project the 2010 covered members. However, the CHA has now determined that
due to increased employee headcount and employee enrollment changes in FY2010, the total
annual premiums for FY2010 will surpass the original authorized amount for FY2010 by
approximately $161,000.00, which will be needed to pay the premium for medical coverage on
December 1, 2010. There were various factors that impacted the change from the 2009
projections requiring an increase in funding for FY2010. The employee changes for FY2010 are:
increase of 86 PPO enrollments from HMO in the beginning of the year, enrolled headcount
increased by 10 new members, new dependent coverage legislation change in 2010 covering
dependents up to the age of 26, CHA Domestic Partner coverage policy revision, and qualified
life events changes. Additionally, the CHA current census shows a few employees on COBRA
were covered by the CHA for 3 months and 4 employees due to a personal leave of absence are
currently covered at 100% by CHA.
The CHA employer-sponsored health coverage costs include premiums paid at 100% by affiliate
employees, retirees and COBRA members, employee contributions and member cost-sharing
provisions. To help keep costs in check for 2011, the CHA will be providing wellness programs
and benefits partnering with CHA employees to take steps to promote healthier lifestyles.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to increase the funding to Contract No. 8073 with Humana Healthcare by
an amount not to exceed $161,000.00 for CHA employees’ medical health coverage . The
contract’s new aggregate not-to-exceed funding amount for medical coverage will be
$5,261,000.00.
