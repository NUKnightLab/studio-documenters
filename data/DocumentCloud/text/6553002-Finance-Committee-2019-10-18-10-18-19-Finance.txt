B.

Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)

Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided an overview of the contractual requests presented for the
Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Mr. Jones stated that request number 6 (Advanced Care Services) will be reduced by $149,000.00, to a revised
contract increase amount of $1,511,000.00. Director Deer noted that the contract spend to date exceeded the
authority by $400,000.00; he asked how this can happen under the existing contract management oversight (at
using department level and from a financial systems perspective). He noted that this vendor is a MinorityBusiness Enterprise, and he found out about the overspend when the vendor contacted him because they could not
make payroll as a result of not getting paid for the services provided that resulted in the overspend. It was noted
that the vendor will not get paid for those services that have already been provided until the CCH Board approves
this contract increase. Mr. Jones noted that, when the administration found out about the overspend, Supply
Chain increased the contract by $149,000.00 under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer as an initial way
to address the overspend and provide payment to the vendor; because of that increase, this request before the
Committee today will be reduced by $149,000.00.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)

With regard to measures being developed at the using level to prevent this from happening again, Dr. Beena Peters,
Chief Nursing Officer, indicated that a new process is being developed for tracking nurse agency usage; once it is
developed, it will become policy. Director Deer requested that a copy of the process be provided.
Board Chair Hammock inquired whether CCH’s financial system sends up a “red flag” when a contract is
overspent. Mr. Jones responded that, once fully functional, the new financial system should do that. Director Deer
requested that Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provide a real-time timeline as to when the components of
the new financial system that relate to that aspect will be fully functional.
With regard to request number 15 (Dayspring Professional Janitorial Service, Inc.), Chair Reiter stated that he will
be asking the Committee to withdraw this item and resubmit a revised request for consideration for next week’s
Board Meeting. He believes that the administration has changed the nature of what this would have turned up in a
bidding process, so he feels that a shorter contract extension (rather than one (1) year) is in order while the
administration moves forward immediately with the request for proposals process for these services.

Chair Reiter, seconded by Director Deer, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 24, with the exception of request number 15, which was withdrawn
and will be resubmitted to the Board of Directors at their next meeting, and
subject to completion of review by Contract Compliance, where appropriate.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

NOTE: The difference between Number of Contract Awarded and Number of Contracts with Goals = Contracts assigned a Contract specific goal of zero.
This means that there were no certified MWBEs to provide the specific Good, Service or Equipment.

May reflects a waiver where the vendor did achieve 5.33% MBE/WBE indirect participation but indirect participation is only considered a good faith effort. 
June reflects one full waiver and three partial waivers that caused a downward trend in participation.
