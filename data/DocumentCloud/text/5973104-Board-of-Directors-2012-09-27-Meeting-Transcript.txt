CHAIRMAN BELL:

Seeing that we have a

2

quorum, I would like to call the meeting to

3

order.

4

First I would like to thank all of

5

you for participating with us in attending our

6

third CIT meeting, and with that I'm going to

7

jump right into the agenda in the interest of

8

being mindful of everyone's time.

9

The first item on the agenda is the

10

approval of the minutes.

11

copy.

The Board all got a

It was sent to you.

Do I have a motion?

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

13

ALDERMAN POPE:

Second.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor?

15

I move.

(A chorus of ayes.)

16

Open Acts training.

Now, I think

17

you all know we have an obligation to get this

18

done by November 1st.

19

get here.

20

will show you, this is what the certificate of

21

completion looks like.

22
23
24

It's 90 days after we all

I don't know who has taken it, but I

MR. HOFFMAN:

I see it's got your name

on it.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's got my name on it.

 3
1

I have taken it.

2

struggle getting in.

3

consuming but you got to -- you have to go to

4

the home page and register first before they

5

will even let you into training, and then when

6

you go through it, you do have to sort of

7

dedicate an hour to get through it.

8
9

It's a struggle.

It's a

It's a little time

But actually it's pretty informative
so I would encourage us all to get it done as

10

quickly as possible.

Obviously it's a

11

requirement to have it done at the end of

12

90 days, so November 1 is it.

13

ALDERMAN POPE:

And, Chairman, we can

14

submit our records to you or --

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Why don't you get them

16

in to Diana and she can just have copies of all

17

of them, and maybe -- I don't know if we should

18

put them in the minutes or what or post them on

19

the website.

20

them, but first and foremost let's get the

21

training done and the certificates in and we'll

22

figure out how we want to deal with it.

23
24

We'll figure out what to do with

Officers and directors insurance,
that's still an item open.

We haven't made much

 4
1

progress on it yet.

I don't know, Diana, if you

2

have had any other contact with the person in

3

the City on this or not.

4

if you have, you can comment.

5

MS. FERGUSON:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I know I have not.

So

I did not.
Okay.

Then I think in

7

our next meeting -- between now and our next

8

meeting we'll try to make some more headway on

9

that and we will report out on what our status

10

is.

11

The status of the application for

12

the 501 status, is that what you're working on,

13

David?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

So let me introduce Henry

15

Kleeman who is a partner at Kirkland & Ellis and

16

I think this has been discussed at prior

17

meetings.

18

the nation's premier law firms, a competitor of

19

our law firm, but a law firm that's one of the

20

greatest in the country, Kirkland & Ellis, who's

21

providing work for us pro bono.

22

We are fortunate that we have one of

So we really appreciate it.

Scott

23

Falk and Henry and I have been spending time on

24

the phone together getting some of these

 5
1

preliminary documents in place.

2

express publicly what I've said to them over the

3

phone, how much I appreciate their time and work

4

on these matters.

5

I want to

And so I know that the -- they spoke

6

to the prior counsel to get up to speed about

7

what had or had not been done on 501(c)(3) and

8

I'll let Henry speak for himself, but I think

9

the very, very short answer is that that process

10

is just starting.

11
12

MR. KLEEMAN:

That process is just

starting.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

So therefore, you know,

14

that's something that needs to be checked off in

15

terms of 501(c)(3).

16

you know, this issue is something that can be

17

discussed over the next -- you know, until the

18

next meeting, but the Steve Berlin issue of

19

whether we are a city agency or not, you know,

20

the ordinance says we're a not-for-profit

21

company.

22

applying to the IRS because you're a

23

non-for-profit company.

24

There are -- and I think,

When you apply to the IRS you're

If you are a public agency, you're

 6
1

not a non-for-profit company.

2

this to me is something that is kind of a

3

collateral issue and I think will be worked

4

out, but that's the answer on the upcoming IRS

5

application.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So, you know,

Thank you, David.

And

welcome.
Retrofit Chicago update, is that
going to be you, Scott?
MR. YONOVER:

Yes.

Mr. Chairman, Board

11

Members, I'd like -- on behalf of the City, I

12

would like introduce Courtney Shea.

13

City's financial advisor from Acacia.

14

She is the

To give you an update, we are

15

accelerating our sequence of meetings.

16

having biweekly meetings to sift through what

17

our projects -- what we're going to be bringing

18

to the Trust for consideration.

19

We are

We've got early drafts of proposed

20

projects and we're trying to make them -- a

21

financial analysis of each project in terms of

22

the energy savings consistent so it's

23

understandable to both the Board as well as

24

investors so we can ensure the outside investors

 7
1

interest into the data room of these projects,

2

and we're going to bring them to you in the not

3

too distant future, but we're trying to make

4

sure that our data is accurate.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

Any

comments, questions of Scott?

7

(No response.)

8
9

All right.

We'll wait to hear back as you guys
continue to move forward on that process.

10

The next item of business is our

11

financial reports, and the first on that list is

12

the approval of the grant agreement.

13
14
15

David, I'll let you lead that
discussion.
MR. HOFFMAN:

So our lawyers from

16

Kirkland have talked to the City lawyers.

17

were some adds made to these grant agreements

18

and we've been advised by Kirkland that they are

19

comfortable.

20
21

There

Do you want me to turn it over to
you, Henry, to say anything?

22

MR. KLEEMAN:

I was going to say what

23

you were about to say, David.

24

comfortable with it.

We're very

I've spoken to I know

 8
1

Scott, to you, James, and I spoke with David.

2

We're ready to go.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I think let me say what

4

we're concerned with.

5

standard Ts and Cs that are for standard

6

grantees and we weren't sure that fit us as well

7

as we'd like, and then David and Kirkland &

8

Ellis looked at it and they think that it's okay

9

for us to keep those in.

10
11

There are some of the

We don't view that to

be an issue for us.
MR. HOFFMAN:

You know, frankly this is

12

a grant agreement that covers the money that we

13

can use for the next few months.

14

to be a pretty narrow window and issue.

It turns out

15

And, you know, the ordinance and the

16

bylaws are the things that govern who we are and

17

what we do, and so as advised by Kirkland we're

18

comfortable frankly because we don't think it

19

changes anything whatsoever in terms of our

20

ability to do anything.

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

22

All right.

have a motion?

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

So moved.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Second?

So do we

 9
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

All right.

All in

favor?

4

(A chorus of ayes.)

5
6

I second.

Let the record show we approved the
grant agreement.

7

Establishment of the bank account.

8

Diana, I don't know if you have had a chance to

9

do more work on that yet or not.

10

MS. FERGUSON:

11

Board on where we are.

12

a second to introduce Tom Morsch who's in the

13

audience from Public Financial Management.

14

is the Managing Director of Public Financial

15

Management.

16

Yeah.

I will advise

At first I'll just take

He

PSM is a nationally renowned

17

financial adviser that has graciously agreed to

18

work for the Trust on a pro bono basis.

19

So following up on the discussion we

20

had at the last meeting, I have had several

21

conversations with PFM.

22

having a competitive process to establish our

23

bank account, PFM has drafted a brief RFP to go

24

out to a handful of banks with emphasis on

Given the importance of

 10
1

trying to get a local, potentially minority

2

bank, if we can find one, that's able to do the

3

scope of work that we are interested in.

4

So that should be out in the next

5

couple of days and hopefully at the next meeting

6

we'll have a recommendation on the selection of

7

a bank.

8

Tom, if you want to add anything to

9

that, please feel free.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

no.

12
13

MR. MORSCH:
Diana.

14
15

Tom is shaking his head

I think that's great,

Good summary.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

All right.

Thank you.

Questions?

16

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman, do we have a

17

copy or access to a copy of the RFP once it's

18

complete?

19

MR. MORSCH:

Absolutely.

Diana, as she

20

has indicated, is reviewing the draft.

I'm sure

21

she'll circulate that to you to take a look at

22

it.

23

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

That's before it goes

 11
1

out.

The Board will have to approve it and be

2

comfortable with it.

3

ALDERMAN POPE:

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

Let me welcome Tom and

5

PFM.

This is I think the first time they have

6

appeared here.

7

really good boost for us and the process that we

8

have an advisor on the financial front that,

9

number one, is very experienced in this area,

As with Kirkland, I think it's a

10

and, number two, in my mind, just as

11

importantly, is committed to advice relating to

12

our independence and to being a truly

13

independent advisor.

14

lines of what they do and what they are.

15

You know, that's along the

But I know we all believe that for

16

us to be successful that having that

17

independence and having experienced advisors who

18

will help us to achieve that independence and

19

get independent guidance is very important.

20

So, you know, I know Tom and I know

21

Julia who are going to -- among other people,

22

who are going to work on this.

23
24

And as it relates to both Retrofit
Chicago and future projects, I think it's a

 12
1

great boost for us that we're going to be able

2

to rely on them for independent advice, and I

3

appreciate the continuing updates from the City,

4

Scott, Lois' office on what they're thinking

5

about and the actions they are taking internally

6

on Retrofit Chicago, all of which assumes that

7

at some point we will have some sort of more

8

substantive discussion publicly about what makes

9

sense and from the beginning of whether as a

10

project it makes sense and what the experience

11

is around the country and the world of people

12

who have done this kind of private financing of

13

retrofit.

14

And in that regard I think Tom and

15

PFM will be a great independent leader for us in

16

sort of allowing us to publicly talk about, you

17

know, where the risk areas are and what makes

18

sense.

19
20

So preliminary comments to say
welcome and glad you're on board.

21

MR. MORSCH:

Thank you, David.

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you, David, and I

23

echo those comments.

Also I just want to

24

acknowledge the fact that these two fine

 13
1

companies, along with Spencer Stuart who's our

2

executive search, have stepped up to do this pro

3

bono.

4

They really have a keen interest in

5

the City and helping the City to be the best

6

that they can be, and so the Board really wants

7

to acknowledge that and express our appreciation

8

for you doing this pro bono.

9

much.

So thank you very

10

Any other comments?

11

(No response.)

12

Let's move on to the status of our

13

search for the executive director.

14

mentioned in our last meeting, Spencer Stuart

15

has decided -- has agreed to provide -- to do

16

that search for us on a pro bono basis.

17

As I

I have met with Spencer Stuart a

18

week ago Friday.

19

through the job description that we have put

20

together and we've shared publicly with all here

21

and the general public.

22

We spent a lot of time going

We started talking about how can

23

they put more specifics to that in order to

24

really go out and conduct this search, and

 14
1

they're in the process of doing that, putting it

2

in their format.

3

I think, as you know, Spencer Stuart

4

has a far wide stretching reach, not only here

5

in the City of Chicago, they have offices

6

globally.

7

this -- we wanted to follow the best practices

8

that the City had provided us in our discussions

9

several months ago, and I gave them that list

Clearly we talked about the fact that

10

and they assured me they could do that, but the

11

fact is they will have the wide reach to really

12

get this thing out publicly.

13

Now, we talked a lot about, you

14

know, what's our process going to be, and the

15

Board really hasn't completely decided that.

16

Obviously they've authorized me to go out and do

17

the initial -- work the initial effort with

18

Spencer Stuart, but once they get a job

19

description and once we get an idea of what the

20

market looks like, I will bring that back to the

21

Board so we can be all comfortable that we're

22

heading in the right direction.

23
24

The other thing I've asked them to
do and they are working on is one, give me a

 15
1

timeline on what it's going to look like to

2

conduct this search and complete it in the way

3

and in the manner we want it done, and so they

4

owe that to us and they are working on it.

5

The other thing I have no idea what

6

the compensation should be for this position,

7

and I've asked them to provide some data that

8

would allow us to, you know, evaluate that

9

appropriately.

I did tell them we don't want to

10

pay them more than we pay the Mayor, but other

11

than I didn't give them much guidance.

12

So they are in the process of trying

13

to pull together comparable compensation data

14

for positions that they think that this one

15

probably would fit in conceptually and the space

16

it would fit in.

17

that.

18

sometime in the near term.

So they're going to work on

So I expect to get that from them

19

Anyway, that is the sum and

20

substance of the progress on the executive

21

search.

22

Any questions?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Will we be able to see

23

the job description assuming it's edited before

24

it gets finalized?

 16
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Absolutely.

I want to

2

bring it back -- as I said, I want to bring it

3

back to the Board.

4

you know, how far and wide reaching the search

5

should be, what the compensation looks like.

6

It's the job description,

I think the Board needs to be

7

comfortable with all of that.

8

we -- you know, how do we -- and they're looking

9

at how do they post it so we are comfortable

10

And then how do

with the most public exposure.

11

So before we go out, once they give

12

me the timeline and all that information, I'm

13

bringing it back to the Board so we can all be

14

comfortable that that's the right approach and

15

before I give them the okay to go out and do it.

16

Other questions?

17

(No response.)

18

Then let's move into the status of

19

other services.

20

David, on the legal?

21

Why don't we start with you,

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I covered it

22

mostly.

I think the update is that Kirkland is

23

on board, that they worked on the grant

24

agreement, that they are taking a look at -- and

 17
1

they really jumped into this.

2

was maybe a couple of weeks ago when it started.

3

So I think our hope is that by the next meeting,

4

whenever that is, that some of these other

5

documents, including the conflict of interest

6

policy and some I would classify them as

7

relatively minor, but some recommendations I

8

think they have to clean up some mistakes in the

9

bylaws.

10

I would say that

Those are the two things along with

11

the IRS application that are on the table, and

12

there's a continuing discussion regarding this

13

Board of Ethics statement about our being a City

14

agency.

15

relating to the legal issue.

16

Those are I think the agenda items

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You might want to

17

mention, David, that we got a pretty extensive

18

rewrite of the conflict of interest policy, and

19

that's why it's going to take us a little longer

20

to work our way through it.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

I mean, the Board

22

of Ethics asked to be involved.

23

last week had some significant suggestions that

24

assume that we're a City agency and not a

They very late

 18
1

non-for-profit agency, and frankly I think that

2

while that's -- I can understand intellectually

3

that issue, and there should be clarity and

4

consistency on that, which in my mind has

5

already been provided by the ordinance, at the

6

end of the day I'm not sure it's going to make

7

much difference in terms of what the substantive

8

terms of the conflict policy are, but in terms

9

of the language that's used and how that relates

10

to the City ordinances, we have to get that

11

right.

12

And frankly we have, you know, some

13

time because obviously we don't have deals in

14

front of us, so we have the time to get it right

15

and the time frame of that is probably right

16

around the next meeting.

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you very much,

David.
Diana, would you like to introduce
the topic of where we are with our advisors?
MS. FERGUSON:

Sure.

Thank you,

Mr. Chairman.
In addition to the first priority
which we talked about already in terms of

 19
1

establishing a banking relationship, the scope

2

of work that we have discussed with our pro bono

3

financial advisor really falls into a total of

4

four areas.

5

The first being establishing our

6

banking relationship, and in that regard, as I

7

mentioned, we are doing some benchmarking with

8

kind of comparable entities to make sure that we

9

are soliciting for best practices in our RFP

10

process.

11

The second area is really helping

12

the Board develop our knowledge base in terms of

13

reviewing and cataloging all proposals or deals

14

that come before us even in their preliminary

15

state to evaluate or just keep a catalog of

16

everything that someone might think is -- might

17

be of interest to the Board in the future so

18

that we get familiar with the types of

19

transactions that we might be asked to

20

consider.

21

In terms of the third area would be

22

helping us with our -- maintain our

23

communications and outreach to financial

24

partners, benchmarking again with best practices

 20
1

the types of transactions that are out there,

2

building our knowledge around investor

3

preferences, transactions, different sources of

4

what types of preferences different investors

5

might have and parameters we might be expected

6

to consider.

7

And then fourth and finally only as

8

a specific deal comes before us with maybe, as

9

David mentioned, our independent advisor and

10

due diligence provider on any specific

11

transaction.

12

So that's the scope that we have

13

talked about so far, and again Tom is here to

14

add to that or answer questions from the

15

Committee.

16
17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Tom, would you like to

add anything?

18

MR. MORSCH:

No, I think that's a good

19

summary.

We've kicked off a dialogue with Scott

20

in the CFO's office to kind of begin that

21

communication and make sure that's established,

22

and the data and information, get that flowing

23

back and forth, so I think we're off to a good

24

start there and anticipate being back to the

 21
1

Board with more information as well.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

One comment.

4

Mr. Yonover, I understand that -- you know, to

5

echo something that Tom just said, we're

6

transitioning, right, to sort of being a fully

7

functional independent thing, and before that

8

has happened you and the CFO's office have

9

played and continue to play a very important

10

role in support.

11

While that will continue, obviously

12

this is moving with our own counsel and

13

financial advisors.

14

encouragement to something I know will happen

15

anyway, to make sure that when there are

16

requests from the independent advisors and from

17

anyone else associated with us for information

18

and stuff that you have received that whatever

19

you can do to get that to them as quickly as

20

possible, we would appreciate it.

Just a note of

21

MR. YONOVER:

That's our goal.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you very much.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

comments?

Thanks.

Any other

 22
1
2

(No response.)
Okay.

Then let's talk about these

3

meeting dates.

4

meetings scheduled for this year, and obviously,

5

you know, we haven't -- we really set this

6

monthly meeting rhythm so that we could start

7

getting our financial advisor in place, our

8

legal support in place and get the executive

9

search off, and now I think we have gotten off

10
11

You know, we got three other

to a good start there.
As you can see with the speed of

12

this meeting that's taking place, I'm not sure

13

that we're going to need to have three more

14

meetings before the end of this year, so we need

to think our way through that.

16

I don't know if we want to set one

17

of these dates like the 23rd and see where we

18

are and then decide on the other two at that

19

point, but I would obviously like input from the

20

other Board Members, but clearly I don't think

21

we're going to have enough to update ourselves

22

or the public on in the ensuing months before

23

the holidays that will require three meetings.

24

What do you all think?

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman, I would tend

to agree.

quickly.

month out would be appropriate in light of the

holidays.

point.

I think this meeting is moving rather

Should we need another one prior or

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree, although I think

for calendar purposes it would make sense to, if

10

we can, I know that Jorge is not here, but to

11

maybe tentatively choose a different date now.

12

We were looking at the November and December

13

dates.

14

time and we have a sense that we may not need

15

three meetings this year.

16

They are both right around the holiday

What if we pick now tentatively

17

subject to Jorge's calendar a meeting that was

18

in the first two weeks of December?

19

thinking people are more likely to be here.

20

instead of having three meetings for the rest of

21

the year, that means we have two.

22

during the weeks of December 3rd or 10th.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Hopefully everyone is

2

trying to get into their calendars.

3

December 6th I am here, believe it or not.

4

Diana, how does that work with you?

5

MS. FERGUSON:

December 6th in the

6

morning is fine, and also October 23rd I agree

7

that we can call that meeting and it's on my

8

calendar.

ALDERMAN POPE:

December 6 is fine for

me, Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And the 23rd is still

ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes, sir.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Why don't we vote to

good?

15

have those two as our two meeting dates for the

16

remainder of 2012 and then we got to work on

2013.

not a good thing.

on that those meetings are on those exact same

20

dates.

and work our way through.

22

table that and then figure out if we can get

23

other dates that she can make.

24

MR. YONOVER:

Diana can't make any of them and that's
She has another board she's

It's not something she can call in on
I would rather us

Mr. Chairman, I'll throw

 25

some more dates out to the Board and we can go

2

from there with Diana.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Sounds good.

Can I

4

have a motion on what we just said which means

5

we're going to defer the 2013 dates and have the

6

remaining meeting dates in '12 to be

7

October 10th and December 6th?

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

October 10th?

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Excuse me,

10

October 23rd, I'm sorry, and December 6th.

11

ALDERMAN POPE:

Seconded.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor?

MR. HOFFMAN:

MR. HOFFMAN:

At 10:00 a.m.

Do you know if they are

17

going to be here or at the Cultural Center or is

18

that to be determined?

19

MR. YONOVER:

Where it's at will be

20

determined.

21

the availability of the Cultural Center.

We'll let everyone know because of
