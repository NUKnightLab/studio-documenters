PROJ ECTS

Fourth Amendment to the Development Agreement with Tiger Stadium Partners,
LLC for the Tiger Stadium Site

Ms. Pavelko stated that in August, 2017, the Economic Development Corporation of the
City of Detroit executed the fourth amendment to the Development Agreement
(as amended, the "Agreement?) with Tiger Stadium Partners, LLC (the "Developer?) for
the redevelopment of the portions of the old Tiger Stadium site to provide an extension to
close. The Developer?s project will incorporate a 4-story building along Michigan (Parcel
4) with approximately 25,000 square feet of ground floor retail and 102 residential units
(the ?Mixed Use Project?). in addition, the Developer, or, subject to Article 18 of the
Agreement, Developer?s affiliate, Tiger Stadium Partners 2, LLC will build a
minimum of 24 townhomes along Trumbull Ave (Parcel 3) (the ?Townhomes Project").

The Developer had anticipated closing on the land and all equity and financing
transactions by October 15, 2017. To account for additional reserve requirements based
on the underwriting of the project, additional New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) equity has
been committed to the project and the Developer has increased their equity committed to
the project. The reserve requirements have caused certain delays subsequent to the
requested extension requiring additional time to close on the financing required by the
Agreement. The Developer has requested an extension to close until December 15, 2017.

November 14, 2017

500 Griswold,8ui?re 2200 48226 (313) 963?2940

Staff reviewed the request and timeline to move this project to completion. Based on this
review, Staff proposed an amendment to the Agreement as follows (the ?Proposed
Amendment"):

1. Closing Date for Mixed Use and Townhouse projects is extended to December 15,
2017. Developer may not close on the purchase of Parcel 3 and/or 4 from the
EDC prior to closing on all financing and equity transactions for the Mixed?Use
Project or Townhouse Project.

EDC staff requested the Board?s approval to amend the terms of the development
agreement previously approved by the EDC Board to reflect the changed terms above.

A draft resolution was provided for the Board?s consideration.
Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Jackson, seconded by Mr. Queries, Resolution Code EDC 17?
11-76?24 was unanimously approved.

1st Amendment to the Amended and Restated Development Agreement with Detroit
Police Athletic League

Ms. Pavelko reported that in June, 2016, the Economic Development Corporation of the
City of Detroit executed the Amended and Restated Development Agreement (as
amended, the ??Agreement?) with DETROIT POLICE ATHLETIC LEAGUE, LLC (the
?Detroit or ?Developer?) relating to the construction of an athletic field (the "Playing
Field?) and permanent headquarters to provide unique programming to Detroit PAL
participants and families (the ?Project?).

In Section 13.01 of the Agreement, the Developer agreed not to develop the Playing Field
using afield surface that utilizes crumb rubber infill. After conducting further due diligence,
the Developer has determined that utilizing a field surface with crumb rubber infill is in the
best interests of the Project, and the programming goals of the Developer. Crumb rubber
infill is the state of the art for artificial turf at all levels including high school, college and
pro sports, examples of which can be found at the recently?built turf fields at
Renaissance, East English Village, Mumford, as well as turf fields at Cranbrook,
Country Day, and West Bloomfield High. The rubber infill has been found to be safe,
durable, efficient, cost effective, and playable. Based on this due diligence, the Developer
has requested to amend the Agreement to allow the use of turf including crumb
rubber infill.

Staff reviewed the request and the due diligence conducted by the Developer that led to
the request. Based on this review, Staff proposed approving this request.

A draft resolution was included for the Board?s consideration.
The Board members discussed their concerns regarding the possible health issues of the

use of crumb rubber and requested a copy of the studies and the research that was done
on the matter. Board members agreed to reconsider this item at a Special meeting on

November 14, 2017

November 20, 2017, provided they receive the requested information and have adequate
time to review the material.

Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Ms. Bruhn, seconded by Mr. Roling, Resolution Code EDC 17-11?
76-25 was tabled,

ADMINISTRATION

Ms. Kanalos advised that an electronic copy of the above-referenced material was sent
to each Board member on November 8, 2017.

The EDC Finance Committee met and reviewed the material on September 19, 2017
and recommends formal receipt by the EDC Board.

The proposed resolution indicates the Board?s formal receipt of the EDC Audited Financial
Statements and Management Report as of June 30, 2017, with comparative totals as of
June 30, 2016, as prepared by George Johnson and Company, Codified Public
Accountants.

Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:

On a motion by Mr. Jackson, seconded by Mr. Queries, Resolution Code EDC 17-
11-01?196 was unanimously approved.

OTHER MATTERS

Mr. Long advised that Mr. Jemison would not be joining the DEGC in December, as
reported at an eariier meeting, and the search team was discussing their options. Mr.
Long stated that he would remain in the capacity of Interim President and until
the candidate is identified. This Board requested Mr. Jemison to present his plan on
DEGC organizational issues. Mr. Long questioned whether the Board would like him to
report on the current status. The Board felt it would be helpful for Mr. Long to do a
presentation on the DEGC organization, staffing and how work gets done at a meeting in
December.

Ms. Bruhn requested that people present for agenda items be asked to identify themselves
when making comments to the Board.

Ms. Forte stated that she felt the Board had asked all the right questions and that it is not
the intent of the Board to stall the Tiger Stadium Redevelopment project, but that it was
just not ready to take action today due to the fact that the Board needs more information
to make an informed decision.
