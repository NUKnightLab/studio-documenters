EASEMENT REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to
grant a permanent easement to the Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) at Roosevelt Road
and IL 171 (1st Avenue) for 0.032 acre or 1,390 square feet.
Reason:
As part of planned intersection improvements at Roosevelt Road and IL 171 (1st Avenue)
IDOT proposes to construct 350 linear feet of 7-foot-wide concrete sidewalk along the south side of
Roosevelt Road from 1st Avenue to the existing Pace bus shelter. The sidewalk will be constructed
adjacent to the curb to minimize the required easement area. The proposed sidewalk will improve safety
and accessibility for pedestrians from the bus shelter to the crosswalks at the signalized intersection. The
Village of Forest Park has requested the sidewalk and will be responsible for its maintenance.

The planned intersection improvements are within the existing IDOT right of way. Only the sidewalk is
proposed to be built on Forest Preserves land.
The area for the permanent easement is 0.032 acres. IDOT indicates that no trees are expected to be
removed for this project.
