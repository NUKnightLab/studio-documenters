Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided information on the work being done by HPI, as
referenced on slide 28 of the presentation. CCH has had a three (3) year contract with this group, which
is a high reliability and training organization. The first phase of their work involved an assessment of
safety events in the organization. The second phase focused on initial training and sensitivity training, the
importance of safety event reporting, working on core values, leveling the playing field, and raising
awareness and expectations for event reporting. This year, which is the third year of the contract, the
work plan will focus on developing specific skills and tools for practices that are likely to enhance both a
safety process and also a safe culture. This training will be offered across the entire organization.
Director Driscoll inquired regarding how the administration will measure the success of the plan and
whether the results will be shared with the Board. Dr. Wyatt responded that the administration has
identified focus areas for quality measurement going into this year and beyond. Under the direction of
Dr. Shannon, a steering committee that is co-chaired by Dr. Fegan and Debra Carey, Deputy Chief
Executive Officer of Operations, has been established, that has begun to meet and develop quality
measurement strategies. Under that steering committee, workgroups have also been established that will
report to the steering committee and subsequently to the Board, through the Quality and Patient Safety
Committee.

SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary measure which compares
the actual number of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR > 1.0 indicates more
HAIs were observed than predicted, conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that
fewer HAIs were observed than predicted.

 Keys to Success

Systems Approach

Culture Counts

The approach to reduce
harm must be integrated and
implemented at the system
level.

Health systems and
organizations must truly
prioritize quality and safety
through an inspiring vision
and positive reinforcement,
not through blame and
punishment.

Patients as True
Partners
Healthcare organizations
must involve patients and
staff in safety as part of the
solution, not simply as
victims or culprits.

Bias toward action
Interventions should be
based on robust evidence.
However, when evidence is
lacking or still emerging,
providers should proceed
with cautious, reasoned
decision-making rather than
inaction
