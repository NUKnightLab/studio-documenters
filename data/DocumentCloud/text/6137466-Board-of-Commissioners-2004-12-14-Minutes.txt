LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioners
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Risk Management
Solutions of America, Chicago, Illinois; Advent Medical Management, Chicago, Illinois; and Spectrum
Health Services, Inc., Bolingbrook, Illinois, to provide an integrated Workers' Compensation case
management program designed to contain costs and accelerate the return to work process for injured
employees on a pilot program basis.
A start up fee of $45,000.00 will be used to hire the appropriate personnel to administer the plan for the
County. The fee wi ll cover the costs of conducting implementation meetings, mailings and special
programming. A call center is where the initial intake of claimant information originates. All other costs
and expenses will be billed directly to the claimant' s file.
Reason:

Historically, the County experiences approx imately 1,700 work-related injury cases per year,
with an estimate of approximately 525 of these cases involving lost time from work and
another 490 cases involving complex medical issues. Therefore, it is estimated that 1,015
newly reported work-related injury cases would be managed by a case manager saving the
County $365,000.00 or more based on the number of ann ual medical users.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $135,000.00 (Year 1: $90,000.00 - $45,000.00 for start up cost and $45,000.00
total annual call center fee; and Year 2: $45,000.00 total annual call center fee). Contract period :

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the Cook County Office of Contract Compl iance's report, pursuant to Fiscal Year 2004
Budget Amendment No. 93 , revealed that minority (African American, Hispanic, and Asian) and women
owned firms each received approximately 1 percent of Cook County construction contracts (excluding
medical equipment) in Fiscal Year 2003; and

149

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

WHEREAS, even more disconcerting is the fact that minority participation has dropped 97 percent since
1999, during which time the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that the County's
Minority and Women 's Business Enterprise (MBE/WBE) Ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to
construction contracts; and
WHEREAS, the statistics demonstrate that the pattern of discrimination against minority and women
construction contractors is at an alarming all-time high and that minorities can have no expectation of
fairness without legislation; and
WHEREAS, the exclusion of minority and women owned construction contracts from the MBE/WBE
Ordinance is an injustice that the members of the Board of Commissioners must immediately rectify.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby approve a contract to hire an attorney specializ ing in formulating affinnative action programs to
draft an " Interim MBE/WBE Construction Contract Program" Ordinance to be submitted for final
approval at the January 5, 2005 Cook County Board meeting.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the " Interim MBE/WBE Construction Contract Program" will not
exclude Asian-Americans, who received only I percent of construction contracts from Cook County
(excluding medical equipment) in Fiscal Year 2003 and continue to be victims of discrimination.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the " Interim MBE/WBE Construction Contract Program" wi ll be
in effect for one year after the date of its approval or until such time the MBE/WBE Task Force conducts
a disparity study and a new constitutionally sound MBE/WBE Construction Ordinance is adopted by the
Board.

WHEREAS, the study of legal and operational requirements to establish physical standards for the hiring

Cook County would be subject to collective bargaining under the Illinois Labor Relations Act; and
WHEREAS, Cook County employs over 5,200 sworn officers and virtually all of them belong to a
union; and
WHEREAS, Cook County would have to bargain with each of the unions over the creation and
implementation of such a program, and if the County were unable to reach agreement with each of these
unions it would have to be submitted for a decision to an Arbitrator who would have the authority to
determine whether the County would be allowed to implement such a program ; now, therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urge the Administration and the
Sheriff of Cook County to negotiate appropriate physical standards for sworn personnel of the Cook

Transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. I in the amount of $543 ,710.00 to Contract
No. 04-53-229 with Walsh Construction Company of Illinois, contractor for the Cook County Building
Infrastructure Upgrade, Phase 2. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this

Reason:

shafts of this I 00 year old building. The electrical shafts that contain the electrical bus ducts
are not 2-hour rated as required. Some new floors in the electrical closets need to be built to
isolate the shafts. Some closets need to be increased in size in order to house the new fire
alarm panels. Additional temporary electrical feeds must be provided to safely shutdown the
power while work is underway. Finally, some fan coil unit drain lines were discovered to be
missing and must be replaced so that the units can be activated.

*Referred to the Business and Economic Development Committee on 12/01/04.
Commissioner Hansen asked what the Commissioners are being asked to vote on today.
John Fallon, Special Assistant to the Assessor, replied that the vote today is to renew the Real Property
Assessment Classification Ordinance for a five-year period.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the five years will begin.
Mr. Fallon replied that the Ordinance will expire December 31 , 2004; the new period would begin
January 1, 2005.
Chairman Collins stated that it is a requirement of the County Board that every five years the Board
reviews the report to see what effect the incentives have on revenue throughout the County, and to
determine whether the County will continue the program .
Commissioner Hansen asked if it was an authorization.
John Nyhan, General Counsel for the Assessor's Office, replied that this is the third time that the
Assessor's Office has provided the Commissioners with the Sunset Report covering a five-year period.
The reason it ceases at 2002 is because the report was started one year ago, and the Assessor's Office is in
the arrears one year; at that point the total completed year was 2002. Traditionally the Sunset Reports
cover a five-year period and end a year or two before the actual date of the continuation of the Sunset
Report.
Commissioner Quigley suggested that the Committee renew the policy because of the complexity of what
is involved and how the County will deal with those nuances; additionally he requested that they report
back to the Board and make sure that the clauses are there to address companies that are underperforming.
Further, Commissioner Quigley stated that he is committed to working with the Assessor's Office,
Commissioners and the President' s Office to detail the circumstances and concerns that citizens have
expressed. He recommended that this Ordinance be amended and presented to the Board at a later date.
Chairman Collins replied that she concurs with Commissioner Quigley. She also has some questions that
need to be addressed which she has expressed to Assessor Houlihan's staff. Chairman Collins stated that
the biggest flaw with the tax incentives is to allow them to renew after the ten-year period has expired.
These companies do not meet the criteria for a second renewal unless they are preparing to expand.

260

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

Commissioner Hansen replied that he a lso agrees with Commissioner Quigley. Further, Commissioner
Hansen stated that the representatives of the Assessor's Office should report back to the Assessor on both
what the Chairman of this committee has stated regarding the performance of these classifications, as well
as the nonperformance of classes. Then the Assessor' s Office should report back to the Com mittee as to
what language the Board would like to include in the C lassification Ordinance to handle the contingencies
that have been talked about.

Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved approval of Communication
No. 268465. The motion carried.

The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:
( I)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial buildings,
which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if new
industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being would be
improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment opportunities
and by a growth in the real property tax base;

(3)

that because of the blighted or depressed condition of the areas where s uch development is
needed1 the ordinary unaided operation of private enterprise cannot accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehab ilitation and development, therefore provision must be made for public
ass istance and encouragement of such private enterprises;

(4)

that the creation of new property tax classifications for (a) new development of industrial
structures, or the substantial rehabilitation and re-utilization of existing industrial structures, fo r
the County as a whole as well as fo r specific areas of special need, and (b) new development of
commercial structures, or the s ubstantial rehabi litation and re-utilization of existing commercial
structures in areas that are depressed, blighted or threatened with blight, is an appropriate and
necessary method of providing such assistance and encouragement, and will result in increasi ng
the tax base in such areas and fo r the entire County; and

26 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

(5)

that the creation of a new property tax classification for the rehabilitation and new construction of
certain multifamily rental housing will increase and improve the stock of decent, safe and
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households in Cook County, and will remove
the blight or potential blight of deteriorating housing stock while also increasing the tax base of
the County.

(6)

that the amendment of real estate assessment classifications for the purpose of lowering the
assessment level for certain retention and development of the most affordable permanent housing
available to homeless and very low income individuals.

(7)

that the creation of a new property tax classification, to facilitate commercial and industrial
development through remediation of property, contamination of which is not attributable to the
owner, is an appropriate and necessary method of providing assistance and encouragement to
achieve remediation and utilization of such property, which will result in increasing employment
opportunities as well as the tax base in the areas in which such sites are located and in the entire
County.

(8)

that the Class L tax classification, will encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of
historically and architecturally significant buildings, will enhance the general character of real
estate in the County and contribute to the economic well-being of the County by increasing the
level of economic activity, increasing employment opportunities and contributing to the longterm growth of the real property tax base.

(9)

that the creation of a new property tax classification to encourage the preservation and retention
of existing affordable rental housing units is necessary and beneficial to the population of Cook
County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

Class 6b:

Real estate used primarily for industrial purposes, as defined herein, consisting of all
newly constructed buildings or other structures, including the land upon which they are
situated; or abandoned property, as defined herein, including the land upon which such
property is situated; or all buildings and other structures which are substantially
rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to their value, including qualified
land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the rehabilitation adds vertical or
horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of land eligible for the
incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the rehabilitation
bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class 6b is necessary
for development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the Class 6b application to the
Assessor. A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed at the time of
filing the Class 6b eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application, the
applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County, as
the case may be, confinning that a resolution or ordinance supporting the incentive has
been requested.
A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the
secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
In the case of abandoned property, ifthe municipality or the Board of Commissioners, as the
case may be, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the property is "abandoned"
for purpose of Class 6b, even though it has been vacant and unused for less than 24 months,
that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be included in the
resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b application. Such
resolution or ordinance shall be included with the eligibility application. If the ordinance or
resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County is required to validate such shortened period of qualifying abandonment, and a
resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 6b eligibility application. The
applicant must obtain the municipal enabling ordinance with the required finding of special
circumstances and present such municipal ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a shortened period
of qualifying abandonment and provide a County resolution to that effect. A certified copy
of an ordinance or resolution finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified
copy of a County ordinance or resolution validating the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility application with
the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal
is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the resolution is not filed at the time of the
eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the
municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a resolution or ordinance
regarding special circumstances has been requested.

to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b and;
3.

a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class 6b. Any property which applies for Class 6b treatment on or before
the adoption date of this ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal term at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
If, on the effective date of this Ordinance, a property is receiving Class 6b treatment, but
the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for s ubsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Cook County Board for
distribution to Commissioners from the effected districts.

shall revert to the applicable classification under this Ordinance.
Additionally, for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated buildings and other
structures to qualify for Class 6b classification, an eligibility application must be made to
the Assessor within one year prior to the commencement of such new construction or
substantial rehabilitation. With respect to abandoned property, the eligibility application
must be made to the Assessor no later than ninety days after purchase for value if such

Remediation Letter" from the Site Remediation Program, as defined above.
To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the

classification.
An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for
development to occur on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County

application for the Class C classification. A copy of that ordinance or resolution,
whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the secretary of the
Cook County Board of Commissioners for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be
made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one year
limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C
classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that
such subsequent application is made within 7 years.

to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class C and;

3.

a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before
the adoption date of this ordinance change will be eligible for this renewal term at the end
of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Cook County Board for
distribution to Commissioners from the effected districts.
If, on the effective date of this Ordinance, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but
the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the
incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 3 below. After
such ten-year period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to
the applicable classification under this Ordinance.
For commercial properties, once the original twelve year incentive period has expired, the

Class S:

Real estate otherwise entitled to Class 3 classification under this ordinance, consisting of
land and existing buildings and structures, which is subject to a Section 8 contract that has
been renewed under the "Mark Up To Market" option, as defined herein. The portion of
the land and building eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the number of
Section 8 units bears to the total number of units. Said proportion shall be applied only to
property used for residential purposes, and not to portions of the property, if any, used for
commercial purposes.
Property qualifies for the Class S classification if its Section 8 contract has been renewed
under the Mark Up To Market option, pursuant to one of the following alternatives:
I. HUD has approved renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up to Market
option, after finding that:
A.

The property has received a physical inspection score of at least 60, in an
inspection by HUD' s Real Estate Assessment Center, confirming that the
property is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair with no uncorrected
Exigent Health and Safety (EHS) violations; and

8.

The property does not have a low-and-moderate-income use restriction that
cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the
current rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the Mark Up To
Market option to increase the rents to the use restriction level, which would
be a renewal qualifying for the S classification; and

C.

A Rent Comparability Study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that
comparable market rents are above I 00% of the HUD Fair Market Rent.

2. HUD has approved a contract renewal for 5 years of the Section 8 contract under its
discretionary authority relating to the Mark Up To Market option, after finding that
the property meets at least one of the required criteria:
A.

A vulnerable population is affected, or

8.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based
assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

C.

The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of State or local funds to the property.

Additional requirements for qualification for the S classification are:
I. At least 20% of the living units must be Section 8 units for qualifying low and
moderate-income persons.

279

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

2. T he owner(s) must agree to retain at least the existing number of Section 8 units for
at least S years after the expiration of the expiring or expired Section 8 contract.
3.

For the duration of the Class S c lassification period, applicant must fi le annually with
the Assessor, on or before a date determined by the Assessor, a sworn statement
verifying continuous compl iance with the Class S provisions of this Ord inance.

4.

Applicant must agree to notify the Assessor's Office if the Section 8 contract is
terminated prior to its expiration date. Applicant shall provide to the Assessor's
office a copy of any Notice of Default or Notice of Abatement received from HUD.

When the applicant applies to HUD for a contract renewal under the Mark Up To Market
option, no less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the contract, the applicant shall
notify the Assessor's Office of the application, on a form provided by that office. Upon
receiving approval of the contract renewal from HUD, the applicant shall file an
application for the incentive with the Assessor's Office, on a form provided by that
office. The application shall be supported by a copy of HUD's letter approving the
contract renewal and a copy of the executed renewal contract.
Any property which, as of the effective date of this Amendment to the Classification
Ordinance, has an existing Section 8 contract with a Mark Up To Market option may
apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the 200 I assessment year
encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the contract term,
including any renewals approved with the Mark Up To Market option.
The classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8
contract.
The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under the " Mark
Up To Market" option. Upon fi ling an application with H UD, no less than 120 days prior
to termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract under the Mark Up
To Market option, the taxpayer shall provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its
application for renewal. The taxpayer shall provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of
HU D's approval of the contract renewal, or notification of other action.
The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initi al and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.
Class L:

Real estate which:
(I)

is designated as a Class 3, Class 4, Class Sa or C lass Sb pursuant to this
Ordinance; and

(2)

is a Landmark or Contributing Building as defined in this Ordinance; and

(3)

has undergone Substantial Rehabilitation, as defined in this Ordinance. The
Substantia l Rehabilitation must constitutes an invest ment by the owner of at
least SO% of the building's full market val ue as determined by the Assessor in
the assessment year prior to the commencement of the Substantial
Rehabilitation.

280

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for
at least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the
Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the
incentive.
Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
an ordinance or resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is
located, which expressly states that the local government:
(I) has determined that the incentive provided by Class L 1s necessary for the
Substantial Rehabilitation of the property; and
(2) supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and
(3) has reviewed and accepted its Preservation Commission's written
recommendation of the project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation
will specify the project's budget and the proposed scope of work and will specify
that the project will meet or exceed the Standards of the United States
Department of the Interior for Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and
Reconstruction of historic properties.
A certified copy of the ordinance or resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the
time the Class L eligibility application, is filed but the ordinance or resolution must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class L.
If the ordinance or resolution is not filed at the time the eligibility application is filed, the
applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
(I) a letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that
a resolution or ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested~ and

(2) a copy of the Preservation Commission's recommendation of the project.
A copy of the resolution or letter confirming that a resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Cook County Board for distribution to the Commissioners from the
affected districts.
Additionally, to qualify a Landmark building or Contributing Building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year
prior to the commencement of Substantial Rehabilitation.
After the Substantial
Rehabilitation has been completed, the Preservation Commission shall review the project
to determine that it is eligible hereunder. The applicant must supplement the eligibility
application with a copy of the determination of the Preservation Commission prior to
classification of the real estate as Class L.
The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of twelve years from the date
such Substantial Rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

281

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or Sb, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16% assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:
I. the taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of his intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, and;
2.

the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated
area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board,
as the case may be, has determined that the use of the property is necessary and
beneficial to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the
Class L, and

3. a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the
Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the Secretary of the Cook
County Board for distribution to Commissioners from the ef!ffected districts.
lf, as of this Ordinance's effective date, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the
assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined
above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the
filing and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the
effective date, the tax payer's assessment is higher than 16% and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment
level based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the
incentive shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 3 below. After
expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Ordinance.
For commercial properties, once the original twelve year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under thi s
Ordinance.
The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class L recipients as to the continued Landmark status of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period
relating to the non-filing.

Section 4.
(A)

To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:

283

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

(I)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federal , state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of I 961 , as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federal Empowennent
Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Chicago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and

(2)

real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County ifthe real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors (l)
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance
or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the
application with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the secretary of the Board of Commissioners for
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall include any
other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the
expense of doing so.
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of factors (I)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.

284

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor ( 4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance.
In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors (1) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Committee's finding. The Assessor shall review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors (1) through (5) exist, he shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary: (1) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an
unincorporated area, the County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of
economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish
the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public
assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or,
if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one
in need of substantial_revitalization; (3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in
need of_substantial revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the economic conditions of
the area. In determining whether the "in need of substantial revitalization" requirement is met,
the Assessor shall give strong consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is
located in a federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by
the Cook County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May
18, 1994.
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of Chicago shall be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.

285

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 14, 2004

If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.

(C)

" Effective January I, 200 I, any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class
