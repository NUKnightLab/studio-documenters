For Council?s review, the attached schedules present the gaming tax revenue activity through
August 2018 and prior ?scal years.

In the second month of the ?scal year the casinos reported a combined gross revenue increase of
8.08% compared to the second month of the prior ?scal year. The ?rst two months combined
show a 4.05% increase over the same period in the prior year. Broken out by casino, 
annual receipts are up by Motor City?s are up by 3.76% and Greektown?s are up by
11.08%, compared with the second month in the prior ?scal year.

In the second month of the ?scal year, the City collected $18.46 million in gaming tax revenue,
which was 39.19 greater than August 2017, as re?ected in Chart 1. Chart 2 Detroit
Gaming Tax Collections? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows an increase
of 4.12% since last July among the combined casino tax revenues. Based on existing data, there
is projected to be surplus of $3.96 million for the ?scal year for a gaming revenue total of
$184.73 million, a 3.21% increase over last year.

Adjusted gross casino gaming receipts were reported at $120.48 million for the month of August
2018 as shown in Chart 1A. This represented an 8.08% gain compared with August 2017. Chart
2A Detroit Gaming Receipts? through a twelve-month moving average trend line

shows growth of 1.83% among the combined casino receipts.

Re\cliuc\Gaminchpon 1 [ml doc

MGM and Motor City are each paying 12.9% of gross gaming receipts to the City, while
Greektown Casino is paying 11.9% of gross gaming receipts and is broken out as follows. By
state law, all casinos are now paying 10.9% of gross gaming receipts to the City as wagering tax.
The casinos also have an additional 1% payment because of the 2002 amended development
agreement with the City. Additionally, if a casino reaches $400 million in receipts in a calendar
year, like MGM and Motor City, then an additional 1% is paid to the City per the amended
development agreement of 2002.

There is not a complete one-to-one relationship between the adjusted gross receipts and the tax
revenue collection increases when comparing prior years, due to two factors. First, there is the
fact that MGM and Motor City casinos began paying the City 1% less due to the permanent
casinos Opening on October 3 and November 29 of 2007. This reduction to the City is part of
state Public Act 306 of 2004, when the legislature amended Public Act 69 of 1997, which was
the original casino gaming legislation. PA. 306 increased the wagering tax by 6% of which 2%
went to the City of Detroit. P.A. also allowed that when the permanent casino had been certi?ed
by the state gaming board as having operated for 30 consecutive days and once the City
determined the project was complete, 5% of the 6% additional wagering tax would be
eliminated, with the remaining 1% allocated to the City where the casino is being operated.
Greektown continued to pay the 6% additional wagering tax 4% to the state, 2% to the City 
until its permanent status was agreed to by the Administration and approved by the State Gaming
Commission, which occurred on March 9, 2010.

Second, the amended development agreement of August 2002 between the City and the casinos,
which is separate from the state law, has all casinos, beginning in January 2006, paying an
additional 1% over the state law, plus another 1% when the casino reaches $400 million in gross
receipts in a calendar year. For the thirteenth year, MGM and Motor City are projected to
exceed $400 million in the calendar year and increase gaming tax collections by $10.6 million
between September and December. MGM reached $400 million in August and Motor City is
projected to do so in October.

Council Approval of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department

(DWSD) budget and retail rates

During the Budget, Finance and Audit Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday, September
26, 2018, Detroit Water and Sewerage Department?s (DWSD) Chief Financial Of?cer Thomas
Naughton claimed that orders of the United States District Court in Detroit (Hon. Sean F. Cox)
somehow authorize DWSD to refuse to submit their budget and retail water and sewer rates to City
Council for approval.

Speci?cally, Mr. Naughton stated in response to the Chair?s direct question: . did not
bring the budget, and that?s based on a court order dated December 15, 2015, based on
recommendations of the root cause committee.? (The DWSD discussion begins with 15:40
remaining on the digital counter)

 

Mr. Naughton?s statement to the committee echoes DWSD Director Gary Brown?s attached
memorandum dated July 10, 2018, attempting to justify their continuing refusal to seek Council
approval of their budget (including budget amendments) and retail rates: ?Judge Sean Cox?s
December 15, 2015 Order (entered in anticipation of the bifurcation of DWSD into a separate
regional wholesale system and a Detroit retail operation) reiterated the powers granted to the
BOWC under Article 7, Chapter 12.? (emphasis added)1

 

I It should be noted that: 1) Neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Naughton is a lawyer; 2) Mr. Naughton in particular
is relatively new to his current position, and to understanding he had no personal involvement in the
court proceedings, either in bankruptcy or the long-running DWSD oversight litigation in the courts of

This remark about ?powers granted to the (Board of Water Commissioners)
begs the real question: what, if anything did Judge Cox ever order ?garding Citv Council
review of budget and retail rates? The simple answer is: nothing.

The referenced court order is attached. It has been thoroughly examined by LPD. Focused
overwhelmingly on labor relations issues, and the then-ongoing establishment of the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA), it does not authorize DWSD to violate the Charter or the Code by
exempting this City government department from seeking City Council approval of its budget and
retail rates. Indeed it does not even refer to limiting Council?s authority in any way.2 Furthermore,
LPD has examined many, many other court orders and documents from that litigation, without
?nding any applicable authority for position.

Given that LPD was not actively participating in the litigation, it has been our query: Is there a
court order that actually authorizes position? Because from reading no such
authority can be found in the December 15, 2015 order.

LPD has over the course of the last 2.5 years repeatedly documented that DWSD, the
administration and the Law Department have failed produce any such relevant court order. Such
an order would be the absolute minimum they would need to justify their course of action in this
regard, in the face of the mandatory requirements of Charter Sections 8-208 and 9?507, and Section
56-3-12(c) of the City Code. (These provisions are quoted again below for the committee?s
convenience.)

Whether Council?s resolutions and legal analysis and conclusions about Council?s Charter-
mandated powers are right or wrong, it is incumbent on DWSD, the administration and the Law
Department to undertake the formal proceedings necessary to establish that, rather than continuing
to delay, pretending that they have not been put on notice of the dispute, shirking their obligations,
and sending uninformed new employees to council meetings to reiterate incorrect information.

To review, here are the speci?c provisions of the City Charter and Code that DWSD is violating,
violations that the Law Department is refusing to timely address through the Charter-mandated
dispute resolution provisions of Section 7.5-208:

 

Judge Cox and, before that, of Hon. John Feikens, between 1977 and 2014; and 3) LPD has previously
explained on multiple occasions why the City Charter and City Code require DWSD to seek and obtain
Council?s approval for their budget and retail rates. LPD has gone so far as to draft the attached mandamus
complaint for ?ling when the unwieldy requirements of the 2012 Charter for Council legal action in such
cases of dispute with the administration can ?nally be met. A copy of that draft complaint has been provided
to the Law Department, which the Charter expressly makes responsible for its enforcement, months ago.

2 Where Judge Cox ordered disregard of a Charter provision on December 15, 2015, he did so clearly and
explicitly, stating ?Further, DWSD is not bound by Section 6-405 of the City?s Charter, which outlines the
City Civil Service Commission.? (Page 13) LPD respectfully submits that this fact, together with the
order?s total silence regarding Sections 8-208 and 9-507 of the Charter, and Section 56-3-12(c) of the City
Code, are fatal to shotgun?style reliance on unspeci?ed provisions of this order, in an attempt to
undermine City Council?s lawful authority in violation of the Charter and the Code.

II Section 8-208 of the City Charter, with respect to the City of Detroit?s budget, states
?Consideration of the budget shall be completed by the City Council as provided by
ordinance.?

Section 9-507 of the City Charter states ?Any agency of the City may, with the approval
of the City Council, charge an admission or service fee to any facility operated, or for any
service provided, by an agency. The approval of the City Council shall also be required
for any change in any such admission or service fee.? (Retail water and sewerage rates are,
and must be legally de?ned as, fees for services provided by DWSD. DWSD is a
department of City government, as acknowledged by Judge Cox in his ?nal court orders.)

0 Section 56-3-12(c) of the Detroit City Code states that ?The rate to such users [of 
services] shall be established by the board of water commissioners and shall be approved
by the city council in accordance with state and local law.?

As LPD most recently reiterated in its of the water workshop DWSD provided for
Commit in Maw Ems will be extremely dif?cult, if not effectively impossible, for
Council to affect water affordability policies until its lawful budget? and rate-
approval authority is restored.? (emphasis in original) The importance of these policies to
quality of life for many residents of the City of Detroit can hardly be overstated. Under the Charter,
City Council is fully empowered to act as a check and balance on the administration in such public
policy debates implicating ?scal, public health and human rights concerns of the City and its
residents. Continuing to pretend otherwise is completely unacceptable. The time has come to
resolve the issue of City Council?s seat at the policy making table regarding DWSD.

 

Recent changes in the way that drainage fees are calculated have resulted in tripling some
residents? water and sewerage bills. Affordability and resulting availability of water is
even more of an issue now. It is therefore vitally important that rate discussions be brought before
Council so that residents can be fully informed on all issues that necessitate such increases.3

If Council has any other questions or concerns regarding this subject, LPD will be happy to provide
further research and analysis upon request.

 

3 Moreover, unpaid water bills can be used as the basis for tax foreclosure. MCL 123.162.

RE: Legislative Policy Division Request for Budget Rate Information for FYs 19 20

This represents the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), Finance Division?s
responses to a request from Detroit City Council's Legislative Policy Division (LPD) for
information regarding the DWSD's amended two-year budgets for fiscal years 2018-19 and
2019?20. The City of Detroit Board of Water Commissioners formally approved FY2019
and FY2020 amended budget on June 20, 2018, after holding the required public hearing. On
July 11, 2018, DWSD will make an informational presentation to this Honorable Body regarding
the approved budget and answer questions. For your consideration and review in advance Of
the presentation, our responses to the requests for information from the Council are

itemized below:

1. Does the DWSD plan on coming to City Council for approval of the FY 2019 rates and FY
2019 and FY 2020 amended budgets?

DWSD Response: DWSD will not seek City Council approval of FY2019 rates or the FY2019
and FY2020 amended budgets as it is not required to do so. Pursuant to
Sec. 7-1202 of the 2012 Detroit City Charter, the Board of Water Commissioners directs the
DWSD in the supply of water drainage and sewerage services within the City and
establishes the rates to be paid by the owner or occupant of each house or building using
water, drainage or sewerage services.1 Judge Sean Cox's December 15, 2015 Order2
(entered in anticipation of the bifurcation of DWSD into a separate regional wholesale
system and a Detroit retail operation) reiterated the powers granted to the BOWC under
Article 7, Chapter 12. The Court also stated the BOWC rates shall be developed to satisfy

 

1 This charter-mandated power to direct DWSD and establish the retail rates for Detroit customers is separate from
its (former) charter?mandated power to set wholesale rates for customers outside the city limits. As a result of
the bifurcation of DWSD into a Detroit retail operation governed by the BOWC and a regional wholesale system
with a separate governing body (Great Lakes Water Authority), the BOWC no longer sets wholesale rates for

customers inside or outside the City.

the revenue requirements established by the GLWA for water and sewer service as well as
the expenses of operating the local water and sewer infrastructure, consistent with the
Water and Sewer Services Agreement approved and executed by the City and the
Authority.3 Lastly, the Order states in the event the BOWC fails to comply with the
requirements of the Water and Sewer Services Agreement with respect to rate-setting,
billing, collection and enforcement for the local water and sewer systems, the GLWA may
assume that responsibility. DWSD's budget and obligations under the Water and Sewer
Services Agreement are based on rates and these matters fall within the purview of the
BOWC, only.

Furthermore, the City's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report clearly designates DWSD
as an enterprise agency. As such, the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act, MCL 141.421
et. seq. does not require DWSD to have its budget approved by City Council.4 Lastly,
revenues are not considered during the City's Revenue Estimating Conference
(Sec. 8-213, Detroit City Charter) because DWSD is an enterprise agency that does not
require a general fund subsidy.

While this response is not intended to be a formal statement of legal position,
absent a federal court order or a super-majority vote of anuAd Hoc Root Cause Committee
to do so, DWSD will not seek City Council approval for rates or budgets; rather, it will
continue to make informational presentations.

2. According to Attachment 2, rate increases are 4% for both Water and Sewer in FY
2019. Does this mean that the "retail rate" increases 4% for both Water and Sewer
in FY 2019? However, Water?s Gross Retail Sales increase 1.6% in FY 2019 and Sewer's
Gross Retail Sales increase 10.2% in FY 2019. Only the Service Charges component of
both Water and Sewer Retail Sales increase by 4% in FY 2019. Please explain what
the 4% rate increase represents and how it was derived. Please also provide detailed
information supporting the development ofthe 4% rate increase.

 

3 As this Honorable Body is aware, since Detroit is no longer a municipal water and sewerage system that serves
more than 40% of the population of the state, Sec. 5e of the Home Rule City Act, requiring the governing body to
vote on rates, is inapplicable. (MCL 117.5e)

4"Budget? means a plan of financial operation for a given period of time, including an estimate of all proposed
expenditures from the funds of a local unit and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. Budget does
not include. . . An enterprise fund.

DWSD RESPONSE:

Water Retail Revenue has two components, the water volume rate and the fixed service
charge. Both rates were increased however, in estimating total retail revenue we
anticipate water volumes will decrease by 2% in FY 2019. When factoring in the volume
reduction, the net increase in retail revenue was reduced to 

Sewer Retail Revenue is comprised of three elements, the Detroit disposal rate, a fixed
service charge, and the drainage charge. The Detroit disposal rate and fixed service
charges were increased by however, we again expect sewerage volumes to decrease
by 2% in FY 2019.

The drainage charge rate was actually lowered from $661 in FY 2018 to $598 in FY 2019,
but the residential and faith-based customer classes will be included for the first time
under the Billable lmpervious Acreage (BIA) methodology for assessing drainage charges
in FY 2019.

Each year we determine the revenue requirement of Water and Sewer Funds based on
contractual obligations under the lease, projected operating expenses, and estimates of
non-retail revenues.

During the presentation made to City Council on May 4, 2018 regarding DWSD
issues, consultants indicated that rates have been increasing nationwide in the 15
to 20% area in some communities. How does DWSD keep the Water and Sewer rates
fair and affordable in accordance with its strategic priorities? How can this be
achieved when DWSD faces high fixed costs, especially with respect to
infrastructure costs, when a sizable segment of its customers hover around or below
the poverty level?

DWSD RESPONSE:

DWSD works to keep rates fair and affordable through several initiatives, such as smart
investments in infrastructure, focusing on preventative maintenance to reduce emergency
repairs, reducing non?revenue water loss, initiating green infrastructure projects to reduce
consumption of sewer and drainage services, and improving collections rates. Affordability
efforts include working with customers to reduce their water consumption by offering
water audits to discover and eliminate leaks, installing low flow toilets, referring customers
to state assistance programs and third party assistance programs such as THAW. Our
payment plan program and WRAP program offer assistance to customers who are
struggling to pay water bills. We continue to explore options for poverty stricken customers
who require long term assistance paying water bills, but we must be careful to avoid any
program that violates the Headlee Amendment or the Supreme Court Opinion in Bolt.

DWSD estimates the GLWA Allocation "Wholesale Charges") for Water to be $41.0
million in FY 2019, a $5.2 million or 14.5% increase from FY 2018 (Attachment 3).
Please explain the reason fOr the increase. Does GLWA alone develop the wholesale
rates and charges or does DWSD have any input in the development of the wholesale
rates and charges? Please provide detailed information supporting the development
of DWSD's Water wholesale rates and charges for FY 2019.

DWSD RESPONSE:

In the DWSD FY 2019 approved budget, we anticipated a 2% annual inflationary increase
from the GLWA in wholesale water charges. GLWA established those rates independently,
with the assistance of the engineering firm of Black Veatch, which recently completed
the first phase of a "units of service? study. wholesale water charge was increased
by $5,700,000 in response to the findings in the engineering study. The second phase of
the study is underway and may alter the initial findings. DWSD personnel have had an
opportunity to comment on and/or dispute the methodology used to perform the "units
of service? study.

While DWSD does not have direct input in the development of wholesale rates and
charges, the City of Detroit has two members appointed to the GLWA board, which sets
wholesale rates and charges for Detroit and all suburban community members.

DWSD estimates the GLWA Allocation "Wholesale Charges") for Sewer to be
$188.5 million in FY 2019, a $13.8 million or 7.9% increase from FY 2018 (Attachment
4). Please explain the reason for the increase. Please provide detailed information
supporting the development of DWSD's Sewer wholesale rates and charges for FY
2019.

DWSD RESPONSE:

In the DWSD FY 2019 approved budget, we anticipated a 2% annual inflationary increase
from GLWA, which established those rates independently. Regarding FY 2019, after
undertaking an engineering analysis, GLWA made an upward adjustment of 
wholesale sewerage charge by $4,800,000, driven mainly by years of deferred
maintenance that has diminished the effectiveness of DWSD combined sewerage overflow
control structures.

When will the GLWA wholesale charges be finalized? Will the FY 2018-2019
amended budget be amended forthe final charges?

DWSD RESPONSE:
The GLWA Board finalized the wholesale charges at its meeting on June 20, 2018. DWSD
plans to amend the FY2018-2019 budget to reflect final wholesale charges during the first
quarter of FY2019.

7. What is the Obligation to GLWA ($27,696,300 for Sewer and $33,438,800 for Water)
in the FY 2018-2019 amended budget?

DWSD RESPONSE:

The Obligation Payable to GLWA is the amortization of principal and interest allocated to
DWSD for its share of debt. As part of the lease transaction in which the City leased the
regional water and sewer system of the DWSD to GLWA, all DWSD revenue bonds
outstanding as of December 31, 2015, including those purchased by the Michigan Finance
Authority under its state revolving loan program, were assumed by GLWA with the consent
of bondholders.

Per the Water and Sewer Services agreement between DWSD and GLWA dated June 12,
2015 and the Master Bond Ordinances dated October 7, 2015, as amended, the Detroit
retail class continues to pay its allocated share of debt service revenue requirements
associated with improvements to the local water and sewer systems. Payments on the
debt service incurred by GLWA on the outstanding revenue bonds assumed as of
December 31, 2015 are to be allocated using an agreed-upon percentage of total debt
service associated with bond financed local improvements over the life of such bonds,
though the bonds themselves continue to be secured by the net revenue of GLWA, which
includes all revenue payable by the Detroit retail class. Subsequent to June 30, 2017, the
parties reached a tentative agreement on the debt allocation, subject to board approval.
During 2018, as a result of continued negotiations on the allocation percentage and as
highlighted on the MOU term sheet, DWSD revised its obligation payable to GLWA in the
amount of $455,000,000 and $370,000,000 in the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund,
respectively. This was approved by the BOWC on June 20, 2018.

8. Please provide the FY 2018-2019 and FY 2019-2020 amended budgets in detail by
appropriation and Object. Also, actual data from FY 2016?2017 and FY 2017-2018 by
appropriation and object for comparison purposes would be appreciated.

DWSD RESPONSE:

The FY 2016-2017 and FY 2017?2018 actual data are currently in Fusion with the exception
of the FY 2019 budget which will be loaded in Fusion by the OCFO-Budget Department. The
FY 2020 budget was developed at "appropriation?level? detail and is not available at the
object-level.

DWSD estimates Water's Bad Debt Expense for FY 2019 to total $6.1 million, or
$4.7 million less than the FY 2018 budget of $10.8 million, a 43% drop. Please explain
the reason for the decrease. Is the amount of delinquent accounts receivable due
from DWSD water customers going down? Have collections on water bills improved in
the last year? What is the current collection rate, and what is the assumed collection
rate for FY 2019? What isthe current level of water shut offs and how does this compare
to last year at this time? What programs are in place to mitigate the number of water
shut offs?

DWSD RESPONSE:

DWSD expects Water?s Bad Debt expense to decrease according to the current trend of
collection efforts. Collection rates have continued to improve over the last few years from
a low of approximately 81% in 2014 to as high as 92% in 2017. This increase can be
attributed to improved processes and procedures, which includes increased management
of tax rolls, modified service interruption procedures, benefits of customer assistance
programs, improved payment systems, attention to the full scope of factors affecting
affordability, and additional staffing in the Customer Service and Collections departments.
Service interruptions have been on the decline year over year. During FY2017 we
completed 11,633 service interruptions. In FY 2018, service interruptions decreased by
66% to 3,941. Currently, we have a number of assistance programs in place to help
residents that qualify, including WRAP and our payment plan program, and this
encourages regular payment history. DWSD and GLWA contribute more than $3 million
a year to the WRAP program.

See also, information on the City's Website: 

DWSD estimates Sewer's Bad Debt Expense for FY 2019 to total $27.7 million, or
$5.4 million higher than the FY 2018 budget of $22.3 million, a 24.4% increase. Please
explain the reason for the increase. Given that the sewer charges are on the same bill as
the water bill, shouldn't the collection rate for sewer charges be about the same for water
charges?

DWSD RESPONSE:

In fact, water and sewer charges are not always on the same bill due to the nature of
drainage charges and some "sewer only? or ?water only? accounts. We bill parcels for
drainage charges independently in many cases. For example, two separate water services
may be associated with one parcel duplexes, condos, etc.). Some properties require
no water service parking lots, vacant commercial properties.) There are drainage
only accounts and since we cannot interrupt drainage services we must pursue civil action

and/or place the delinquent amount owed on the tax roll (on commercial parcels) to
enforce payment. Civil litigation can be costly and time consuming with uncertain
outcomes and sometimes ineffective, which affects the collection rate. Collection rates
generally improved when we placed debt on the tax roll.

When will you present the DWSD FY 2018-2019 and FY 2019-2020 capital budgets?

DWSD RESPONSE:
The FY 2019-2023 five year capital budget was approved by the BOWC on May 16, 2018.
See attached materials.

Why aren't any capital expenses budgeted for Water in FY 2018-2019?

DWSD RESPONSE:
Capital expenses are budgeted in the Improvement and Extension fund. The FY 2019
total Water l&E budget is $50,117,400.

According to page 19 ofthe City of Detroit and Sewerage Department financial statements
as of June 30, 2017 (Attachment 9), the FY 2019 bond debt service (principal and
interest) requirement for Water and Sewer is $38.6 million and $29.3 million,
respectively. Where is this budgeted in the FY 2019 Water and Sewer budgets?

DWSD RESPONSE:
Subsequent to June 30, 2017, GLWA and DWSD agreed to a new allocation in a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Please refer to the response to question 

Also according to Attachment 9, total outstanding bonds payable (principal only) as of
June 30, 2017 is $545.8 million and $416.6 million for Water and Sewer, respectively.
Based on the FY 2019 Water and Sewer capital improvement plans, how much in bonds
payable could be added for Water and Sewer in five (5) years that could impact
rates in the future? Meanwhile, is DWSD attempting to use cash as much as possible
for Water and Sewer capital expenses?

DWSD RESPONSE:

Our current plan is to allocate the $50 million lease payments to fund both post-bifurcation
debt service and capital projects. As such, anticipated lease revenue will pay for both
leveraged and pay?as?you go capital expenses. This approach to funding capital should have
no immediate impact on retail rates.

According to page 81 of the City of Detroit's financial statements as of June 30, 2017
(Attachment 10), GLWA assumed $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion in Water and Sewer bonds,

respectively according to the lease agreement and resulting bifurcation. As ofJune 30,
2017, DWSD management estimates Sewer's and Water's percentage portion of these
bonds on DWSD's books to be 11.4 percent and 20.5 percent, respectively. As of June
30, 2017, GLWA and DWSD were still working to resolve the allocation percentage. What
is the status of the negotiations on the Water and Sewer allocation percentage of the
debt assumed by 

DWSD RESPONSE:

These negotiations were completed resulting in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
approved by the BOWC on June 20, 2018, in which DWSD was allocated $455,000,000 and
$370,000,000 in the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund, respectively. The allocation
percentages no longer apply. See attached MOU.

What pay increases are projected for DWSD employees in FY 2018-2019?

DWSD RESPONSE:

Pay increases have not been decided. Any increases will likely be funded by overtime
savings, savings from vacancy rate including- employee turnover and other sources as
needed.

Why do fringe benefits increase $3.1 million or 28.1% in FY 2018?20 19?

DWSD RESPONSE:

in FY 2018, fringes were under estimated. The FY 2019 fringe rate is 7.39% greater than FY
2018. The fringe rate used to prepare the FY 2019 budget was 43.53%. DWSD mistakenly
used a fringe rate of 36.14% in FY 2018.

18. Why are utilities expenses down $2.8 million in FY 2018-2019? What do utilities expenses

19.

include?

DWSD RESPONSE:

Utility expenses include gas, electricity, steam, water and sewerage. DWSD estimated the
utility allocation between DWSD and GLWA facilities in previous years. We have more
information and experience now. The FY 2019 utility budget is based on FY 2018 actuals.

Where isthe GLWA $50 million annual lease payment in the budget?
DWSD RESPONSE:

The lease payment is budgeted in the Improvement and Extension Funds in the amount Of
$22,500,000 and $27,500,000 in the Water and Sewage Disposal Funds, respectively.

How much of the annual $50 million Lease revenue due to DWSD is being applied to
pay debt service in the FY 2018-2019 amended budget?

DWSD RESPONSE:
All of the post-bifurcation water debt service will be funded by the lease payment. This
includes an estimated $2.8 million for water debt service.

Why are the DWSD FY 2017-2018 restated budgets for both Water and Sewer different
than the amended budget in the City's The ERP shows Water's FY 2017-2018
amended appropriations budget at $200.2 million and the DWSD restated Water budget
was $128.5 million. The ERP shows Sewer's FY 2017-2018 amended appropriations
budget at $291.5 million and the DWSD restated Sewer budget was $296.5 million.
Please explain the differences.

DWSD RESPONSE:

The restated budget was not an amended budget. DWSD used the term ?restated budget"
to represent the contract terms of the same budget. The water and sewerage charges
were grossed up for owner?s equity. The bad debt was grossed up to show gross retail
sales. Simply stated, it is a different compilation ofthe same BOWC approved budget. We
were unable to identify the ERP budget numbers stated in your question.

Why are drainage charges to residential customers up so much for FY 2018-2019?
What major programs are in place to mitigate residential drainage charges? What is the
timetable for implementing drainage charges for industrial, commercial, City of Detroit,
Wayne State, Tax-Exempt and Faith-Based customers?

DWSD RESPONSE:

Many parcels had already been charged for drainage based on either the size of the water
meter or the percentage of billable acres compared to total acres (?class system").
Effective October 2016, the drainage charge was imposed on all non-residential and non?
faith-based customers and effective July 1, 2018, was imposed on all residential and faith?
based customers based on a billable impervious acres (BIA) methodology that captures
every parcel contributing water run-off into combined sewerage overflow system.
This methodology will result in a net increase in drainage revenue for FY 2019, and will
create a more equitable allocation of drainage costs among DWSD retail customers. In
FY 2019, the drainage rate was actually decreased from $661 per acre (FY 2018 rate) to
$598 per acre.

Further, 56% of residential customers will see a decrease in their drainage charge based on
the BIA methodology. Programs to mitigate residential drainage charges include a 25%
automatic credit (which includes a credit for downspout disconnection), parcels with less

than .02 impervious acres are not subject to the drainage charge, and any customer may
request a site assessment if they dispute the amount of impervious acres attributed to their
parcel or if they would like a consultation whether removal of impervious surfaces will
lower their drainage charge bill.

Stormwater Management is a new appropriation in FY 2019. 13 new staff positions and
3 staff transferred from Operations support this new program. What will the
Stormwater Management Group and appropriation in FY 2018-2019 do? How will they
keep drainage costs down?

DWSD RESPONSE:

The Stormwater Management Group (SMG) manages the Drainage Charge Program,
drainage charge engineering projects, customer inquiries, post construction stormwater
ordinance and permit issuance, capital partnership administration and management,
stormwater management practice inspection and construction oversight, stormwater
permit compliance engineering and administration, administration and management of
permit compliance and technical support contract. Generally, stormwater management
projects divert run-off away from and out of the combined sewerage overflow system,
which should collectively reduce the volume treated sewage costs allocable to the DWSD
retail system, and which will likely reduce an individual customer?s BIA assessment.

The two keys to lowering drainage costs for all customers are: (1) incentivizing greenspace
infrastructure projects to reduce the amount of stormwater that flows into the combined
sewerage overflow system and (2) high collection rates, whereby all customers are billed at
the same equitable rate and pay their fair share of the cost to treat stormwater runoff.

How do the results of the new ?Term Sheet" negotiated with GLWA and approved by
the BOWC on April 4, 2018 impact the FY 2018-2019 budget? Please detail the benefits
and obligations to DWSD that will occur in the FY 2017-2018 and FY 2018?2019 budgets
such as reduction in debt service.

DWSD RESPONSE:

DWSD experienced a variety of benefits from the recently negotiated Term Sheet, now
codified in the MOU. Debt service was reduced to $455 million and $370 million for water
and sewer, respectively, and is now fixed. DWSD will also be credited $5.6 million with the
final Sewer lookback adjustment. DWSD will not budget for Extraordinary Repair 
Replacement GLWA will transfer to DWSD a total of $51.66 million. Finally, the
Term Sheet simplifies the funding requirements for the Master Bond Ordinance and Water
and Sewer Services Agreement.

What is the allocated shared service of $7.4 million in DWSD's FY 2018?2019 amended
budget?

DWSD RESPONSE:

The Information Technology shared service cost is for information technology services that
GLWA provides DWSD through the shared services agreement. There are nine separate services
that DWSD pays for through this agreement. The services are for software and hardware
support for a range of software packages related to retail water sewerage services provided
to DWSD retail customers. Examples of the software supported are retail meter reading
technology, customer service and billing software, See-Click-Fix, work order and asset
management software, and geographic information system. GLWA also provides hardware
support from desktop and network support to system interface support.

What is the FY 2018?2019 revenue budget for fire hydrant maintenance that is billed to

Therefore, the funding amount will vary annually. Also, fiscal year 2018 included some

carryover expenses from FY 17.

Plaintiffs, by and through their Counsel, for their Complaint and Petition for Writ of Mandamus,
pursuant to MCR 3.305 and all other relevant provisions of law as stated in this Complaint, say as
follows:

Introductory Statement

The ?ling of this action is necessitated by the clear, mandatory terms of the Detroit City Charter
and Code of Ordinances, together with Defendants? continuous failure and refusal to comply with
them in 2016 and 2017 by annually submitting the retail water and sewerage rates for the City of
Detroit, and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) budget, to Plaintiff Detroit City
Council for their approval as required by the Charter and the Code.

Before 2016, DWSD provided wholesale water and sewer services to communities
throughout southeastem Michigan.

Since January 1, 2016, DWSD has been bifurcated into the retail provider of water and
sewer services within the City of Detroit, and has leased its infrastructure to the Great
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) as the new regional wholesale provider of water and
sewer services to communities throughout southeastern Michigan.

In 1977 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sued DWSD under the
Clean Water Act, and that litigation. (United States of America vs. City of Detroit, et at,
Case No. 77-71100 (US ED MI) (Hon. Sean F. Cox) remained pending until 2013 and was
brie?y reinstated in 2015, with Judge Cox serving as a mediator in negotiations that led to
bifurcation of DWSD and GLWA, and also entering orders regarding procedures to be
followed by DWSD, including, inter alia, which contracts DWSD is required to submit to
Detroit City Council for approval. Signi?cantly, Judge Cox never ordered that the retail
water and sewerage rates for the City of Detroit and the Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department budget are not required to be submitted to Plaintiff Detroit City Council for
their approval as required by the Charter and the Code.

In 2013 the City of Detroit, acting by and through a state?appointed emergency manager,
?led for bankruptcy protection (In Re City of Detroit, Case No. 13-53846?swr (US ED MI
Bankruptcy Court) (Hort. Steven Rhodes). The bankruptcy court appointed Judge Cox
to mediate the negotiations that led to bifurcation of DWSD and GLWA. The City of
Detroit continues to operate its municipal government pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment
entered into and con?rmed by the bankruptcy court. Nothing in the Plan of Adjustment or
any other bankruptcy court order or GLWA agreement requires that the retail water and
sewerage rates for the City of Detroit and the DWSD budget are not required to be
submitted to Plaintiff Detroit City COuncil for their approval as required by the Charter and
the Code.

In 2015, while DWSD and GLWA were in the process of bifurcation, and after the
Memorandum of Understanding in September 2014 that created the GLWA and left
DWSD responsible for retail water and sewer services within the City of Detroit,
Defendants submitted retail rates and budget to Detroit City Council for approval,
as required by the Charter and the Code. Plaintiff Detroit City Council initially rejected
proposed retail rate increase, and then approved it after ?lrther proceedings.

In 2016 and 2017, Defendants failed and refused to submit retail rates and budget
to Detroit City Council for approval, in violation of the Charter and the Code.

On or about April 18, 2017, Plaintiff Detroit City Council duly approved the attached

Resolution to Establish City Council?s Authority over DWSD Rates and Budget Under the
City Charter and City Code, or to Invoke Section 75-208 of the Charter.

3

16about May 18, 2017, Plaintiff?s counsel requested of Defendant Hollowell in writing
a meeting between the Detroit City Council President and Defendant Duggan, pursuant to
Section 7.5-208 of the City Charter, requiring mandatory prelitigation Intra?Government
Dispute Resolution procedures.

Plaintiff?s counsel has on multiple occasions attempted to meet and confer with Defendant
Hollowell to cost-effectively and lawfully resolve this matter, as speci?cally set forth in
the attached correspondence dated June 6, 2017, but Defendant Hollowell has continuously
failed and refused to substantively respond, necessitating the ?ling of this action to enforce
compliance by Defendants with the Charter and the Code.

Section 8-208 of the City Charter, with respect to the City of Detroit?s budget, states
?Consideration of the budget shall be completed by the City Council as provided by
ordinance.?

Section 9-507 of the City Charter states??Any agency of the City may, with the approval
of the City Council, charge an admission or service fee to any facility operated, or for any
service provided, by an agency. The approval of the City Council shall also be required
for any change in any such admission or service fee.? Retail water and sewerage rates are,
and must be legally de?ned as, fees for services provided by DWSD. DWSD is a
department of City government.

Section of the Detroit City Code states that ?The rate to such users [of 
services] shall be established by the board of water commissioners and shall be approved
by the city council in accordance with state and local law.?

Defendants have taken the position, which is unsupported by the plain language of the
Charter and the Code, that since the unelected Board of Water Commissioners establishes
retail rates and budget, and the unelected Financial Review Commission created
by the state legislature as part of the ?grand bargain? achieved in the bankruptcy has
authority over the City?s ?nanCes, retail rates and budget are not required to be
submitted to Plaintiff Detroit City Council for approval, contrary to the plain language and
common sense meaning the Sections 8-208 and 9-507 of the City Charter, and Section 56-
3-12(c) of the Detroit City Code, supra.

Defendants have continuously failed and refused to implement Section 75-208 of the City
Charter, requiring mandatory prelitigation Intra-Government Dispute Resolution
procedures, although Defendant Hollowell in particular, as Corporation Counsel, is
responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Charter, pursuant to Section 75-209 of the
Charter, thus necessitating the ?ling of this action.

Pursuant to MCR 3.305 an action for mandamus may be brought in Circuit Court.

To obtain a writ of mandamus, a plaintiff must show that: 1) the plaintiff has a clear legal
right to the performance of the duty sought to be compelled; 2) the defendant has a clear

4

legal duty to perform; 3) the act is ministerial in nature; and 4) the plaintiff has no other
adequate equitable or legal remedy. See, e. White-Bey Dept. of Corrections, 239 Mich
App 22], 223?224; 608 833 (1999); In Re MCI Telecom Complaint, 460 Mich 396,
443; 596 164 (1999); McKeighan Grass Lake Supervisor, 234 Mich App
194, 211-212; 593 605 (1999)

Plaintiff has a clear legal right to have retail rates and budget submitted to Detroit
City Council for approval, as expressly required by Sections 8-208 and 9-507 of the City
Charter, and Section 56-3-12(c) of the Detroit City Code, supra.

Defendants have clear legal duties to perform under Sections 8-208, 9-507 and 75-208 of
the City Charter, and Section 56-3-12(c) of the Detroit City Code, supra.

Submitting retail rates and budget to Detroit City Council for approval is a
ministerial act.

Plaintiff has no other adequate equitable or legal remedy for Defendants? continuing
Violations of the Charter and ordinances of the City of Detroit; Defendants are the very
parties who are charged by law with responsibility to enforce these laws, and Plaintiff
cannot have any remedy in the absence of court action to enforce Defendants? clear legal
duties.

RELIEF REQUESTED

Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that This Honorable Court Issue a Writ of Mandamus
compelling Defendants to submit the retail water and sewerage rates for the City of Detroit, and
the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) budget, to Plaintiff Detroit City Council for
their approval as required by the City Charter and the City Code of Ordinances, together with all
such other and further- relief as the Court deems necessary, appropriate and warranted by the law
and the facts.

OPINION ORDER CLEHKS OFFICE

 

ON JOINT MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT ?5?90?

FILED BY THE CITY OF DETROIT AND
THE DETROIT WATER AND SEWERAGE DEPARTMENT

In 1977, the United States Environmental Protection Agency initiated this case against the
City of Detroit (?the City?) and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department alleging
violations of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. The violations alleged in this case,
which are undisputed, involve the wastewater treatment plant and its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit. Over the years, a number of other agencies
and entities were made parties to this case.

This case was originally assigned to the Honorable John eikens, who presided over this
action for decades, during which time he took various actions aimed at allowing the DWSD to
achieve compliance with its NPDES permit and the Clean Water Act. This case was reassigned
to this Court on November 24, 2010, following Judge Feikens?s retirement. At that time, the

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality was addressing renewed permit

violations and attempting to negotiate yet another remedial plan.

 

As set forth more fully in prior opinions and orders (see, Docket Entry Nos. 2397 
2528), this Court concluded that the DWSD had not achieved even short-term compliance with
its NPDES permit, as it self-reported new violations shortly after signing an Administrative
Consent Order. This Court further concluded that the record in this case established that, unless
more fundamental corrective measures were taken to address the underlying root causes of non-
compliance, the DWSD would remain in a recurring cycle where the DWSD is cited for permit
violations, the DWSD and the MDEQ agree to a detailed remedial plan, but the DWSD is unable
to follow it and is again cited for the same type of violations. Rather than order a remedy on its
own, without input from City leaders, the Court took a somewhat unorthodox approach. This
Court created a court-ordered committee (?the Root Cause Committee?) to devise and propose a
workable plan to address and remedy the underlying root causes of the inability to
comply with its NPDES permit and the Clean Water Act.

On November 4, 201 1, this Court adepted the Root Cause Committee?s Plan of Action,
and its proposed procurement policy, and ordered its implementation. Thereafter, the DWSD
hired its ?rst permanent Director since 2008, who began working on implementing the changes
ordered.

Signi?cantly, this Court?s November 4, 2011 Order (Docket Entry No. 2410) also
included a number of directives that concerned labor issues (?the Court?s November 4lh Labor
Mandates?):

Speci?cally, the Court hereby ORDERS that:
1. The Director of the DWSD, with the input and advice of union leadership,

shall develop a DWSD employee training program, a DWSD employee
assessment program, and a DWSD apprenticeship training program.

2. Any City of Detroit Executive Orders imposing furlough days upon City
employees shall not apply to DWSD employees.

3. The DWSD shall act on behalf of the City of Detroit to have its own
CBAs that cover DWSD employees DWSD CBAs

shall not include employees of any other City of Detroit departments. The
Director of the DWSD shall have final authority to approve CBAs for
employees of the DWSD.

4. The Court hereby strikes and enjoins any provisions in current CBAs that
allow an employee from outside the DWSD to transfer (?bump") into the
DWSD based on seniority. Future DWSD CBAS shall adopt a seniority

system for the DWSD that does not provide for transfer rights across City

of Detroit Departments does not provide for ?bumping rights? across

city departments). -

5. DWSD management must be able to explore all available means and
methods to achieve compliance with its NPDES permit and the Clean
Water Act. DWSD CBAs shall not prohibit subcontracting or outsourcing
and the Court hereby strikes and enjoins any provisions in current CBAs
that prohibit the DWSD from subcontracting or outsourcing.

6. DWSD CBAs shall provide that excused hours from DWSD work for
union activities are limited to attending grievance hearings and union
negotiations, with prior noti?cation to DWSD management. The Court
strikes and enjoins any current CBA provisions to the contrary.

7. DWSD CBAs shall include a three-year time period pertaining to
discipline actions.

8. The Director of the DWSD shall perform a review of the current employee
classi?cations at the DWSD and reduce the number of DWSD employee
classi?cations to increase workforce flexibility. Future DWSD CBAs

shall include those revised employee classifications.

9. DWSD CBAs shall provide that promotions in the DWSD shall be at the
discretion of management and based upon skill, knowledge, and ability,

and then taking seniority into account. The Court strikes and enjoins and

current CBA provisions to the contrary.

10. Past practices on Operational issues shall not limit operational changes
initiated by management with respect to DWSD CBAs.

L.l I illbu 5 vh?l' I 

11. The Court strikes and enjoins any provisions in existing CBAs that
prevent DWSD management from assigning overtime work to employees
most capable of performing the necessary work within a classi?cation, at
the discretion of management. DWSD CBAs shall provide that
management has the discretion to assign overtime work to employees
most capable of performing the necessary work within a classi?cation, at
the discretion of management.

12. Any existing work rules, written or unwritten, or past practices that are
contrary to these changes are hereby terminated.

13. The Court enjoins the Wayne County Circuit Court and the Michigan
Employment Relations Commission from exercising jurisdiction over
disputes arising from the changes ordered by this Court. The Court also
enjoins the unions from ?ling any grievances, unfair labor practices, or
arbitration demands over disputes arising from the changes ordered by this
Court.

(Docket Entry No. 2410 at 

Soon after, three labor unions whose members include employees of the DWSD

(Michigan AFSCME Council 25, AFSCME Local 207, and the Senior Accountants and

Appraisers Association ?led motions seeking to intervene in this action. This Court

denied those motions to intervene as untimely. All three of those unions ?led interlocutory

appeals with the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

On March 27, 2013, after having entered a number of orders in this action, this Court

issued an Opinion and Order Terminating Second Amended Consent Judgment and Closing this

Case. Thereafter, the City ?led an appeal. At that time, the interlocutory appeals ?led by two of

the three' labor unions who had sought to intervene in this case were still pending in the Sixth

On April 8, 2013, the Sixth Circuit reversed this Court?s denial of the motions to
intervene ?led by AF SCME Local 207 and United States v. City of Detroit, 712 F.3d
925 (6th Cir. April 8, 2013). It appears from certain language contained in the Opinion that, at
that time it was issued, the Panel may not have been aware that this Court had already closed this
case. See, e. United States v. City of Detroit, 712 F.3d at 931 (stating that ?despite signi?cant
progress? the underlying district court case ?cannot be eXpected to end any time soon?) and at
932 (stating that ?intervention can be limited on a prospective basis? allowing the unions to
participate ?in new matters? including ?participation in shaping future remedial efforts?).

In any event, the Sixth Circuit remanded for a limited grant of intervention as to
AF SCME Local 207 and In that opinion, the majority noted that interested parties
?should not be able to join at a late stage and re-litigate issues that they watched from the
sidelines.? 1d. at 932. The majority nevertheless reversed and remanded ?for a limited grant of
intervention.? In doing so, the majority stated that ?the scope ofintervention can be limited on a
prospective basis,? that the ?district court can con?ne the issues the Unions may raise, limiting
intervention to matters that are forum?appropriate? and ?[g]iven the district court?s greater
familiarly with this case and interest in managing its own docket, the district court retains broad
discretion in setting the precise scepe of intervention.? Id. at 933. The majority noted, however,
that ?the core of the Unions? purpose for intervention must be participation in shaping future
remedial efforts? and noted that ?getting all interested parties to the table promotes an effective
and fair solution.? Id. at 932?33.

This Court intended to hold a status conference with the parties, including the two

intervening unions, after issuance of the Mandate. But before the Mandate issued as to the Sixth

 LUIO LLILUI J.U F'g Ul ILJ 41003

Circuit?s April 8, 2013 decision,2 however, the City of Detroit ?led a Notice of Appeal in this
action. \(Docket Entry No. 2532).3

After the City ?led its Notice of Appeal, the City ?led for bankruptcy protection under
Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The City?s appeal was held in abeyance
pending resolution of the bankruptcy petition pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

During the City of Detroit?s bankruptcy proceedings, the Honorable Steven Rhodes
ordered the City and other parties 'to mediate issues concerning the DWSD and the potential
creation of a regional authority to manage the DWSD system. The undersigned was appointed as
the mediator of those matters.

In September of 2014, the City and the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Wayne, along with
the State of Michigan, executed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a
regional water and sewer/storm water authority to be called the Great Lakes Water Authority (the
The GLWA has since been established and it has entered into a lease agreement with
the City pertaining to the regional assets of the DWSD system. The lease agreement has been

make lease payments to the City, to be applied to either the City?s local infrastructure
improvements or the City?s share of DWSD debt service. Thus, the GLWA will operate the
main assets of the system, such as water-treatment plants and the wastewater treatment plant.
The City will only manage and operate the local water and sewer infrastructure in Detroit. The
parties anticipate that by January 1, 2016, the GLWA will be fully operational, operating and
managing the main assets of the system, and that a new, scaled-down version of the DWSD
will be operating only the local infrastructure in Detroit.

Given these changed circumstances, the City and the DWSD asked this Court to entertain
a Motion for Relief from Judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. so that this Court can
clarify the applicability of its previous Orders in this case to the City?s new local retail water and
sewer operation. Signi?cantly, the relief requested by the included this Court ruling
that the November 4, 2011 Order would still apply prospectively. They submitted an initial
prOposed order that contained the Speci?c relief requested. (See Docket Entry No. 2559-2 at 7-


Because this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant any relief due to the City?s pending appeal
in the Sixth Circuit, the City and the DWSD asked this Court to make an indicative ruling under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. This Court issued an Order on October 14, 2015, indicating that the case
should be remanded to this Court for consideration of the requested relief. (Docket Entry No.
2563)

At roughly this same time, the Honorable Thomas J. Tucker, at this Court?s

and 2566-1).

recommendation, appointed the Honorable Victoria Roberts as a judicial mediator for the
purpose of facilitative mediation of labor relations matters regarding the Lakes
Water Authority. That order was entered in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding. In
connection with that mediation, Judge Roberts met with the and with numerous
unions, including but not limited to the three unions that are parties to this case (AFSCME
Council 25, AFSCME Local 207, and (See Ex. 1 to this Memorandum Opinion).

On October 30, 2015, the Sixth Circuit issued an Order granting a limited remand so that
this Court could consider and rule upon the Joint Motion for Relief.

Thereafter, on November 5, 2015, this Court issued an Order (Docket Entry No. 2565)
that explained the course of events and that, if any party to this case opposes
any portion of the relief requested by the City and/or the DWSD in the proposed orders
(Docket Entry Nos. 2559-2 2561-2), that party shall ?le a brief of no more than 25 pages
no later than November 23, 2015)? (Id. at 3). That order expressly noted that and
AFSCME Local 207 are now parties to this case and granted AFSCME Council 25 the right to
intervene in this case because the Court concluded that AFSCME Council 25 should also have an
opportunity to voice any objections to the relief requested by the and/or to propose
alternative relief.

Thus, mindful of the Sixth Circuit?s observation that ?getting all interested parties
to the table promotes an effective and fair solution,? this Court allowed AFSCME Council
25 to intervene, and also expressly gave AFSCME Local 207 and an opportunity to

voice any objections to the relief requested by the CitleWSD and/or to propose alternative

Notably, however, the only party that ?led any objections to any of the relief requested by

In the mediation, Judge Roberts spent a tremendous amount of time with the 
and the various unions whose members include employees of the DWSD, over the course of
several weeks. With the patient guidance of Judge Roberts, the and AFSCME
Council 25 and AFSCME Local 207 were able to resolve a wide ranges of disputes, including but
not limited to di5putes over any labor mandates that should apply prospectively in this case.

The and AFSCME Council 25 and AFSCME Local 207 ultimately agreed to
a Stipulated Order Regarding Labor Matters which was entered by this Court on December 14,

With no other party having voiced any objection to any of the provisions in the
requested order, and the Court having reviewed the proposed order and ?nding its terms to be
necessary and appropriate, this Court issued the Order on December 15, 2015.

Having reviewed that Stipulated Order Regarding Labor Matters, having reviewed all
?lings by the and AFSCME, and having not heard from any other party in this
action as to any modifications of this Court?s November 4'h Labor Mandates that should be
applied prospectively, the Court hereby ORDERS the following:

The Court ORDERS the following as its 2015 Labor Mandates that shall apply
prospectively to the and any labor unions that were not a party to the December 14,
2015 Stipulated Order Regarding Labor Matters:

1. DWSD, with the input and advice of any or all
involved/affected unions, must establish training or apprentice
programs.

2. If the City of Detroit should choose to implement furlough
days for its employees in the future, whether DWSD implements
them for DWSD employees will be the subject of bargaining with its
involved/affected unions.

3. The DWSD shall act on behalf of the City of Detroit to have
its own Collective Bargaining Agreements that cover DWSD
employees DWSD CBAs shall not include
employees of any other City of Detroit departments. No DWSD
CBAs will become effective priorto Board of Water Commissioners?
approval.

4. DWSD, in its reasonable discretion and consistent with its
operational needs and staf?ng requirements, may allow employees
displaced from other City of Detroit departments to bump into
DWSD, and exercise their seniority rights in their union. These
employees can diSplace the least senior employee in a related lower
classi?cation requiring similar job skills, provided the employee can
perform the duties of the new position as reasonably determined by

10

d: I (-CV-liiUU-bl?b LJOC FF 43/6 l?lleCl .Ld/ib/ib Hg OT .L4 Pg IL) (1/644

DWSD. In addition, employees seeking to bump must have the
necessary skills, training, education, performance, attendance,
expertise, competency, certi?cations, licensing and ability to perform
the job, as determined by DWSD in its reasonable discretion and
consistent with its operational needs. Bumping must permit (or not
interfere with) compliance with applicable state and federal
environmental and other laws. Bumps must be done without loss of
city-wide seniority.

5. DWSD management must be able to explore all available
means and methods to achieve compliance with its National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System Permit permit and the
Clean Water Act. Thus, if DWSD intends to outsource work
currently performed by DWSD union-represented employees, the
current provisions in existing CBAs will apply. In situations where
no CBAs exist as of the date of this Order, DWSD should provide
timely notice to the affected unions of its intent to outsource or
subcontract. If a union wishes to have an opportunity to perform
work for which subcontracting bids are sought, any union may submit
a proposal to Director on a timely basis, proposing that
Unions perform the same work instead of it being outsourced.
Contractor and unionproposals must be evaluated by the same.
quali?cations and quality standards. The DWSD shall retain the
work with the union if the union proposal demonstrates that: 
members of the collective bargaining unit have the necessary skill,
expertise and experience to perform the work; members can
perform the work in a manner that permits (or does not interfere with)
the compliance with state and federal environmental and
other applicable laws; the cost of the union proposal is reasonably
close to the lowest bid from contractors; and its proposal
reasonably addresses the work that needs to be done. Taking these
considerations into account, DWSD will make the ?nal decision
concerning what competitive proposal[s] to accept.

duties, labor management meetings, Special conferences, grievance
processing and investigation (up to and including arbitration), and
negotiating collective bargaining agreements. In deciding whether to
grant or deny requests, supervisors may take into account 
Operational needs and need to comply with applicable state and
federal environmental and other laws. Supervisors must be
reasonable in granting or denying such requests, and must do so in

11

 LJUU LOIS .LAILOILD Hg .Ld Ul Hg ILJ 4/640

writing. Excused hours for these purposes will be part of the Union
of?cial?s paid work day.

7. DWSD CBAs shall include a (2) two year period pertaining
to discipline actions.

8. DWSD retains the ability to reduce employee classi?cations
in order to increase workforce ?exibility, based on operational needs.

9. DWSD has the right to promote employees, in its reasonable
discretion, taking into account skill, knowledge, ability, training,
education, seniority, expertise, performance, attendance and
discipline history.

10. Past practices on operational issues shall not limit operational
changes initiated by management with respect to DWSD CBAs.
Although efforts have been made to address past practices, vestiges
of past practices may still exist. The Court?s intention is that past
practices not impede the future operation of DWSD and that intention
is expressed in this paragraph.

11. The Court prohibits any CBA from containing provisibns
which prevent management from exercising reasonable discretion to
assign overtime work to employees mo$t capable of performing the
necessary work within a classi?cation. DWSD CBAs must provide
that management has the reasonable discretion to assign overtime
work to employees most capable of performing the necessary work
within a classi?cation, consistent with operational needs.

12. Any existing work rules, written or unwritten, or past
practices that are contrary to these changes are hereby terminated. It
may be the case that current contracts still contain provisions
prohibited by this mandate. It may also be the case that past practices
unwritten are still being engaged in. This paragraph addresses the
intention that this Order will override anything to the contrary.

13. This Court previously enjoined the Wayne County Circuit
Court and Michigan Employment Relations Commission 
from exercising jurisdiction over the changes ordered by the Court.
These changes are certain provisions of the November 4, 2011,
October 5, 2012, December 14, 2012, and March 27, 2013 Orders,
and are referred to as Labor Orders. This injunction is modified as
follows:

12

LI LJUU 4016 Hg .LJ Ul Pg ((640

Except as provided in this Order, labor claims ?led or
later ?led that challenge actions of DWSD which were
ordered or speci?cally permitted by the Labor Orders, are
permanently enjoined unless dismissed with prejudice by the
parties.

Upon execution of this Order, the injunction
previously issued is modi?ed to returnjurisdiction to Wayne
County Circuit Court, MERC and grievance arbitrators for
those claims challenging DWSD actions which were neither
ordered nor speci?cally permitted by Labor Orders. These
labor claims may proceed whether ?led before or after this
Order?s date.

There are also certain pending claims where the
parties disagree as to whether or not actions, which
were challenged with such claims, were ordered or
speci?cally permitted to be taken by the Labor Orders. For
such claims, the tribunal where the matter is pending will
decide whether actions were ordered by Labor
Orders. This shall occur also for claims yet to be ?led.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that while DWSD is a unitary department of the City
of Detroit, the DWSD Human Resource division may continue its autonomous administrative
structure, meaning that the division must report to the Director of DWSD and shall not have
any reporting requirements to the similar function of the City of Detroit. Further, DWSD is
not bound by Section 6-405 of the City?s Charter, which outlines the City Civil Service
Commission.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these above-quoted Labor Mandates and above
rulings are the entire sum and substance of all labor or union employment rulings which will

govern DWSD henceforth, as orders from this Court. These 2015 Labor Mandates and this

Opinion and Order replace the November 4, 2011 Order and its attachments, which are

13

 led l?lleO .LA/iD/ib Pg .L4 0114 HQ IL) 4/64!

prospectively null and void due to their replacement with this Order, yet remain the historical
law of the case retroactively. Additionally, those Orders issued from this Court which
concern labor or union employment matters at DWSD are hereby null and void prospectively
and are replaced by this Order. Those Orders remain the historical law of the case
retroactively. This includes but is not limited to: the November 4, 2011 Order and
attachments, the August 23, 2012 Order, the October 5, 2012 Order, the December 14, 2012
Order, the January 30, 2013 Order, and the March 27, 2013 Order.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any party to this litigation may seek relief
from this Court to request modi?cations of the 2015 Labor Mandates, starting one year
after entry of this Order, and for as long as the 2015 Labor Mandates are in effect. This
Court will grant modi?cation if there is not a demonstrable need for the continuation of
the mandate(s) at issue.

IT IS FINALLY ORDERED, that, with the entry of the December 14, 2015
Stipulated Order Regarding Labor Mandates, and the December 15, 2015 Order, and the
issuance of this Opinion Order, this Court has resolved the pending motion. The Court

directs the City, pursuant to Docket Entry No. 2564, to advise the Sixth Circuit that this

Court has decided the motion.
