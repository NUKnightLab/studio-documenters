This increase will support the Zoo’s submitted 2018 Budget proposal. On 4/6/1987 an agreement between

given day and may establish other rules and regulations that reasonably ensure public safety, accessibility,
and convenience, including but not limited to standards of conduct and supervision. Said Zoological Park
shall be free to the public without payment of any general admission fee or gratuity for a period equivalent
to 52 days each year. The Society may otherwise charge an admission fee to said Park not exceeding
