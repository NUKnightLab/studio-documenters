neighborhood, may grant special permits for the remodeling of existing dwelling houses or
the erection of row houses to provide for more than two dwelling units but not more than
six dwelling units in each building, provide that: (1) The square feet of lot area to be
allotted to each dwelling unit is in accordance with the area regulations included in Chapter
355: (2) The dwelling units to be created will be not smaller than two rooms and a
bathroom; (3) There will be no exterior evidence that a remodeled dwelling house is
occupied by more than two families, except such as may be permitted by the Board. The
square footage of lot area to be allotted to each dwelling unit is not in accordance with the
area regulations of Chapter 355. Per Section 355.04, in a “B” area district, the minimum lot
area per dwelling unit is 2,400 square feet therefore a 7,200 square foot lot is required and
