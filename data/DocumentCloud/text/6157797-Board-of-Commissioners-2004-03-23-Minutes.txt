Sec. 15-3. Findings.
The Cook County Board hereby finds that:
1. Inappropriate use of the flood plain and development have increased flood risk, flood damage, and
environmental degradation; and
2. It is necessary to consider stormwater management on a watershed basis; and
3. Cook County drains poorly because of flat topography and soils of low permeability; and
4. The costs of increasing channel capacity are prohibitive and
5. Many land development practices upset the natural hydrologic balance of Cook County streams; and
6. Most flood damage occurs to structures developed adjacent to streams in the flood plain or floodway;
and
7. Wetlands represent a significant portion of the natural watershed storage in Cook County, and wetlands
play an essential role in flood storage, conveyance, sediment control, and water quality enhancement; and
8. Many stormwater management fac ilities are not adequately maintained; and
9. The authority for control of storm water facilities is widely distributed to many entities in Cook County;
and
10. There are many strong local stormwater management programs; and
11. Inconsistent enforcement of storrnwater regulations contributes to the extent and severity of flood
damage.

Sec. 15-4. Purposes of this Ordinance.
1. The principal purpose of this Ordinance is to promote effective, equitable, acceptable, and legal
storm water management measures. Other purposes of this Ordinance include:
a. Managing and mitigating the effects of urbanization on stormwater drainage throughout Cook County;
and
b. Reducing the existing potential for stormwater damage to public health, safety, life, and property; and
c. Protecting human life and health from the hazards of flooding and degradation of water quality; and
d. Protecting and enhancing the quality, quantity, and availability of surface and groundwater resources;

2. The purposes of this Ordinance are consistent with the Plan.
3. The purposes of this Ordinance will be implemented by its provisions.

Sec. 15-5. Reference to Watershed Plans.

procedure. This procedure shall be conducted in accordance with the current Federal wetland delineation
methodology authorized under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. A written wetland
delineation/evaluation report shall be prepared in compliance with all methodologies and definitions set
forth in this Ordinance or the applicable waiver community ordinance.
2. The approximate location, extent, and relative quality of off- site wetlands contiguous to the
development shall be identified. The location and extent of contiguous off-site wetlands shall be
determined by using the first of the following documents or procedures pertaining at the time of
development:
a. Site specific delineation according to the procedures specified in the Plan and the Federal Manual for
Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands. If such delineation is not available, use Paragraph (b)
below.
b. Wetlands identified in Watershed Plans. If such plans are not available, use Paragraph (c) below.
c. Wetlands identified in Interim Watershed Plans. If such plans are not avai lable, use Paragraph (d)
below.
d. Wetlands identified in the Soil Conservation Service Wetlands Inventory Maps.
3. Wetlands shall be classified as either critical or regulatory wetlands based on the assessment of the
following functions and values. Critical wetlands, because of their sizes, configurations, vegetation, soils,

maintaining or enhancing water quality, and providing habitat for threatened or endangered species.
Critical wetland status shall be assigned to those wetlands that have been determined to satisfy one or
more of the following:
a. The wetland is identified as a critical wetland in the County's wetland inventory, as an ADID wetland,
or as part of an Illinois Natural Areas Inventory (INAJ) site; or
b. The wetland is known to possess a Federal or State listed threatened or endangered species using the
methods found in the Illinois Department of Conservation's 'Guidebook for Endangered Species
Inventories", or Illinoi s Department of Conservation has record of their presence within the last three (3)
years; or

seep, streamside marsh, or wet prairie; or
d. the plant community within the wetland is determined to have a mean rated quality (MRQ) of 3.5 or
higher during a single season assessment, or alternatively a natural area rating index (NARI) value of
35.0 or higher during a spring, summer, and fall assessment, as calculated by the Swink & Wilhelm
methodology. If both methods are perfonned, the NARI value shall prevail as the determining value; or
e. The initial wildlife quality value using the Modified Michigan Department of Natural Resources
Method is 5.0 or higher, or alternatively the mean rated wildlife quality (MWRQ) is determined to be 8.0
or higher, as calculated by the Ludwig wildlife habitat evaluation methodology. If both methods are
performed, the Ludwig value shall prevail as the determining value; or
f. The ratio of stormwater storage volume available at the base flood elevation to tributary basin runoff
volume to the wetland is 25% or greater, or alternatively using a method described in Section 15-1 14.3 or
Section 15-114.4, the loss of wetland storage causes adverse offsite impacts that cannot be mitigated in
accordance with Section 15-113 and Section 15-13 3. If both methods are performed, the methods
described in Section 15-114 shall prevail as the determining value; or

35

necessary, upon consultation with outside wetland authorities.
Sec. 15-135. Requirements for Development Affecting the Function and Values of Wetlands.
I. Development within or affecting critical wetlands shall be prohibited, unless documentation is
submitted that conclusively proves that the presence of critical wetlands precludes a ll economic use of the
entire parcel, and that no practicable a lternative to wetland modification exists. Based upon a review of
the submitted documentation, and any other available resources, the Director, or the Administrator in a
complete waiver community, will make a determination as to whether the proposed critical wetland
modification represents the least amount of wetland impact required to restore an economic use to the
upland portion of the parcel, and whether a pennit should be granted.
2. Development within or affecting regulatory wetl ands shall be prohibited unless documentation is
submitted that conclusively proves that no practicable alternative to wetland modification exists. Based
upon a review of the submitted documentation, and other available resources, the Director, or the
Administrator in a complete waiver comniunity, will make a determination as to whether the proposed
wetland modi fica tions will be permitted.
3. Development will be permitted onl y when the proposed direct environmenta l impacts to on-site
wetlands, and indirect environmental impacts to off-site wetlands, can be sufficiently evaluated,
minimized, and mitigated, as specified in this Section 15- 135.
4. Mitigation for developments within or affecting a wetland shall provide fo r the replacement of the
wetland environment lost to development at a minimum proportional rate of three to one (3 : 1) fo r critica l
wetlands where critical for wetland environments as defined in sections 15-134.3.b,c, & d, and one and one
half to one ( 1.5 : 1.0) for regulatory wetlands. The mitigated wetland s shall be designed to duplicate or

an existing wetland contiguous to a proposed regulatory wetland mitigation site to be enhanced in
exchange for a partial reduction in the mitigation area required. In no case shall there be a loss of wetland
function and value. The area of creation of new wetland to compensate for unavoidable wetland loss shall
not be allowed to fall below a one to one ratio.
10. Development in or affecting a wetland environment shall be initiated only after a mitigation plan has
been approved and adequate securities are provided as specified in Article I 3 of this Ordinance.
11. The designs and analyses of all wetland mitigation measures shall meet the standards of the Plan and
shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations regarding wetland impact and
mitigation.
12. The Director, or the Administrator in a complete waiver community, shall require that the developer
or owner provide the County or the waiver community with periodic monitoring reports on the status of
the constructed mitigation measures, and further may require the developer or owner to undertake
remedial action to bring the area into compliance with the mitigation plan.
I 3. Mitigation for development within or affecting a wetland begun prior to issuance of a stormwater
permit, or other unauthorized impact to a wetland, shall presume the wetland disturbed was a critical
wetland requiring mitigation at a minimum rate of three to one (3: l ).

14. To the extent practicable, development within 50 feet of a wetland shall not, without mitigation:
a. Adversely change the quantity, quality, or temporal and areal distribution of flow s entering any
adjacent wetlands or waters; nor
b. Destroy or damage vegetation that stabilizes wetland fringe areas or provides overland flow filtration to
wetlands; nor
c . Adversely affect any ground water infiltration functions.
Sec. 15-136. Wetland Banking.
1. Where development affecting wetland meets the requirements of Section 15- I 35 and the long term
preservation of existing wetland functions or characteristics is unlikely as a result of existing or proposed
land use practices in adjacent upland areas, then the Director or the Administrator may provide that
mitigation for development within or affecting wetlands be accomplished wholly or in part through
investment in an established wetland banking project in lieu of constructing new wetlands.
2. Such wetland banking shall be allowed only if no long term net loss of wetlands results within each
watershed planning area as defined in Section 15-135.5 and if the adverse impacts of development in
regulatory or critical wetlands are fully mitigated.
3. Wetland banking for development impacts within a critical or regulatory wetland shall take place
within an established wetland banking project approved by the Committee, or the Oversight Committee in
a complete waiver community, and shall:
a. Include a wetland enhancement, restoration, and construction plan approved by the Committee and the
County Board, or by the Oversight Committee and the corporate authorities in a waiver community; and
b. Include a capital improvements plan containing an estimate of the total per acre cost of wetland
mitigation, including operation and maintenance costs; and
c. Include a formula to determine that any investment in a wetland bank shall be at least equal to the cost
of planning, acquiring of lands, constructing, operating, and maintaining mitigated wetlands of equivalent
or greater functional value than those lost to development.

37

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

4. If development impacts to a wetland meets all the conditions for mitigation in a wetland banking
project, a payment may be made into the wetland banking program and shall be determined by
multiplying the acres of required mitigation times the first of the following applicable costs:
a. The investment cost of the closest wetland banking project to the development that is in the watershed
planning area that has the greatest wetland deficit, as defined in Section 15-136.4.c; or
b. The investment cost of the closest wetland banking project within the same watershed planning area as
the proposed wetland impact; or
a. The investment cost of the closest wetland bank to the development that is outside the watershed
planning area where the development is proposed. However, the area of mitigation available within a
wetland banking project for mitigation from outside the watershed planning area shall not exceed 15% of
the bank 's total wetland area. This amount of wetland mitigation is considered a wetland deficit in the
watershed planning area where the development occurs. The watershed planning area that receives the
wetland mitigation shall pay back the wetland deficit in accordance with Section 15- 136.4.a.
5. If development impacts to a wetland meet all the conditions for mitigation in the wetland banking pro
wetland impacts are under the threshold requiring compensatory mitigation in accordance with current
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Chicago District Regional Permit Program, and there is not a wetland
banking project available per Section 15-136.4, a payment may be made to the County equal to $ 175,000
per acre of required mitigation.
6. All finds deposited in the wetland banking program shall be maintained in accounts designated solely
for a particular wetland banking project or in a wetland bank suspense account if collected under Section
15-136 At the option of the Director, or the Administrator of a full waiver community, funds may be
transferred to the account of another wetland banking project in the same watershed planning area, or if
one is not available, in an off-site mitigation area meeting the requirements in section 15- 135, if that
particular wetland banking project is not construct within I 0 years after the date on which such fund s
were deposited. Upon approval of a wetland banking project within a watershed planning area for which
payments have been deposited in accordance with Section 15-136.5, such payments shall be immediately
transferred into that wetland banking project. Any portion of the payment paid in excess of the actual fee
established for sa id wetland banking project shall be refunded to the then current property owner or
his/her/its designee.
7. The County Board or the corporate authorities in a waiver community shall audit annually all funds
deposited in wetland banking accounts and shall account for such funds on a first-in, first-out basis.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ADT Security Services,
Inc., Oak Brook, Illinoi s, for project support to maintain the electronic monitoring equipment used by the
Cook County Sheriff's Office. ADT Security Services, Inc. has been the sole source provider for this
support s ince the system was purchased from ADT in 1999. Project support includes maintenance of the
host processors and home monitor/receiver units (HMRUS) and transmitters, training of new officers and
the resupply of all consumable items.
Reason:

ADT Security Services, Inc. (formerly Security Link from Ameritech) is the only company in
North America that can provide support for the ELMO-TECH equipment. None of the
consumable items are available through commercial means. Also, no other company in North
America distributes the EMS 2000JU equipment. Therefore, ADT Security Services, Inc. is
the on ly known company that can provide support.

I hereby request that the above contracts be terminated by the County. Further, in order to ensure that the

arrangements are recommended to fulfill the requirements which were procured through these contracts.

First, with regard to a number of the contracts, relatively small procurements under ($25,000) remain to

ana lyzers); 03-72-23 1 (customized vascular garments); 03-73-258 (occupational therapy supplies); 04-7211 3 (posterior and anterior intraocular lenses); and 03-72-748 (radiopharmaceuticals) meet significant
ongoing needs of the Bureau of Health Services and your consideration of alternative arrangements is
required in order to meet these needs.
With respect to Contract Number 01-73-930, the Bureau of Health Services is requesting that the
remaining period covered by thi s contract be entered into directly with the manufacturer, Olympus
America, Inc., in order to permit the Bureau of Health Services to continue to receive supplies for, and to
continue utilizing, the Olympus chemical analyzers which were suppl ied under the Ravenswood Medical
Resources Corporation contract and which are heavily relied upon at Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
With respect to Contract Numbers 03-72-23 1, 03-73-258, 04-72-113 and 03-72-748, the Bureau of Health
Services is requesting that the Board authorize the award of contracts to the next lowest bidders meeting
specifications. Each of these bidders has indicated its willingness to stand by their origina l bid prices
with respect to a contract award for a full contract term.
Note: See related item "Termination of Contracts and Request to Enter Into New Contracts" listed under

The property is currently vacant, and has been vacant since 1998. The site was previously home to the
Arrow Garage Company and had a small office building and several sample garages, but had ceased
operations. The Village recei ved a court order to demolish the structures and did so in 1998. The
property is subject to dumping of debris, overgrown weeds, and is used by some vehicles as a short cut to
go from Butterfie ld Road to Washington Boulevard. The Village of Hillside now desires to own the
property so that the village can clean it up, landscape it, and stop the cut through traffic.

ITEM #3
Senate Bill 2112

Chairman Daley stated the meeting is being held for informational purposes, and to seek public testimony
relative to the proposals before the committee today, namely the proposed ordinances from
Commissioners C laypool and Maldonado, as well as Senate Bill 2 11 2.
Commi ssioner Suffredin noted that certain bills currently before the Illinois General Assembly will affect
the taxpayers of Cook County. He stated that the purpose of today's meeting is to form a consensus on
both the Mayor's bill and the County Assessor's bill.

126

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23 , 2004

Commissioner Claypool stated that he hoped that changes in assessment could be affected so that
assessments do not increase substantially this fall. He stated that both amendments have a broad crosssection of support by the County Board. He stated that he is hopeful that the General Assembly will
address this problem and obviate the need for the two bill s. He also stated that it is the goal of the Board
to merge the two existing proposals in order to both expand the base of eligibility and devise a means test
or some similar device to target the neediest. He further stated that the proposal before the Board, while
not as deep or broad as the bills before the Illinois General Assembly, can blunt the impact of increased
assessments.
Commissioner Maldonado voiced his support for pending Senate Bill 1498. He stated the need to
pressure the General Assembly to pass the 7% yearly assessment cap for homeowners who have owned
their home for over one year. He noted that Senate Bill 1498 would not contradict the ordinances before
the County Board. Commissioner Maldonado stated that assessment rel ief should be means tested. He
noted that, so far, approximately twenty-eight to thirty thousand homeowners have received help from the
Assessor through the existing Longtime Homeowner Exemption Ordinance; these homeowners will not
be penalized and will be reassessed at the correct level. He noted the need to work more aggressively
with the Assessor's Office.
Commissioner Hansen voiced the concern that any legislation should include a means test, so that tax
relief is given to those who truly need it. In response to Comm issioner Hansen' s question as to the
difference between Communication Numbers 264015 and 264018, Chairman Daley responded that the
two ordinances are working documents, and there would be a synthesis of the two presented at a later
date.
Commissioner Hansen voiced the concern that the large triennial tax increases on city homeowners
(increases ranging from 15% to 161 %) might indicate that substantial increases in the suburban areas are
pending. He also voiced concern that tax relief under one classification might shift the tax burden to
another classification; and further voiced concern as to how the levies would be redistributed.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

Your Committee has met to discuss President Stroger' s proposed legislative agenda and to receive an
update from the County's lobbying team directed by Tim Casey, Director of the Intergovernmental
Affairs Office.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the commissioners w ill not be taking any action today, but will be
discussing the issues that are currentl y pending before the Illinois General Assembly.
Chairman Suffredin stated that he had asked Frank Bass, Legislative Liaison, Office of the President,
Eugene Barnes, and Stephen Morrill, contractual lobbyists for Cook County to address the Committee.
Further he stated that Mr. Casey was not able to attend today's meeting due to a previous engagement.
Commissioner Hansen asked when the committee will act on the legislation it has recommended to the
Cook County Board.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the General Assembly is currently in a recess until March 23 , 2004. He
stated that hopefully after today's discuss ion the County will be able to figure out the areas it needs to
take a positi on on, and the Committee wi ll meet on or before the March 23, 2004 Cook County Board
Meeting. Chainnan Suffredin further stated that a number of resolutions that were introduced at today's
Board meeting were referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Re lations Committee.
Chairman Suffredin called on Frank Bass, Legislative Liaison, Office of the President.
Mr. Bass stated that the commissioners had rece ived a copy of the President's Legislati ve Agenda. Mr.
Bass give a brief exp lanation of each item on the agenda.
Chairman Suffredin asked Mr. Bass if currently there 1s a bill making its way through the General
Assembly that deals with the Tuberculosis District.
Mr. Bass responded in the affirmative.
C hairman Suffredin stated, in reference to the issue of the appointment of the Cook County Board
President to the Criminal Justice Information Authority, that he believes that the leaders of both houses
and the Governor's Offi ce are in agreement. Chairman Suffredin stated that President Stroger has said
that the reason for this is that the State' s Attorney, the Sheriff and the C lerk of the Circuit Court are on
this and receive certain grants, but many of the grants impose a financial burden on Cook County.
President Stroger's belief is that if the Pres ident's Office is represented, the County may be able to
reshape the grants or find that there are other resources avai lable to deal w ith the burden.
Mr. Bass responded in the affi rmati ve.
Chairman Suffredin stated that there is no bill number, but the speaker is hoping that it could be added at
the end of the session as an amendment to the Budget Implementation Act.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Mr. Barnes stated that during the past week he attended a meeting in the Speaker's Office regarding any
action that would be taken relative to Cook County matters. He stated that most of the ideas were
presented earlier to the Leadership and General Assembly. The Leadership and General Assembly have
filed many shell bills. He further stated that some of the ideas might move at the end of the session as
previously stated by Chairman Suffredin. The Speaker' s opinion was that they might not deal with that
issue during this General Assembly, but it could be dealt with in the future in concurrence with the
Governors office. Further, Mr. Barnes stated in terms of the Dissolution of the TB District, there are two
bills; they are both shell bills. He stated that Senator Harmon has one bill in the Senate, Senate Bill 2200
which is a shell bill; Kevin Joyce has a bill in the House, House Bill 40 17 which is also a shell bill.
In regards to the RTA appointments the Speaker's position was that there was a commission that was
adopted in the last session that has a reporting date of sometime this April or thereafter.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked if Senate Bill 2200 has language.
Mr. Barnes stated there is no language at this time; it is on second reading in the Senate and it is a shell
bill.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the County's Health Department, Mr. Bass, Mr. Morrill and Mr. Barnes
have been meeting with the Senate and House staff regarding the language of an amendment, and he
believes that there is a draft amendment as to what form Senate Bill 2200 will take. Chairman Suffredin
stated that the deadlines for passing the Bills out of the House and Senate will be after the General
Assembly goes back on March 23, 2004.
Commissioner Collins asked if Senate Bill 2200 originated as a bi ll to do what the County expects it to
do.
Mr. Barnes stated that originally Senate Bill 2200 was introduced by Senator Cullerton. In discussion
with the Leadership and the caucus, Senator Cullerton indicated that he had passed that bill to Senator
Harmon because of the limitations that had been put on each one of the legislators relative to what bills
they could move. Senator Harmon accepted the bill and the discussions that are happening with all the
various entities. Senator Harmon indicated that he would follow what was being done in the Ho use.
Therefore, when the bill was called in committee he took out all of the previous language that had been in
the bill and made it into a vehicle bill.
Commissioner Collins asked if there was an agenda available that showed live bills.
Mr. Barnes stated that as of last Thursday all of the items on today 's agenda were being discussed, put
forward, and that the lobbyi sts are working with the staff on putting together the necessary amendments
for when the General Assembly returns on March 23, 2004.
Mr. Barnes stated that regarding gaming, this was established over a year ago in language in the statute
which allows Cook County to receive a certain percentage of revenue from any future gaming activity.
Commissioner Collins asked if there was an agenda for all the Cook County initiatives in the General
Assembly that shows the positives as well as the negatives that the County doesn' t want to pass.
Mr. Barnes stated that there is no agenda. Further he stated that each week before going to Springfield
they would meet to review and discuss all of the proposed legislation that the County is aware of and ask
each one of the entities to provide them with information relative to any proposed activity that they
anticipate during that particular week.

173

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Commissioner Collins asked how the commissioners rece ive a copy of the " list.'"
Chairman Suffredin stated that Mr. Casey sent out a memo to everyone that included a list of 86 Senate
Bills and 137 House Bills that are being monitoring. Chainnan Suffredin stated the one bill that they are
prepared to talk about, comes from another constitutional officer and is Senate Bill 1498 which 1s
Assessor Houlihan ' s proposal which is being discussed in the Finance Committee on March I 0, 2004.
In response to Commissioner Murphy 's question regarding the tenth gaming license, Stephen Morrill,
Cook County Lobbyist, stated that the Bill that moved the tenth license to Rosemont does contain
language that gives Cook County 2% adjusted gross revenue. Mr. Morrill stated that the irony is that if
that license is awarded ultimately to Waukegan in Lake County, Cook County would still receive the 2%
adjusted gross revenue. In conclusion, he stated that the gaming item is basically being monitored by the
lobbyists for any gambling expansion and certain legislation.
Commissioner Murphy asked if all of the race tracks would be grandfathered into the bill.
Mr. Morrill stated the way that gaming works is that it's always a big package and it doesn't disallow any
existing operations. It may affect how their taxes work for example, but that is what our agenda would be
if the County would have an opportunity in that package; then the lobbyists would put a revenue source
for Cook County.
Comm issioner Peraica asked if Mr. Barnes, Mr. Morrill and Mr. Bass work together.
Mr. Barnes stated that they work together completely. He stated that they intend to cooperate with the
other representatives of the other constitutional offices.
In regards to Commissioner Peraica 's question regarding Mr. Houlihan' s 7% proposal, Mr. Barnes stated
that they have not been given any direction as whether to oppose or support it.
Commissioner Peraica stated that even though Cook County will be losing revenue as a result of the 7%
cap Cook County is not taking any pos ition if it's enacted.
Mr. Morrill stated that the lobbyists do work together and in fact have slipped in committee that bill in
support along with the Assessor. Mr. Morrill stated that it is his understanding that it doesn' t affect the
levy, but rather the reassessment levels. Further, Mr. Morrill stated that it wou ld not cost the County
money. It might have an effect on who bears relatively more or less of the burden: commercial,
residential or industrial.
Mr. Morrill stated that Mr. Casey helps hold together the teams. Everyday he is in contact with his
counterparts at the Sheriff's Office, Assessors Office, State's Attorney's Office and even with the City of
Chicago, who the County works very closely with.
In response to Commiss ioner Peraica's question regarding the Telecommunications Tax, Mr. Morrill
stated that it would not be a tax; it would only put Cook County as the only Home Rule County in lllinois
on the same footin g as every other municipality. Further, he stated that the approach is to give pennissive
authority so as to not a lways go to property tax if there is a need.
Commissioner Peraica asked how many bills concerning the Tuberculosis District are still alive and
active.

174

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Mr. Morrill responded three bill s are still alive and they are in second reading, and also there are two bills
in rules, for a total of five bills.
Mr. Barnes stated that in speaking with the Leadership in both the House and the Senate they indicated
that they would use two vehicles, 2200 in the Senate and 4017 in the House.
Commissioner Collins asked whether Cook County is developing the amendment.
Mr. Morrill stated that the lobbyists have had extensive meetings with Senator Harmon and there is
working language and it was ready for committee before the Senate Committee deadline, but the decision
was made to move it as a shell bill to give the lobbyists more time to review.
Vice Chairman Silvestri stated that once the language is ready the lobbyists will forward the language to
the Commissioners.
Commissioner Peraica asked if Cook County is going to put together any ideas for possible amendments
to the Cook County Code, particularly with the veto override issue.
Chairman Suffredin stated that his suggestion to Commissioner Peraica would be to introduce a resolution
and bring it before the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee and vote on it.
Commissioner Collins stated that she has a problem with being this late in the session and everything in
committee being a shell bill.
Commissioner Collins asked if Administrative Adjudication is a shell bill.
Mr. Barnes stated that they met with the Speaker in regards to Administrative Adjudication, and the
Speaker directed his Chief of Staff to research it and not introduce a bill on this item. Speaker Madigan
directed his Chief of Staff to have this reviewed for him between last week and March 23 when session
begins. Then a decision will be made whether or not an amendment would be drafted in order to be put
into a bill.

Mr. Barnes stated that during this session the leadership in both houses (Republican and Democratic) fi led
shell bills virtually on everything that is in the statute. Then in their meetings they came to how they
would handle legislation in the spring session.
Commissioner Collins stated that she is concerned with the process.
Mr. Barnes stated that the lobbyi sts brought the concern to the attention of the leadership, but the
lobbyists work within the framework of what that leadership puts out for its membership.
Chairman Suffredin stated that he plans on having a Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations meeting
on March 23, 2004 before the next Cook County Board meeting, and at that time they would consider the
appointment to the Sheriff's Prisoner Review Board and the contracts for the County Clerk's and
Recorder of Deeds lobbyists. Further, Chairman Suffredin stated that there is a resolution on House Bill
4100.

Vice Chairman Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Collins. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned unanimously.

177

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Mr. Neese stated that it would depend on the Cook County C lerk' s Office' s needs, and that it is hard to

NOTE:

This item was deferred at the January 22, 2004 Board Meeting.

*Referred to the Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations on
03/09/04.
Chairman Suffredin asked Darlena Williams-Burnett, Chief Deputy Recorder, to give the committee a
brief explanation regarding the contract with Fletcher, Topol, O'Brien and Kasper, P.C.
Commissioner Daley asked whether the lobbyists for the Recorder's Office work together with the Cook
County lobbyists.
Mrs. Williams-Burnett stated that the Recorder's Office does inform their consultants who the consultants
are for the Cook County Board. She stated that they are advised regarding legis lation that the Recorder's
Office is opposed to and also consu lt with the President's Office.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked whether it would be a problem for the Legislation and Intergovernmental
Relations Committee to receive a copy of the weekly report that is issued by Fletcher, Topol, O ' Brien and
Kasper, P.C.
Mrs. Williams-Burnett responded that it would not be a problem.
Vice Chairman Silvestri suggested to the Chairman that all of the lobbyists should submit a copy of their
reports to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee.
Chairman Suffredin stated that he would write to each of the offices requesting cop ies of the reports.
Commissioner Gorman asked how soon the Commissioners would be receiving the reports.
Chairman Suffredin stated that he would request them immediately.
Commissioner Sims stated that she would like to find out whether receiving the reports every week or
once a month is a reasonable time frame.
Chairman Suffredin stated that it depends on how they are requested to report under their contracts.
Commissioner Collins stated that the Board needs to stop opposing initiatives put forward in the General
Assembly. Commissioner Collins further noted that it causes confusion if everyone is not on the same
page.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the only way to avoid that problem is by putting forth resolutions to the
Cook County Board; if the Board votes issues up or down, that would give direction to the lobbying team
in Springfield. Chairman Suffredin further stated that the Board needs to begin to look at bills for specific
concepts and to get input from the staff so that the County could have a unified team.
Commissioner Murphy stated that receiving the reports quarterly is not frequent enough. She suggested
that the reports should be received monthly in order for the Commissioners to be hands on.
Commissioner Peraica asked why the Recorder' s Office needs its own lobbyist.

179

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Mrs. Williams-Burnett stated that she is not suggesting that the Recorder' s Office can't use the County
lobbyists, but that in the past the lobbyists that worked for the Cook County Board followed a number of
legislative initiatives and proposals that would not benefit the Recorder's Office. Mrs. Williams-Burnett
stated that during this session and last session the Reco rder's Office had several proposed bills that would
have an impact on the Recorder's Office. Mrs. Williams-Burnett further stated that in the past they have
found that the Cook County Board lobbyists do not follow the issues that will impact the Recorder's
Office.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the Recorder's Office has asked the Cook County Board lobbyists to
follow their issues.
Mrs. Williams-Burnett stated that the Recorder' s Office does communicate with the Pres ident's Office
and the President shares with the lobbyists what issues are of concern to the Recorder' s Office, but that
the Recorder' s Office has specific lobby ists that focus only on issues that impact the Recorder's Office.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved approval of Communication
No. 264401. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica voted Nay on the above item.

SUPPORT PROGRAM
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to respect the human rights of all people, including
the right to adequate housing for all; and
WHEREAS, an affordable housing crisis exists in Cook County as evidenced by the fact that
there are 191,260 households in Cook County earning less than 30% of area median ($22,500
for a family of four) who are rent burdened, meaning they pay more than 35% of their income
for rent; and

public housing and housing choice vouchers; and
WHEREAS, HUD' s fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Cook County is $95 1.00;

$5 15.00 a month for rent; and
WHEREAS, House Bill 4100, the Rental Housing Support Program, which is currently
pending in the Illinois General Assembly, would alleviate the affordable housing crisis in
Cook County by creating a rental subsidy program for households earning less than 30% of
area median income funded by a new $ 10.00 state surcharge for the recordation of any real
estate related document and such surcharge would be evidenced upon collection by a state
seal from the Illinois Department of Revenue; and

180

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

WHEREAS, the program created by HB 4100 is modeled after a very successful program in
Chicago, the Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust Fund and the Trust Fund has been in
existence for over ten years and currently subsidizes over 2,000 units of housing in Chicago;
and
WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in an estimated $14 million to be
allocated to Chicago and Cook County housing agencies to provide rental subsidies; and
WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in at least 1,600 new units of affordable
housing in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, HB 4100, would create a new $10.00 state surcharge on real estate recordings
to fund the Rental Housing Support Program, with Cook County to receive $1.00 for every
affected filing generating an estimated $1.2 million to go directly to the County's general
revenue fund to cover the County's costs for collecting the fee created by the bill; and
WHEREAS, all of the funds generated in Cook County through the collection of the
surcharge will go to serve low income households in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Richard M. Daley and the City of Chicago are in support of HB 4100

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that the Board does hereby declare its support for House Bill 4100 and urges the members of
the 111inois General A ssembly to pass House Bill 4100, and in sequence, to urge the Governor
to sign the measure into law.

*Referred to the Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations on 3/09/04.
Vice Chairman Silvestri assumed the Chair.
Chairman Suffredin stated that an amendment was distributed to the Commissioners which is amending
the "Therefore" clause to reflect support for the concept of rental housing program and to encourage the
General Assembly to pass House Bill 4100 after adoptions of amendments as proposed by Cook County.
Further, Chairman Suffredin stated that the purpose is a technical issue that has been raised by the State 's
Attorney 's Office and others that does not affect the substance of the program but w ill answer some of the
Commissioner's questions and will put Cook County on record in favor of the program.

Chairman Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved approval of Amendment #1. The
motion carried.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the purpose of this amendment is to put the Cook County Board in favor
of a state-wide housing rental program. Chairman Suffredin stated that the County of Cook is responsible
for many social programs, including healthcare. He stated that one of the areas that the County of Cook
does not have direct responsibility for its housing. Further, Chairman Suffredin stated that this creates a
state-wide program, a pool of money to assist renters in finding adequate housing. In conclusion he stated
that the vast majority of the funds generated state-wide will deal with people in Cook County and the
collar Counties, because Cook County has the majority of people who fall 30% below the median wages
for the area.

181

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

Chairman Suffredin stated that he has a letter of support from the Illinois Association of Realtors that will
be made part of the record. (The referenced document is on file in the County C lerk's Office).
Commissioner Gorman asked how alive House Bill 4100 in Springfield is.
Chairman Suffredin stated that currently House Bill 4100 is in the House Rules Committee, but that it is
being discussed by a number of people in the House as an amendment that could be added to another bill.
Chairman Suffredin stated that what is happening with House Bill 4100 is that people have seen a need
for a housing rental program. He stated that there are 8,000 people who can not get Section 8 vouchers
within Cook County alone. Further, he stated that House Bill 4100 has been through the General
Assembly for about three years and the format was to give Cook County the most dollars and create a
process that was simple. Chairman Suffredin stated that under House Bill 4100 the County of Cook could
be the receiving agency. In conclusion, Chairman Suffredin stated that Cook County needs to go on
record as being in favor of this program.
Commissioner Daley stated that he strongly supports the ordinance as amended.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked if the amendments that are being discussed reflect an interest by Cook
County to administer the program and to receive the funds.
C hairman Suffredin made three points: I) the State's Attorney has raised a technical issue about the way
the bill is drafted, is the collection of the $ 1.00 that is a fee on a fee and it is a constitutional issue that can
be easily avoided; 2) the way the bill is put together, Cook County could become the agency that could
administer the program; and 3) Cook County need~ to be looking for the way to make this the most
efficient program possible so that Cook County can get the dollars immediately into the rental stream and
help people with housing.
Commissioner Sims asked Darlena Williams-Burnett to speak on the issue of the collection of the $ 10.00
and the position that the other Recorders throughout the State of Illinois have taken on the issue.
Mrs. Williams-Burnett stated that she would like to go on record as stating that Recorder Moore is not
opposed to any type of subsidies for low income renters. She stated that Recorder Moore does have so me
concerns with the bill as it is proposed. She stated that he has been working with the attorneys to address
these issues as well as trying to communicate with the sponsor of the bill.
Commissioner Daley distributed a second amendment to the "Therefore'· clause which incorporates the
language of Amendment # 1.
Vice Chairman Silvestri stated that the amendment reflects some concerns that some members are
addressing including the concerns of Mrs. Williams-Burnett.
Commissioner Gos lin asked if House Bill 4100 applies to every county in the State of Illinois, whether
every county would be required to put a $10.00 fee on real estate transactions.
Chairman Suffredin responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Goslin asked whether there is any provi sion that a county would be able to opt out.
Chaimrnn Suffredin responded no.

A RESOLUTION CALLING ON GOVERNOR BLAGOJEVICH AND
THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO RESTORE FULL FUNDING IN
THE 2005 FISCAL YEAR BUDGET FOR THE ILLINOIS BUREAU OF TOURISM
WHEREAS, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism (IBOT) manages industry efforts that resu lt in sustainable
and significant quality-of-life benefits for all Illinois residents; and
WHEREAS, the tourism industry in Illinois generates $38 billion in total economic impact annually as
well as 600,000 jobs. Tourism employs 1 in 10 jobs in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the $1.1 billion in state tax revenues generated by tourism amounts to 4.4% of the General
Revenue Fund operating budget which contributes to education, health care, public safety, and other
essential services; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the importance of creating a continual funding source for tourism promotion for
Illinoi s, in 1984, the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor signed legi slation that raised the
dedicated tax on hotels to 6% with the express understanding of the tourism industry that the intended use
of the tax increase was for the purpose of touri sm promotion; and
WHEREAS, tourism is the only base industry common throughout the State of Illinois and provides
revenue to all 102 counties in some fonn; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Bureau of Tourism provides unified, unbiased leadership for the industry with
the sole mission of creating economic impact through consistent, research-based and targeted marketing
to enhance Illinois' image as a world-class trave l destination; and
WHEREAS, Governor Blagojevich ' s proposed 2005 Budget eliminates 50% of funding for the Illinois
Bureau of Tourism; and
WHEREAS, a cut in marketing dollars will not only cause hotel and motel tax revenues to be lost to the
state but also will negatively affect the hotel, restaurant, attraction and supplier sectors which will result
in lost jobs; and

196

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 23, 2004

WHEREAS, this reduction in state tourism funding will have a devastating effect on Illinois' fi scal
health. The consistent generation of local option bed taxes that our rural communities rely on to support
essential city services, such as police and fire protection, would be at risk w ithout IBOT's efforts.
Taxpayers across Illinois pay less in taxes because visitors help fund state and local government services
and it has been estimated that the loss of visitor industry tax revenues would cost every Illinois fami ly of
four an additional $525.00 in taxes per year; and

WHEREAS, continuation of full base funding for the Illinois Bureau of Tourism is cri tical to the
residents of Cook County and Illinois, because the agency 's tourism promotion activities generate
irreplaceable revenues for education , health care, public safety, po lice and fire protection and other
essential services.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby call on Governor Blagojevich and the Illinois General Assembly to restore full funding to the
Illinois Bureau of Tourism in the F iscal Year 2005 Budget; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to Governor
Blagojevich, Senate President Emil Jones, Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan and the members of
the Illinois General Assembly representi ng Cook County and also be spread upon the official proceedings
of this Honorable Body.
