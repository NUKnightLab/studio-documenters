GENERAL COUNSEL’S REPORT (Cont’d)
RE:

MICHAEL PLOUFFE ASF RECOUPMENT

Motion By: Trustee Anthony – Supported By: Trustee Cetlinski
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees (the “Board” or “Board of Trustees”) of the General
Retirement System of the City of Detroit (the “Retirement System”) has determined that
the original Annuity Savings Fund (“ASF”) Recoupment calculations performed with
respect to the referenced retiree were incorrect because the calculations did not take
into account the portion of Mr. Plouffe’s ASF account balance awarded to his former
spouse, Kathleen Patrona, under an August 15, 2013 Eligible Domestic Relations Order
“EDRO”), and
WHEREAS, in light of the foregoing the Board of Trustees has requested and received
ASF Recoupment re-calculations from its actuary pertaining to the referenced retiree,
and
WHEREAS, the Board has a legal and fiduciary obligation to enforce the ASF
Recoupment provisions of the Plan of Adjustment consistent with the August 15, 2013
EDRO, and
WHEREAS, the ASF Recoupment re-calculations are consistent with the provisions of
the Eighth Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit (the “Plan of
Adjustment”) as well as the August 15, 2013 EDRO between the parties, and
WHEREAS, the Board has commenced recoupment efforts from Ms. Patrona via
monthly reduction of her pension payment from the Retirement System, and
WHEREAS, in light of the foregoing Mr. Plouffe is entitled to repayment of those
amounts attributable to his former spouse and incorrectly deducted from his ASF
account balance, therefore be it
RESOLVED, that the Board hereby approves a lump sum credit in the amount of
$48,045.10, to Mr. Plouffe’s ASF account, as soon as administratively feasible, and
further
RESOLVED, that upon its adoption Mr. Plouffe be provided with a copy of this
Resolution as notification of the credit made to his ASF account, and a copy of this
Resolution be retained for the Retirement System’s records.
