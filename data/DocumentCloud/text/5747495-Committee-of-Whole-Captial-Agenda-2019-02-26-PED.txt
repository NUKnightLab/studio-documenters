MEMORANDUM

TO: Maurice Cox, Director

Planning and Economic Development
FROM: Roy McCalister, Member

Public Health and Safety Standing Committee
DATE: February 20, 2019
RE: Opportunity Zones in the City of Detroit

 

Councilman McCalister is requesting the Flaming Department provide details as to the
potential to establish Opportunity Zones in the City of Detroit. Under the 2017 Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act Opportunity Zones were created to incentivize private investment in low-
income communities nationwide that have been cutoff from capital and experienced a
lack of business growth.

According to MSHDA, ?There are 1,152 eligible census tracts with the maximum of
25% or 288 of these tracts allowed to qualify per program rules.? Councilman McCalister
is asking for a report relative to the administration?s plans, in conjunction with Govemor
Whitmer?s of?ce, to pursue such zones in the City and where those zones would likely be
established. Additionally, if such plans have not yet been devised we request a report
regarding when and how plans for the establishment of Opportunity Zones in Detroit
might begin to be developed.

Sincerely,

Roy McCalister, Jr.
