 AGENDA ITEM #6A

Date: March 16, 2018

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager

Re:

Annual Update & Financing Strategy with PFM (Part 2 of 2)

Background: This presentation is a follow-up to the presentation given by PFM Financial Advisors
(PFM) at the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Audit Committee meeting on January 19, 2018.
GLWA is currently evaluating opportunities to better manage the existing debt portfolio and
evaluating water and sewer bond refunding opportunities during the next several months. As part
of the evaluation process, PFM is analyzing GLWA’s draft FY 2017 financial metrics in comparison
to other similar water and sewer utilities. The analysis also uses the draft FY 2017 GLWA metrics as
inputs to the Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s rating agency scorecards to demonstrate how
GLWA’s metrics align.

Analysis: The PFM presentation also identifies the yield differential for the ‘A’ and ‘AA’ categories
and the potential interest cost savings based on a hypothetical $100 million bond issuance and for a
$2 billion capital program i. As GLWA looks to increase its ratings, this yield differential related to
the ratings increase means lower interest costs on its refunding opportunities and future capital
program financings.

The draft FY 2019 and FY 2020 biennial budget and 5-year financial plan, which was presented to
the Board at its meeting on January 24, 2018 and at the February 29, 2018 public hearing, reflect no
potential refunding savings. Based upon potential refunding candidates this calendar year, and
rates and assumptions presented in the PFM analysis, GLWA could see an average annual savings of
about $2.8 million and the water system $2.7 million for the sewer system over the remaining term
of the original bonds. For this reason, the GLWA staff will present water and sewer series
ordinances for the proposed refunding bonds and related financing schedule to the Audit
Committee in April 2018.
Budget Impact: None.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.
i

Note: GLWA’s proposed FY 2019 through FY 2023 capital improvement program totals $1.3 billion with a financial
plan that contemplates up to $780 million of new bond financing.

 Key Financial Metrics for GLWA
The maintenance of key financial metrics is critically important to GLWA’s ongoing positioning for rating upgrades and
its objective of lowering GLWA’s fixed costs for both the Water and Sewer enterprises.
¥ GLWA senior lien water and sewer ratings of A3/A-/A remain among the lower quartile of utility ratings nationally
¥ GLWA continues to push forward with efforts to improve its bond ratings up to AA category ratings for both the

water and sewer sectors, recognizing that debt service (for planned new money and refinancing bonds) accounts
for almost 50% of the annual budget
¥ With the improvement in senior lien bond ratings to the AA category for water and sewer, significant reductions in

fixed cost could be achieved relative to the maintenance of current ratings
¥ GLWA has identified an initial group of peer utilities, against which it is benchmarking performance and

establishing targets for key metric of debt service coverage and liquidity to improve bond ratings
¥ GLWA is also using rating agency medians on a broader range of variables to assess the progress for the upgrade

of its senior lien bond ratings
¥ Ongoing benchmarking and continued progress in improving key financial metrics of GLWA are critical to the

achievement of lower debt service cost and a path to higher credit quality

Moody’s Investors Service

Strengths
— Very wide service area that includes a
population of 3.8 million
— Commitment to revenue enhancements will
likely support sound debt service coverage
— and healthy liquidity
— GLWA management team has implemented
operating adjustments to cut costs and
improve financial metrics, and is committed
to continuing these efforts
— Excess treatment capacity presents
management with flexibility to repurpose
facilities to achieve further operating
efficiencies

— Diverse revenue stream from a large
number of wholesale customers
— Adequate-to-good historical financial
performance, with projections that indicate
generally improving conditions
— Generally affordable rates given income
indicators for the Detroit metropolitan
statistical area
— Management policies and procedures that
we generally consider strong

— Essential service provider in expansive
service territory
— Strong rate adjustment history in support of
financial and capital needs
— Over 75% of operating revenues coming
from suburban customers with higher wealth
metrics
— All system funds and accounts are separate
and distinct Detroit funds including the city's
general fund
— Changes in rate setting practices and
reserve accumulation should help to insulate
GLWA from high city retail delinquencies

Challenges
— Declining water consumption trend High
leverage will moderate slowly given
outstanding capital improvement needs and
plans to issue debt
— High combined operating needs and fixed
costs leave little margin to miss revenue
targets
— Economic and demographic weaknesses in
portions of the service area

© PFM

— Debt load is expected to remain elevated for
— Significant economic stress in Detroit,
the foreseeable future
which could continue to place downward
— Continued annual rate adjustments are
pressure on utility collection rates
needed to meet rising debt service
— Large amount of accounts receivable and
obligations and sustain financial
high allowances for doubtful accounts
performance
— Significantly less affordable rates for
customers living in Detroit compared to
suburban residents
— System leverage that is high and unlikely to
abate significantly

 S&P Retail Water & Sewer Utility Ratings Framework
¥

S&P uses a hybrid approach to the rating process for GLWA, whereby retail metrics are considered but within
the context of the Wholesale Utility Criteria

¥

Rating caps and overriding factors are applied after initial score calculated and can result in a substantially different
final rating from initial indicative rating

¥

The weighted average of the two individual factors are rounded to the nearest whole number and the interaction
between the Enterprise Risk Profile and the Financial Risk Profile determines the initial indicative rating for the Utility
issuer (see table below)

Moody’s Water & Sewer Sector Outlook
¥

Anticipate overall stability in 2018 supported by strong rate management and liquidity

¥

Stable debt service coverage levels expected to remain in line with 2016 median of 2.1x represents solid
rate management as utilities continue to proactively adjust rates accordingly

¥

Liquidity, pivotal to the sector’s stability, will remain healthy as utilities accumulate reserves for future rate
stabilization, unexpected system shocks and capital needs

¥

Managing the relationship between system investment, financial stability and rate affordability will be key to
the sector's credit quality

¥

Incremental investment continues to lag system depreciation, evidenced by a declining trend in the median
useful life of all systems

¥

௅

Sufficient funding of system investment is becoming an increasingly important factor within the sector

௅

Declining asset conditions increases the risk of operating efficiencies, as well as malfunctions that could
lead to system interruptions and regulatory issues
Continued extreme weather events will present operating and capital challenges for utilities, but they are
largely mitigated by availability of state and federal funds

 Fitch’s Water & Sewer Sector Outlook
¥

Stable outlook, with the key factors in the sector’s performance stability being essentiality of the services,
monopolistic nature, and local rate-setting authority

¥

Fitch expects revenues will climb between 2% and 4% in 2018 based on anticipated adjustments by rated
credits, continued flat consumption patterns and improvements in economic conditions nationally, helping to
offset rising operating and debt costs and preserve good coverage and robust reserves

¥

Fitch anticipates a slight decrease in capital spending in 2018 and the years thereafter but indicates
sustained capital investment increases will be necessary to preserve service levels over the long term

¥

Growth in debt levels expected to be muted in 2018, rising 0%-3% based on planned borrowings, should
preserve the sector’s moderate debt profile

¥

With user charges continuing to outpace inflationary growth, the issue of affordability is becoming an
increasing focus among sector stakeholders and could pressure finance and debt ratios beyond the outlook
period

¥

Regulatory environment is expected to remain uncertain – the pace of new rules by the EPA is expected to
be limited in 2018, although delayed revisions to the Lead & Copper Rule could have significant implications
for water utilities

 Standard & Poor’s Water & Sewer Sector Outlook
¥ Anticipate overall stability with upgrades outpacing downgrades, and S&P believes that decisions on rates

and charges will over the long term be the main determinant of whether the sector credit quality remains
stable
¥ With nearly all operating revenues coming from local ratepayers, affordability of rates continues to be a

localized risk in a sector that retains a large need for infrastructure investment
¥ With key assets largely out of sight and out of mind to the public (in contrast to competing priorities such as

roads and airports) and mandated compliance projects often taking an outsized share of limited capital
dollars, utility managers are increasingly extending replacement cycles and deferring maintenance of
assets
S&P Credit Risks and Opportunities
Risks
•

•
•

•

Elimination of tax-exempt advance refunding transactions and the
•
FOMC’s stated intent for three hikes in the federal funds rate in 2018
could make borrowing costs higher for all and will almost surely lead
to a steep decline in total bond issuance in 2018
The gap between larger utilities (defined by the EPA as a service area •
population of over 10,000) and smaller ones is increasingly profound
As many as half of all water sector employees will be of retirement
•
age or will have retired by the end of this decade; succession
planning and mentoring could move from risk to crisis (again, with
disproportionate impacts on smaller and rural systems)
Capital expenditure dollars are limited and projects must be

prioritized. For some, the focus is on what they can afford rather than
what they need, which, in our view, introduces the risk of deferred
maintenance.

Opportunities
The fiscal 2017 federal budget included appropriations for the first
loans under the WIFIA; there are also several bills that focus on
creating federal appropriations for drinking and clean water and
stormwater
As in 2017, we do not expect major new environmental regulations in
2018, only updates on those implemented or under development
Should a new federal grant require a state match, given the relatively
low debt loads across the state sector and increasing awareness of
the need for more infrastructure investments, many states might
consider leveraging the federal grant with bond proceeds.
S&P Global Ratings' economic research states that even in a
downside scenario, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) should still
grow in 2018, at 1.6%

 AGENDA ITEM #6B

Date: March 16, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer
Re:

Update: FY 2019 – FY 2020 Biennial Budget and FY 2019 – 2023 Financial Plan

Background: On January 5, 2018 the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) was presented
with discussion draft materials for the FY 2019 – FY 2020 Biennial Budget and FY 2019 –
2023 Financial Plan. Subsequently the draft budget was presented to the GLWA Board at
its meeting on January 10, 2018. A combination of materials from both of those meetings
was presented at the Customer Outreach meeting on January 11, 2018.

On February 28, 2018, the Public Hearing was held for the FY 2019 – FY 2020 Biennial
Budget and FY 2019 Proposed Charges. At that meeting, the GLWA Staff recommended
“Scenario 2” of the charges worksheets that were presented to customers which provides a
two-year phasing of the 2017 Units of Service recommendations. The Public Hearing
remains open as there are related matters under discussion with the Detroit Water &
Sewerage Department. This discussion is intended to result in a Memorandum of
Understanding related to clarification of certain lease matters.
Analysis: Attached are materials distributed to the GLWA Board on February 28, 2018 for
review and discussion at the Audit Committee meeting.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

MEMORANDUM

Summary of FY 2019 BUDGET Changes February 2?7, 2013
To: Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster

You have asked for commentary and observations regarding a comparison of the FY 2019 GLWA
request with that utilized for the FY 2018 water and sewer charges. The accompanying
exhibits present a high level summary of our review.

As noted in prior correspondence on this matter, the FY 2019 BUDGET request represents a 2%
increase compared to FY 2018 ?gures for both the Water Fund and the Sewer Fund. The executive
summary budget request categorizes the overall revenue requirements into three major categories:

- Operation and maintenance expenses for the Regional System;

Master Bond Ordinance (MBO) requirements, the largest of which is debt service; and
Planned deposits to the Regional System account oF the Improvement and Extension 
Fund to ?nance capital improvements.

The left side of the attached exhibits present the relative changes in each of these categories when
comparing the FY 2019 and FY 2018 ?gures. As noted on Exhibit Page I, the 2% increase for the
Water Fund is characterized by a moderate operating expense increase, a reduction in M30
requirements (largely associated with a naturally occurring reduction in debt service related to the
optimized structure resulting from the Series 2016 Refunding Bonds), and a material increase in
expected transfers to the Fund. The changes in the operating expense increase is summarized by
major cost pool is shown on the right side of Exhibit Page I, and reflect moderate increases in each
major cost pool.

The same presentation is made for the Sewer Fund BUDGET on Exhibit Page 2. The majority of the
2% BUDGET increase is related to increased MBO requirements. The sewer debt service for FY
2019 re?ects a natural increase that results from the optimized structure resulting from the Series
2016 Refunding Bonds. As we have noted in prior correspondence, the Sewer operating expense
increase is a combination of signi?cant increases in the Combined Sewer Over?ow (C30) and
Oakland Macomb Interceptor (OMID) cost pools, and reductions in the Common-to?All (CTA
SHAREs) and Industrial Waste Control (IWC) cost pools.

We trust that this brief summary is responsive to your request and we are prepared to discuss this
matter at your convenience.

 

In keeping with prior presentations, reference to the BUDGET in all capital letters is intended to apply to the
comprehensive revenue requirement, including the operation and maintenance expenses, debt service and other Master Bond
Ordinance requirements, and deposits to the GLWA Regional Improvement and Extension Account.

AGENDA ITEM #6C

Date: March 16, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Request for Extension to File FY 2017 Annual Audit

Background: The fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 is the Great Lakes Water Authority’s
(GLWA) first twelve-month fiscal year. The year-end audit fieldwork began in October
2017, less than three months after completing the opening balancing sheet and initial sixmonth operational period ended June 30, 2016.
Michigan Public Act 2 of 1968 (PA 2 of 1968), the Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act,
establishes requirements for the submission of local government audits, including
authorities, to the State of Michigan Department of Treasury as of six months after the
fiscal year-end. Despite significant accomplishments in 2016, the GLWA will need to
request an extension of that filing requirement. Key drivers include the following.
“141.424 Annual financial report; contents; filing; extension; unauthorized
investments prohibited; “pension” defined.

The chief administrative officer of a local unit may request an extension of
the filing date from the state treasurer, and the state treasurer may grant the
request for reasonable cause. If the local unit of government requests an
extension of the filing deadline, then the local unit of government must
provide to the department of treasury the unadjusted year end trial balance
reports, in a form and manner as prescribed by the department of treasury,
to the department of treasury at the time the local unit of government
requests the extension. The department of treasury shall post these
unadjusted year end trial reports on the department's internet website if the
extension is granted.”

Chief Administrative Officer is defined by the Statute as shown below in PA 2 of 1968
Section, 141.422b Definitions; B to D, Sec. 2b.
Page 47

 “(3) “Chief administrative officer” means any of the following: ….

(g) The official granted general administrative control of an authority or
organization of government established by law that may expend funds of the
authority or organization.”

Further guidance is provided by the Audit Manual for Local Units of Government in
Michigan:

“The chief administrative officer of a local unit may request an extension of
the filing date from the state treasurer. When an audit cannot be completed
within 6 months after the end of the fiscal year, a written request must be
made before the audit is actually delinquent. A request for the extension for
filing of an audit must include a letter from the chief administrative officer
indicating:
o that the audit is in progress (identify any component units);
o when the audit is expected to be completed;

o an explanation of the existence of extraordinary circumstances
beyond the control of the local unit and the audit cannot be completed
and filed timely (the reasonable cause).

Treasury will send a written response to all audit extension requests. The
request for an extension will be denied absent the existence of an
extraordinary circumstance beyond the control of the local unit.”

Analysis: Consistent with discussions at the Audit Committee and Board meetings, a
request for extension to file GLWA’s FY 2017 audit report until April 30, 2018 was
submitted. That extension request and the related approval letter are attached.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Mr. Nick Khouri, Treasurer

Department of Treasury
P.O. Box 30716
Lansing, MI 48909
Dear Treasurer Khouri:
Thank you for previously granting an extension for submission of the audit for the Great Lakes
Water Authority’s (GLWA) fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 financial report until February 28,
2018. As you may recall, this is the first full year of operations for GLWA. At this time, the
financial report is largely complete. There are, however, some open items that the Great Lakes
Water Authority and the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) are negotiating
as a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) related to the leases for the regional water and sewer
systems. The outcome of the MOU process is likely to impact cash balances and liabilities on the
books of the GLWA. For this reason, the GLWA Board, Audit Committee and management would
prefer to work through these final issues with DWSD in March 2018 and issue the final FY 2017
financial report with any contingencies resolved by April 30, 2018. This will also allow the reports
to reflect this subsequent event as we plan to enter the market in mid calendar year 2018 to optimize
refunding opportunities. While the amounts in the MOU discussion are material, nothing under
discussion is considered to be detrimental to the financial position of either GLWA or DWSD.
Given these circumstances, the GLWA respectfully requests an extension for the filing of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2017 audit until April 30, 2018.
The preliminary FY 2017 financial results are positive as reported to the Audit Committee on
November 17, 2017. The current FY 2018 financial results are also positive. The FY 2018 2nd
Quarter report presented to the Audit Committee on February 23, 2018 is attached.
Thank you, in advance, for your consideration of this request.
Very truly yours,

RE:

Extension request for Audit Report for the Great Lakes Water Authority, FYE June 30, 2017

Dear Ms. McCormick:
This is in response to the Authority’s February 28, 2018 request for an extension to file the
Authority’s audit for fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. Due to the Authority’s circumstances as
conveyed in said letter, including open matters related to cash and liabilities which will be addressed
by a Memorandum of Understanding under discussion with the City of Detroit Water & Sewerage
Department (DWSD). Therefore, the Authority’s audit along with the auditing procedures report will
be due no later than April 30, 2018.
The Authority may submit a copy of the audit report, the auditing procedures report, and the
comments and recommendations letter (if applicable) online by visiting Michigan.gov/treasury at
Michigan Department of Treasury/online report.
If Authority staff have any questions, please contact Rod Taylor, Administrator of the Community

Date: March 16, 2018

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Water Residential Assistance Program Update and Proposed Program Assistance
Allocation Changes

Background: The Water Residential Assistance Program (“WRAP”) provides sustainable
funding for qualifying low-income residents served by the Great Lakes Water Authority’s
(“GLWA”) customer communities. The program is funded by GLWA at an amount equal to
0.5 percent of budgeted revenues with the initial FY 2016 funding level of $4.5 million
combined for water and sewer services, $4.7 million in FY 2017 and $4.9 million for FY
2018.

The scope of funding uses includes a) payment assistance and b) water audit and water
conservation measures. Eligible residential customers with a past due bill and/or who are
in active shut off can receive assistance with paying down arrears and receive $25 toward
monthly bill payment assistance annually up to $1,000. High volume water users can
receive a one-time home audit and home water conservation services up to $1,000.
Maximum annual assistance per household is $2,000. To participate in WRAP, an applicant
must have household gross incomes at or below 150% of the federal poverty income
thresholds. Customers with water usage at or above 120% of the average residential usage
are eligible to participate in a water audit and install water conservation measures. WRAP
participants are also encouraged to participate in both financial coaching and water
conservation workshops as well as other support services. The program is administered by
Wayne Metro Community Action Agency (Wayne Metro), a nonprofit agency.
The WRAP began providing assistance to customers of GLWA on March 1, 2016 and has the
potential to serve over 100 communities within the GLWA service area. In order to assist
qualified households each community must opt into the program and sign a Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) with Wayne Metro. To date, 72 communities have opted into WRAP,
with 7 more communities with MOAs in progress. A list of current participating
communities is presented in Table 1.

WRAP Cashflow Update
Through December 31, 2017, WRAP has committed almost $4.9 million in assistance funds
and over $1.4 million in conservation and repair funds across the GLWA service area. Over
6,600 households have been assisted, avoiding over 4,100 shut-offs. Below are cashflow
updates for WRAP through the end of FY 2017 and through the end of the most recent
period, December 2017.

Page 52

 1. FY 2017 WRAP Cashflow
Table 2 shows the WRAP cashflow of budgeted and committed funds in total and for
each of the participating counties and the City of Detroit as of June 30, 2017. In total for
FY 2017, over $2.2 million in assistance funds were committed and over $570,000 of
conservation and repair dollars were spent. From March 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017, over
$8.0 million was budgeted for WRAP and almost $4.3 million was utilized by WRAP
participants during that time. As of June 30, 2017, the suburban counties still had
uncommitted funds (combined assistance and conservation) of over $1.9 million
through June 30, 2017. The City of Detroit had uncommitted funds of over $1.8 million
due to the reallocation of the uncommitted FY 2016 suburban assistance funds.
2. FY 2018 WRAP Cashflow as of February 28, 2018

Table 3 shows the WRAP cashflow of budgeted and committed funds in total and for
each of the participating counties and the City of Detroit as of February 28, 2018. From
March 1, 2016 to February 28, 2018, over $12.3 million was budgeted for WRAP
(including the FY 2018 allocation) and over $6.6 million was utilized by WRAP
participants during that time.
Proposed Change to Program Requirements

In response to the feedback GLWA management has received from participating member
communities, GLWA management is recommending changing the 2-year residential
customer WRAP participation limit to a 3-year limitation. This will help eligible
participants in WRAP to have the best chance at success by allowing an extra 12 months of
bill assistance.
Wayne Metro Funding Recommendations

Based on the demonstrated usage of the WRAP funds since March 1, 2016 and the usage
during FY 2017, Wayne Metro is recommending reallocation of currently uncommitted FY
2017 suburban WRAP funds and a reallocation of budgeted WRAP funds for FY 2019.
Attached is Wayne Metro’s letter (including referenced documents) dated March 9, 2018
which outlines their recommendations. Below is a summary of the recommendations:

1. Reallocation of Uncommitted FY 2017 Assistance Funds: Similar to the
demonstrated WRAP utilization in FY 2016, suburban counties had uncommitted
assistance dollars of $1,034,435, as of June 30, 2017. Wayne Metro is requesting a
reallocation of those funds to the City of Detroit in the amount of $604,720 and
$383,515 ($307,515 for assistance and $76,000 for conservation) to the City of Flint.
Page 53

 The remaining $46,200 will remain in the county allocations for third year WRAP
assistance to eligible participants.

2. Reallocation of Uncommitted FY 2016 and 2017 Conservation Funds: In
addition to the uncommitted assistance funds, the suburban counties have
underutilized the conservation funds in both FY 2016 and FY 2017. Wayne Metro is
recommending that the $446,089 in uncommitted FY 2016 conservation dollars be
reallocated to the City of Detroit and the uncommitted $202,249 FY 2017
conservation dollars be designated for the replacement of fixtures in the home that
pre-date the lead-free plumbing code change.
3. Need-Based Allocation of FY 2019 WRAP Funds: Although WRAP is still a
relatively new program and new communities are continuing to join WRAP, the
utilization of suburban funding allocations is below those of the City of Detroit. In
2017, the GLWA Board reallocated over $1.6 million to the City of Detroit and
$117,000 to the City of Flint from uncommitted FY 2016 WRAP allocations. A
similar request is being made for a reallocation of uncommitted FY 2017 suburban
funds. In order to address this continued gap in demonstrated utilization, Wayne
Metro is requesting an allocation for FY 2019 WRAP funds based on a need-based
formula, similar to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. A
table of proposed need-based allocations is attached.

Budget Impact: None

Proposed Action: The Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water Authority
Board 1) approve the proposed program change to WRAP to allow participants to remain
in the program for 3 years, subject to approval by the representing Director; and 2)
consider the proposed Wayne Metro funding reallocation recommendations.

Great Lakes Water Authority & Chief Executive Officer
500 Randolph, 19th Floor
Detroit, MI 48202
RE: Water Residential Assistance Program Reallocation of Uncommitted FY16-17 Funds
Dear GLWA Board of Directors and Sue McCormick,
Community Action Agencies, America’s anti-poverty network, carry out a shared
promise to empower people and communities to be strong, healthy, and thriving. The
Community Action Alliance for Southeast Michigan, through our role in WRAP, has
made water assistance, conservation, and consumer education a leading priority in our
community-based poverty fighting efforts.
Together we have enrolled more than 11,000 GLWA resident customers into WRAP
assisting in the prevention of thousands of water service shut offs. With 68 of the eligible
GLWA communities now offering WRAP services to residents and four additional MOAs
in process the reach and impact of WRAP continues to grow. Even with an increase in
community participation, an unspent balance of $446,089 in uncommitted funds remain
in year one and $1,236,684M in year two.
The greatest need for WRAP services continues to be from City of Detroit customers. 70
percent of all WRAP enrollments are City of Detroit residents. All available GLWA Detroit
WRAP funding has been committed to service first year enrollments, second year
reenrollments, home repairs, and conservation measures.
We respectfully request that GLWA Board of Directors:
1. Approve a WRAP conservation and direct assistance funding reallocation as
follows:
a. Conservation:
i. Reallocate Year 1 ($446,089) to Detroit residential customers for
conservation.
ii. Reallocate Year 2 ($202,249) to replace kitchen and bathroom
faucets and program staffing supports.
b. Direct Assistance:
i. Reallocate year 2 unspent funds as follows:
1. All Counties: Year 3 re-enrollments: $347,400 (bill credit only)

 

Page 57

  
2. Genesee County: New enrollments & Conservation: $383,515
3. City of Detroit New Enrollments: $305,520
2. Adjust future WRAP allocations to include a need-based formula. Example
benchmark data scenarios are attached.
In advocating for this reallocation, it is worth noting:
 All allocated GLWA funding and additional funding raised for Detroit has been
committed.
 This request is consistent with the reallocation request made by the CAA Alliance
in 2017.
 An additional $4,000,000 has been raised and committed for WRAP Detroit Wayne Metro contributing $1M in Federal dollars and DWSD an additional $3M
for Departmental sources.
 $1.6M has been leveraged to expand and advance WRAP services through
technology, facilities, and increased staffing.
 $300,000 of discretionary funding has been raised through events, grants, and
donations to provide one-time assistance to individuals and communities
ineligible for WRAP.
 Introductory meetings have been conducted with GCARD, the Community
Action Agency serving Flint in anticipation of providing WRAP services to Flint
residents.
Please find attached:
1. A funding allocation request table
2. A yearly WRAP enrollment and community opt-in report
3. Benchmark data to inform a need-based allocation formula for WRAP
4. WRAP success story, Mr. Denzel Donald, a Detroit resident. Denzel’s monthly bill
went from $300 a month to $50 after a broken pipe was repaired. Denzel is also
doing well in his new role as a Wayne Metro 2018 Certified Tax Specialist assisting
other Detroit residents with free tax preparation services and financial education.
Sincerely,

Louis D. Piszker, CEO

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Request for Public Hearing: Drinking Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) Project Plan
Submittals for the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements
Project and the Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main Project

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (the “GLWA”) has identified two water
system projects in the proposed FY 2019 to FY 2023 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for
submittal to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for the Drinking
Water Revolving Fund (DWRF) financing program for funding in the state’s 2019 fiscal
year. The deadline for submitting all DWRF project plans to MDEQ is May 1, 2018. Prior to
submitting the project plans, GLWA must hold a public hearing for each project and present
the plans. The public hearing for both projects has been set for April 11, 2018 at 1:00 p.m.
The FY 2019 DWRF Project Plans and public hearing notices for the Lake Huron Water
Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements Project and the Waterworks Park to
Northeast Transmission Main Project have been posted on the GLWA website and can be
found at: http://www.glwater.org/category/news/hearing-notices. These project plans
will be presented at the public hearings. After the public hearings are closed, the included
draft resolutions will be scheduled for action by the GLWA Board of Directors at its
regularly scheduled meeting also on April 11, 2018. The resolutions must be approved and
signed to ensure that the finalized Project Plans are assembled, printed, and submitted to
the MDEQ by the deadline of May 1, 2018.
Analysis: Below is a description of the two projects.

Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements – (CIP# 111007):
This project is comprised of the evaluation, design, and construction of the Raw Sludge
Clarifiers and Raw Sludge Pumping Systems at the Lake Huron Water Treatment Plant
(LHWTP). Constructed in 1976, the LHWTP is a Type I public water system that supplies
water to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in GLWA’s Northern
communities. The LHWTP uses source water drawn from a single intake located in Lake
Huron. There are significant operational matters associated with the sludge handling
system at the LHWTP as it relates to the twice annual cleaning of the settling basins. This
Page 63

 project is necessary to ensure that GLWA can maintain treatment of flows at the LHWTP
without system failure.

The proposed project will provide construction of a new redundant wash water retention
basin and a new sludge pumping station with the existing clarifiers being abandoned or
demolished. Additionally, provisions for decanting clear water from Lagoon 5 and Lagoon
6 to Lagoon 8 so Lagoon 8 can serve as temporary overflow storage during basin cleanout
are included within the scope of this project. These improvements and modifications are
detailed in the Project Plan. The estimated cost of the project is $7,250,000.

Water Conveyance System – Waterworks Park to Northeast Transmission Main
Project- (CIP# 122003): The primary purpose of the project is to better align the GLWA
water production capacity with long-term system water demands, while improving
reliability, water quality protection and reducing future operational and maintenance costs
as well as capital improvement costs.

The intent of the project is to provide finished water to the NE site from WWP through a
proposed transmission pipeline such that treatment facilities at the NE site can be decommissioned and the existing NE high lift station and reservoirs can be used to re-pump
finished water to the NE service area. The proposed NE Repurposing will largely eliminate
the need to complete the large and costly backlog of capital improvement projects at the NE
site with the goal of long term capital cost savings. In addition to NE repurposing, the
project is also intended to provide additional reliability to the WWP service area through
the proposed transmission pipeline in case of loss of service at the WWP. The project is
comprised of the final design and construction of a new transmission main, isolation valves,
control valves, and related appurtenances to provide a design flow rate of 160 million
gallons per day (MGD) of finished drinking water from Waterworks Park WTP to the
Northeast facility. These improvements and modifications are detailed in the Project Plan.
The estimated cost of this project is $133,700,000.

Justification: GLWA is seeking low interest loan assistance through the DWRF program
for both projects. Although the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ)
interest rate for FY 2019 will not be determined until October 2018, the current year’s
interest rate of 2.00% is less than the present conventional revenue bond interest rates.
Based on the combined project amounts of $140.9 million, GLWA could save an estimated
$92 million in interest costs and avoided issuance costs, based on a similar open market
revenue bond with a 30-year term and 5.00% interest rate, over the life of the 30-year
bond issue. This will afford savings to both GLWA and its members.

Budget Impact: Debt service is anticipated to begin in FY 2020 for both projects and will
be included as part of the FY 2020 financial plan.

Proposed Action: The Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water
Authority Board hold the public hearings on April 11, 2018 for the project and approve the
resolution to accept and submit the DWRF Project Plans for the Lake Huron Water
Treatment Plant Sludge System Improvements Project and the Waterworks Park to
Northeast Transmission Main Project as presented, at its regular meeting on April 11, 2018.

MEMORANDUM
GLWA Sewer “Charge Stability Adjustment”
To:

March 13, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for commentary and observations regarding the potential implementation of
a “Charge Stability Adjustment” for certain aspects of GLWA’s Sewer service charge
schedule. This concept was originally introduced in presentation to the GLWA Board at its
February 2018 workshop. We’ve prepared some sample hypothetical implementation
scenarios to illustrate how it might work.
To review, in the GLWA sewer cost of service methodology, the vast majority of annual
revenue requirements are allocated to Customers based on their relative SHARE of the costs
allocated to the “common to all” (CTA) Cost Pool. There are two major “Customer specific”
Cost Pools that are solely or primarily allocated to specific Customers:
• Oakland Macomb Interceptor (OMID) – directly allocable to OMID; and
• Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) – of which 83% is allocable to the Detroit
Customer Class. 
The nature of these two Customer specific Cost Pools are similar, and methods for assigning
indirect costs to both are under review as part of the Cost Allocation Project1. However there
are unique circumstances for these two Cost Pools:
• The OMID Cost Pool is related to facilities that entirely serve one GLWA Customer,
and could arguably be defined as “local” facilities for that Customer;
• The CSO Cost Pool is related to regional facilities that (while predominantly
allocated to service for one Customer) are still a “common to all” wholesale service.
Both of the “Customer specific” Cost Pools are experiencing “unique” circumstances with
respect to the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, that have the effect of increasing costs
allocated to them. The increases reflect a combination of refined budgetary awareness, new
maintenance programs, and the recognition of new information from the capital asset
inventory and valuation project. The increased allocation of costs to the OMID Cost Pool has
the effect of increasing the OMID Wholesale Service Charge by approximately 2%, which is
net of an offsetting reduction in costs allocable to the CTA Cost Pool. The increased
1

For instance, the methods of assigning Centralized Services operating expenses, etc.

Page 71

 GLWA Sewer “Charge Stability Adjustment”

March 13, 2018
Page 2

allocation of costs to the CSO Cost Pool has the effect of increasing the total Detroit
allocated wholesale sewer revenue requirement by approximately 3.5%, which is also net of
an offsetting reduction in costs allocable to the CTA Cost Pool.
The Charge Stability Adjustment concept seeks to stabilize potential variances in these two
Customer specific Cost Pools, and the resulting possible irregular impacts in charges to
specific Customers. It embraces a notion of comparing actual Cost Pool expenditures to
budgeted amounts, and making adjustments to future charges to reflect actual cost activity.
Under this approach, Sewer Service Charges would be established at 100% of the BUDGET
assigned to the Customer specific (OMID / CSO) Cost Pools, with the understanding that:
• Actual costs to these Cost Pools would be tracked and compared to original budgets;
• Potentially, adjustments to future charges (for FY 2020 and/or beyond) would be
made to reflect actual vs. budget performance in “Customer specific” Cost Pools.
This “Charge Stability Adjustment” concept is consistent with the overall equity and stability
strategy that is fundamental to the GLWA Strategic Charge Initiatives. The concept may
provide a valuable tool for GLWA to address potentially volatile expenditures in these
unique Cost Pools, and avoid unintended consequences to the directly impacted Customers.
This approach is NOT being considered for budget/actual variances in revenues or “CTA
SHAREs” revenue requirements.
The concept is demonstrated in the accompanying exhibits to this memorandum for two
separate scenarios. The first example Exhibit Page 1
Lines 1 through 8 illustrate the allocation of the FY 2019 budgeted revenue requirements to
cost pools, and the use of the SHAREs concept to allocate cost of service to Customers. For
purposes of this discussion we’ve grouped Customers into (1) OMID; (2) All Other Suburban
Wholesale; and (3) Detroit Customer Class. The amounts shown in Column 5 for Lines 5
through 7 represent the proposed FY 2019 annual sewer service charges for each of these
Customer groupings.
Now let’s introduce how reviewing actual costs incurred could be considered under the
concept under review. On Exhibit Page 1, Scenario 1 assumes varying levels of actual cost
savings compared to budget for each Cost Pool. The SHAREs concept can be used to
allocate of the resulting actual costs of service to Customers (Lines 11 through 14) and
compared to the originally allocated budgeted revenue requirements, as summarized by the
variances on Lines 16 through 19. Under the Charge Stability Adjustment concept any actual
to budget variances in the “regular” Cost Pools shown in Columns 1 and 2 would not result
in charge modifications, but rather would impact GLWA reserve balances. However, the
variances in the Customer specific Cost Pools would potentially modify future charges.
Now let’s illustrate how this might work in subsequent charges. For purposes of discussion,
we’ll assume that the FY 2020 budget reflects a 4% increase uniformly for all Cost Pools.
The budget increase for each Cost Pool is shown on Line 24. The Charge Stability
Page 72

 GLWA Sewer “Charge Stability Adjustment”

March 13, 2018
Page 3

Adjustments computed earlier on Line 21 are carried down to Line 25 before computing
charges. In this example the net impact on the OMID and CSO Cost Pools is actually a 6%
reduction compared to the original FY 2019 Charges. The reduction to the OMID Cost Pool
accrues directly to OMID, and the decrease in the CSO Cost Pool is shared by all Customers,
although principally to the Detroit Customer Class. As shown in Column 5 on Lines 31
through 34, this results in FY 2020 “charge increases” that are slightly lower for OMID and
the Detroit Customer Class than for All Other Suburban Wholesale Customers. It also results
in “charge increase” that is lower than the budget increase, since charges are being set to
reflect activity from a prior budget year.
A second scenario is presented on Exhibit Page 2. The analysis is identical, except that in this
instance we’ve assumed that actual costs exceed budgeted levels by varying amounts. (See
Line 9.) The results can be traced through the rest of the exhibit, and in effect this scenario
results in FY 2020 “charge increases” that are slightly higher for OMID and the Detroit
Customer Class than for All Other Suburban Wholesale Customers. It also results in “charge
increase” that is higher than the budget increase.
Any implementation of the “Charge Stability Adjustment” concept will require further
analysis and policy development, including:
• Understanding that the OMID “Charge Stability Adjustment” (at least as referenced
in this commentary) is suggested to be limited to the potential recognition of a
successfully negotiated operating agreement for the Northeast Sewer Pump Station;
• Acknowledging that OMID Cost Pool adjustments are applicable to the OMID
Customer only, while CSO Cost Pool adjustments are subject to the 83 / 17 allocation
agreement;
• Establishing material thresholds for implementing “Charge Stability Adjustments”;
• Understanding how I&E Funds are generated, included in charges, committed, and
expended;
• Understanding that there may be a need to delay implementation of the concept by a
year to allow for actual cost to be reviewed.
We are prepared to discuss this matter at your convenience.

 AGENDA ITEM #8A

Date:
To:

March 16, 2018

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Deirdre Henry, Treasury Manager
Re:

Quarterly Investment Report through December 31, 2017 (Unaudited)

Background: As stated in section 14 of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Investment
Policy, quarterly reporting shall be presented to provide a clear picture of the status of the current
GLWA investment portfolio. The attached report, prepared and presented by PFM Asset
Management LLC, summarizes portfolio information through December 31, 2017 (unaudited).

Analysis: The Quarterly Investment Report through December 31, 2017 is in compliance with the
requirements of Public Act 20 of 1948, as amended and the GLWA Investment Policy. GLWA is
actively investing its funds in a diversified portfolio which includes bank deposits, money market
funds, a local government investment pool, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, and commercial
paper. All securities in the portfolio are in compliance with the GLWA investment policy. Key
metrics are provided below with additional commentary in the attached report.
•

•

Yield to Market at Cost compared to market index:
o As of December 31, 2017: 1.36% vs 1.25% (3-Month Treasury Index)
o As of September 30, 2017: 1.09% vs 0.98% (3-Month Treasury Index)
Portfolio Allocation in Cash/Money Market Securities
o As of December 31, 2017: 60%
o As of September 30, 2017: 56%

Over the next sixty to ninety days, the GLWA Financial Services Area is implementing process
improvements to more clearly define bond and Improvement & Extension Fund cash flows and
close out interfund and receiving fund activity monthly. This will enable the GLWA Treasury group
to coordinate expanded cashflow forecasting on a rolling 24-month basis. PFM Asset Management
LLC will use this additional information to identify strategies to optimize investment returns while
meeting GLWA standards for safety and liquidity.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Executive Summary

PORTFOLIO RECAP
¾ Safety – The overall portfolio is diversified amongst cash, bank deposits, U.S. Treasuries, Federal Agencies, commercial paper, SEC-registered
money market funds, and a local government investment pool. The total credit profile of the pool is strong with over 98% of the assets invested in
bank deposits or securities that are rated within the two highest short and long-term rating classifications as established by S&P.
¾ Liquidity – The portfolio’s liquidity weighting to overnight funds has remained steady, with 59.7% of the total assets maturing overnight.
¾ Return – The overall yield increased to 1.36% as of December 31, 2017 versus 1.09% at September 30, 2017. The Authority has earned
$5,534,062 in investment income for fiscal year 2018 to date on a book value basis. Based on the current interest rate environment, the investment
income earned for the previous quarter, and assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for the remainder of the fiscal
year, we are projecting that the Authority will earn approximately $11.0 million in investment income for fiscal year 2018.
¾ Compliance – The aggregate portfolio is in compliance with the Authority’s investment policy and Michigan Public Act 20.

Investment Strategy

GLWA INVESTMENT STRATEGY
¾ To date, the Authority has continued to invest its funds in assets concentrated in a mixture of short and intermediate-term
investments to ensure sufficient liquidity; there was a slight increase in funds maturing overnight at the end of December to
cover debt service, debt reserve, and pension obligation payments and requirements
¾ The aggregate portfolio was yielding 1.36% at the end of December*
• This compares to the 1.25% yield of the Bank of America / Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as of
12/31/2017, which is a comparable market indicator
¾ The Authority has continued to implement a disciplined investment plan to provide improved safety and diversification and
putting every dollar to work
¾ For the third quarter of FY 2018, the investment strategy steps to be taken includes seeking opportunities to invest intermediate
and longer-term funds based on refined cash flows (i.e., construction funds, trust funds, etc. that can be invested beyond three
months)
¾ The Authority will continue to work with its investment manager to identify strategies to maximize future investment income
while meeting the objectives of safety and liquidity
¾ Assuming that the Authority maintains the same investable balances for FY 2018 and FY 2019 and the interest rate
environment remains in a similar range, we conservatively expect to earn approximately $11.0 million in interest income in FY
2018 and over $14.0 million in FY 2019
* Current market yield as of December 31, 2017.

Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS

¾ In the fourth quarter of 2017, economic data was generally favorable as the unemployment rate hovered near a 15year low, inflation remained in check, and the Federal Reserve raised rates for a third time in 2017. At the same time,
both consumer and business confidence remained high, and Congress passed large corporate and individual tax cuts.
¾ Market reaction to the final tax bill reflected expectations for at least a near-term positive economic impact causing both
interest rates and the U.S. equity markets to rise.
¾ The post-tax bill market moves amplified existing trends. During the quarter:
– 2-Year Treasury yields rose by 40 basis points (0.40%), reflecting the December rate hike by the Federal Open
Market Committee (“FOMC”) and expectations for more policy changes going forward
– 10-year Treasury yields rose by 9 basis points (0.09%), muted by low inflation prospects and strong demand for
yield by global investors
– The yield curve flattened to the narrowest level since 2007
– Equity markets capped the first calendar year ever with twelve consecutive months of positive returns
¾ The strength of the U.S. economy, coupled with the December Fed rate hike, drove yields on all but the longest
Treasury maturities higher in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, fixed-income returns were mixed for the quarter,
with shorter indexes generating negative returns; but, reinvestment opportunities became more attractive. Higher
yields, narrow credit spreads, and a flat yield curve created a challenging investment landscape.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2017

Market Overview and Outlook

FIXED INCOME MARKET – ECONOMIC HIGHLIGHTS

¾ Credit instruments and other “spread product” generally outperformed Treasuries for the quarter relative to government
securities. The primary drivers of portfolio performance were asset allocation and diversification.
– Federal Agency yield spreads remained very narrow relative to similar maturity Treasuries throughout the
quarter. Minimal incremental income and similar relative price changes resulted in little excess return from the
Agency sector during the quarter (excess return is the return on a sector over and above the return on similar
duration Treasuries).
¾ Generally, the economic themes that brought 2017 to a close will carry forward into 2018, including: improving growth;
stable job production; healthy personal consumption; and strong corporate fundamentals.
¾ Following three hikes in 2017, the Fed’s “dot plot,” released after the December Federal Open Market Committee
(“FOMC”) meeting, indicated an expectation for three more hikes in 2018. As of year-end, the market-implied
probability of a rate hike at the March FOMC meeting was around 70%.
¾ The FOMC starts 2018 balancing several factors: persistently low inflation; uncertainty around the pace of economic
growth; and the continuation of balance sheet normalization. Additionally, a change in leadership at the Fed – Jerome
Powell has replaced Janet Yellen as Fed Chair – has the potential to create some uncertainty. Powell is expected to
follow closely in Yellen’s footsteps.
¾ The outlook for some of the major investment-grade fixed-income sectors are as follows:
– Federal Agency spreads remain tight; however, the best value relative to U.S. Treasuries is in the 2 – 3 year
area of the curve.
– Given the steepness of the short-term yield curve (under one year), short-term credit instruments like
commercial paper look particularly attractive as their current yields fully compensate for at least three Fed rate
hikes in 2018.

 Investment Performance Report – December 2017
Great Lakes Water Authority
Demonstration of Yield to Maturity vs. Duration
As of December 31, 2017
¾ The comparison agencies included on the list below were selected based on type and/or other non-performance based criteria to show a broad
range of water entities/utilities. This peer group list does not represent an endorsement of any of the public agencies or their services. The types of
funds (e.g., bond proceeds, debt service, etc.) and duration of the overall portfolios listed below as well as the various differences in permitted
investments and allowable credit capacity in state statutes (i.e., the ability or non-ability to invest in long-term corporate credit) will have a direct
impact on the corresponding yields at market.
¾ The overall yield of the Authority’s aggregate portfolio compares favorably to those of other short-term indices (i.e., the S&P LGIP index and the 3month U.S. Treasury index).
¾ The Authority does not have a potential for a longer duration portfolio when compared to other similar water entities/utilities as the Authority’s
covenants limits and restricts its ability in managing funds to longer-term strategy.

FOMC Statement Highlights

December

13

• Information received since the FOMC met in November indicates that the labor
market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been
rising at a solid rate. Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job
gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further.
• Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity,
employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the
outlook for the national economy.
• Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2.0%
in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2.0% objective over the
medium term.

• The Committee decided to raise the target range for the Federal Funds rate to 1.25% to 1.50%.
• The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the
Federal Funds rate.
• All voting members of the FOMC supported the monetary policy action, except for Charles Evans (Chicago) and Neel
Kashkari (Minneapolis), who preferred at this meeting to maintain the existing target range for the Federal Funds rate.

Economic Growth Remained Strong in the 3rd Quarter
•

Gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 3.3% in the third quarter of 2017, the fastest pace of
expansion over two consecutive quarters since 2014; growth has averaged 2.4% over the last four quarters

•

The acceleration in third quarter 2017 GDP reflected positive contributions from personal consumption, business
investment, boosted primarily by a rise in private inventories, and exports which were offset by negative contributions
from residential housing

Operations & Resources Committee

From: Sonya Collins, Procurement Management Professional
RE:

Procurement Group Process Improvements - Implementation of Bonfire

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Procurement Group relies on a
fragmented set of tools to manage the sourcing cycle from scope development through
contract administration. This includes heavy reliance on various tools such as Excel, Word,
Adobe, SharePoint, email, Bidnet/MITN, and various network drives and intranet pages. In
addition to gross inefficiencies, the lack of cohesive tools hinders consistent business
process, timeliness, ability to measure performance, reduction of human error, and
stakeholder satisfaction.

Analysis: Along with our partners in the GLWA Information Technology Group, software
options were evaluated that could provide a business process framework that aligned with
our needs that was also innovative, demonstrated public sector expertise, and is userfriendly. After considering the options available, the clear leader was Bonfire, a software as
a service (SaaS) solution. In Fall 2017, the Procurement Group conducted a live pilot of
Bonfire for a few key procurements. Feedback from the vendor community, Procurement
staff, and internal and external customers was very positive. Based on that hands-on
experience and a relatively low cost and condensed implementation timeline, it became
apparent that Bonfire was an excellent fit for GLWA’s urgent and foreseeable needs. Bonfire
spans the “end-to-end” cycle from soliciting suppliers, receiving bids and proposals,
evaluating & scoring, documenting awardee decision, and managing the contract.
A few items of note for GLWA’s needs.

1. Bonfire can archive all the current and closed solicitations for the public and vendors
to view at their discretion along with all supporting documentation. This creates an
efficiency because we can now have a link on the GLWA website that directs vendor

Page 130

 to Bonfire for current and/or past solicitations instead of staff posting the request
through Public Relations. This reduces redundancies of effort.

2. Bonfire can post award notices (shows what has been awarded) which will archive
the original solicitation along with an executed contract in which the public and
vendors will also have access to view. Based on other public-sector users’ feedback,
this reduces the amount of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests received.
3. We will now be able to demonstrate GLWA’s commitment to transparency and satisfy
our requirements to post contracts on our website via the link to GLWA’s Bonfire site.
4. Other complex contract management tasks, such as Construction Change Directives
(CCD), can also be aligned with the Bonfire program.

The negotiated fee per seat (user) is $3,900. GLWA’s annual cost for 30 users is $117,000.
There is no charge for training and implementation. The contract is for one year with two
one-year extensions at GLWA’s discretion at the same rate. The fee negotiated for GLWA
members and affiliates is $4,500 per user with a minimum of five users.
The implementation timeline is below.

 Supercharging RFP submission
and evaluation efficiency


Customer Success Story

Metropolitan Transportation Commission

When the number of projects is growing faster than your team’s resources, you need to become
more efficient and effective. MTC knew their existing hard-copy submission and paper-based scoring
processes were holding them back. With Bonfire, MTC streamlined their submission and RFx evaluation
to slash project times, improve operational efficiencies, and make better decisions with confidence.

Organization Profile

Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the transportation planning,
financing and coordinating agency for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. MTC
supports the roads, transit systems, airports and other transportation resources that
help the region’s seven million residents and visitors get to where they need to be.

 Procurement at MTC before Bonfire
The Contracts group at MTC manages all the competitive bidding and RFx projects for
the agency, serving the San Francisco Bay Area. This includes over 75 RFPs and many
more lower-spend solicitations and projects. It is the team’s responsibility to the agency
to deliver the best value for public funds, ensure open opportunity to bid, be as efficient
as possible, and maintain perfect compliance to applicable local, state, and federal laws.
In late 2015, the Executive Office tasked the Contracts team with improving the efficiency
of their procurement process. It was clear to Denise Rodrigues [Assistant Director, Contracts
Compliance Manager],

Michael Brinton [Principal, Contracts Manager] and the rest of the Contracts

Contracts Manager, MTC

Finding the right software
The team at MTC began exploring their options, looking for a software platform that
would help their procurement activities become more effective and efficient.
With the rise in project volume, they needed to be able to run more projects in less time
with the same amount of resources. More specifically, they needed software that not
only streamlined their activities and handled complex RFP evaluations, but was also
incredibly easy to use, reliable, and stable for their use.
Another requirement was for the software to help the agency respond to public data
and information requests, and make it easier for the Contracts group to find, gather, and
share relevant project information as needed.
Implementation of the platform needed to be simple and straightforward, with
stakeholders able to learn and become proficient in the system quickly and without
major disruptions or extensive training.

 Choosing Bonfire
Many of the options that Denise, Michael, and the team evaluated had individual
components of what they were looking for, but ultimately they lacked the full
functionality, ease of use for all users, and the modern look and feel they wanted.
“The way that the [first] demonstration was run, we could tell that [Bonfire] was going
to be really easy for us to adopt: not a whole lot of training to do, it was intuitive”.
In particular, Bonfire’s PDF evaluation features had the potential to significantly improve
their evaluation efficiency. Bonfire’s ability to bring their submissions online, structure
their solicitation data, streamline their activities, and allow evaluators to review, score,
and apply justifications all in a single place were all crucial features for MTC.
Bonfire would eliminate the inefficient and manual hard-copy processes, improving
the efficiency of data and scoring management, the effectiveness of evaluator panel
meetings, and overall slash project times to allow the team to tackle the growing
number of procurement projects coming their way.

The impact of Bonfire at MTC has been significant. Project times have been slashed by
as much as 200%, allowing the team to run complex RFPs in about a month versus the

Independent Auditor's Report

To the Board of Water Commissioners, the Honorable Mayor, and Members of the City Council
City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying ?nancial statements of the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund of the City
of Detroit, Michigan as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and the related notes to the ?nancial statements,
which collectively comprise the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department?s {the or the
"Department?) basic ?nancial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these ?nancial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design.
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of ?nancial
statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor?s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these ?nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to ?nancial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards. issued by the Comptroller Generai of
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the ?nancial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
?nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor?s judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the ?nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
?nancial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of signi?cant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the ?nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf?cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

Opinions

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects. the ?nancial
position of the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund of the City of Detroit, Michigan as of June 30, 201? and the
changes in their ?nancial position and cash ?ows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Emphasis of Matter

As described in Note 1 to the ?nancial statements, effective January 1, 2016, the City of Detroit, Michigan entered
into lease agreements and related service agreements with the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) under which
GLWA will operate the regional water and sewage system for the term of 40 years. The Department has
continued to negotiate some of the ?nal issues concerning the transaction. resulting in the recognition of a special
item (bifurcation loss) in the statement of revenue, expenses, and changes in net position. Dur opinion is not
modified with respect to this matter.

To the Board of Water Commissioners, the Honorable Mayor, and Members of the City Council
City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department

We draw attention to Note 1, which explains that these financial statements present only the Water Fund and
Sewage Disposal Fund and do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the ?nancial position of the City of Detroit.
Michigan as of June 30, 2017 or the changes in its ?nancial position and the changes in its cash ?ows, where
applicable thereof, for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Other Matters
Required Supplemental information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the pension system
schedules, as identi?ed in the table of contents, be presented to suppiement the basic financial statements. Such
information, although not a part of the basic ?nancial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board, which considers it to be an essential part of ?nancial reporting for placing the basic ?nancial
statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited
procedures to the required supplemental information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the
information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the
basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements.
We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not
provide us with suf?cient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Management has omitted management?s discussion and analysis that accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America require to be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such missing
information. although not a part of the basic ?nancial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic ?nancial
statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. Our opinion on the basic ?nancial
statements is not affected by this missing information.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. we have also issued our report dated January 26, 2018 on
our consideration of the City of Detroit, Michigan's internal control over ?nancial reporting and on our tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The
purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over ?nancial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over ?nancial
reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards in considering the City of Detroit, Michigan's internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

Reporting Entity

The City of Detroit. Michigan (the "City") Charter established the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department
(the or the "Department'l in 1335 to supply water. drainage, and sewage services within and
outside the City. The Department is governed by a seven-member Board of Water Commissioners (the
"Board") that is appointed by the mayor of the City of Detroit, Michigan. In accordance with government
accounting principles. there are no separate legal entities to be reported within these financial statements.
The ?nancial statements of the Department have been included in the City?s Comprehensive Annual
Financial Report and reported as enterprise funds. These ?nancial statements represent the ?nancial
condition and the results of operations of the Department only and do not purport to, and do not. present
fairly the ?nancial position of the City. Copies of these reports. along with other ?nancial information. can
be obtained at the Department's administrative of?ce located at 735 Randolph. Detroit. Michigan 48226
and on its website at 

The Board?s governance structure. authority. and level of operational autonomy is established by ?ve
standing federal court orders dated September 9. 2011 (Creation of the Root Cause Committee};
November 4. 2011 (Adoption of the Root Cause Committee Plan of Action); October 5. 2012 (Clarification
of the November 4. 2011 Order); December 14. 2012 (Adoption of Root Cause Committee's Plan of
Action Clarification); and December 15. 2015 (Opinion Order on Joint Motion for Relief of Judgment).
These court orders resulted largely from federal court oversight of the DWSD for most of the time from
May 6, 19?? through March 27. 2013 related to alleged violations of the Clean Water Act and its National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The ?nal court order reiterated that the court
retains limited jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcement of its orders issued on September 9. 2011,
November 4. 2011. October 5. 2012. December 14. 2012. and December 15. 2015.

Authority granted by the federal court to the DWSD includes operational independence in the areas of law.
finance. human resources. and procurement. Speci?cally. while they restored some provisions in the
Charter relating to the appointment and removal of members of the Board. these orders enjoined the City
from applying any existing or future charter provisions. ordinances. resolutions. executive orders. city
policies, regulations. procedures. or similar rules or practices that are inconsistent with the express terms
of the court?s orders. Further the orders granted the DWSD the authority to: purchase its own information
technology systems; establish its own subunits and programs within its ?nance division. including debt
management, accounts payable. accounts receivable. accounting. budget. and to establish new rates and
charges; treasury and cash management. asset management. and deferred compensation; independence
from city finance policies; be exempt from the application of city ordinances. the City's human resources
policies and regulations. Civil Service Commission Rules. and city resolutions and orders. pertaining to
payroll. employee bene?ts. and employee and labor relations; establish bank accounts in its own name;
and establish its own self-insurance fund.

Effective January 1. 2016. the City of Detroit. Michigan entered into lease agreements and related service
agreements with the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) under which GLWA will operate the regional
water and sewage system for the term of 40 years (with automatic extension to coincide with any debt still
outstanding that was issued to finance system improvements). The agreements transfer all then-
outstanding bonded indebtedness to GLWA. along with a leasehold interest in certain capital assets. cash.
investments. and receivables in exchange for an annual lease payment of $50 million.

The GLWA bonds are supported by a pledge of the revenue of both the regional system and local system
revenue. master bond ordinance requires collections of the Department's water and sewer receipts to
be deposited into trust accounts controlled by the master bond ordinance (through which will be
used to fund wholesale operation and maintenance costs. debt principal and interest. pension obligations,
the Water Residential Assistance Program. and the budget stabilization fund. after distributing cash
sufficient to cover the local operation and maintenance costs to the Department; any remaining monies
are transferred to an improvement and extension fund.

Note 1 - Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Accounting and Reporting Principles

The City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department follows accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (GAAP) as applicable to governmental units. Accounting and ?nancial
reporting pronouncements are promulgated by the Government Accounting Standards Board. The
following is a summary of the significant accounting policies used by the Department:

Fund Accounting

The Department accounts for its various activities in two different funds in order to demonstrate
accountability for how it has spent its resources: separate funds allow us it show the particular
expenditures for which speci?c revenue was used.

Progrietag: Funds

Proprietary funds include enterprise funds (which provide goods or services to users in exchange for
charges or fees). The Department reports the following two funds:

. The Water Fund accounts for the operations of the water distribution system. The fund provides
services to retail customers located in the City of Detroit, Michigan.

0 The Sewage Disposal Fund accounts for the operations of the sewers including sanitary and
combined sewers. The fund provides services to retail customers located in the City of Detroit,
Michigan.

Report Presentation

This report includes the fund-based statements of the Department. In accordance with government
accounting principles, a government?wide presentation with program and general revenue is not
applicable to special purpose governments engaged only in business-type activities.

Basis of Accounting

The Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund use the economic resources measurement focus and the full
accrual basis of accounting. Revenue is recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a
is incurred regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Nor-exchange revenue (grants and
contributions) are recognized when all eligibility requirements have been satis?ed (generally based on
reimbursements of amounts spent).

Speci?c Baiances and Transactions

Cash and Cash Eguivaients

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with a
maturity of three months or less when acquired.

investments
Investments are reported at fair value or estimated fair value based on quoted market prices.
Receivabies

All customer receivables are shown net of allowance for uncollectible amounts of $12,174,486 and
$38,829,885 in the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund, respectively.

Note 1 - Nature of Business and Signi?cant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In and Prepaid items

Inventories consist of operating and maintenance and repair parts for water and sewer assets and are
valued at the lower of cost or market. with cost being determined on an average cost method. Inventory is
recorded as expenditures when consumed rather than when purchased. Certain payments to vendors
re?ect costs applicable to future ?scal years and are recorded as prepaid items.

Capital Assets

Capital assets are recorded at historical cost. together with interest capitalized during construction.
Capital assets are de?ned by the Department as assets with an initial individual cost of more than $5.000
and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. All acquisitions of land and land improvements are
capitalized regardless of cost. Donated capital assets are recorded at estimated acquisition value at the
date of donation.

Interest incurred during the construction of capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of
the capitalized value of the assets constructed.

Infrastructure. buildings, equipment, and vehicles are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:

Depreciable Life -

Years
Land improvements 6? years
Buildings and structures 40 years
Distribution mains 67 years
Services and meters 20-6? years
Sewers years
Machinery. equipment. and 3-20 years

fixtures

The Department capitalizes qualifying net interest costs of the system on bonds issued for capital
construction in accordance with GASB Statement No. 62. Capitalization of interest Cost. as amended.
Accordingly. capitalized interest for the year ended June 30. 201? was $933151 for the Water Fund.
There was no capitalized interest recognized in the Sewage Disposal Fund in fiscal year 2017.

Construction in progress is related to buildings. improvements. or infrastructure that has not yet been
placed in service for the intended use. These costs include contract costs (materials. labor. and overhead)
as well as professional fees and interest incurred during the construction period. Upon completion.
construction in progress costs are transferred to the appropriate capital asset classification. A periodic
review of projects included in construction in progress identified projects that were suspended or canceled
during the period. These identi?ed projects were removed from construction in progress and recorded as
operations and maintenance costs.

Taxes and City: Services

The Department pays no direct federal. state. or local taxes. except local taxes on excess property and
federal Social Security taxes. The Department reimburses the City for most of the direct services
furnished by other city departments. including general staff services. Charges are billed for all water and
sewerage services provided to city departments.

Shared Costs

Costs related to shared facilities and personnel are allocated to the Department on a basis that relates
costs incurred to the fund bene?ted.

Note 1 - Nature of Business and Signi?cant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Comgensated Absences

The liability for compensated absences reported in the basic financial statements consists of unpaid,
accumulated vacation and sick leave balances. The iiability has been calculated using the vesting method.
in which leave amounts for both employees who are currently eligible to receive termination payments and
other employees who are expected to become eligible in the future to receive such payments upon
termination are included. Vacation leave is accrued as bene?ts are earned by employees and it is
probable that the City will compensate the employees for the bene?ts through paid time off or other
means, such as cash payments at termination or retirement. The liability has been calculated based on
employees? current salary level and includes salary-related costs Social Security and Medicare tax).
The current year accruals are based on estimates, and payments are based on actuals.

Bond PremiumsI Discounts, and Deferred Amounts on Refundino

Bond premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method, and deferred amounts
on refunding are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the bonds. Bonds payable are
reported net of the applicable bond premium and discounts. Deferred amounts on refunding are reported
as deferred out?ows and deferred in?ows of resources.

Long-term Obligations

In accordance with contractual agreements with GLWA. the Department continues to be responsible for
funding its share of the GLWA bonds that are estimated to have been used to improve the local DWSD
system. The Department has been assigned a portion of the City of Detroit. Michigan?s ?nancial recovery
bonds, which had been used to fund prebankruptcy operating obligations. There are also outstanding
revenue bonds and state revolving fund loans at year end. All of these amounts are reported as long-term
obligations in the statement of revenue, expenses. and changes in net position.

Deferred Out?owsfin?ows of Resources

In addition to assets, the statement of net position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
outflows of resources. This separate ?nancial statement element represents a consumption of net position
that applies to a future period and so will not be recognized as an out?ow of resources (expense) until
then. The Department has one item that quali?es for reporting in this category. The item is the deferred
out?ows of resources related to the City's defined bene?t pension plan reported in both the Water Fund
and Sewage Disposal Fund. The deferred out?ows of resources related to the de?ned bene?t pension
plan result from three transactions: contributions to the de?ned bene?t pension plan subsequent to June
30, 2015. the variance between the plan's actual investment earnings compared to the plan's assumed
investment earnings. and changes in assumptions related to economic and demographic factors. The
amounts deferred for changes in assumptions are amortized over the expected remaining service lives of
all active and inactive employees who are provided with pensions. The amounts deferred resulting from
the variance between actual investment earnings and assumed investment earnings and are amortized
over a closed ?ve-year basis.

In addition to liabilities. the statement of net position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred
in?ows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of net position
that applles to a future period and so will not be recognized as an in?ow of resources (revenue) until that
time. The Department has one item that quali?es for reporting in this category. The item is the deferred
inflows of resources related to the City's de?ned bene?t pension plan reported in both the Water Fund and
Sewage Disposal Fund. The deferred in?ows of resources related to the de?ned bene?t pension plan
result from two transactions: differences between expected and actual experience and changes in
assumptions related to economic and demographic factors. These amounts are amortized over the
expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees who are provided with pensions.

Note 1 - Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Net Position
The Department's net position is categorized as follows:

Net Investment in Capital Assets - This consists of capital assets. net of accumulated depreciation, and
net of capital-related debt.

Restricted The net position has been legally restricted by outside parties or by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation.

Unrestricted - This consists of assets that do not meet the de?nition of "restricted? or ?net investment in
capital assets."

Net Position Flow Assumgtion

Sometimes. the Department will fund outlays for a particular purpose from both restricted restricted
bond or grant proceeds) and unrestricted resources. In order to calculate the amounts to report as
restricted net position and unrestricted net position in the Department?s ?nancial statements, a flow
assumption must be made about the order in which the resources are considered to be applied. It is the
Department's policy to consider restricted net position to have been depleted before unrestricted net
position is applied.

Revenue

The Department records unbilled revenue for services provided by the DWSD prior to year end by
accruing actual revenue billed in the subsequent month.

interest Exgense

Interest expense in the statement of revenue. expenses. and changes in net position includes amounts
related to the portion of rates and charges collected by the DWSD which relate to the accretion of
obligations payable to the Great Lakes Water Authority in respect to the interest payable on GLWA's
bonds and interest paid and accrued on outstanding financial recovery bondsr revenue bonds. and state
revolving fund loans.

Classification of Revenue and Exgenses
The Department classi?es its revenue and expenses as either operating or nonoperating.

Operating revenue includes activities that have the characteristics of exchange transactions. such as
revenue from charges for water service and sewerage services.

Nonoperating revenue includes activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange transactions, such
as contributions and investment income.

Operating expenses include the costs of operating the water and sewer utility systems, administrative
expenses. and depreciation on capital assets. All expenses not meeting this de?nition, including interest
expense. are reported as nonoperating expenses.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of basic ?nancial statements in conformity with requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic ?nancial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

As of June 30. 2017. several of the Department?s accounts were subject to signi?cant estimates as a
result of the leasing of assets to the Great Lakes Water Authority and are still pending negotiations.

Speciai item - Bifurcgtion

On January 1, 2016, the City of Detroit, Michgian, effectuated a lease agreement with the Great Lakes
Water Authority for the regional water system for the term of 40 years, to be extended automatically to
coincide with the ?nal maturity of any bonds issued to ?nance improvements to the regional or local water
systems. The service agreement and a corresponding lease of the regional water and sewer system
collectively provide for an annual lease payment of $50 million (of which $22,500,000 is currently allocated
to the Water Fund and $2?,500,000 is currently allocated to the Sewage Disposal Fund) in exchange for a
leasehold interest in the Water and Sewer System's water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plant,
certain public sewers, wastewater interceptors, transmission lines, and certain other assets, including
cash and investments held by the Department as of December 31, 2015, assignment of all revenue of the
regional and local water systems, and the assumption of all the DWSD bonded debt and certain liabilities.

The Department has continued to negotiate some of the ?nal issues concerning the bifurcation, including
the portion of the debt assumed by GLWA that was utilized for local system improvements, whose debt
will continue to be funded by the Department. As a result of these negotiations, the Department has
adjusted the recognition of the gain from the bifurcation in the current year by $85,895,242 in the Water
Fund and in the Sewage Disposal Fund.

Upcoming Accounting Pron ouncements

In June 2015, the GASB issued Statement No. T5, Accounting and Financiai Reporting for
Postempioyment Bene?ts Other than Pensions, which addresses reporting by governments that provide
postemployment bene?ts other than pensions (OPEB) to their employees and for governments that
finance OPEB for employees of other governments. This OPEB standard will require the Department to
recognize on the face of the ?nancial statements its proportionate share of the City's net DPEB liability
related to its participation in the supplemental death benefit plan. The Department is currently evaluating
the impact this standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this
statement are effective for the Department?s ?nancial statements for the year ending June 30, 2018.

In November 2018, the Govemmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No. 83,
Certain Asset Retirement Obiigations, which establishes criteria for determining the timing and pattern of
recognition of a liability and a corresponding deferred out?ow of resources for asset retirement obligations.
The Department is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on the ?nancial statements when
adopted. The provisions of this statement are effective for the Department?s financial statements for the
2019 ?scal year.

In June 2017, the Govemmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No. 87, Leases,
which improves accounting and ?nancial reporting for leases by governments. This statement requires
recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that were previously classi?ed as operating
leases and recognized as in?ows of resources or outflows of resources based on the payment provisions
of the contract. it establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that
leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. Under this statement, a lessee is required to
recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize
a lease receivable and a deferred in?ow of resources. The Department is currently evaluating the impact
this standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this statement are
effective for the Department's ?nancial statements for the year ending June 30, 2021.

Michigan Compiled Laws Section 129.91 (Public Act 20 of 1943, as amended) authorizes local
governmental units to make deposits and invest in the accounts of federally insured banks, credit unions,
and savings and loan associations that have offices in Michigan. The law also allows investments outside
the state of Michigan when fully insured. The local unit is allowed to invest in bonds, securities, and other
direct obligations of the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States; repurchase
agreements; bankers acceptances of United States banks; commercial paper rated within the two highest
classifications, which matures not more than 270 days after the date of purchase; obligations of the State
of Michigan or its political subdivisions, which are rated as investment grade; and mutual funds composed
of investment vehicles that are legal for direct investment by local units of government in Michigan.

There are no limitations or restrictions on participant withdrawals for the investment pools that are
recorded at amortized cost.

The Department's cash and investments are subject to several types of risk, which are examined in more
detail below:

Custodial Credit Risk of Bank Deposits

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the Department's deposits may not be
returned to it. The Department does not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. At year end, the
Department had $54,399,204 of bank deposits (certi?cates of deposit and checking and savings
accounts) that were uninsured and uncollateralized. The Department believes that due to the dollar
amounts of cash deposits and the limits of FDIC insurance, it is impractical to insure all deposits. As a
result, the Department evaluates each ?nancial institution with which it deposits funds and assesses the
level of risk of each institution; only those institutions with an acceptable estimated risk level are used as
depositories.

Custodial Credit Risk of investments

Custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty, the Department will not
be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of an
outside party. The Department does not have a policy for custodial credit risk. As of June 30, 201?, the
Department had no investments subject to custodial credit risk.

interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of investments will decrease as a result of a rise in interest rates.
The Department's investment policy does not restrict investment maturities other than commercial paper,
which can only be purchased with a ETD-day maturity. At year end, the Department had no investments
subject to interest rate risk.

Credit Risk

State law limits investments in commercial paper to the top two ratings issued by nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations. The Department has no investment policy that would further limit its
investment choices, As of year end, the Department had no investments subject to credit risk.

Note 3 - Restricted Assets

Restricted assets, principally cash and investments, are available for debt service revenue requirements

Note 5 - Long-term Debt (Continued)

Per the Water and Sewer Services agreement between the DWSD and GLWA dated June 12, 2015 and
the Master Bend Ordinances dated October 7, 2015, as amended, the Detroit retail class continues to pay
its common?to?all share of debt service revenue requirements and its allocated share of debt service
revenue requirements associated with improvements to the local water and sewer systems. Payments on
the debt service incurred by GLWA on the outstanding revenue bonds assumed as of December 31, 2015
are to be allocated using an agreed-upon percentage of total debt service associated with bond ?nanced
local improvements over the life of such bonds. though the bonds themselves continue to be secured by
the net revenue of GLWA, which includes all revenue payable by the Detroit retail class. As of June 30,
2017, the parties were still working to resoive the allocation percentage. Subsequent to June 30, 2017,
the parties reached a tentative agreement on the debt allocation, subject to board approval. During 2017,
as a result of continued negotiations on the allocation percentage, the DWSD revised its obligation
payable to GLWA in the amount of $79,360,077 and $64,026,310 in the Water Fund and Sewage
Disposal Fund, respectively. These amounts, along with other bifurcation-related adjustments. are
recognized as a special item (bifurcation loss) in the statement of revenue, expenses, and changes in net
position.

Financial Recovery Bonds

On December 10, 2014, the City issued approximately $1.3 billion of debt. The Financial Recovery Bonds,
Series 2014?Bf1) and Series total $816,560,047 and $15,404,098, respectively. They are
federally taxable. The bonds] interest rate is 4.0 percent per annum from December 10, 2014 through and
including March 31, 2034 and 6.0 percent per annum thereafter until the maturity date of April 1, 2044.
The bonds were delivered to classes of creditors in satisfaction of (1) Class 12 OPEB claims (the bonds
were distributed to the new Voluntary Employee Bene?ciary Associations (VEBA) for the general retirees
and police and ?re retirees), Class 9 Pension Obligation Certi?cate (POC) claims, and other
unsecured bankruptcy claims.

The Financial Recovery Bonds, Series 2014-0 total $88,430,021. The bonds bear interest at 5.0 percent
per annum. The bonds mature on December 10, 2026. The bonds are unsecured but city revenue from its
parking garages will provide the required debt service. If the parking garage revenue is insuf?cient, then
the City?s General Fund will provide the necessary debt service funds. The 2014-0 Bonds were issued as
part of the Syncora Settlement and FGICIPOC Settlement in the plan and on the effective date. As part of
the Plan of Adjustment, GLWA remains responsible to pay a portion of the debt; however, the entire debt
remains in the City?s name. The Department was allocated 11.21 percent and 11.55 percent of the Series
and Series 2014-0 debt, respectively, of which portion of that allocation is 71.42 percent
and the portion of that allocation is 28.58 percent. The Department has recorded a liability for
the entire balance of the allocated debt and has also recorded a receivable from GLWA for the debt
allocated to GLWA that will be reimbursed to the Department.

Revenue Bonds

During the year, GLWA issued revenue bonds, of which new money in the amount of $50,740,000 was
allocated to the DWSD. Proceeds from the bonds provided ?nancing for improvements to the local water
system. The bonds are secured by the net revenue of GLWA and the DWSD. GLWA's master bond
ordinance requires collections of DWSD receipts to be deposited into trust accounts controlled by the
master bond ordinance (through which will be used, among other things, to fund debt principal
and interest.

State Revolving Fund Loans

The Department (Water Fund) received loans from the State of Michigan Revolving Loan Fund totaling
$1,268,474 during the year ended June 30, 2017. The proceeds of the loans were used to pay costs of
making certain repairs and improvements to the water system and are reported as a long-term liability on
the statement of net position. The Department (Water Fund) also recorded nonoperating revenue in the
amount of $2,305,284 related to principal forgiveness on state revolving loans.

Note 6 - Contingent Liabilities

The Department is subject to various governmental environmental laws and regulations. GASB Statement
No. 49, Accounting and Financiai Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations, established accounting
and financial reporting standards for pollution {including contamination) remediation obligations, which are
obligations to address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in
pollution remediation activities such as site assessments and cleanups. The standard excludes pollution
prevention or control obligations with respect to current operations, and future pollution remediation
activities that are required upon retirement of an asset, such as land?ll closure and postclosure care. The
Department determined that there were no estimated pollution remediation obligations to be recorded at
June 36, 2617.

The Department is also a defendant in numerous alleged claims, lawsuits, billing disputes, and other
stated and pending demands. The Department's and the City's tegal department have estimated a
reserve, which is included in the accompanying basic ?nancial statements, for the potential outcome of
such claims or the amount of potential damages in the event of an unfavorable outcome for each of the
above contingencies. The Department?s management and the City's legal department believe that any
differences in reserved amounts and ?nal settlement, after consideration of claims covered by insurance,
resulting from such litigation will not materially impact the Department's ?nancial position or results of
operations.

Binns vs. Detroit and Detroit Alliance Against Rain Tax vs. Detroit are class action lawsuits challenging the
Department's drainage charge as a violation of the Michigan constitution's Headlee Amendment. The
cases have been consolidated and orlginal jurisdiction lies in the Michigan Court of Appeals. The
Department anticipates a ruling in the fourth quarter of ?scal year 2618. The class plaintiffs seek a ruling
that the Department's drainage charge is an illegal tax and all customer classes are entitled to a refund
under the Headlee Act of all drainage charges paid during the previous year, which amounted to
approximately $136 million (the 16,666+ class members in Michigan Warehousing vs. Detroit released
their claims and are precluded from relief). If the Court rules in the plaintiffs? favor, the Department would
not be able to impose drainage charges in the future unless voters approve a millage. The City of Detroit,
Michigan, currently assesses the maximum millage allowed by law; thus, an additional tax could not be
imposed. The nonprevailing party will likely appeal.

The City holds various commercial insurance policies to cover other potential loss exposures.

Note 7 - Risk Management

The Department is exposed to various risks of loss related to property loss. torts, errors and omissions,
and employee injuries (workers? compensation} as well as medical bene?ts provided to employees. The
Department is self insured for losses such as workers? compensation, legal, disability bene?ts, and
vehicular liabilities. There is also a risk of loss associated with providing health, dental. and life insurance
bene?ts to employees and retirees.

The Department, through the City, provides health and dental insurance bene?ts to employees and certain
retirees through self-insured health plans that are administered by third-party administrators. The
Department does not purchase excess or stop-loss insurance for its self-insured health plans.

The Department purchases public of?cial liability insurance, property insurance for certain properties, and
general liability insurance for accidents occurring at certain properties. The Department assumes a
$250,000 self-insured retention for any one loss or occurrence under its self-insured public of?cial liability
program. The Department purchases excess liability insurance for its general liability for certain properties
that provides per occurrence and aggregate protection. The Department is fully self insured for
environmental-related liabilities and purchases no excess environmental liability insurance. Settled claims
relating to the commercial insurance have not exceeded the amount of insurance coverage in any of the
past three ?scal years.

The Department estimates the liability for claims that have been incurred through the end of the ?scal
year, including claims that have been reported as well as those that have not yet been reported. Changes
in the estimated liability for the past taro ?scal years were as follows:

Note 8 - Pension Plans
Plan Description

The Department participates in the City of Detroit General Retirement System (the "System?}. The System
is a single-employer plan composed of a de?ned benefit plan component and a de?ned contribution
annuity plan component. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor bene?ts to plan members
and bene?ciaries. The plan is administered by its own board of trustees. Plan members include active
employees, retirees, and bene?ciaries from various departments within the City. Bene?t terms have been
established by contractual agreements between the City and the employees? collective bargaining units;
amendments are subject to the same process.

The System issues publicly available financial reports that include financial statements and the reCtuired
supplementary information. The reports can be obtained from City of Detroit Retirement Systems, One
Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Ave, Suite 3000, Detroit, MI 46226 or obtained from the System's website
Detailed information about the pension plan's ?duciary net position is available in the
separately issued ?nancial report. The pension plan's ?duciary net position has been determined on the
same basis of accounting used by the pension plan. The Plan uses the economic resources measurement
focus and the full accrual basis of accounting. Investments are stated at fair value or estimated fair value.
Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. Employer
contributions to the plan are recognized when due pursuant to legal requirements. Bene?ts and refunds
are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan.

June 30, 201?

Note 3 - Pension Plans (Continued)

The City filed for bankruptcy in June 2013 and subsequently exited bankruptcy on December 10. 2014.
This resulted in the adoption of the Eighth Amended Plan for Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit
(the Under the provisions of the POA, effective July 1, 2014, the Combined Plan for General
Employees Retirement System of the City of Detroit was introduced.

As a result of negotiations between the City and the public employee unions, the existing plan bene?t
formulas were frozen and no employees were allowed to earn further bene?ts under the existing plans
after June 30, 2014. The emergency manager issued Order #30 {General Employees Retirement System
of the City of Detroit) on June 30, 2014, which put these changes into effect. This plan in existence as of
June 30, 2014 is known as the "legacy plan" or "Component ll".

As of July 1, 2014, all eligible employees began participating in the new hybrid pension plan, or
Component I. Eligible city employees will receive the bene?ts they have earned under the legacy
Component ll plan for services performed through June 30. 2014, plus an additional bene?t under the new
hybrid plan formula for services after June 30, 2014.

With respect to Component Il benefit adjustments resulting from the FDA, the pension settlement (for
which benefit levels were and are contingent on other factors, including receipt of outside contributions)
provided: for a loss of cost~of?living adjustments, or "escalators" paid after July 1, 2014; for a 4.5
percent reduction to the remaining accrued pension benefit after the COLA loss; and for plan members
who participated in the Annuity Savings Fund plan between 2003 and 2013, subject to certain caps,
recoupment of certain amounts of interest deemed by the City to be in ?excess? of that which should have
been credited to the individual ASF accounts, referred to as Recouprnent". ASF Recoupment, like
other provisions of the pension settlement, was not optional. Most members will pay their ASF
Recoupment by a deduction from their future pension bene?ts for a set term of months, including
interest calculated at 6.?5 percent. All members were offered a lump-sum cash option, which was limited
in the aggregate to $30 million in member recoupment. The FDA also included the possibility of
restoration of certain benefit reductions, based on a program for the most financially vulnerable
pensioners and beneficiaries through the State of Michigan Treasury Department as well as a new feature
of Component ll allowing restoration of bene?ts depending on the plan funding level overtime.

Nonemplover contributing entity within Component ll - On September 9, 2014, a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) was entered into by the emergency manager and mayor of the City of Detroit,
Michigan, county executive of each of the charter counties of Wayne and Macomb, the County of
Oakland. Michigan, and the governor of the State of Michigan. The purpose of the MOU was to establish a
framework for the creation of a regional authority (known as Great Lakes Water Authority or 
pursuant to Act 233 of 1955 to operate, control, and improve the regional assets of the water supply
system and the sewage disposal system owned by the City.

Pursuant to the MOU, the City of Detroit, Michigan and GLWA entered into two lease agreements: the
Regional Water Supply System Lease dated June 12, 2015 and the Regional Sewage Supply System
Lease dated June 12, 2015. Under the provisions of the lease agreements, GLWA leases the regional
assets of the City for a period of at least 40 years.

Pursuant to the lease agreements, on December 1, 2015, a tri-party agreement between the City of
Detroit, Michigan, General Retirement System of the City of Detroit (GRS), and GLWA was signed. Per
the FDA and Section 4.3 of the lease agreements, GLWA is required to pay a portion of the pension
obligation that will be allocable to the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. The purpose of the
pension reporting agreement is to set forth in determining the funding status for the DWSD pension pool,
and for GRS to agree to provide GLWA with certain actuarial and other reports to enable GLWA to
properly manage and pay its portion of the pension obligation that is allocable to the DWSD.

Note 8 - Pension Plans (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2016, GLWA was established. Accordingly, the prior DWSD division was split into
time: one representing the ongoing DWSD department, now referenced as DWSD Retail and
another to represent the Great Lakes Water Authority. In accordance with the pension reporting
agreement, the net position and liabilities of the DWSD were allocated to and GLWA in
accordance with written directions received from and GLWA. Per written directions, GLWA is to
be allocated 70.3 percent of the net position and liabilities of the DWSD. Because GLWA has no
employees or retirees in the Combined Plan, GLWA is considered a nonemployer contributing entity in
accordance with GASB Statement No. As this arrangement also meets the de?nition of a special
funding situation per GASB Statement No. 68, allocated pension expense of $6,30?,901 is
recognized by the Department as a revenue and expense.

Benefits Provided

Component ii - Component II is the legacy plan, the original de?ned bene?t plan, which includes a defined
benefit component and a de?ned contribution component. Component II generally applies to bene?ts
accrued by members prior to July 1, 2014. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor bene?ts to
plan members and bene?ciaries. Except as speci?cally provided in Combined Plan, bene?ts provided
under Component II are frozen effective June 30, 2014. Component II also includes the Income
Stabilization Fund. The fund, a part of Component II and established as a provision of the FDA, was
established for the sole purpose of paying the Income Stabilization Bene?ts and Income Stabilization
Bene?ts Plus to eligible pensioners.

The Income Stabilization Fund is outlined in Section 6-3 of the POA. The annual supplemental pension
income stabilization benefit is equal to the lesser of either the amount needed to restore an eligible
retiree?s reduced annual pension bene?t to 100 percent of the amount of the annual pension benefit that
the eligible retiree was receiving from the System in 2013; or (ii) the amount needed to bring the total
annual 2013 household income of the eligible retiree up to 130 percent of the Federal Poverty Level for
2013. The income Stabilization Fund did not have an impact on total pension liability for the systems or
the City as of the measurement date of June 30, 2016 because the assets held by the Income
Stabilization Fund are not considered to be available to fund the normal retirement benefit provisions
under the pension plan but instead are restricted to pay Income Stabilization Bene?ts and Income
Stabilization Bene?ts Plus. No liability currently exists for these bene?ts.

Postbankruptcy GRS Component ll plan members upon retirement will receive an annuity which shall be
the actuarial equivalent of the member?s accumulated contributions in the 1973 De?ned Contribution
Annuity Savings Fund at the time of retirement. In addition, each member will receive a basic service and
a membership service pension. The Basic Service Pension will consist of $12.00 per annum multiplied by
the number of years and fractions of years of credited service, not to exceed 10 years. The Membership
Service Pension will be calculated as follows:

a For members who retire on or before June 30, 1992, a membership service pension of 1.5 percent of
average ?nal compensation for the ?rst 10 years of service and 1.63 percent for service in excess of 10
years

- For members who retire on or after July 1, 1992 but prior to July 1, 1993, a membership service
pension of 1.5 percent of average ?nal compensation for each year of service for the ?rst 10 years,
plus 1.7 percent of average ?nal compensation for each year of service in excess of 10 years up to 20
years of service, plus 1.9 percent of average final compensation for each year of service in excess of
20 years. In no event shall bene?ts paid by the System exceed 90 percent of average ?nal
compensation.

percent of average ?nal compensation for each year of service; plus $12 for each year of city service
not to exceed $120. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for members of the Michigan Council 25 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO Local 2920 and the Detroit
Senior Water Systems Chemists Association bargaining units, the effective date of the 1.5 percent
multiplier was April 1, 2013 for all years of service rendered after that date. In no case shall benefits
paid by the System exceed 90 percent of average ?nal compensation.

In the event the eligible retiree's estimated adjusted annual household income in any calendar year after
the first year that the eligible retiree receives a benefit from the Income Stabilization Fund is less than 105
percent of the Federal Poverty Level in that year, the eligible retiree will receive an additional Income
Stabilization Bene?t Plus bene?t commencing as of the following July 1.

Component - Component is considered a "hybrid" plan because it includes a de?ned bene?t component
and a de?ned contribution component. Component of the plan document applies to bene?ts accrued by
members of the GRS on and after July 1, 2014. The Component I plan provides retirement, disability, and
survivor bene?ts to plan members and bene?ciaries.

Contributions

Article 9, Section 24 of the State of Michigan constitution requires that ?nancial benefits arising on account
of employee service rendered in each year be funded during that year. Accordingly, in the past, the
System retained an independent actuary to determine the annual contribution. Until 2024, contributions
are based on speci?c provisions of the Plan of Adjustment. After 2024, contributions will be actuarialiy
determined based on a 30-year level principal closed amortization.

Employer Contributions
Component ii

The Department made contributions of $12,741,300 to the System for the ?scal year ended June 30,
201?.

Component i

Per Section 9.3 of the Combined Plan, commencing on July 1, 2015 and ending on June 30, 2023, the
Department is required to contribute 5 percent of compensation of active members. During the fiscal year
ended June 30, 201?, the Department contributed $1 ?12,219 to the Component I plan.

Employee Contributions

Contribution requirements of plan members are estabiished and may be amended by the board of
trustees in accordance with the City Charter, union contracts, and plan provisions. For the year ended
June 30, 2017, there were no employee contributions into Component II, as the plan was frozen as of
June 30, 2014. Effectively, employee contributions were allowed only until August 1, 2014. Contributions
into Component I began with the members' ?rst payroll date occurring in August 2014. With respect to
GRS Component I, the Departments employees who are members of GRS are now required to make
mandatory contributions of 4 percent of pay toward their defined bene?t. Additionally, employees can
make voluntary contributions of 3, 5, or 7 percent of annual pay. During the ?scal year ended June 30,
2017. the Department's employees contributed $1,424,205 in mandatory and voluntary contributions.

Net Pension Liability

As permitted by GASB Statement No. 63, the Department has chosen to use June 30, 2016 as its
measurement date for the net pension liability. The net pension liability was calculated using the total
pension liability and the Systems' ?duciary net position as of June 30, 2016. The June 30, 2016 total
pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation performed as of June 30, 2015, which used
updated procedures to roll forward the estimated liability to June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2013. the
Department reported a liability for its net pension liability as follows:

From the above table, the Plan reported $12,741,300 and $1,012,219 for Components It and l,
respectively, as deferred out?ows of resources resulting from employer contributions subsequent to the
measurement date, which will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended

Actuarial Assumptions

The total pension liability in each actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement:

 

Component II Component 
In?ation WA
Salary increases MA 2.0 3.0%
Investment rate of return (net of investment expenses} 7.23% 123%

Based on an experience study from 2008-2013 issued in February 2015, the modality table assumption
was based on the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table for males and females. The tables are projected
to be fully generational, based on the two-dimensional sex distinct mortality scale NIP-2014.

The actuarial assumptions other than mortality and the investment rate of return, used in the June 30,
2015 valuation to calculate the total pension liability as of June 30, 2016, were based on the results of an
actuarial experience study for the period from 2002-2007.

Discount Rate

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 2016 was 7.23 percent for both
Components and Il; however. the single discount rate used at the beginning of the year was 2.51 percent
for both plans. For the Component ll plan. the projection of cash flows used to determine the discount
rates assumed that employee contributions will cease as of June 30. 2014 and that city contributions.
including contributions sourced from the proceeds of the sale of artwork from the State of Michigan and
the Foundation for Detroit?s Future. will be made at rates equal to those set by the ?nal Plan of Adjustment
through June 30. 2023 and a 30~year closed level dollar amortization thereafter. For the Component I
plan, the projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rates assumed that employee
contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be made at
rates equal to the difference between actuariaily determined contribution rates and the employee rate.
Based on those assumptions. the pension plans? ?duciary net position was projected to be available to
make all projected future bene?t payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore. the long-
term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected bene?t
payments to determine the total pension liability.

investment Rate of Return

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building~block
method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns. net of
pension plan investment expense and in?ation} are developed for each major asset class. These ranges
are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates
of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected in?ation. Best estimates of
geometric real rates of return as of June 30. 2016 for each major asset class including pension plan target
asset allocation. as disclosed in the investment footnote. are summarized in the following table:

Note 9 - Other Postemployment Benefits

In prior years, the City offered retiree health care, life insurance. and supplemental death benefits. Under
the City's Plan of Adjustment approved in the Bankruptcy Case. the City restructured retiree health
bene?ts through the creation of two voluntary employee bene?ciary associations (or VEBAs). The
Employee Health and Life Insurance Bene?t Plan was signi?cantly reduced on March 1, 2014 and
terminated on December 31. 2014. The supplemental death bene?ts plan was also closed as of
December 10! 2014; bene?ts to be paid to individuals retiring prior to that date are limited to the assets
allocated to the closed plan. There are no further contribution requirements for the City or for plan
members.

The City continues to provide certain death bene?ts to its employees providing services after December
10. 2014. The remainder of this note relates solely to those bene?ts.

Plan Description

The Supplemental Death Bene?t Plan {the "Supplemental Plan") is a prefunded single-employer de?ned
bene?t plan administered by the employee bene?t board of trustees and is accounted for in the City's
Employee Death Bene?ts Fund. The Supplemental Plan does not issue a separate standalone ?nancial
statement. The money is held in the City of Detroit Employee Bene?t Trust and the City uses the trust fund
to account for the Supplemental Plan.

Funding Poiicy

The City is under no legal obligation to prefund the plan bene?ts. Plan members have no contribution
requirements. While the City has made contributions in prior years no contributions were made during
the year ended June 30, 2017'.

Funding Progress

For the year ended June 30. 201?. the City has estimated the cost of providing these other
postemployment bene?ts through an actuarial valuation as of June 30. 2016. The valuation computes an
annual required contribution, which represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis. is
projected to cover normal costs each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities over a period not
to exceed 30 years. This valuation's computed contribution and actual funding are summarized as follows:

 

Annual required contribution (recommended) 10.104
Interest on the prior year's net OPEB obligation 45,091
Less adiustment to the annual required contribution 121,541)
Annual DPEB cost Increase in net DPEB obligation 34,554

Note 9 - Other Postemployment Benefits (Continued)

Funded Status and Funding Progress

As of June 30, 2016. the most recent actuarial valuation date for the Supplemental Plan. the actuarial
accrued liability for bene?ts related to all city employees was $3,292,916 and the actuarial value of assets
was $4,002,000, resulting in an unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) of The covered
payroll (annual payroll of all active city employees covered by the plan) was $449,330,941 and the ratio of
the UAAL to the covered payroll was (0.2) percent.

The preceding ?gures do not include the closed plan. The closed plan includes assets of approximately
$21.4 million. which equals the actuarial accrued liability of the plan as of June 30, 2017.

Methods and Assumptions

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and
assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include
assumptions about future employment, mortality. and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined
regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject
to continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made
about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented above, presents multi-year trend
information about whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative
to the actuarial accrued liabilities for bene?ts.

Projections of bene?ts for ?nancial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as
understood by the employer and the plan members) and include the types of bene?ts provided at the time
of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of bene?t costs between the employer and plan
members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are
designed to reduce the effects of short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value
of assets consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations.

In the June 30, 2010 actuarial valuation. the individual entry age actuarial cost method was used. The
actuarial assumptions included a percent investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses).
which is a blended rate of the expected long-term investment returns on plan assets and on the
employer's own investments calculated based on the funded level of the plan at the valuation date and an
annual healthcare cost trend rate of 12 percent initially reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5
percent after 10 years. Both rates included a 4.5 percent in?ation assumption. The actuarial value of
assets was determined using techniques that spread the effects of short-term volatility in the market value
of investments over a ?ve-year period. The UAAL is being amortized as a level percentage of projected
payroll on an open basis. The remaining amortization period at June 30, 2016 was 30 years. The mortality
tables used by the Supplemental Plan to evaluate the death bene?ts to be paid for general retirees were
100 percent of the RP 2014 Blue Collar Annuitant table set forward one year.

Page 221

 Capital Improvement Plan
• This CIP should be considered a planning document – the
CIP is an evolving plan that requires continual review and
modification during the course of each year. The estimates
indicated in the early years of the report are likely more
precise than those in the later years.
• The following table details the planned expenditures for the
Fiscal Years 2019-2023 CIP. Expenditures are focused on
replacement, installation and/or abandonment of existing
water mains, replacement of inoperable fire hydrants,
rehabilitation of sewer systems, management of storm
water with green infrastructure, upgrades to information
technology systems, replacing aging equipment and
vehicles, as well as rehabilitation of facilities that support
the operation of the utility.

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Supplemental Analysis for Monthly Accounts Receivable Aging Report

Background: As part of this month’s Wholesale Accounts Receivable Aging Report (and
provided detail) included in the Revenues and Collection Report, there were several accounts
with balances that require additional information.
Analysis: The analysis by customer category is shown below.
Wholesale Water Customers
City of Flint: The ‘46 to 74 Days’ outstanding balance of $397,357.73 and the ‘75 to 104 Days’
outstanding credit balance 92,970.46 were due to the unusual reporting of credits and charges
on the aging. This was a result of the way BS&A was configured to apply Flint’s prior credit
balance and the new, Karegnondi Water Authority Debt Service credit. Their account has since
been corrected to ‘redistribute’ those credits and this should not happen in the future.
Industrial Waste Control (IWC) Customers
Canton Township, Northville Township and Plymouth Township: All three customers are a part
of the Western Township Utilities Authority (WTUA) which had previously sent wastewater
flows though the Rouge Valley system. Around July 1, 2017 WTUA began sending its
wastewater flows to the Ypsilanti Township Utilities Authority (YCUA) including those related to
industrial waste. GLWA’s IWC department has been in contact with WTUA regarding the
discontinuation of IWC services, however the one issue that remained was related to the
physical changes made to the WTUA system to ensure no flows would enter the Rouge Valley
system. This inquiry has since been satisfied and the last item to bring this to closure is the
formal release of GLWA as the IWC regulator. GLWA’s Office of the General Counsel has been
notified. It is anticipated that these balances will be corrected once this action is complete.

Addendum Page 1

 Pollutant Surcharge (PS) Customers
Faygo Beverages, Inc.: Faygo has a total balance due of $177,251.40, of which, $151,707.34 is
46 or more days outstanding. Faygo is a customer within the City of Detroit, but Faygo is billed
directly for Pollutant Surcharge by GLWA. Because of the Agency relationship outlined in the
Water and Sewer Services Agreement GLWA relies on the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage
Department (DWSD) staff to follow up on customer accounts within the City of Detroit. It is
GLWA’s understanding that Faygo stopped paying their bills around December 2017 as part of a
billing dispute. GLWA billing staff will follow up with DWSD billing staff to coordinate a
response.
General Linen Supply Co.: General Linen has a total balance due of $55,137.92 of which,
$43,019.81 is 46 or more days outstanding. Similar to Faygo, General Linen is a customer
within the City of Detroit but is billed directly for Pollutant Surcharge by GLWA. It is GLWA’s
understanding that General Linen stopped paying their bills around December 2017 as part of a
billing dispute. GLWA billing staff will follow up with DWSD billing staff to coordinate a
response.
Budget Impact: The loss of the WTUA IWC customers will result in negative revenue variance
of almost $697,000 for FY 2018, based on the current IWC meter counts.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Andrew Sosnoski, Manager, Construction Accounting & Financial Reporting
Re:

Construction Work-in-Progress Report through September 30, 2017

Background: The inaugural construction work-in-progress report (CWIP) for the Great
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) as of June 30, 2017 was issued on September 27, 2017. Since
then, additional resources and business processes have been put in place for an expanded
quarterly report. Attached is the first quarter report for FY 2018 as of September 30, 2017.
Additions to this report include an accounting of how “allowances” and “programs” are
drawn upon to support capital delivery at GLWA. This report also presents operational
adjustments to the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) utilizing a budget amendment feature in
GLWA’s financial system. This will support accurate monthly cashflow projections for
managing capital funds as well as refining planning data.
Analysis: Highlights from the attached report will be noted at the Audit Committee meeting.
It should be noted that the second quarter FY 2018 report as of December 31, 2017 will be
presented at the April 20, 2018 Audit Committee meeting.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Report Contents and Organization 
This report is divided into two sections:  one for the Water System and one for the Wastewater System as identified in the table of 
contents.  Each section includes analysis and reporting of the following: 
Percent of Spend Compared to Budget and Capital Improvement Plan Requests:  Presentation of spend information is necessary 
to report our progress on CIP projects. 
Analysis of Projects with Largest Percent of Spend and Otherwise Noteworthy Projects:  A combination of commentary and 
analysis provides further insight into risk factors and project status.  An excerpt from the CIP for each of the selected projects 
follows the commentary as further background information.

 Construction Work‐in‐Progress Quarterly Report 
As of September 30, 2017 

Construction Work‐in‐Progress Rollforward:  This table provides a list of all projects in the CIP along with status or financial 
activity.  This table may be used to revisit priorities, workload, and phasing. 
Budget Amendments / Allowance & Program Analysis:  This information identifies the specific usage and the reallocation of 
allowance and program budgets to CIP projects 

Financial Information 
All project amounts are unaudited and are “pre‐close”.  This means that direct contractor costs are generally included in these totals with most 
pay estimates entered through September 30, 2017.  There may, however, be some pay estimates that lag.  The totals do not include indirect 
overhead or capitalized interest.   

Future Enhancements 
This report presents information that is readily available.  Currently under development are enhancements that will provide the opportunity for 
improved CWIP reporting. 
Monthly Capital Spend Projections ‐  Improvements are underway related to preliminary monthly spend information, projected out for 
the duration of the CIP, and communicated with Treasury to allow for investment optimization.  This reporting is being developed as a 
joint effort with our engineering partners.  This will also allow for improved accuracy of our Key Performance Indicator on rate of 
spending. 
Direct Labor Capitalization – Technology solutions are being evaluated to improve direct labor capture accuracy, timeliness and ease in 
which labor cost are captured. 
Indirect Labor Capitalization ‐  Presently an effort to identify indirect labor related to the capital process is underway.

Alignment of Budget & CIP  – During the development of the FY 2019–2023 CIP Plan, FY 2018 budgeted CIP was reforecast to align with 
anticipated spend.  The resulting budget amendments will be entered and reflected in future period CWIP reports. 
Key Performance Indicators – KPI’s under consideration include CIP spend vs book value assets, percentage growth of project in amount 
and duration, actual vs planned number of projects completed, and actual vs planned monthly capital spend.

WATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend of is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 37.9% and for FY 2018 (three months) of 16.2% 
are lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 25% respectively.  This is attributable to three reasons.  First, competition for staff priorities 
during stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017).  Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to 
carry out the projects.  Several key hires occurred during the past year which will improve this performance.  Third, is the phasing of CIP activity 
which is being further refined throughout GLWA.

FY 2018 Last Pay Estimate Processed:  01/27/2017 
Key Contracts/Vendors:  SCP‐DWS‐018 Z Contractors 
Project Description:  Construction of a new bypass around Ypsilanti Station, joining the Ypsilanti Station Discharge to the Joy Road section.  A FY 
2017 budget amendment funded this project from the Water Transmission Improvement Program – 170400 
Purpose:  The project is to bypass a broken valve that is not easily accessible and costly to replace. 
Status:  Project was delayed significantly by easement issues.  Project on hold pending early termination. 
Additional Project Manager Comments:  GLWA is in the process of negotiating an early termination of the project without prejudice to the 
vendor.  Due to ground water contamination site‐specific issues at the station, repairing or replacing the malfunctioning gate valve requires too 
large a shutdown to be viable.  Project needs to be redesigned to address zero ground water infiltration issues.  Work completed to date on 
project will be able to be reused on the new design.

The purpose of the construction work‐in‐progress (CWIP) rollforward is to analyze the current year activity for each project in relation to the 
overall capital improvement program as well as the project portfolio overall.   
The CWIP Rollforward provides a project status for each item. 
Future Year: Project that was included in the CIP with no expenditures (F) 
Active: Project in which procurement process has been initiated and expenditures incurred (A) 
Pending Close: Project that has no projected expenditures for the current fiscal year and has reached substantial completion (PC) 
Closed: Project that has been closed and capitalized (C) 
Projects in bold font on the CWIP Rollforward were discussed in further detail previously in this report.  
As shown in the summary below, the Water System CWIP Rollforward for FY 2018-2022 identifies 109 projects with a total value of $1.17 
billion.  Of that total, $163.5 million (pre‐close, unaudited) is in CWIP as of September 30, 2017 as shown in the table beginning on the next

WASTEWATER SYSTEM 
Percent of Spend Compared to Annual Budget and Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) Requests 
The rate of spend is a key performance indicator.  The ratios for FY 2017 (twelve months) of 55% and for FY 2018 (three months) of 50.1% are 
lower than simple benchmark of 80% and 25% respectively. This is attributable to three reasons. First, competition for staff priorities during 
stand‐up of the GLWA (primarily during FY 2017). Second, is the alignment of projects identified and staff or contractor resources to carry out 
the projects. Several key hires occurred primarily during fiscal FY 2017 will improve this performance. Third, is the phasing of CIP activity which 
is being further refined throughout GLWA.

Key Contract/Vendor: Walsh Construction 
Project Description/Purpose: The new CIP Project 260113: Fire Remediation project addresses the uninsured capital work at the Water 
Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) resulting from the fire which occurred March 2016. 
Status: The facility has been restored to service but installation of a new fire pump and related electrical work remains to be completed in FY 
2018.  A PO for the required transformers has been initiated.  The transformers have a 16 week delivery lead time. 
Additional Project Manager Comments: PMA is assisting GLWA in managing the Fire Remediation project (both insured and non‐insured 
capital and O&M work). The additional cost of replacing the North side conveyor resulting from the fire is not included in the scope of this 
project. 

A full presentation on this project was submitted to the Board of Directors on February 28, 2018.
