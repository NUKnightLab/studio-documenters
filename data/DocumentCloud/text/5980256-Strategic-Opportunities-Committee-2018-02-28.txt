Re:

February 28th Strategic Opportunities Committee Meeting Information

This memo provides a brief overview of the Strategic Opportunities Committee (SOC) meeting on
Wednesday, February 28th from 1:00-3:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
We hope you will be able to join us.
First, we want to discuss our efforts to develop a four-year Violence Prevention Plan, in keeping with a
statutory obligation to “develop, publish, and facilitate the implementation of a 4-year statewide violence
prevention plan” that “incorporates public health, public safety, victim services, and trauma recovery
centers and services.” We are currently developing a survey of state-level stakeholders to catalog
resources and programing for violence prevention, and planning more intensive interviews with
stakeholders following the survey. This is our first step in the asset-mapping phase of the violence
prevention plan.
Second, staff will give updates on ICJIA’s involvement with three task forces that impact important state
criminal justice concerns: the Illinois Supreme Court Commission on Pretrial Practices, which has
initiated a comprehensive review of Illinois' pretrial detention system in order to provide guidance and
recommendations for reform; the Governor’s Opioid Prevention and Intervention Task Force, which is
continuing its collaboration with public health and criminal justice to address the opioid crisis; and the
Opportunities for At-Risk Women Task Force. You will find descriptions of the charge to each in the
attachments.
Third, we will present the ways in which ICJIA addresses the priorities identified by Board members at
the November 30, 2017 Board meeting. Staff have collected funding opportunities and research projects
that relate to each of the priorities identified, and we hope to both offer details on these to interested
parties, and gather information from Board members on relevant programming. To this end, we request
you review the priorities (attached as a PDF of PowerPoint slides) and bring information about non-ICJIA
programming that addresses these concerns. For example, one priority was bond reform. We heard that
stakeholders in Cook County were partnering to tackle this issue, and further information on this effort
might assist our agency’s work under the Pretrial Practices Commission. With your assistance, we will be
able to improve outreach for the opportunities our agency provides and spread awareness of the efforts
and new knowledge produced by the criminal justice system as a whole.
We look forward to your participation and guidance.
