 Appendices
A. 2009-2013 Actual Spending
The 2009-2013 Plan projected resources of $1.98 billion. Howeveq, the
Plan relied in part on finding $530 million in new revenues, which
were never realized. In fact, the Plan led to actual spending of $1.67
billion during that time frame.

The 2014-2018 Plan projects a realistic revenue base of $1.31 billion that
relies on funding that can be identifíed and contidently forecast. These
funds include the City's continuing deep commitment to affordable housing, with a projected L9% increase in Corporate and TIF funds, from actual
investments of $184 million between 2009 and 2013 to $219 million over
the next five years.

In additioru the Plan relied on onetime or diminishing federal funding
sources that amounted to $3L7 million that are no longer available to

The City is also committed to seeking new funding from federal and private sources for the 2014Plan, and to commit these funds to the preservation and creation of additional housing units.

Many renters and owners are'cost-burdened'

The bulk of the City's housing resources, especially federal dollars, are specifically targeted to

affordable rental housing. Some government-assisted buildings with expiring use restrictions

and project-based Section 8 contracts are stable, while others may be at risk due to strengthen-

ing markets and other concerns. DPD will continue to workwith owners, community groups
and The Preservation Compact to monitor these properties and coordinate preservation efforts.
One of the most efficient ways to provide affordable housing is to improve and preserve

existing buildings. The City will continue to support programs such as the Troubled Build-

o

ings Initiative, the Energy Savers Fund, the Multi-UnitAffordability through Upfront Investment (MAUI) program, the Tax Increment Financing-Neighborhood Improvement Program
(TIF-NIP), and the TIF Purchase Rehab Program. The City supports proposed tax incentives to
encourage owners to rehabilitate and retrofit rental buildings while keeping units affordable.

4.2 Protect affordability for Chicago's most vulnerable
The City will work to expand the number of affordable units available across different types
of markets, with special attention to renter populations at the lowest income levels and those
that require supportive services. The Keep Chicago Renting Ordinance, approved by the City
Council ìn June 201.3, will protect renters housed in buildings whose owners are in foreclosure.
The City

will

also pursue new sources of funding for affordable units, as outlined in Strategy

2.2.

The City

will continue to work with the Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust Fund, which pro-

vides homes for more than2,700 of the city's most-at-risk individuals and families each yea¡,
to fund its efforts and aid it in securing a long-term source of funding. The City

will support

construction of supportive housing units through the City's multifamily affordable housing
program, and will report on the number of units created for people with disabilities.
The State's mandate to provide housing to those with mental illness requires additional resou¡ces from the State and coordination between the City and the State. The City

will advo-

with the State and the Federal government for additional affordable housing resources
with comprehensive supportive services to help the State meet this mandate.
