color of the masonry on that elevation. Samples of mortar shall be

1501 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior and interior rehabilitation of the 2-story frame
building, a new 1-story rear addition, and a 1-story side addition.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The existing non-historic siding shall be removed and Landmarks staff
shall be contacted to inspect any uncovered historic wood siding and
any physical scarring of original window openings. Any visible
scarring shall provide guidance as to extent of new storefront system
and location, size, and shape of 2nd-floor windows. Historic wood
siding shall be retained and be repaired, wherever possible. Areas
beyond repair may be replaced with new wood siding to match the
historic siding in size, type and profile. Historic Preservation staff
shall review the condition of the siding prior to any work beginning
and shall approve any areas of replacement and the replacement
siding;

 2. The paired windows below the arched cornice on the Milwaukee
façade shall be 1/1 double-hung windows. Enlarged window and trim
details, cornice and bracket repair/replacement details, and new

revise the design to provide a better separation between the historic
frame building and rear masonry addition. The design of the Honore
Street façade shall be modified to have window panes or sashes at a
minimum of 3’wide each and the brick facade shall incorporate a short
base to be more compatible with the architectural character of the
historic properties of the district. The addition’s parapet height shall
be at code compliant guard rail height for the new rooftop deck and to
sufficiently screen the rooftop furnishings from being visible from
Milwaukee Avenue. Enlarged window, door, parapet, and trellis
details shall be provided for review and approval by Historic
Preservation staff as part of the permit application;
6. The rear facades of the new rear addition as well as the adjacent new
construction project, proposed to be concrete masonry units, shall be
changed to integral-colored concrete or brick masonry units in a color
that matches common brick or the Endicott iron-spot face brick;
7. All exterior wall material samples shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application; and,
8. The project may require a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.
In addition, staff recommends that the Committee finds that the amount of
demolition involved with the project, based on the submitted information,
does not trigger the requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing the
demolition of 40% or more of landmark buildings.
