Background
As part of CHA’s unit delivery strategy, the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for PDTs was created.
The unit delivery strategy builds on CHA’s experience working with private development teams
and owners to supply quality housing that enables low-income families to maximize their
potential for long-term economic success.

 CHA refined the scope for PDT’s to engage development partners for the acquisition,
development and management of both mixed-finance housing and mixed-use developments.
The RFQ provides a method to pre-qualify developers and creates opportunities for CHA to
provide capital loans and operating funds for new construction and rehabilitation of multi-family,
mixed-income and mixed-use projects that directly benefit CHA residents.
The selected respondents will be issued a “Letter of Qualification” and have two (2) years from
the date of that letter to submit proposals to CHA. CHA may provide financial investment or
enter-into-long term leases for the units, subject to Board, HUD and other approvals, if necessary.
