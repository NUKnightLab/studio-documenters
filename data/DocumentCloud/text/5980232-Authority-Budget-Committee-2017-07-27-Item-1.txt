MEMORANDUM

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Kevin Givens, Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

Date:

July 27, 2017

RE:

Continuation of Current Programs, Revised Chart*

Continuations of Current Programs
As Director Maki explained in his January 23, 2017, memorandum to the Board ICJIA
will be using standardized Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFO) to make JAG
awards, as required by the Grants Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) and
ICJIA’s Strategic Plan for JAG. Given ICJIA’s current staffing levels, it is not possible to
transition all JAG programs simultaneously to NOFO-driven awards; therefore, staff has
grouped the JAG programs into four primary strategic areas and will issue a staggered
series of corresponding NOFOs to which potential grantees will be able to apply over the
next two years per the schedule below.
Strategic Areas
Comprehensive Law Enforcement
Response to Narcotics
ICJIA Research and Evaluation
Court Programs
Correctional Programs

Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics NOFO awardees are listed on
Page 4 of this memo. Other programs offering comprehensive responses that did not fit
into the parameters of that NOFO also are in need of funding. While previously described
staffing limitations preclude the use of a competitive process at this time, staff
recommends designating the following funds to support those programs. Additional
information on each program is available in the attached Grant Recommendation Reports.
