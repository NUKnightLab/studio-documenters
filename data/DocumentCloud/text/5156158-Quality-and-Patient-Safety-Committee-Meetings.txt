Getting to Zero Illinois (gtzillinois.hiv)
GOAL & VISION
We want to make sure that the HIV epidemic is no longer able to sustain itself by
achieving both HIV prevention and access to care goals.
We want to see:
1. Zero new HIV transmissions
2. Zero people living with HIV who are not receiving treatment
Through increasing access and uptake of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis),
retaining more people living with HIV (PLWH) in care and the continued funding
of ongoing supportive services, we can get to zero in Illinois by 2030.

Cook County Health supports and is a partner in the GTZ
Illinois initiative.

Improve Quality of Life (QOL) for People living with HIV
Earlier diagnosis, linkage to care, retention in care, viral
suppression, managing co-morbidities-physical and mental
health, healthy aging, addressing social determinants of
health

Work towards ZERO NEW INFECTIONS
More people with undetectable viral loads (U=U), increase
access to Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) community
engagement, patient-centered research, strengthening
collaborations, advocacy

Patient Satisfaction Summary
• Low hospitalization rates despite high complexity of
patients supports the need for PCMH with wrap
around services.
• Most measures have continued to improve
• We will continue to work on wait times, patient flow.
• Standardized patient satisfaction surveys implemented
late 2018 across all CCHIP sites

 Retention in Care
and Viral Suppression




 

CCHIP- Retention in Care 2017

2 primary care visits, 1 in each half and at least 3 months apart

18

HRSA retention rate 81%
National HIV AIDS Strategy (NHAS) new goal is 90%

 CCHIP- Rates of HIV Viral Suppression

Viral Load Rates are extracted by HRSA defined HAB
Performance Measures:
In order for patients to be pulled into the denominator, the
patient has to have had at least one primary care visit with a
provider with prescribing privileges within the past 12
months (this data is as of 12/31/2017).

 Retention and Viral Suppression Summary
• 82% viral suppression; good but could be better
• Retention rates meeting HRSA goals, short of new NHAS goals
• Retention activities need to be comprehensive, creative,
innovative.
• Opportunities to explore and address disparities in viral
suppression
• Opportunities to make CountyCare the model health plan for
HIV/viral hepatitis /STIs by adopting and reporting HRSA
measures
• Systemizing best practices across all HIV treatment sites
• Optimizing linkage and re-engagement for Cermak discharges

CORE outreach- performed 470 rapid HIV tests at community events

 HIV (Non-ACHN) Screening Initiatives
• Need to reach into new community areas to enhance finding
new diagnoses
• Using our community events as opportunities to link or reengage previously known HIV+ lost to care
• Use System data to prioritize testing areas, PreP initiatives
• Work with other community partners to be referral sites for
primary and specialty care
