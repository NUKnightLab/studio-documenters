Following the presentation of public testimony by Dr. Blaine, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the
proposed funding level for the Access to Care Program within the proposed CCHHS FY2014 Preliminary Budget.
Mr. Galeener responded that the funding level is $3 million; this amount is the same as last year’s funding level for
the Program. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, in the past, he has always recused himself on Access to Care
matters brought forth before the System Board, because he was one of the County representatives on their board.
He stated when he became Chairman of the System Board, he resigned from their board, so he is no longer a voting
member of their board.

Concerned Citizen
Community Health Psychologist (re: Access to Care – written testimony
also provided)

Board Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding the costs relating to CountyCare. Mr. Galeener stated that staff is still
evaluating exactly how close the System is running to cost. There are some issues with regard to the State’s
processing time; the delayed processing time creates a delay for the System in getting all of the claims in from
outside providers. The System has to wait until the application is approved, but then the System is liable for claims
going back to when the application was submitted. Staff is still gathering information on what the incurred but not
reported (IBNR) expenses are, but in terms of how the System is running right now, the administration believes that
costs are running relatively close to the per-member per-month (PMPM) payment amount, but likely slightly under
that amount.
Recess
As there were no additional registered speakers present, Chairman Butler recessed the meeting to Friday, August
23, 2013 at the hour of 8:00 A.M.

Revenue Budget
• Revenue increase of $238.6M to a total $950.7M
• Revenue estimates based on current experience and trends
• Increase reflects CountyCare impact of 100% FMAP and full
year membership of 56,131 patients
• CountyCare membership of 56,131 reflects a conservative
estimate for budgeting purposes due to uncertainty in transition
to Medicaid expansion, patient retention, and transition to new
state eligibility system

TESTIMONY TO THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEMS BOARD

i am Steven Blaine, Director of Managed Care Contracting for Gardien Services, a subsidiary of
Vanguard Health Systems. I am also Treasurer for the Suburban Primary Health Care Council,
administrators of the Access to Care program. I am here to thank you for budgeting $3 million for the
Access to Care program in 2013, and urge you to continue funding Access to Care at this same level in
2014.

Access to Care has been part of the delivery system of primary health care within Cook County since
1991 when the County began to fund the program. Access to Care serves uninsured and underinsured
low-income residents throughout suburban Cook County. The program contracts with private
physicians who provide care in their own offices for $68 per person per year. The in-kind contributions
of those private physicians is conservatively estimated at $3 million.

Access to Care has always been an ef?cient, cost-effective public-private partnership where County
dollars go further because they are used by a charity to get discounts from the private system. in 2013
the per-person cost of care is $657.89 per year. $657.89 for unlimited physician visits, unlimited basic
laboratory and X~ray services for an entire year.

With all the upcoming changes in health care, Access to Care has partnered with CountyCare to provide
services to many people. CountyCare patients are currently ineligible for traditional Medicaid . There is
a reciprocal agreement that Access to Care will refer patients to CountyCare and CountyCare will, in
turn, refer those patients to Access to Care that do not meet CountyCare guidelines.

There are many patients that are not and will not be covered by CountyCare. Those individuals include
low income, legal immigrants who have not been in the United States for ?ve (5) years and are not
covered under the Affordable Care Act. Also individuals who are working and have a family income over
133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and under the 300% income guidelines for the Access to Care
program.

Within a rapidly changing health care environment, Access to Care continues to have a role to play in the
health care system within Cook County. Access to Care has been serving uninsured and underinsured
low~income residents of Cook County for 25 years. The program has been a stalwart in serving Cook
County residents with affordable primary health care services.

I thank you for recognizing the value that the Access to Care program provides to the people of Cook
County and to the Cook County Health and Hospital System.

Testimony to Finance Committee Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and Hospital System
Linda Coronado, Co-Chair 7th District Health Task Force

Last year Commissioner Garcia established the 7th District Health Task Force to advise and advocate
. regarding the critical issues facing the Cook County Health and Hospital System. This advisory body
consists of more than one hundred members representing community organizations, direct care
providers and activists within the 7th District. lam one of the conveners of this Task Force.

There was a time when the public was given a real budget to be able to evaluate shifts in resources and
increases or cuts. Since this semi-autonomous board was established we only receive last minute vague
summaries with inadequate notice and little or incompetent outreach to non?English speaking
communities.

This board has not reflected in these budget documents reference to the 2015 Strategic plan passed by
this board and approved by the Cook County Commissioners. Where is the new health centers projected
in the strategic plan? Where is the expansion of services that are culturally respectful and linguistically
specific that are critical for the survival of county health services? Why do we face another round of
hearings that fail to accommodate non?English speaking and hearing impaired members ofthe public?
Where are the human improvements to the infrastructure? Have the system?s vacancies in critical
specialty care areas and nursing been filled; why do we continue to give extravagant contracts to
consultants?

The 7th District Task Force as a group met several times with representatives from the Health and
Hospital System to address significant issues around the implementation of the CountyCare program.
Due to our advocacy, the Health System was pressured to address major gaps in its plan for community
outreach including the pulling of poorly translated written materials and replacing them with
appropriate materials.

As incompetent as the outreach has been in Spanish, there has been no outreach in the other major
languages of our County, Chinese, Arabic, Polish, Ibo. While many FQHC health centers are enrolling
patients in County Care in their waiting rooms, patients being served by the County must call a phone
number.

Where are the financial reports promised about County Care? How many applications have been
completed and sent to the State? How many members is receiving capitation for? What
payments have we made for medical services outside the system? Is County Care projected to make a
surplus, break even or lose money in this fiscal year? Why has (to use the budget language from LAST
YEAR) the conservative member projections drop from 115,000 to only 56,131 members by December 1,
2013. How many of these 56,000 members will be in the system as opposed to Where are the
financial reports detailing enrollment milestones and detailing expenses as promised?

Page 50 of 53

The Seventh District Task Force is only one of many concerned community groups. For health
executives new to Chicago, we are part of the massive numbers of people that fight for a high quality
mission driven health system. We believe that healthcare is a basic human right regardless of gender,
race, class or immigration status. We understand that in order to have healthy communities we need a
health system that not only provides medical care, but addresses the social determinants of heath. We
are part ofthe community that forced the creation ofthis board. We are part of the public that ?ght
against cuts to services.

We stand in the tradition of Commissioner Garcia of speaking truth to power and then reaching out to

assure that change occurs. We stand ready to work to make sure that our health 'system becomes what
it should be.

TESTIMONY TO THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEMS BOARD
August 21, 2013

I am Venoncia Bat??Ambrus, MS, Community Health I am also the Chair of the Board
Affairs Committee for the Suburban Primary Health Care Council, administrators of the Access to Care program.
On behalf of the patients served by Access to Care, I thank you for including $3 million for this vital program in
the 2013 budget. I urge you to continue funding Access to Care at the same level, in the 2014 budget.

Access to Care has been part of the delivery system of primary health care since 1991 when Cook County began
to fund the program. Access to Care serves uninsured and underinsured low?income residents throughout
suburban Cook County. The program has contracted with over 600 private physicians who provide care in their
own offices for $68 per person per year. The in-kind contributions of those private physicians is conservatively
estimated at $3 million.

Access to Care was developed to meet the needs of suburban populations who have very few resources for
uninsured or underinsured individuals to obtain needed health care services. Transportation also is an issue for
suburban patients. It is important to be able to get care locally through the Access to Care program. Many
Access to Care patients have chronic illnesses that need to be monitored, such as diabetes and hypertension.
These patients appreciate being able to see a local physician, get tests when needed and very importantly, get
needed medications. In the past twelve months the Access to Care program has served 9,100 low-income Cook
County residents. In 2012 they received 16,334 laboratory test and 2,170 radiology procedures. Access to Care
paid for 22,768 prescriptions while providing information on other options for obtaining low-cost or free
prescription medications.

With all the upcoming changes in health care, Access to Care has partnered with CountyCare to provide services
to many people. CountyCare patients are currently not eligible for traditional Medicaid. There is a reciprocal
agreement that Access to Care will refer patients to CountyCare and County Care will, in turn, refer those
patients to Access to Care that do not meet CountyCare guidelines.

There are many patients that are not and will not be covered by CountyCare. Those individuals include low-
income, legal immigrants who have not been in the United States for five (5) years and are not covered under
the Affordable Care Act. Also individuals who are working and have a family income over 133% of the Federal
Poverty Level (FPL) and under the 300% income guidelines for the Access to Care program. In short, there are
many people that will continue to need the services provided by Access to Care.

During this rapidly changing health care environment, Access to Care will continue to have a role to play in the
health care system in Cook County. Access to Care has been serving the uninsured and underinsured low?
income residents of Cook County for 25 years. The program has been a dependable vehicle for low-income Cook
County residents to access affordable primary health care services.

I thank you for recognizing the value of the Access to Care program to low-income residents of Cook County and
also its value to the Cook County Health and Hospital System.

TESTIMONY TO THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITAL SYSTEM BOARD
August 23, 2013

I am Victoria Bigelow, President of the Suburban Primary Health Care Council, administrators of the Access to
Care program. I thank you so much for your support over many years. I have been told that the Access to Care
program is in the preliminary 2014 budget for $3 million. On behalf of the patients we currently serve and new
patients we will be serving, I extend my sincere gratitude for your continued faith in the Access to Care program.

Access to Care is celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2013. The program has been the delivery system for over
100,000 unduplicated low-income Cook County residents. Many patients have been in the program for many
years.

The funding provided by the Health and Hospital System has returned great value for the County. It has allowed
Access to Care to link low?income, uninsured and underinsured suburban Cook County residents to participating
physicians in their own community. This arrangement brings the private side of medicine into caring for Cook
County?s indigent residents. Currently the program has over 600 participating physicians. We surveyed our
physicians about their continued participation past 2014 and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Only
three doctors stated that they would drop out of the program in 2014. The physicians are paid $68 per person
per year. The in-kind contributions of the doctors has been conservatively estimated at $3 million.

The ability for uninsured and underinsured individuals in suburban Cook County to see a local doctor keeps them
out of local emergency departments. Many Access to Care patients have chronic illnesses and appreciate the
ability to manage their health issues without breaking the bank. Most importantly, Access to Care provides low-
cost prescription medications for its patients.

Transportation is a difficult issue faced by suburban Cook County residents. By having a geographically, widely
dispersed network of participating physicians, labs and x-ray facilities, we are available to care for people who
would otherwise, have no way to access affordable primary health care services.

The coming changes in health care bring many challenges. Access to Care has been a partner with the Cook
County Health System for many years. We now have partnered with CountyCare to identify eligible patients for
County Care. And, in return patients who do not meet the guidelines for CountyCare will be referred to Access
to Care.

The health care environment is changing rapidly. For many low?income, uninsured and underinsured suburban
residents the Access to Care program was the only resource for affordable health care services.

Access to Care has been a dependable and constant source for health care for 25 years. We look forward to our
continued role in caring for Cook County?s uninsured and underinsured population.

Lastly, I want to thank you for recognizing the value of the Access to Care model to care for low income,
medically indigent suburban Cook County residents.
