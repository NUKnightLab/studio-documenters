Report from Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the information on compliance volumes, Acting Chairman Hammock noted that, in

his departmental policies; it gets reviewed as part of the quality assurance plan. Mr. Bauman stated that there
should be some measure to rely on to ensure that the team is taking their required professional education
courses and are up to date. Mr. Schroeder responded that he will research the subject further to see if there
are other avenues for this, and will check with his peers at an upcoming roundtable meeting. Mr. Bauman
suggested that Mr. Schroeder should look into the Institute of Internal Auditors for courses they may offer
that will assist in the development of the expertise needed for this specialized field. Mr. Schroeder responded
that he will do so; additionally, he will provide more information to the Committee on the various
requirements and training currently being done.

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
CCHHS Provider Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY17
I.

Introduction

Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) Corporate Compliance incorporates two (2) distinct Compliance
Programs, the CountyCare Medicaid Health Plan and CCHHS as a provider of health care services. Provider services
occur within CCHHS hospitals, clinics, correctional medicine, public health, and incorporates research, it includes
physicians and others that provide direct care to patients. The CountyCare Medicaid Health Plan’s Compliance
Program is addressed through a separate annual report.
This Annual Report presents the activities throughout county fiscal year 2017 of the CCHHS-Provider Corporate
Compliance Program under the executive leadership of Cathy Bodnar, Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, and the
operational leadership of Dianne Willard, CCHHS Compliance Officer detailed to the CCHHS Provider Program. The
report also serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of our program by looking at the infrastructure, communication
strategy and channels. In addition, this report provides an assessment of the Program using the seven (7) Compliance
Program Elements of a comprehensive compliance program delineated by the Office of Inspector General (OIG).
CCHHS has established a Mission:
“To deliver integrated health services with dignity and respect regardless of a patient’s ability to pay; foster
partnerships with other health providers and communities to enhance the health of the public; and advocate for
policies which promote and protect the physical, mental and social well-being of the people of Cook County.”
Corporate Compliance supports the CCHHS Mission with a departmental Mission:
“To uphold the mission, vision, and core goals of Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) by establishing
and supporting a system-wide culture of honesty and respect to guide everyone’s actions by:
Developing standards
Increasing awareness
Promoting honest behavior and professional responsibility
through education, awareness, and shared accountability that promotes compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, and System policies.”
CCHHS has established a Vision:
“In support of its public health mission, CCHHS will be recognized locally, regionally, and nationally – and by
patients and employees – as a progressively evolving model for an accessible, integrated, patient-centered,
and fiscally-responsible healthcare system focused on assuring high-quality care and improving the health of
the residents of Cook County.”
To support CCHHS’ Vision, the Vision of Corporate Compliance is:
“To ensure safeguards are in place for our patients, our staff, and the public at large, the Corporate Compliance
Program will be a resource to everyone affiliated with Cook County Health & Hospitals System.
(For the purposes of this statement, “affiliated” is defined as all employees, medical staff, house staff, Board
members, volunteers, students, patients, partners, consultants, business associates, agency personnel, and
vendors.)”
II. Building Blocks – Program Infrastructure and Scope
The Annual Report begins with a look at the activities of the Program that incorporate efforts to foster an infrastructure

ANNUAL REPORT – FY17
III. Being Present – Communication – Fostering Transparency
A. Communication Strategy
The ongoing organizational compliance communication strategy has been to increase the CCHHS workforce
awareness of the following topics:
Code of Ethics;
Privacy, Confidentiality, and Security;
Accessibility of the Compliance Officer and Program;
Availability through multiple modalities;
Responsibility to report potential/actual issues; and
Non-retaliation.
B. Communication Channels
Within FY17 communicated the aforementioned topics utilizing multiple formats:
E-mail communications;
Organizational Newsletters (System Briefs);
Attendance/presence at team meetings;
Compliance Program business cards;
Pens with the compliance hot line number;
Privacy Protector wrist bands;
Code of Ethics posters; and
Annual education; topics this year included an updated Code of Ethics, Security Mentor – E-mail
Security, Security Mentor Office Security, CMS Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA), and Compliance
modules. The CMS modules are required to adhere to contractual requirements found within
Government Managed Care Plans and Prescription Drugs Plans.
IV. Compliance Program Structure: Performance of the Elements
Element 1
The development and distribution of written Code of Ethics, as well as written policies and procedures that promote
the hospital’s commitment to compliance (e.g., by including adherence to compliance as an element in evaluating
managers and employees) and that address specific areas of potential fraud, such as claims development and
submission processes, coding and billing risk areas, and financial relationships with physicians and other healthcare
professionals.
A. Policies and Procedures
1. Developed, updated, and performed triennial reviews on multiple system policies related to general
compliance, governance, and HIPAA. Functioned as a reviewer for numerous organizational policies
with compliance and/or privacy elements.
2. Work Plan Activities
In addition to policy and procedure activity, Corporate Compliance worked with operational areas to
assess compliance with procedures and/or regulatory requirements.

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
CCHHS Provider Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY17
340B Compliance
Administered through the Health Resources and Services Administrations (HRSA) Office of
Pharmacy Affairs, the 340B Drug Pricing Program has significant program integrity
requirements. Corporate Compliance continued to function as a resource for the organization’s
340B Drug Pricing Program managed within the Department of Pharmacy that requires drug
manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations such as CCHHS
at significantly reduced prices.
Dual Employment Surveys and Accounting of Disclosures
To support organizational transparency, procured a web-based software tool to survey CCHHS
staff in two (2) areas, dual employment and conflict of interest.
All CCHHS employees are required to complete a Dual Employment survey annually whether
or not they participate in external employment. This requirement is promulgated by the Rules
of the Board of the Cook County Commissioners, CCHHS Dual Employment Policy and CCHHS
Personnel Rules.
Historically, a subgroup of CCHHS employees, those that influence procurement or function in
any decision-making capacity on behalf of CCHHS, their patients or members are required to
disclose additional information. This is the Accounting of Disclosures or Conflict of Interest
survey. The survey was broadened to incorporate all employees and requires disclosure of any
external activities, whether paid or unpaid. This survey is a mandatory requirement pursuant to
our Conflict of Interest policy to assess if conflict exists.
The survey requires a two-step review process. Once completed by an individual, the survey is
submitted to their operational leader. The operational leader reviews the submission. Once
reviewed and approved, the survey is routed for a secondary review by the operational leader’s
supervisor. At each step of the review, the reviewer has the ability to reject a submission,
sending the survey back to the individual for more specificity. Unfortunately, the software survey
tool did not fulfill the needs of CCHHS principally in the critical area of supervisory review. Failing
to meet key performance indicators, the contract was terminated. Corporate Compliance has
engaged internal resources to develop the survey tool that will be rolled out in Quarter 2 Fiscal
Year 2018.
Annual Education
The ongoing operations and day-to-day management of the CCHHS electronic learning
management system (LMS) for all mandatory annual training for the entire CCHHS workforce
(employees and contractors) remains the responsibility of Corporate Compliance. A candidate
for the Director of Organizational Development and Training in Human Resources has been
identified. Transition to Human Resources will occur once the candidate in on boarded.
Utilized external consultants, partnered with adult education experts and subject matter experts
to develop or revise current training modules. By December 31, 2017 97% CCHHS employees
achieved compliance on fourteen (14) core mandatory annual education modules.

Page 22 of 73

 Cook County Health & Hospitals System
CCHHS Provider Compliance Program
ANNUAL REPORT – FY17
Remained subject matter expert for four (4) annual education modules – CMS Fraud, Waste,
and Abuse, Code of Ethics, privacy and security of protected health information modules.
Record Retention
As a government entity, all documents must be reviewed to determine if they are considered
“public records.” Public record is defined in 50 ILCS 205/3 is defined as “(a)ny book, paper,
map, photograph or other official documentary material, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, made, produced, executed or received by any agency…or in connection with
the transaction of public business and preserved…as evidence of the organization, function,
policies, decisions, procedures, or other activities thereof, or because of the informational data
contained therein.
CCHHS follows an approved Application for Authority to Dispose of Local Records, considered
the Records Retention Schedule. The Schedule dates back to 1985, it contains 1,237 pages
with 4,395 different records and retention periods. Over the past year, Corporate Compliance
has requested and received permission to destroy each record on the Records Retention
Schedule based upon the regulatorily defined retention period. Within FY18, develop and
compile a leaner, intuitive Records Retention Schedule for submission to the Local Records
Commission. Once approved, append the current Records Retention policy and communication
the update to the CCHHS workforce.
Element 2
The designation of a Chief Compliance Officer and other appropriate bodies, e.g., a corporate compliance committee,
charged with the responsibility of operating and monitoring the compliance program, and who reports directly to the
CEO and the governing body.
B. Compliance Office and Committees
The graphic below illustrates the communication and reporting structure. Cathy Bodnar, the Chief Compliance
& Privacy Officer, reports to the CCHHS Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board and the CCHHS Chief
Executive Officer. In turn, the CCHHS Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board and the CCHHS Chief
Executive Officer each report to the CCHHS Board of Directors.

FY 17 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2016 through November 2017
I.

Introduction

CountyCare is a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) health plan offered by Cook County Health & Hospitals
System (CCHHS) pursuant to a contract with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) effective
July 1, 2014. The health plan is designed to simultaneously provide coverage for any Cook County Medicaid eligible
beneficiaries and transform CCHHS into a patient-centered continuum of care. By working to employ the advantages
of our parent organization, CCHHS, CountyCare is able to uniquely promote achievement of the Triple Aim: 1)
improving the patient experience, 2) improving the health of populations overall, while 3) reducing the cost of care. The
operation of the CountyCare MCCN is facilitated through CCHHS and its various subcontractors.
To adhere to Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Managed Care Program Integrity requirements1, contractual
provisions in the MCCN Agreement with HFS, and the elements of an effective compliance program as recommended
in the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance Program Guidance
publications, CountyCare developed and implemented the CountyCare Compliance Program. The CountyCare
Compliance Program is designed to demonstrate the health plan’s commitment to promoting ethical and lawful conduct
consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements, as well as CCHHS policies, procedures,
and Code of Ethics/Standards of Conduct.
This Annual Report presents the activities throughout county fiscal year 20172. The CountyCare Managed Care
Compliance Program is under the executive leadership of Cathy Bodnar, Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, and
the operational leadership of Ryan Tyrell Lipinski, CCHHS Compliance Officer dedicated to CountyCare.
During this past fiscal year, the CountyCare Health Plan, as a whole, accomplished many goals and implemented a
variety of initiatives. A few health plan achievements include:
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA): CountyCare submitted its first Health Plan Accreditation
Survey in June 2017 and received notification of accreditation status in September 2017.
HealthChoice Illinois: CountyCare submitted a response to the State of Illinois’ Request for Proposals to
continue to operate its Medicaid MCCN and received notification of the award in the Fall 2017.
Behavioral Health: CountyCare continues to develop initiatives with the goal of integrating behavioral health
care into medical homes, care coordination and health plan operations. CountyCare helped launch the
Behavioral Health Consortium and Behavioral Health Primary Care Integration Learning Collaborative.
Transportation: CountyCare partnered with CCHHS to implement a new transportation program, consisting of
a fleet of dedicated vehicles to transport CountyCare members treated at CCHHS facilities.
The Corporate Compliance Program dedicated to CountyCare was directly involved in each major initiative, to assure
the execution adhered to and incorporated relevant regulatory directives and contractual requirements.
II. Building Blocks – Program Infrastructure and Scope
The Annual Report begins with a look at the structure and implementation activities of the Program designed to foster
an infrastructure that produces a comprehensive compliance program for CountyCare and its affiliates.
The Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, in consultation with Executive Leadership, the Compliance Oversight
Committee, and the CCHHS Board of Directors, through the Audit & Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors,
are responsible for coordinating the implementation of the CountyCare Compliance Program. The Chief Compliance
and Privacy Officer is primarily supported by Ryan Tyrrell Lipinski, JD, CHC, the CountyCare Compliance Officer, Cory
Otto, CHC, Compliance Analyst, and external consultants. The consultants provide guidance in the development and

Managed Care Program Integrity requirements3 and by contractual provisions in the MCCN Agreement.
Element 1
The distribution of written Code of Ethics, as well as written policies and procedures that promote the health plan’s
commitment to compliance (e.g., by including adherence to compliance as an element in evaluating managers and
employees) and that address specific areas of potential fraud, waste and abuse. The CCHHS Code of Ethics applies
to all CountyCare personnel, providers, agents and subcontractors. The Code of Ethics, as well as CCHHS’ policies
and procedures, support CountyCare’s commitment to comply with all federal and state standards, including but not
limited to, applicable statutes, regulations and sub-regulatory guidance and contractual requirements.
A.

Policies and Procedures.
Compliance staff engaged in the following activities to promote and establish an effective compliance program
for the CountyCare Health Plan:

 
1. Maintained an action plan to incorporate contractual language from the MCCN Agreement, Evolent’s
Third Party Administrator (TPA) agreement, and integrated governmental Managed Care Program
Integrity requirements with the recommended elements of an effective compliance program. This
includes oversight of the Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) and the Grievances and Appeals program.
2. Continued to follow the CountyCare Compliance Plan that focuses exclusively on outlining the
compliance responsibilities of the health plan and program design for implementation, as well as specific
CountyCare compliance policies for high risk areas focused on health plan operations.
3. Ensured that CountyCare personnel, providers, agents and subcontractors had access to compliance
documentation electronically and were provided with hard copies of compliance policies and procedures
upon request.

and publishing policies.
Examples of the specific policy and procedure activity:
HIPAA Member Rights: Developed outline of CountyCare health plan member rights concerning
the confidentiality and privacy of protected health information in accordance with the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 Privacy and Security Rules.
ACA Section 1557 Non Discrimination Requirements: Created policy to comply with Section 1557
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs.
Mental Health Parity: Developed and implemented a policy to establish and demonstrate
compliance with the requirements regarding parity in mental health and substance use disorder
benefits, as outlined in the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, 42 CFR part 438,
subpart K and contained in the CountyCare Contract with HFS.

Ad Hoc Activities/Guidance

 

Corporate Compliance worked with operational areas to assess compliance with policies, procedures
and/or regulatory requirements and, in certain instances, assisted in the development of new policies.
Examples of areas assessed:
Medical Records: Subpoena Requests
In response to numerous inquiries for medical and claim records for CountyCare members,
Compliance expanded the existing CCHHS policy to address requests related to subpoenas for
CountyCare member PHI as permitted by HIPAA. Compliance worked with CCHHS Legal to draft a
Subpoena Review tool to ensure that any requests for PHI were legally sufficient. Compliance also
maintains a database to track each request.

Marketing Material Review
Due to the ever-changing complex regulatory environment of Medicaid managed care plan
marketing, Compliance assisted the Marketing team by creating a Marketing review tool updated
with all of the current contractual and regulatory requirements. Compliance reviewed and tracked all
marketing materials before they are submitted to HFS for approval.
42 CFR Part 2 Compliance
Compliance continues to work with operations and delegated vendors to develop a process to ensure
that the use and disclosure of member substance abuse records for care coordination purposes
meets federal Part 2 program requirements. In FY17, Compliance assisted the program staff by

3. Reporting
Categories have been defined to allow CountyCare Compliance to accurately measure general
compliance inquiries/issues. The inclusion of an item in a specific category does not substantiate the
issue; rather it classifies the issue within a defined category. The issues addressed within the past fiscal
year of CountyCare as a MCCN fell into the following categories:
Regulatory, Policy, and Contractual Issues
HIPAA Privacy, Confidentiality and Security
Accurate Books & Records
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
False Claims
Conflict of Interest
Grievances & Appeals
4. Total Volume of Compliance Inquiries/Issues
A total of 176 general compliance issues were brought to CountyCare Compliance during the last fiscal
year, this is a 15% increase from last year.

The majority of the inquiries/issues, 83 or 47%, were identified as Regulatory/Policy/Contract. These items related to
the applicability of regulations, relevance of policies, and interpretation of contract language in the areas covered by
Corporate Compliance.
In addition to the generic regulatory category are concerns related to Privacy and Security (HIPAA). This category
accounted for 59, or 33%, of all issues. As a covered entity, the health plan is also required to safeguard privacy for
plan members. This area is highly regulated and has specific notification requirements if a breach occurs. Of the 59
issues within this category, 4 were confirmed breaches that resulted in 4 member notifications. Although counted
within CountyCare’s volumes, to optimize resources, privacy issues and breach investigations are directed and
managed by the CCHHS Provider side of the Corporate Compliance Program.

Of the 176 CountyCare inquiries/issues in FY 17, 81% or 143 issues were proactive issues. Reactive activities are
unanticipated queries or concerns, while proactive activities anticipate possible issues. While proactive activity is
optimal, reactive issues are not viewed negatively by Corporate Compliance. A majority of reactive issues indicate
awareness of the Compliance Program as an organizational resource. Additionally, based upon the issue, it may allow
for education to resolve future queries or shift similar queries from reactive issues into a proactive paradigm.
 
6. Fraud, Waste and Abuse Metrics (Tracked by State Fiscal Year (S-FY) not county fiscal year.
(S-FY 2017 is July 1, 2016- July 1, 2017)
In addition to issues raised directly to Corporate Compliance, the TPA separately tracked FWA
allegations and monitored investigations.
Metrics for the S-FY17 follow:

There were 52 allegations in FWA,

Element 5
The development of a system to respond to allegations of improper/illegal activities and the enforcement of appropriate
disciplinary action against employees who have violated internal compliance policies, applicable statutes, regulations
or Federal health care program requirements.
A.

Enforcing Standards
Broadened the scope of Standards enforcement through:
1. Fraud, Waste and Abuse Monitoring. During this fiscal year, CountyCare Health Plan, through the
TPA, replaced FWA vendors. CountyCare Compliance monitored the TPA’s selection process for a new
FWA vendor and provided oversight to assure compliance with the MCCN. Investigations initiated by the
TPA’s Special Investigation Unit (SIU) from referrals and data analytic software which identify providers
with aberrant billing patterns are reviewed by Compliance. Once approved to initiate an investigation,
Compliance monitored the process to ensure that appropriate action was taken, including reporting of
suspected FWA to the State HFS OIG.
2. Breach Assessments. Partnered with CCHHS Provider Compliance to review allegations, if validated,
provided remediation guidance to operational areas to minimize and/or eliminate breaches in the future
and, utilized the CCHHS Sanction Policy and Personnel Rules, to provide leadership guidance for
disciplinary action.
3. Investigations Resulting in Employee Related Corrective Actions. Investigated Conflict of Interest
and confidentiality complaints and provided employee guidance.
4. Partnerships with Governmental Agencies. Partnered with the HFS, HFS OIG, and Illinois’ Medicaid
Fraud Control Unit (MFCU).
5. Partnerships with non-Governmental Agencies. Invited to participate with a number of new
organizations related to the detection of fraud and wrong-doing in the insurance industry. These nongovernmental organizations include the HealthCare Fraud Prevention Partnership, National Insurance
Crime Bureau, and Midwest Anti-Fraud Insurance Association.

Element 6
The use of audits and/or other evaluation techniques to monitor compliance and assist in the reduction of identified
problem areas.
A.

Annual Compliance Attestation
Developed and implemented an Annual Compliance Attestation issued to it all 6 of CountyCare’s delegated
vendors in May 2017. The Compliance Attestation required all vendors to attest to several compliance
provisions in their contracts, including distribution of a Code of Ethics, FWA policy distribution, training and
education requirements, sanction screening checks, and delegated oversight. All of the vendors responded,
and one vendor was subject to a corrective action plan.

B.

Auditing and Monitoring
Noted earlier in this report, CountyCare transitioned to a new Special Investigation Unit (SIU) with strong
analytical and data analytic software component. This software identifies anomalies and aberrant billing
patterns vital to the FWA and Compliance Program and in compliance with the MCCN. Partnerships with the
State’s HFS OIG and MFCU enhance the program.
Conducted a variety of reviews to ensure adequate oversight of operations performed by delegated vendors
and MCCN contract compliance. Partnered with CCHHS Internal Audit to help develop priority risk areas for
further audit and review.

C.

Risk Assessment
Continued to conduct risk assessment activities to identify outstanding risks and challenges to meeting the
standards of an effective compliance program. The following risks were identified in FY17 that require ongoing
assessment:
Vendor Compliance with Sanction Screening and Conflict of Interest requirements
Disclosure and sharing of member sensitive health information

Element 7
The investigation and remediation of identified systemic problems and the development of policies addressing the nonemployment or retention of sanctioned individuals.
A.

Identification of Systemic Issues
Sanction Screening Checks
Addressed regulatory requirements to avoid employing, engaging, contracting or agreeing with any
individual or entity that is excluded or “sanctioned” from participation in a federal or state health care
program or who is debarred from participation in federal procurement or non-procurement programs for
the provision of goods or services.
Oversight
Developed processes to address contractual requirements and best practices for oversight of the
CountyCare Compliance Program.

FY 17 ANNUAL REPORT – December 2016 through November 2017

IV. Looking Ahead
In FY18 the Corporate Compliance Program will continue to focus on maintaining adherence to contractual
requirements and industry best practices as the program matures. As CountyCare relies heavily on delegated vendors,
monitoring for adherence to CountyCare policies, contractual, and regulatory standards are critical to avoid sanctions
that may result in monetary penalties. The Program will continue ongoing activities related to risk reduction in the
areas of compliance, policy implementation, and the development and implementation of monitoring and auditing
efforts.
These priorities have been established for the CountyCare Compliance Program:
Mature the CountyCare Compliance Program and incorporate best practices.
Sustain compliance with contractual requirements and industry best practices as CountyCare evolves into the
largest Managed Care Organization in Cook County.
Continue to partner with operations and the TPA to fulfill contractual obligations relating to state required
reporting.
Strengthen Health Plan oversight in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, focusing on vendor oversight.
o
Ongoing partnerships with the HFS OIG and the State’s MFCU to develop best practices in Corporate
Compliance for CountyCare.
o
Enhance relationships with non-government organizations and other MCOs’ SIUs to build a network
of skilled investigators and increase effective Program Integrity efforts.
Increase monitoring oversight for all delegated vendors.
Continue to investigate all issues/complaints brought to the attention of the Program.
Promote serving as a resource to the workforce and delegated vendors.
Maintain CountyCare Compliance Program recognition on a national presence.

Introduction

The Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS) is the public, safety-net health care system for
Chicago and suburban Cook County. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital (Stroger), CCHHS’ academic medical
center, is located in the Illinois Medical District on Chicago’s Near West Side and primarily serves the acute
care needs of the people of metropolitan Chicago. The System is also comprised of Provident Hospital on
Chicago’s South Side and the Oak Forest Health Center in suburban Oak Forest, along with the Ruth M.
Rothstein CORE Center in addition to multiple Ambulatory and Community Health Network clinics.
Healthcare is also provided within Cermak Health Services of Cook County, to detainees at the Cook
County Jail and the Temporary Juvenile Detention Center, and services are provided through the Cook
County Department of Public Health. CCHHS also operates CountyCare, a Managed Care Community
Network (MCCN) plan pursuant to a contract with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services (HFS). CountyCare is designed to provide coverage for currently uninsured individuals and
transform CCHHS into a patient-centered continuum of care. CountyCare is designed to provide coverage
for any Cook County Medicaid eligible beneficiary and transform CCHHS into a patient-centered
continuum of care. The operation of the CountyCare MCCN is facilitated through CCHHS and its various
subcontractors.

Purpose

It is the policy of CCHHS and all affiliated organizations to establish and support a system-wide Corporate
Compliance Program that incorporates two (2) distinct Compliance Programs, the CountyCare Medicaid
Health Plan and CCHHS as a provider of health care services. CCHHS is committed to conducting business
in a manner that is ethical and in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. To that end,
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board of Directors, through the Audit and Compliance
Committee of the Board, established and continues to maintain a Corporate Compliance Program.
The Corporate Compliance Plan, also called a Compliance Program, is designed to demonstrate the
organization’s commitment to promoting ethical and lawful conduct consistent with all applicable laws,
regulations, and contractual requirements, as well as CCHHS policies, procedures, and Code of
Ethics/Standards of Conduct. The Corporate Compliance Program is structured around the elements of an
effective compliance program as recommended in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) Compliance Program Guidance
publications and required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Managed Care Program
Integrity requirements found at 42 C.F.R. §438.608. A separate CountyCare Compliance Plan was
implemented to address specific State requirements.

Corporate Compliance Program Overview

The Corporate Compliance Program upholds the mission, vision, and core goals of CCHHS by establishing
and supporting a system-wide culture of honesty and respect to guide everyone’s actions by developing
standards, increasing awareness and promoting honest behavior and professional responsibility through
education, awareness, and shared accountability that promotes compliance with applicable laws,
regulations, and system policies. In addition, the Corporate Compliance Program is designed to prevent
and detect violations of applicable laws and regulations, CCHHS Code of Ethics, and organizational policies.
The Corporate Compliance Program applies to all affiliates and business units of CCHHS, both the health
care provider side and the CountyCare plan side, and to all Business Associates and contractors associated
with CCHHS. While it is expected that CCHHS personnel will comply with applicable laws and regulations,
the CCHHS Code of Ethics and policies, CCHHS management and directors understand that the
implementation of the Corporate Compliance Program cannot eliminate all risk of improper conduct. In
the event that CCHHS becomes aware of possible violations of law or the Code of Ethics or policies, the
Chief Compliance Officer will investigate the matter with management and, where appropriate, act as a
resource for Human Resources regarding recommended disciplinary action to deter future violations.
Where appropriate, the Chief Compliance Officer will confer with legal counsel.
The Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, in consultation with Senior Leadership, the Compliance
Oversight Committee, and the CCHHS Board of Directors, through the Audit & Compliance Committee of
the Board of Directors, are responsible for coordinating the implementation of the CCHHS Corporate
Compliance Program. The Corporate Compliance Program is subject to ongoing review and revision as
deemed necessary to ensure compliance. It is designed to accommodate future changes in regulations
and laws and may be updated to address issues not currently covered or issues related to new service
offerings or regulatory requirements.
The sections below establish the scope of activities, authority, reporting, committee and governance
structure, and assessment guidelines for the CCHHS Corporate Compliance Program.

It includes the following specific controls to ensure CCHHS meets all federal, state, and contractual
requirements. Elements of the Corporate Compliance Program include:
1. Written Policies, Procedures and Code of Ethics. CCHHS has a uniform Code of Ethics that provides
policies and guidelines for all CCHHS personnel. The CCHHS Code of Ethics applies to all CCHHS
personnel, providers, agents and subcontractors. The Code of Ethics, as well as CCHHS’ policies and
procedures, support the organization’s commitment to comply with all federal and state standards,
including but not limited to, applicable statutes, regulations and sub-regulatory guidance and
contractual requirements.
The Code of Ethics will be distributed to CCHHS personnel and updated as necessary. Training on the
Code of Ethics will be included in the new hire orientation program. Staff will be asked to attest to
receiving the Code. The Code will also be available on the CCHHS Intranet.
The Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer will regularly review the Code of Ethics to assure that it
covers significant risks caused by changing regulation and practices. Recommendations for changes
to the Code of Ethics will be forwarded to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Audit & Compliance
Committee of the Board of Directors, which has the authority to change the Code of Ethics and inform
CCHHS personnel of these changes.

agents, and subcontractors receive training at hire/contract initiation and annually thereafter on their
responsibilities under the Corporate Compliance Program, the CCHHS Code of Ethics and the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA, which includes privacy,
confidentiality, and security, and how to prevent, identify, and report fraud, abuse, and misconduct.

agents, and subcontractors have a duty to report misconduct including actual or potential violations
of law, regulation, policy, procedure or the CCHHS Code of Ethics to their supervisor, another member
of management, Human Resources or the Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer. Failure to report a
violation may result in appropriate disciplinary action. Personnel, agents, and subcontractors are
protected from retaliation and harassment as a result of having reported a good faith compliance or
integrity concern. CCHHS maintains procedures for reporting instances of suspected fraud, abuse, or
financial misconduct to HFS and OIG. Additionally, CCHHS makes regular communications to its
employees and subcontractors regarding compliance information and updates.
Communication mechanisms utilized by CCHHS include:

informed that violations of the Corporate Compliance Program, Code of Ethics or policies and
procedures will result in appropriate disciplinary action or sanctions. For CCHHS personnel, this could
mean up to and including termination of employment. Contracts with agents, providers and
subcontractors contain provisions regarding the organization’s responsibility for adhering to CCHHS
contractual requirements and applicable state and federal regulations. Non-compliance may result in
termination of the contractual relationship with CCHHS, where applicable.

6. Monitoring and Auditing. CCHHS has implemented a monitoring and auditing program which
includes written policies and procedures for routine internal monitoring as well as oversight auditing
by the CCHHS Office of Corporate Compliance. The monitoring and auditing program tests and
confirms compliance with regulatory guidance, contractual agreements, and applicable federal and
state laws, as well as internal policies and procedures to protect against non-compliance and potential
fraud, abuse, and financial misconduct. Additionally, regular audits of subcontractors and agents are
conducted to ensure compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements. Auditing and
monitoring activity is conducted in accordance with the annual Compliance Work Plan, developed by
the Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer, with input from the CCHHS Board of Directors, through the
Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board. Results of monitoring and auditing activities, and
subsequent corrective action plans, are reported to the CCHHS Board of Directors, through the Audit

programs that encourage personnel and subcontractors to report program non-compliance and
potential fraud and abuse or financial misconduct without fear of retaliation. This includes a process
consistent with state requirements for responding to reports of potential fraud and abuse or
misconduct, including reporting such instances to the HFS and HHS OIGs, cooperating with OIG
investigations, and developing and implementing appropriate corrective or disciplinary actions, if
necessary.

Introduction

CountyCare is a County Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) plan offered by Cook County Health
and Hospitals System (CCHHS) pursuant to a contract with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services (HFS). CountyCare is designed to provide coverage for any Cook County Medicaid eligible
beneficiaries and transform CCHHS into a patient-centered continuum of care. The operation of the
CountyCare MCCN is facilitated through CCHHS and its various subcontractors. All personnel tasked with
CountyCare operational responsibilities are CCHHS personnel or subcontractors, agents and non-CCHHS
providers.
As an integral part of CCHHS, CountyCare will uphold the mission, vision, and core goals of the system by
establishing and supporting a system-wide culture of honesty and respect to guide individual’s actions by
developing standards, increasing awareness, and promoting honest behavior and professional
responsibility through education, awareness, and shared accountability that promotes compliance with
applicable laws, regulations, and system policies.
CountyCare has developed this CountyCare Compliance Plan to demonstrate its commitment to
promoting ethical and lawful conduct consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, and contractual
requirements, as well as CCHHS policies, procedures, and Code of Ethics/Standards of Conduct. The
CountyCare Compliance Plan is structured around the elements of an effective compliance program as
recommended in the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG)
Compliance Program Guidance publications and required by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS) Managed Care Program Integrity requirements found at 42 C.F.R. §438.608. Upon implementation,
the CountyCare Compliance Plan will be managed and maintained by the CCHHS Office of Corporate
Compliance.

2.0

Purpose

All personnel are expected to uphold honest and ethical behavior, comply with laws, regulations, and
system policies, and to fulfill their responsibilities as important members of the CCHHS organization. In
order to preserve this environment, all personnel, agents, providers, and subcontractors are expected to
demonstrate the highest ethical standards in performing their daily tasks. The purpose of the CountyCare
Compliance Plan is to communicate the compliance expectations to all CountyCare stakeholders, including
those related to the prevention and detection of fraud, abuse, and financial misconduct within plan
operations. This communication is intended to reduce the likelihood of improper conduct within the
CountyCare organization and among its many stakeholders.
Further, the CountyCare Compliance Plan outlines guidelines to:
• Comply with the CMS Managed Care Program Integrity requirements and the terms of the
CountyCare Health Plan contract with HFS;
• Prevent, detect and eliminate fraud, abuse, and financial misconduct;
• Protect health plan members, providers, CountyCare and the State from potential fraudulent
activities; and
• Understand and focus on high-risk areas that have the greatest potential for non-compliance with
federal and state regulatory and contractual requirements.

 Internal Audit Charter
(The following 3 slides are excerpts from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Practice
Standards)

INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL
PRACTICE OF INTERNAL AUDITING (STANDARDS)

Attribute Standards
1000 – Purpose, Authority, and Responsibility
The purpose, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit activity must be
formally defined in an internal audit charter, consistent with the Definition of Internal
Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and the Standards. The chief audit executive (CAE)
must periodically review the internal audit charter and present it to senior
management and the board for approval.
Interpretation:
The internal audit charter is a formal document that defines the internal audit
activity's purpose, authority, and responsibility. The internal audit charter establishes
the internal audit activity's position within the organization, including the nature of
the chief audit executive’s functional reporting relationship with the board; authorizes
access to records, personnel, and physical properties relevant to the performance of
engagements; and defines the scope of internal audit activities. Final approval of
the internal audit charter resides with the board.

2

Page 68 of 73

 Internal Audit Charter
1110 – Organizational Independence
The chief audit executive must report to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity to
fulfill its responsibilities. The chief audit executive must confirm to the board, at least annually, the
organizational independence of the internal audit activity.
Interpretation:
Organizational independence is effectively achieved when the chief audit executive reports functionally to the
board. Examples of functional reporting to the board involve the board:
Approving the internal audit charter;
Approving the risk based internal audit plan;
Approving the internal audit budget and resource plan;
Receiving communications from the chief audit executive on the internal audit
activity’s performance relative to its plan and other matters;
Approving decisions regarding the appointment and removal of the chief audit executive;
Approving the remuneration of the chief audit executive; and
Making appropriate inquiries of management and the chief audit executive to determine
whether there are inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

 Internal Audit Charter
Considerations for Implementation
Based on this foundational work, the CAE (or a delegate) drafts an internal audit charter. The IIA offers a model internal audit
activity charter that may be used as a guide. Although they vary by organization, charters typically include the following sections:
Introduction – to explain the overall role and professionalism of the internal audit activity, citing the relevant elements of the
International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF).
Authority – to specify the internal audit activity’s full access to the records, physical property and personnel required to perform
its engagements and to declare its accountability for safeguarding assets and confidentiality.
Organization and Reporting Structure – to document the CAE’s reporting structure. The CAE reports functionally to the board
and administratively to a level within the organization that allows the internal audit activity to fulfill its responsibilities. This section
may delve into specific functional responsibilities, such as approving the charter and audit plan, and hiring, compensating, and
terminating the CAE; as well as administrative responsibilities, such as supporting information flow within the organization or
approving human resource administration and budgets.
Independence and Objectivity – to describe the importance of internal audit independence and objectivity and how these will
be maintained, such as prohibiting internal audit from having operational responsibility or authority over areas audited.
Responsibilities – to lay out major areas of ongoing responsibility, such as defining the scope of assessments, writing an audit
plan and submitting it to the board for approval, performing assessments, communicating the results, providing a written audit
report, and monitoring corrective actions taken by management.
Quality Assurance and Improvement – to describe the expectations for maintaining, evaluating, and communicating the
results of a quality program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity.
Signatures – to document the agreement between the CAE, a designated board representative, and the individual to whom the
CAE reports, with the date, name, and title of signatories.
