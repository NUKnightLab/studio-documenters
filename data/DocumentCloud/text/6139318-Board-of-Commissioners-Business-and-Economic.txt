PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION OF THE COOK COUNTY COMMISSION ON SOCIAL INNOVATION
CALLING ON A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF CROSS-RAIL CHICAGO
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation was established via ordinance, April of
2016, and codified as Chapter 14, Article IX Sections 14-89 to 14-97 to develop policy recommendations
for the Cook County Board of Commissioners on matters related to economic development that address
divestment and or disinvestment in areas within the Cook County region; and
WHEREAS, the Commission has found through the Cook County Long Range Transportation Plan that
improved and expanded passenger train service is essential to maintain Cook County’s economic vitality
and allow for increased growth and prosperity; and
WHEREAS, finding major transportation projects that can unite the county’s economy, by linking
business centers to housing centers, convention centers and tourism destinations in order to connect
disconnected populations should take precedence; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has ceased the diversion of Motor Fuel Tax funds; and
WHEREAS, the Commission on Social Innovation’s committee on Public Capital learned of the
Metropolitan High Speed Rail Association’s Cross-Rail Chicago proposal, and collectively introduced it
to the overall Commission on Social Innovation on October 20th of 2016; and

Page 7 of 10

WHEREAS, the Cross-Rail Chicago plan seeks to affirm the county’s place as financial, business and
cultural capital of the Midwest by attracting ridership from millions of tourists and visitors every year;
and

and Metra to create a unified, county-wide transportation network that may be piloted through the
expansion of the Metra Electric line, the Metra North Central service to O’hare via existing connections
through Union Station, and the 16th Street tracks that would allow for direct rides from South Cook
County to Northwest Cook County; and
WHEREAS, increasing the number of Metra trains, and connecting Metra lines together to Pace and
Chicago Transit Authority bus lines would significantly improve service for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, such coordination could also provide access to and through Cook County for Amtrak and
other trains transporting visitors to the region resulting in broader positive impact for the nation; and

encouraging the County of Cook to conduct such feasibility study of Metra Electric on December 18th,

feasibility study of Metra Electric.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Department of Transportation and Highways share the results
of the study with the Cook County Board of Commissioners, the Cook County Commission on Social
Innovation, the City of Chicago, Chicago Transit Authority, Chicago Department of Transportation,
Pace, Metra Rail and the Regional Transportation Authority to commence discussions on coordination,
integration of services, and the possibility of expansion of services to the West Side of Chicago and
