((CAHs)) will report
p usingg the new 2014 criteria regardless
g
of
whether they are participating in Stage 1 or Stage 2 of the Medicare and Medicaid
Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs. Although clinical quality measure
(CQM) reporting has been removed as a core objective for both EPs and eligible hospitals
and CAHs, all providers are required to report on CQMs in order to demonstrate
meaningful use.

before 2014.
 For 2014 only

 All providers regardless of their stage of meaningful use are only required to demonstrate

meaningful
f l use ffor a three-month
h
h EHR reporting period.
d
 For Medicare providers, this 3-month reporting period is fixed to the quarter of either the
fiscal (for eligible hospitals and CAHs) or calendar (for EPs) year in order to align with
existing CMS quality measurement programs, such as the Physician Quality Reporting
System (PQRS) and Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR).
(IQR)
 For Medicaid providers only eligible to receive Medicaid EHR incentives, the 3-month
reporting period is not fixed, where providers do not have the same alignment needs.
 CMS is permitting this one-time three-month reporting period in 2014 only so that all

providers who must upgrade to 2014 Certified EHR Technology will have adequate time
to implement their new Certified EHR systems.

 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has begun to audit

providers who have received payments under the Medicare and Medicaid
Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs. The audit letters, which
will come from accounting firm Figliozzi and Company, request four categories
of information from participants:
 a copy of the provider’s certification from the Office of the National Coordinator
for Health Information Technology to show that the provider has a certified EHR
system
 documentation to support the method used to report emergency department
admissions, which affects some of the required measures

INDEPENDENT REPORT
ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS

To the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Schedule) of
Cook County, Illinois (the County) for the year ended November 30, 2011. This ?nancial
statement is the responsibility of the County?s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the ?nancial statement based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and the standards applicable to ?nancial audits contained in Government
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and OMB Circular
A-133, ?Audits of States, Local Governments. and Non-Profit Organizations?. Those standards
and OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the ?nancial statement is free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
?nancial statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
signi?cant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall ?nancial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2, the County prepares the Schedule on the cash basis, which is a
comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

In our opinion, the ?nancial statement referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects,

the expenditures of Federal awards of the County for the year ended November 30, 2011 in
conformity with the basis of accounting described in Note 2.

the prior year grantfbusiness unit, are transferred to the new business unit. When the authorization
of a new grant occurs in the subsequent ?scal year (after the normal year-end closing), the
transfer of the expenditures from the prior year business unit to the new grantfbusiness unit
results in a negative expenditure in the prior year business unit.

NOTE 7 DCEO AUDITS

The Illinois Department of Commerce Economic Opportunity (DCEO) issued its report (dated
July 28, 201 1) of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) ?scal monitoring ?ndings identi?ed for
the period of 06716I2010 through 068072011 at the President?s Of?ce of Employment Training
(POET).

The letter detailed ?ndings on POET and sixteen (16) service providers that resulted in POET

questioned costs of $529,478, POET disallowed costs of $128,188, and service provider
questioned costs of $890,460. .

NOTE 7 DCEO AUDITS {Continued}

The letter requested a written response from POET regarding these ?ndings and corrective
actions by August 23, 2011 and the corrective actions contained in the response were to be
implemented by September 3, 2011 or as speci?ed in the corrective action, if earlier. Any
additional eligibility documentation was to be submitted no later than August 23, 2011.

POET submitted a response to DCEO on August 23, 2011. Based on discussions between DCEO
and POET on the potential questioned and disallowed costs, $1,562,820 pertaining to the 2009
Summer Youth program will be disallowed by DCEO. Due to the ongoing Federal investigations,
the disallowed costs for 2010 have yet to be determined. The County will ultimately be liable for
any disallowed costs stemming from the ongoing investigation.

In January 2011, in accordance with directives issued to the previous administration to reorganize
POET, the Preckwinkle administration began assessing numerous aspects of operations
and management, including staffing, ?scal and programmatic policies and procedures. During the
course of this review, the administration became aware of allegations of fraud within the 2009
and 2010 Summer Youth Programs.

This matter was then turned over to the County?s Independent Inspector General and
subsequently taken over by the U.S. Attomey?s Of?ce (U.S. AD.) for investigation. It is worth
noting that as a result of state programmatic audit ?ndings released in 2010, 2009 and
2010 Summer Youth Programs had been under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor?s
(U.S. DOL) Of?ce of the InSpector General. U.S. DOL, in conjunction with the U.S. 21.0., is now
conducting a thorough review of the summer programs. The investigations are ongoing.

As a result of the agency?s history and high risk status, POET has been completely restructured
and renamed Cook County Works (CCW). Effective December 2, 201 1, CCW ceased to operate
as a direct service provider and focus exclusively on the administration of the Workforce
Investment Act grant, while developing programming aimed at aligning job training with existing
and projected employment opportunities for Cook County residents.

NOTE 8 HUD AUDITS
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development?s (HUD) Of?ce of Inspector General
(010) issued an audit report, 2010-CH-1004 (dated February 13, 2010), that contained issues that

remain open at November 30, 201 1.

The US. Department of Homeland Security?s (DHS) Of?ce of the Inspector General (OIG)
issued a draft audit report in August 2011. Under the direction of the new Executive Director of
the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM), the
DHSEM conducted an internal audit of the program and provided the DHS 010 with comments
on the draft report in late September 2011. The ?nal report was issued by the DHS 010 in
December 2011. This report contained four (4) recommendations and concluded that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the State of Illinois, the Urban Area Working Group,
and Cook County did not ensure the effective implementation of Project Shield. As of the date of
this report, the DHSEM has been working with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and
the US. DHS to resolve the findings outlined in the OIG Audit Report.

NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In June 2011, the Mayor of the City of Chicago and the Cook County Board President
commissioned the creation of the Joint Committee on City County Collaboration. This group was
tasked with identifying means of streamlining the provision of services to residents while
increasing effectiveness and reducing costs. The Joint Committee reviewed more than 50
agenciestrograms and made recommendations for 19 of them, including workforce development.

The City of Chicago, West and South Suburban Cook County, and Northern Cook County
currently comprise three (3) separate Local Workforce Investment Areas (L WIA). Each LWIA
has a separate workforce board that receives and distributes its own Federal Workforce
Investment Act (WIA) funds. Across the region however, there is no coordination among the 3
workforce boards in each LWIA, nor is there an organization focused on creating a regional
workforce strategy grounded in cross-sector collaboration and innovative program development.

These de?ciencies impact the quality of service for local residents and businesses, as they are not
easily able to seek services across LWIA borders. Moreover, the lack of consistency throughout
the region negatively impacts the ability of businesses to access have to a well-trained labor force
to meet its current and future employment needs.

To improve the quality of services made available to local residents and businesses, and to
maximize administrative cost savings, the Mayor and the President have sought and received
approval for the recon?guration of the 3 aforementioned into a single LWIA, and a single
workforce board tasked with administering all regional WIA funds. The new LWIA will be
served by a non-pro?t administrative organization, The Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership
(CCWP), staffed under the model previously employed by the Chicago Workforce Investment
Council (CWIC) to drive strategic workforce development planning and implementation for the
entire region. The CCWP, which will amend articles of incorporation and acceded to its
501(c)(3) status, will also serve as the administrative staff to the Local Workforce Investment
Board and is scheduled to begin operations July I, 2012. Pursuant to an intergovernmental
agreement, upon recon?guration, any ?ndings (?scal or programmatic) will remain with the prior
existing LWIA.

INDEPENDENT REPORT ON COMPLIANCE
WITH REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A DIRECT AND MATERIAL EFFECT
ON EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER COMPLIANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH
0MB CIRCULAR A-133

To the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County, Illinois

Compliance

We have audited Cook County, Illinois? (the County) compliance with the types of compliance
requirements described in the US. Of?ce of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133
Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the County?s
major Federal programs for the year ended November 30, 2011. The County?s major Federal
programs are identi?ed in the Summary of Auditor?s Results section of the accompanying
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. Compliance with the requirements of laws,
regulations, contracts, and grants applicable to each of its major Federal programs is the
responsibility of the County?s management. Our responsibility is to express an Opinion on the
County?s compliance based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of Americas, the standards applicable to ?nancial audits contained in
Government Azaditinar Standards. issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and
OMB Circular A-133, ?Audits of States. Local Governments. and Non-Pro?t Oreonizations?.
Those standards and OMB Circular A-133 require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major Federal program
occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the County?s compliance
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit
does not provide a legal determination of the County?s compliance with those requirements.

16

Page 104 of218

in our opinion, the County complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major Federal
programs for the year ended November 30, 2011. However, the results of our auditing
procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance with those requirements, which are required to
be reported in accordance with OMB Circular A-l33 and which are described in the
accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as items 2011 .. l, 2011 - 3, 2011 4,
2011 ?5,2011 2011 2011 2011 10,2011 11,2011 I2, 2011? I3,
2011? 14,201] 15, 2011 - 16,2011 17, 2011 18, 2011 19, 2011 -20, 2011 ~21, 2011-
22 and 2011?23.

Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of the County is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants
applicable to Federal programs. In planning and performing our audit, we considered the
County?s internal control over compliance with the requirements that could have a direct and
material effect on a major program to determine the auditing procedures for the purpose of
expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance
in accordance with OMB Circular A-l33, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on
the effectiveness of the County?s internal control over compliance.

A de?ciency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or Operation of a control
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a Federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal
control over compliance is a de?ciency, or combination of de?ciencies, in internal control over
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of
compliance requirement of a Federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on
a timely basis.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in

the ?rst paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all de?ciencies in internal

control that might be de?ciencies, signi?cant de?ciencies, or material weaknesses. We did not
identify any de?ciencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material

weaknesses, as de?ned above. However, we identi?ed certain de?ciencies in internal control over
compliance that we consider to be signi?cant de?ciencies as described in the accompanying-
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as items 2011 2, 2011 3, 2011 4, 2011 5, 2011

2011 ?11,2011? 12,2011 ?-l3,2011 14,2011 
15, 2011?16, 2011?17, 2011 19, 2011? 20, 2011? 21, 2011? 22 and 2011? 24. A

significant de?ciency in internal control over compliance is a de?ciency, or a combination of
de?ciencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
Federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance,

yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

The County?s responses to the ?ndings identi?ed in our audit are described in the accompanying
Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. We did not audit the County?s responses and,
accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses.

Finding 2011 Questioned Costs: None

 

CRITERIA

2 CFR Part 225 (OMB Circular A-87), Appendix C, requires that all local governments claiming
central service costs must develop a cost allocation plan in accordance with the requirements
described in this Circular and retain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit.
?Each local government that has been designated as a "major local government" by the Of?ce of
Management and Budget (OMB) is also required to submit a plan to its cognizant agency
annually. OMB periodically lists major local governments in the Federal Register.? ?All central
service cost allocation plans will be prepared and, when required, submitted within six months
prior to the beginning of each of the governmental unit's ?scal years in which it proposes to claim
central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agency on a case-by-case
basis." ?All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: an organization chart
suf?ciently detailed to show operations including the central service activities of the Statez?local
government whether or not they are shown as bene?ting from central service functions; a c0py of
the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive Budget if budgeted costs
are being proposed) to support the allowable costs of each central service activity included in the
plan; and, a certi?cation that the plan was prepared in accordance with this Circular, contains
only allowable costs, and was prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among
the various Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awardsfactivities.?

?For each allocated central service, the plan must also include the following: a brief description of
the service, an identi?cation of the unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving
the service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the method used to distribute
the cost of the service to bene?ted agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of
each service to the speci?c bene?ted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringe bene?ts costs
are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services, documentation shall also be
included.?

CONDITION

The County?s County-wide cost allocation plan (CAP) was received by its cognizant agency, the
US. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) subsequent to the end of the current
Fiscal year. HUD granted the County an extension until December 12, 2011 to submit the 2011
CAP.

The CAP submitted by the County did not comply with the requirements of 2 CFR Part 225
(OMB Circular A-87).

Finding 2011 1 (Continued)

 

CONTEXT
During our test procedures we noted the following:

The CAP did not contain the required certi?cation that the plan was prepared in
accordance with OMB Circular A-87, contained only allowable costs, and was prepared
in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the various Federal awards and
between Federal and non-Federal awardsIactivities.

- The CAP did not contain the required organizational chart suf?ciently detailed to show
operations including the central service activities of the County, and whether or not they
are shown as bene?ting from central service functions.

a We requested and were not provided documentation supporting the amounts and
methodologies contained in the CAP.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with County management, the primary staff responsible for preparation of
the CAP is no longer with the County. The timing of this staff turnover impacted the submission
of the CAP as well as the maintenance of supporting documentation.

EFFECT

The failure to submit the CAP asrequired is a violation of Federal regulations, and as a result, the
County did not adequately support costs allocated to its applicable Federal programs.

RECOMMENDATION
We recommend the County allocate the appropriate resources to ensure that all costs of
centralized services charged to Federal programs are supported by a current centralized CAP that

meets the requirements described in OMB Circular A-87.

VIEWS OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS AND PLANNED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:

 

The County?s corrective action plan is on page 74.

CRITERIA

2 CFR Part 225, Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments (OMB Circular
Appendix A. General Principles for Determining Allowable Costs (C) Basic Guidelines
states that ?to be allowable under Federal awards, costs must meet certain general criteria,
including: 1) Be necessary and reasonable for proper and ef?cient performance and
administration of Federal awards; 2) Be allocable to Federal awards under the provisions of 2
CFR Part 225; 3) Be authorized or not prohibited under State or local laws or regulations; 4) Be
consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that apply uniformly to both Federal awards
and other activities of the governmental unit; 5) Be accorded consistent treatment. A cost may not
be assigned to a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for the same purpose in
like circumstances has been allocated to the Federal award as an indirect cost; and 6) Be
adequately documented.?

The County?s policies and procedures require that supervisors monitor, review, and approve
employee time worked, evidenced by the supervisor?s signature on the employee?s timesheets.

CONDITION

During the current year, certain County departments did not follow established policy and
procedures to ensure expenditures for program activities were properly supported and monitored

Summarization Sheet reported 16. Also, we noted the report was due on 3/10/20] 1, but
was not submitted until 3/22/20] 1.

The total free breakfasts served to students were 9,019 per the June 2011 Claim for
Reimbursement. However, the NSLP Summarization Sheet reported 9,015.

. For 3 NSLP Summarization Sheet reviewed, we selected a total of 49 days and
noted that the meal counts were not recorded for 9 days in June 20]] and 3 days in
November 20] 1.

Also, we were not provided with the 20]] Child Nutrition Program Annual Financial Report
covering the period from 7/ 1/2010 to 6/30/2011.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain adequate documentation could result in inaccurate reporting and the
impairment of the grantor agency?s ability to monitor program performance.

CAUSE

Management did not adequately supervise the required reports, or review reporting requirements.
RECOMMENDATION

We recommend JTDC immediately implement procedures to ensure accurate pmparation of the
Claims for Reimbursement and NSLP Summarization Sheets, as well as the Child
Nutrition Program Annual Financial Report, maintain adequate supporting documentation on the
information contained in the reports, and ensure the reports are properly reviewed and approved
prior to submission.

CRITERIA

Federal regulations (7 CFR section require distributing agencies to maintain
accurate and complete records with respect to the receipt, distributionfuse, and inventory of
donated foods including end products processed from donated foods.

Federal regulations (7 CFR section also require sub-grantees to take a physical
inventory of all storage facilities. Such inventory shall be reconciled annually with the storage
facility?s inventory records and maintained on ?le by the agency. Corrective action shall be taken
immediately on all de?ciencies and the results of the corrective action forwarded to the
distributing agency.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the County?s JTDC failed to establish adequate controls over
commodities inventory and to maintain accurate and complete inventory records in accordance
with applicable agreements and Federal regulations.

CONTEXT

Based on our review of the commodities inventory Reports and the Commodity Receipts Listing
for 4 months (January, March, September and November, 201 1) during the current ?scal year, we
noted the following:

- Variances were noted between the quantity received per the Inventory Report and the
Commodity Receipts for 5 commodities listed for March 201 1, 3 commodities listed for
September 2011, and commodity listed for November 2011.

a We were not provided pull sheets for these months, and as a result, the commodities
identi?ed as consumed per the Inventory Report were not adequately supported. Based
on discussions with management, the pull sheets were no longer being used to identify
commodities used during the month and the process was combined with the recording of
items on the Inventory Report. However, we noted no evidence of review and approval of
the Inventory Report to verify the accuracy of the data. Also, these procedures were not
documented as part of written policies and procedures manual.

. We were unable to obtain evidence that a physical inventory of commodities was
reconciled with Inventory Report. -

EFFECT

Failure to maintain accurate commodity records and reconcile physical inventories as required by
Federal regulations could result in the misstatement of perpetual records and the improper
distribution or loss of purchased andlor donated commodities. The failure to maintain adequate
controls over the monitoring, receipt, distribution and reporting of commodities could lead to
inaccurate reporting and loss of donated foods, including possible theft.

Per Federal regulations, the failure to maintain required records shall be considered prima facie
evidence of improper distribution or loss of donated foods (7 CFR section and the
agency, processor, or entity maybe required to pay USDA the value of the food or replace it in
kind (7 CFR section 

CAUSE

These situations continue to occur due to the failure of management to establish
apprOpriate policies and procedures to ensure accurate reporting and prevent potential loss of
commodities, and the inadequate monitoring of the controls over com moditiesfinventory.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend management implement procedures to ensure that 1) accurate and
complete records of used, purchased and donated foods are maintained in accordance with
Federal regulations and the grant agreement; 2) an annual physical inventory is conducted and
reconciled with inventory records; and 3) appropriate supervision and review exists in the food
servicefcommodities area. Also, the written policies and procedures should be established to
document all current practices and process regarding commodities inventory.

CRITERIA 

In accordance with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations (29 CF 
Part 5, ?Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contacts Governing Federally inanced, and
Assisted Construction?), non-Federal entities shall include in their construction contracts a
requirement that the contractor or subcontractor comply with the Davis-Bacon Act. This includes
a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit a certi?ed copy of the payroll and a
statement of compliance (29 CFR sections 5.5 and 5.6) to the non-Federal entity weekly, for each
week in which any contract work is performed.

OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .300(b) requires auditees to maintain internal control
over Federal programs that provides reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal
awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the DPD did not adequately document its compliance with
Federal Davis-Bacon requirements for the HOME program.

CONTEXT

Based on our testing of eleven (11) contractors? ?les, we reviewed twenty-two (22) certi?ed
payrolls and noted no evidence of review for the 22 certi?ed payrolls.

We also noted that the loan agreement for one (1) multi-farnily construction project did not
contain the required language on prevailing wages. -

EFFECT

Failure to monitor certi?ed payrolls submitted by contractors is a violation of Federal regulations
and impairs the ability to adequately monitor the Federally funded program. The failure to
include the required prevailing wage clauses could result in violations of Federal regulations. .

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, this situation was the result of management?s oversight
to monitor the appropriate documentation of the review process.

RECOMMENDATIONS
We recommend DPD establish policies and procedures to ensure its compliance with the Davis-

Bacon Act requirements and ensure that the documentation of procedures performed are
appropriately maintained.

EFFECT

Failure to ensure the accuracy of required reports impairs the grantor?s ability to monitor grant
activities and results in inaccurate ?nancial reporting. Failure to submit the required report is a
violation of Federal regulations and also impairs the grantor agency?s ability to adequately
monitor the Federally funded program.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, these situations resulted from management?s lack of
adequate review over the Federal reporting process.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend DPD comply with Federal reporting regulations by establishing and
implementing written policies and procedures to ensure accurate preparation, review and approval
of required reports.

CRITERIA

Circular No. A?l33, Subpart Federal Agencies 6'1. Pass-through Entities, 
requires that pass-through entities must monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to
ensure that Federal awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations,
and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and that performance goals are achieved.

OMB Circular A-l33 Subpart Section .400 requires pass-through entities to: (1) identify
Federal awards made by informing each subrecipient of Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
(CFDA) title and number, award name and number, award year; (2) advise subrecipients of
requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or
grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity;
(3) monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to ensure that Federal awards are used for
authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant
agreements and that performance goals are achieved; (4) ensure that subrecipients expending
$300,000 ($500,000 for ?scal years ending after December 31, 2003) or more in Federal awards
during the subrecipient?s fiscal year have met the audit requirements of this part for that ?scal
year; (5) issue a management decision on audit ?ndings within six months after receipt of the
subrecipient?s audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective
action; (6) consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through
entity's own records; and (7) require each subrecipient to permit the pass-through entity and
auditors to have access to the records and ?nancial statements as necessary for the pass-through
entity to comply with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a subrecipient
to have the required audits, the pass-through entity shall take appropriate action using sanctions.

Also, OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .405(a) states that the management decision shall
clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the
expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make ?nancial adjustments, or take other
action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be
given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may
request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor
assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management
decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, DPD did not adequately document its procedures for the
monitoring of subrecipients, which resulted in the noncompliance with Federal regulations.

CONTEXT
During our review of ?fty (50) subrecipients? ?les, we noted the following:

- Forty?eight (48) subrecipients? ?les had no documentation as to whether or not an A-l 33
audit was required. Also, we noted no evidence of receipt of the A-l33 reports. As a
result, we were unable to determine if DPD reviewed these reports, and if applicable,

0 Fifteen (15) subrecipients? ?les did not contain evidence as to whether DPD performed
the required annual on-site review and monitoring visit.

EFFECT

Failure to adequately monitor the activities and performance of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes and inability to adequately perform
risk assessments on subrecipients. . 

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management this situation resulted from staff turnover and subsequent
staff reorganizations as well as management oversight.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend DPD review and update established policies and procedures for monitoring its
subrecipients that includes at a minimum: l) ensuring all required subrecipient audit reports are
received and reviewed timely; 2) maintain documentation on reviews of subrecipients A-133
audits, and where applicable, issue timely management decisions on audit ?ndings to inform
subrecipients of needed corrective actions.

swim

CCW operates on a reimbursement basis. Expenditures are disbursed and reported in the State
Grant Reporting System (GRS) on a basis prior to CCW reimbursement requests to the
Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO).

Federal regulations (29 CF section 95.22 (D) implicitly require that reimbursements shall be

made for actual cash disbursements. Thus, expenditures must be disbursed prior to the date of the
reimbursement receipt.

Per the grant agreement, grant funds paid in advance of realized costs must be kept in an interest
bearing account and maintained therein until used in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the grant agreement.
CONDITION
During the current audit period, CCW did not comply with Federal regulations applicable to cash
management requirements. Also, we noted no procedures in place to ensure that the same
expendituresfcosts are not resubmitted for reimbursements.
CONTEXT
During our test of four (4) reimbursements, we noted the following:

0 Three (3) reimbursements of $1,519,830, $43,783, and $1,198,984, respectively, were

disbursed by the County after the reimbursement request date, ranging from 1 to 117

days. We noted no evidence that these funds were put into an interest-bearing account.

. For two (2) reimbursements, a total of $210,463 in accruals were included as part of the
reimbursement request.

0 For one (1) reimbursement, we noted expenditures of $164,659 which were also a part of
a previous reimbursement. As a result, this amount was reimbursed twice.

EFFECT

Failure to disburse program costs prior to requesting reimbursement and to ensure that duplicate
expenditures are not submitted for reimbursement is a violation of Federal regulations and could
result in the loss of funding and potential return of funds to the Federal government. Under the
reimbursement method of payment, amounts requested for reimbursement are required to be
disbursed prior to the reimbursement. As a result, the inclusion of accruals in the reimbursement
requests violates the Federal regulation.

CAUSE

This situation existed due to management oversight as a result of the reshu?ling of resources in
preparation of anticipated merger with other entities on July 1, 2012.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend CCW implement procedures to ensure incurred costs submitted for
reimbursement are disbursed prior to requesting reimbursements and that procedures are
developed and implemented to ensure that duplicate expenditures and accruals are not submitted
for reimbursements.

CRITERIA

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity Grant Programs Supporting
Documentation Guidelines state ?supporting documentation supports a value, cost, or
performance criteria relative to the grant.

Expenses must be necessary, reasonable, allocable, and allowable under the grant agreement.
Grantees must maintain ?le copies of all documentation related to the grant including documents
submitted to the Department.?

Per the grant agreements, the grantee is required to submit a trial balance as supporting
documentation with their quarterly status reports. The trial balance and supporting documentation
must include information on revenues and expenditures reported in the grantee accounting system
for the grant.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, CCW failed to comply with Federal requirements pertaining to
reporting requirements.

CONTEXT
During our testing, we noted the following:

The supporting documentation (excel spreadsheet and GRS Cost Ledger summary report)
for the close-out report for grant 09-681007 included total expenditures for the period of
$11,999,798. Per the Transaction Analysis provided (for Business Units (BU) 9010901,
9010902, 9010903 and 9010904 for period from 7f1108 to 89/11) the total grant
disbursements were $10,268,236. Based on discussions with management, the difference

CONTEXT (Continued)

0 Per the March 2011 quarterly ?nancial status report for grant 09-681007, we noted
expenditures of $1 1,095,362 was provided as part of the excel supporting documentation.
Per the Transaction Analysis provided (for BU 9010902 (for the period 7/1/08 to
9010903 and 9010904 (7/1/09 to 3/31/11), and BU 9181001 (7/1/10 to
3/31/11) the total grant disbursements were $11,391,356. Based on discussions with
management, the difference of $295,994 represented costs transferred to the ARRA
funded grant 08-761007. Based on this assumption, we expected grant 08-761007 to
re?ect a comparable difference. However, we noted grant 08-761007 included an
increase of $107,903 as budget modi?cation, leaving a net unexplained difference of

55] 88,091.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain adequate documentation resulted in inaccurate reporting, re?ecting an overage

of $901,373 in expenditures and is a violation of Federal requirements.

CAUSE

This situation existed due to management oversight as a result of the reshu?ling of resources in

preparation. of anticipated merger with other entities on July 1, 2012.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend CCW develop and implement procedures to ensure that adequate supporting

documentation is maintained to comply with Federal reporting requirements.

CRITERIA

Per EECBG Program Notice 10-013 (Effective Date: June 23, 2010), Guidance for State Energy
Program and Energy Ef?ciency and Conservation Block Grant Recipients on Payment
Procedures states that grantees are encouraged to utilize one or more of the following procedures
going forward: I) drawdown funds on ASAP as soon as it is administratively feasible to meet
their ongoing needs to disburse funds: at a minimum, to the extent practicable, grantees should
draw down funds every 2 weeks to make project-related disbursements; 2) minimize lag time
between the receipt of invoices and project-related disbursements to 2 weeks, where practicable;
and 3) provide advances to sub-grantees for disbursements of funds as necessary.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not establish
procedures to ensure funds were disbursed within two weeks of the receipt of invoices.

CONTEXT
During our test of ?ve (5) draw downs, we noted the following:

0 One drawdown for $125,587 was drawn down 6/15/20] 1. However, we noted a total of
$66,000 was disbursed on 7f7f2011.

I Another drawdown for $123,204 was drawn down 9/1/20] 1. However, we noted $1,300
was disbursed on 9f20/2011.

ELEM

Failure to ensure funds are not disbursed within the required two week period is a violation of
Federal regulations.

CAUSE

This situation existed due to the lack of adequate policies and procedures, and due to
management?s lack of understanding of the applicable Federal regulations.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Department of Environmental Control?s management update its policies and
procedures to include guidance on compliance with Federal cash management regulations on
drawdowns. Furthermore, we recommend the Department of Environmental Control implement
procedures to ensure Federal funds drawn down are disbursed within the required two. week
pe?od.

Finding 2011 13 Questioned Costs: None

 

CRITERIA

In accordance with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations (29 CFR
Part 5, ?Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Governing Federally Financed and
Assisted Construction?), non-Federal entities shall include in their construction contracts a
requirement that the contractor or subcontractor comply with the Davis-Bacon Act.

This includes a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the non-Federal entity
weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, a certi?ed copy of the payroll
and a statement of compliance (29 CFR sections 5.5 and 5.6).

OMB Circular A-l33 Subpart Section .300(b) requires auditees to maintain internal control
over Federal programs that provide reasonable assurance that the auditee is managing Federal
awards in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of the contracts or grant
agreements that could have a material effect on each of its Federal programs.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not adequately
document its compliance with Federal Davis-Bacon requirements for the EECBG program.

CONTEXT

During our review of the Department of Environmental Control?s Manual of Administrative
Procedures, we noted references to a website that provides an overview of the Davis-Bacon
requirements and other links providing information about Davis-Bacon compliance. However,
these procedures do not provide required policies and procedures in a detailed manner that
ensures that controls are in place over compliance with the requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act.
Based on our testing of nine (9) subrecipients? ?les we noted the following:

0 Eight (8) subrecipients? files had no evidence of the review of the certified payrolls.

I One (1) subrecipient ?le had no evidence of the Department of Environmental Control?s
receipt of the certified payrolls.

- Two (2) subrecipients? ?les had no evidence of employee interviews being performed.
EFFECT
Failure to monitor certi?ed payrolls submitted by contractors is a violation of Federal regulations
and impairs the Department of Environmental Control?s ability, _to adequately monitor the
Federally funded program. The lack of written policies and procedures IS a significant de?ciency

and impairs the Department of Environmental Control?s ability to consistently comply with
Davis-Bacon requirements.

42 USC 17154 states that an eligible entity may use a grant received under this part to carry out
activities to achieve the purposes of the program, including (5) the provision of grants to
nonpro?t organizations and governmental agencies for the purpose of performing energy
ef?ciency retro?ts.

For the purposes of the EECBG Program, ?city? includes a city-equivalent unit of local
government as de?ned by the US. Census of Governments. For example, a city-equivalent unit
of local government such as town, village, or other municipality shall be considered eligible if it
meets the required population thresholds. Consolidated city-county governments will be
considered as cities.

Cities that are eligible for direct formula grants from the DOE are those that have a population of
at least 35,000, or that are one of the 10 highest populated cities of the state in which the city is
located. ln states that have incorporated eligible municipalities (villages) within the boundaries
of other incorporated eligible municipalities (towns), the village population will be subtracted

CONDITION

During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not comply with
Federal eligibility requirements. Also, the Department of Environmental Control did not
maintain written polices and procedures to document adequate compliance with eligibility
requirements.

CONTEXT

During our review of IO subrecipients? eligibility ?les, we noted no supporting documentation
was maintained to determine compliance with the eligibility requirements for local governments
and non-govemmental units. Speci?cally, for local governments, we noted no determination of
whether or not the applicable subrecipients met the population requirement. For non-
govemments, we noted no determination of whether or not the applicable subrecipients met the
ability to perform the energy ef?ciency retro?ts requirement.

EFFECT

Failure to adequately document the eligibility determinations of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes and the Department of Environmental
Control?s inability to adequately perform risk assessments on subrecipients.

The lack of detailed written procedures is a signi?cant de?ciency and impairs the Department of
Environmental Control?s ability to adequately monitor its subrecipients to ensure compliance
with Federal regulations.

CAUSE

This situation existed due to the lack of adequate policies and procedures, and due to
management?s lack of understanding of the applicable Federal regulations.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Department of Environmental Control immediately ad0pt and implement
written policies and procedures over eligibility to ensure compliance with Federal regulations. In
addition, supporting documentation should be maintained to support all eligibility determinations.

CRITERIA

Circular No. A - 133, Subpart Federal Agencies Pass-through Entities, 
requires that pass?through entities must monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to
ensure that Federal awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations,
and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and that performance goals are achieved.

OMB Circular A-l33 Subpart Section .400 requires pass-through entities to: (1) identify
Federal awards made by informing each subrecipient of Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
(CFDA) title and number, award name and number, award year; (2) advise subrecipients of
requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or
grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity;
(3) monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to ensure that Federal awards are used for
authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant
agreements and that performance goals are achieved; (4) ensure that subrecipients expending
$300,000 ($500,000 for ?scal years ending after December 31, 2003) or more in Federal awards
during the subrecipients ?scal year have met the audit requirements of this part for that ?scal
year; (5) issue a management decision on audit ?ndings within six months after receipt of the
subrecipients audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective
action; (6) consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through
entity's own records; and require each subrecipient to permit the pass?through entity and
auditors to have access to the records and ?nancial statements as necessary for the pass-through
entity to comply with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness of a subrecipient
to have the required audits, the pass-through entity shall take appropriate action using sanctions.

Also, OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .405(a) states that the management decision shall
clearly state whether or not the audit ?nding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the
expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make ?nancial adjustments, or take other
action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action,__a__timetable for follow-up should be
given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may
request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor
assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management
decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.

CRITERIA {Continued}

In addition, the Department of Environmental Control?s policies and procedures require that its
management performs both an initial and a ?nal on-site monitoring visit, documented by a
checklist.



During the current audit period, the Department of Environmental Control did not adequately
document its procedures for the monitoring of subrecipients, which resulted in noncompliance
with Federal regulations.

CONTEXT
During our review of ten-(10) subrecipients? ?les we noted the following:

I Eight (8) subrecipients? ?les had no documentation as to whether or not an A-133 audit
was required. Also, we noted no evidence of receipt of the A-133 reports. As a result, we
were unable to determine if the Department of Environmental Control reviewed these
reports, and if, applicable, issued a management decision on audit ?ndings in accordance
with OMB Circular A433 Subpart Section .405(a).

- Five (5) subrecipient ?les did not contain the checklist documenting that the initial on-
site monitoring visit was performed. 

EFFECT

Failure to adequately monitor the activities and performance of subrecipients could result in
Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes and the Department of Environmental
Control?s inability to adequately perform risk assessments on subrecipients.

CAUSE

This situation existed due to the lack of adequate policies and procedures, and due to
management?s lack of understanding of the applicable Federal regulations.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend the Department of Environmental Control review and update established policies
and procedures for monitoring its subrecipients that includes at a minimum: 1) ensuring all
required subrecipient audit reports are received and reviewed timely; 2) maintain documentation

on reviews of subrecipients A-133 audits, and where applicable, issue timely management
decisions on audit ?ndings to inform subrecipients of needed corrective actions.

CONTEXT

Based on our review of the equipment listings provided for the County?s current ?scal year, we
noted the following:

a Total equipment from inception to date as recorded by the DHSEM was $26,731,370.
Total equipment per the Comptroller?s Of?ce was $25,119,906, for a difference of
$1,611,464.

- Master equipment listing ($26,731,370) and the equipment reconciliation
listing ($24,765,936) did not agree. A difference of $1,965,434 was noted between the
two listings. The difference appears to represent FY 2011 additions, which was not
included on the equipment reconciliation listing. It appears the reconciliation was
prepared using FY2010 amounts.

During our test of 25 equipment items (13 from DHSEM equipment listing and 12 from the
Comptroller?s equipment listing), we noted the following:

a Ten (10) equipment items tested represent FY 2011 additions that were not
included in the Comptroller's equipment records.

0 Four (4) of the Comptroller?s equipment items tested were not included on 
equipment records.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain accurate and complete property records and adequately reconcile physical
inventories and equipment listings could result in the misstatement of perpetual records and
improper distribution of purchased equipment, as well as loss of Federally funded equipment due
to damage, theft, or fraud.

CAUSE

Based on discussions with management, these situations occurred due to inadequate monitoring
of controls over equipment inventory and miscommunications between the two departments.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend management establish a system to ensure that a complete and accurate
listing of all assets acquired is maintained and that equipment records are adequately updated for
any asset purchased or disposed of during the year in accordance with Federal regulations.

Management should implement policies and procedures to ensure a complete physical inventory
is performed at least once every two years and reconciled to the equipment listing.

my

Based on our review, we noted DHSEM developed a policies and procedures Grants manual with
an effective date of December 31, 2011. As a result, DHSEM did not maintain adequate written
policies and procedures for monitoring its subrecipients during ?scal year 2011. Also, while we

noted that the manual does address some of the basic Federal requirements for subrecipient
monitoring, the manual does not include any procedures to describe how these policies are met.

Due to staff turnover in the program and lack of adequate documentation, we were unable to test
the current status of controls over subrecipient monitoring.

Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASWHomeland Securitv Grant (HSG) Programs

During our review, we noted no evidence as to whether DHSEM performed any monitoring visits
(?scal or_ programmatic) or received periodic progress reports for its subrecipients. Also, we
noted no documentation as to whether or not an A-133 audit was required. As a result, we were
unable to determine if DHSEM reviewed these reports, and if applicable, issued a management
decision on audit ?ndings in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 Subpart Section .405(a).

In addition, based on our review of the subrecipients? agreements, we noted no clear language
advising subrecipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the
provisions of contracts or grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by
DHSEM.

EFFECT

Failure to communicate the requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the
provisions of contracts or grant agreements and to adequately monitor the activities and
performance of subrecipients could result in Federal awards being used for unauthorized purposes
and inability to adequately perform risk assessments on subrecipients. The lack of

CAUSE (Continued)

UA 

Based on discussions with management, these situations occurred due to staff turnover which lead
to inadequate monitoring of controls over subrecipient monitoring during the current period, and
the lack of adequate written policies and procedures.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend DHSEM immediately adopt and implement written policies and procedures over
subrecipient monitoring to ensure compliance with Federal regulations. Also, the procedures
should be detailed enough to identify the nature, timing and extent of the procedures to be
performed. These procedures should include at a minimum: 1) ensuring all required subrecipient
audit reports are received and reviewed timely; 2) maintain documentation on reviews of
subrecipients A-133 audits, and where applicable, issue timely management decisions on audit
?ndings to inform subrecipients of needed corrective actions. -

In addition, subrecipients? agreements should include clear language to advise the subrecipients
of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or
grant agreements, as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by DHSEM.

CRITERIA {Continued}

Cook County was to perform pre and post inspections of all participants? homes to ensure the
need for rehabilitation work and mold remediation was effectively resolved. inspections were to
ensure work to be completed was in accordance with contract speci?cations.

CONDITION

During the current audit period, DHSEM failed to comply with the special tests requirements for
the 8530, Illinois Disaster Assistance Grant. Furthermore, we noted no written policies and
procedures to ensure compliance with Federal requirements regarding special test provisions.

CONTEXT

During the current period, due to staff turnover and a lack of adequate documentation, we were
unable to test the current status of controls over contractors? project ?les.

EFFECT

Failure to maintain supporting documentation, including required inSpections, could result in
Federal funds being disbursed for unauthorized and unallowable activities. The lack of written
policies and procedures is a signi?cant de?ciency and impairs ability to ensure
compliance with Federal regulations.

CAUSE

Per discussions with management, the program?s period of availability for the expenditure of
program funds was not adequately monitored. This caused DHSEM to increase its efforts to
ensure the timely expenditure of program funds, and as a result, failed to establish adequate
policies and procedures to ensure that required documentation was maintained.
RECOMMENDATION

We recommend DHSEM maintain documentation of all required pre and post inSpection and
other documentation necessary to ensure compliance with contract and Federal requirements.
Also, written policies and procedures should be developed and implement to ensure compliance
with special test provisions.

CONTEXT
During our test of twenty four (24) Federally-funded contracts, we noted the following:
. One OPA contract ?le was not provided for our review.

a The contracts did not contain certain provisions required by Circular A-102

CONTEXT 1 Continued 

For twelve (12) contracts, we noted no documentation of whether the required
veri?cations of delinquent taxes and fees were performed.

I For two (2) contracts, we noted no evidence of compliance with requirements
andfor waivers of such requirements.

0 The CPA did not monitor Federally-funded contracts to ensure that contracts in excess of
$100,000 were approved by the Federal awarding agency. The OPA does not obtain
copies of grant agreements from user departments to perform monitoring with grant
agreement provisions, in order to determine the applicability of this compliance
requirement.

During the current audit period, we were unable to obtain any evidence that the GPA performed
monitoring of Open Market Purchases in amounts greater than $750 and less than $100,000 to
ensure that aggregate expenditures to the same vendor for the same, or substantially the same
contractual services within the same ?scal year equaling a sum of $25,000 or more, were
approved by the County Board. . 

EFFECT

Failure to include the required contract provisions is a violation of Federal regulations and could
result in non-compliance with Federal regulations by contractors, subcontractors, and vendors of
Federally-funded contracts.

Per Federal regulations, if a participant knowingly does business with an excluded person, the
Federal agency responsible for the transaction could disallow costs, annui or terminate the
transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend the participant, or take other remedies as
deemed appropriate.

Failure to comply with the provisions of the Cook County Code could result in contract
termination. Also, the failure of the GPA to maintain adequate documentation of the monitoring
of potential delinquencies in taxes and fees, including child support, impairs the ef?ciency of the
contract award/evaluation process, and could result in unquali?ed vendorsfcontractors being
awarded Federally funded contracts.

inadequate controls surrounding the monitoring of multiple contractual services expenditures to
the same vendors for the same services, allows user departments and vendors to potentially
circumvent the required County Board approval process in cases where the aggregate contractual
service expenditures exceed $25,000 in a given ?scal year; ultimately resulting in non-
compliance with Cook County Code.

The failure to determine if federally-funded contracts include Recovery Act funding could result
in Recovery Act funded contracts violating Federal requirements.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the GPA develop procedures to ensure all federally-funded contracts include the
required contract provisions as described in OMB Circular A-102 Common Rule. Also,
management should implement policies and control procedures to ensure vendors who are
awarded contracts are monitored against the Federal EPLS system.

We further recommend the GPA review the Cook County Code and establish policies and

should be provided to ensure that employee responsibilities are clearly understood.

Finally, we recommend the GPA establish and implement written policies and procedures to
ensure controls exist to monitor whether or not user departments follow prescribed guidelines for
complying with prescribed procurement requirements and approvals prior to entering into
agreements with vendors. This includes establishing a system for monitoring Open Market
Purchases in amounts greater than $750 and less than $100,000 to ensure that aggregate
expenditures to the same vendor for the same, or substantially the same contractual services
within the same ?scal year equaling a sum of $25,000 or more, were approved by the County

CONTEXT

The County?s data collection forms and the reporting packages (includes the single audit report
and the basic ?nancial statements) are due no later than August 31?? of each year. During our
review of the submissions of the prior two ?scal years? data collection forms and reporting
packages, we noted the reporting package for ?scal year 2009 was dated August 31, 2010.
However, the data collection form and the reporting package were not submitted to the Federal
Audit Clearinghouse until October 4, 2010. As a result of M-10-14, no extension was allowed for
?scal year 2009.

EFFECT

As a result of not submitting the data collection form and the reporting paCkage in a timely

CRITERIA

OMB Circular Subpart C-Auditees, Section 300 Auditee responsibilities states that
?the auditee shall identify, in its accounts, all Federal awards received and expended and the
Federal programs under which they were received.?

Mill?N

The County failed to maintain adequate controls to ensure that all Federal awards received and
expended were identi?ed in its accounts.

CONTEXT

During the current year, the County presented a preliminary Schedule of Expenditures of Federal
Awards for audit. Subsequently, the County discovered the following:

I Approximately $16 million in non-cash assistance in the form of Federally funded
equipment received by the County was not in the County?s accounts nor identi?ed in the
preliminary Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards.

0 Approximately $2.4 million in Federal expenditures that were not identi?ed as such in
the County?s accounts nor identi?ed in the preliminary Schedule of Expenditures of
Federal Awards.

EFFECT

Failure to identify all Federal awards received and expended could cause the understatement of
Federal expenditures in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and allow Federal
awards to not be reported and audited accordance with OMB Circular A-133 and thus could
result 1n violations of Federal regulations.

was

Typically Federal grants are approved by the County Board of Commissioners, a new business
unit established for the grant by the Budget Office, and the activity of the grant administered by
the applicable department, and receipts and expenditures accounted for by the Of?ce of the
Comptroller. However, certain other types of Federal awards are received unconventionally in
forms other than grants, and based on discussions with management, due to a lack of
understanding of the various forms of Federal awards received, some County departments failed

Re: Response to 2011 Single Audit Finding Numbers 2
Dear Mr. Reinhold:
Demiled herein are Cook County Work?s responses to the Single Audit Findings issued by Washington,
Pimnan, McKeever, LLC regarding the period of December 1, 2010 to November 30, 2011. As you know,
we are in the process of making signi?cant policy and procedural changes wimin Cook County Works

(formerly known as the President?s Of?ce of Employment Training (POET). We look forward to working
with you to ensure our Department?s successful compliance with all federal, state and county requirements.

Finding 2011?2 mil?CM. 

3 1..

During the current year, CCW did not ensure expenditures for program activities were properly supported
and monitored for compliance with federal guidelines.

 

Speci?cally, this audit ?nding points to a sample evaluation of timesheets and indicates that several
were unsigned hy the direct supervisor. First, there were a total of 7 unsigned timesheeis all of which
permined to the same time period during which the supervisor was on vacation due to the holiday. The other
reported incidents were not validated upon our review of the actual Iimesheeis. Although the individual time
sheets may not have been signed by the employee?s supervisor, the Director of ?re department did in fact
review the reported time records and signed off on the timekeeping reports prior to their submission to the
Comptroller?s of?ce for payroll processing.

The ?nding also indicated that for one employee the timekeeping records do not accurately re?ect
domentation of 3.5 hours. As of February 2012 the Director?s Executive Assistant will be responsible for 
ensuring that these tasks are being done correctly. Due to the merger of 3 Local workforce Investment Areas
CCW will cease to exist as ofjune 30, 2012 and that the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership


Page 165 of218

(CCWP) is being formed to be the new LWIA for all 3 areas, and will be responsible for compliance after
June 30, 2012.

In sum, the above completes out responses to the ?nding. If you have any questions or concems, please do
not hesitate to contact Kirklinn Fowlkes, Fiscal Manager at (312) 603-0226.

The Business and Finance Department has add ressed the following issues for the ?ndings in the
Fiscal Year 2011 and a Corrective Action Plan has been initiated by the Director of Business and
Finance:

1. Finding 2011-3: Failure to maintain adequate documentation could result in inaccurate
reporting and impairment of the gra ntor agency?s ability to monitor program
performance:

The current process of inputting data on a basis has been changed to weekly starting
June 1, 2012. This will allow the opportunity to review the document, the data submitted,
correct or improve collection and distribution procedures, etc.

The Nutrition Program Annual Financial Report was submitted prior to last year?s audit thereby
denying .ITDC the ability to take corrective action for the year. However, .ITDC submitted the
Report for 2011-2012 school year with supporting documentation.

2. Finding 2011-4: .ITDC failed to establish adequate controls over commodities inventory and to
maintain accurate and complete inventory records in accordance with applicable agreements
and federal regulations.

The inventory reports and pull sheets have been separated into two sections

(donated/pu rchased) in accordance with JT DC policies and federal regulations. Management will
review and audit the individual reports and approve after ensuring accuracy of
information. Written policies and procedures for commodities inventory will be revised by June
30, 2012. The revisions will include address the issue with annual audit and reconciliation of
commodities. The policy will be created by the Business Analyst, and reviewed?by the Director
of Business and Finance. Also, the Director of Business and Finance will provide oversight on the
inventory to ensure that all activities are reviewed by management.

Discrepancies will be documented and reported on a basis.

Yearly audits will be conducted in the same manner ensuring accuracy of information.

Re: Response to 2011 Single Audit Finding Numbers 10 a: 11
Dear Mr. Reinhold:

Detailed herein are Cook County 1Work?s responses to the Single Audit Findings issued by Washington,
Pittman, McKeever, LLC regarding the period of December 1, 2010 to November 30, 201 1. As you know,
we are in the process of making signi?cant policy and procedural changes within Cook County Works
(fonnerly known as the President?s Of?ce of Employment Training (POET). We look forward to working
with you to ensure our Department?s successful compliance with all federal, state and county requirements.

Finding 2011-10 - 659
2 1. .
During the current audit period, did not comply with federal regulations applicable to cash management

requirements. Also, noted no procedures in place to ensure that the same expendimres/ costs are not
submitted for reimbursements. -

   

CCW implemented rocedures in 0 her 2011 to ensure incurred costs for reimbursements are disbursed
prior to request'mg reimbursement. Currently prints out for support includes the County?s Check
Register and Trans Action Analysis to document cost already paid when requesting funds. The activity
selected transpired before implementation of current procedures. Due to the merger of 3 Localworkforce
Investment Areas CCW will cease to exist as of June 30, 2012 and that the Chicago Cook
Workforce Partnership (CCWP) is being formed to be the new LWIA for all 3 areas, and will be responsible
for compliance after June 30, 2012.

In the process of closing out the ARRA Adult and Dislocated Wodter Grant, direct cost to the grant for two
sub-grantees totaling $210,463 was included in the ?nal drawdown for the grant at close-out. Funds were not
immediately paid out due to ?scal and programmatic moniton'ng issues in which disallowed costs had to be
calculated and netted against ?nal vouchers to he paid. CCW will implement procedures to ensure that funds

Helium?
Page 173 of 218

are paid out in a more ef?cient lime line, and implement altemaiive procedures dmling with disallowed cost.

CCW has reviewed the allocation of staffsalaiies for the period 10/10/2009 to 03/27/2010 in the W09
grant# 09-68100? and a duplicate expenditure was included for one reimbursement request It' is
recommended that the questioned cost be removed from the grant and like costs from grant# 10-68100? be
transfened to replace those costs. The Fiscal Manager in cooperation with the County?s Comptroller?s Of?ce
will be responsible for completing this task. November 2012 should be the last year this program is re?ected
in the County?s Single Audit.

Finding 2011?11 Wham-Jinn:

1..

During the cunent audit period, CCW failed to comply with federal requirements pertaining to reporting
requirements.

 

When the current administration took over in early of 2011, there were millions of dollars in jeopardy of
being returned to the grantor. To minimize this possible occurrence, pennission was granted from the
grantor of the funds to use the FIFO method for WLA grants running concurrently. This entailed moving
thousands of transactions back to grants closing out ?rst. In the process of identifying and compiling - -
transactions, to support the transfers, some transfers were not posted in the Gnunty?s accounting system in
time to he recognized for the 2011 Single Audit.

This was an extraordinary situation that should not occur again at this magnitude. CCW will implement
procedures to address any ?nite transfers so that they are completed and recognizedin the proper period
Due to the merger of 3 Local workforce Investment Areas 5), CCW will cease to exist as ofjune 30,
2012 and that the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership (CCWP) is being formed to be the new LWIA for all
3 areas, and will be responsible for compliance afterjune 30, 2012. 

In sum, the above completes our- responses to the ?ndings. If you have any questions or concerns, please do
not hesitate to contact Kirklinn Fowlkes, Fiscal Manager at (312) 603-0226.

Finding Response - Corrective Actions

Responder: Kevin Givens - Deputy Director

To: Takashi Reinhold - Interim Comptroller

Finding 2011-12
Reaggnso:

I The matter of timely disbursement has always been a collective issue. Currently the
Department of Environmental Control makes the request for funds via the ASAP System
based on payment request from sub recipients then sent to the comptroller. Within
twenty four to thirty six hours the funds are deposited into an account managed by
the Comptroller's Office. The disbursement initiation after the point of deposit is
the responsibility of Comptroller's Office.

Corrective Action

I A cut off period of the 15th of every month will be established for the processing of
payment requests. Requests received after the 15th will be held for the following
month.

I Payment request from sub recipients will be processed then forwarded to the
Comptroller?s Office with all necessary documentation and signatures.

I After payment requests have been processed and checks disbursed to Sub recipient
{verified via transaction analysis) a request for reimbursement of disbursed funds
will be submitted via the ASAP System by the Program Manager.

a An email will be forwarded to the Comptroller?s Office informing him of the Federal
Compliances regarding disbursement timetables

I A single tracking document will be created that identifies when the draws were
requested. when they were disbursed and what sub?recipients were involved. This will
tie the fed draw to the disbursement entries and the sub-recipient payments reported

Finding 2011?14
RasEgnsa:

The Department of Environmental Control role is to manage the EECBG program. This
Department did not have a significant role in the sub recipient selection process. The
decision of which sub recipients would participate in the EECBG Program was determined by
the Bureau of Community and Economic Development during the period of 2009-2010. It was
communicated to the Department of Environmental Control by previous administrators in the
Bureau of Community and Economic Development that the sub recipient selection was based
on set of entities that were previously awarded grant funding from the HUD funded
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).

Corrective Action

For future federal grants the Department of Environmental Control will develop a written
policy and procedure regarding the selection process that will cover program goals to
track with federal goals. 

Scoring Criteria, which will be used to verify federal eligibility requirements
Performance evaluation criteria.

Reporting formats requirements.

Selection process including role of Cook County Departments, Board of Commissioners
and Others.

The issues mentioned in finding 2011-15 can be attributed to multiple actions by both the
Department of Environmental Control and that of the Comptroller's Office.

The double signature requirement for the approval of 29A submittals has been
implemented recently without the Department's prior knowledge, thus 29A were
submitted back to the Department weeks after their submittal to the Comptroller's
Office for corrective action.

The documentation requirement for 29A submittals has changed recently without the
Department's prior knowledge, thus 29A were submitted back to the Department weeks
after their submittal to the Comptroller's Office for corrective action.

Corrective Action

The following will become part of the Standard Operating Procedures for the financial and
program administration activities: -

RE: FY 2011 Single Audit-Corrective Action Plan

 

Please see below for the Corrective Action Plans for the Department of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management for the FY 2011 Single Audit.

Finding 2011-17

CAUSE

With regard to the year-end equipment reconciliation, the difference between the
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM) Master
List and the Comptroller?s Of?ce records was due to a miscommunication between
the two departments.

Ell I: . ii .

The President took office as the new head of the Cook County Board in December
2010, Almost immediately. she identi?ed the DHSEM as in need of a change in
leadership and signi?cant reorientation in mission. Upon being appointed to head
the department in May 2011. the new Executive Director ofthe DHSEM conducted
his own independent review of the Department; this quickly identi?ed a lack of
transparency and accountability across a variety of areas. One of the areas
identi?ed as in need of signi?cant reform was inventory and asset management as
well as tracking.

Pagge3181of218

in 2011, the DHSEM purchased an asset tracking software system to aid in the
tracking of its equipment. This system will tie in directly with the DHSEM master
equipment inventory list and will assist the Department in accurately tracking any
updates and disposals of equipment. The DHSEM has been working on
implementing this system and anticipates that it will be fully functional by
September 30, 2012. Similarly. DHSEM has developed a detailed written procedure
for inventory of equipment under the Department.

in addition, over the last year, the DHSEM has conducted physical inventory
inspections on its equipment. Speci?c procedures for a complete biennial physical
inventory have been developed and are included in' the Equipment Inventory
procedures.

The DHSEM will work closely with the Comptroller's Of?ce to develop a 
process for reconciliation of the DHSEM master equipment inventory list against the
Comptroller?s Of?ce listing.

The Director of Financial Controls will be responsible for ensuring that this
Corrective Action Plan is implemented.

Finding 2011-18

CAUSE

The quarterly report was not completed in a timely manner due to signi?cant staff
turnover during this reporting period. Previous staff members responsible for
completing this reporting requirement were no longer with the Department at the
time the report was due. As a result, this report was not submitted until a month
later. by the new staff hired to the Department in August.

?m?l in I. a? 

The DHSEM made various staff adjustments and hired a new Director of Financial
Controls as well as a new Grants Manager to oversee and complete the reporting
requirements of all grant programs maintained under the 

To assist in ensuring that issues do not arise, the DHSEM has developed a Reporting

Calendar to track due dates for all grant reporting. The Grants Manager will be
responsible for ensuring that this Calendar is updated.

Pagge4182 of218

 

 

 

 

Finding 2011-19

CAUSE

The new Executive Director of the DHSEM started in May 2011. In addition, the new
Director of Financial Controls and the new Grants Manager started in August and
October 2011, respectively. By the time the new DHSEM staff was in place, the
grant, with an expiration date of June 30, 2011 had ended. With the change in
administration and the turnover at the Department, the DHSEM was not able to
perform subrecipient monitoring in 2011.


SSBQ

The DHSEM has contacted the State to resolve this finding since the grant is now
expired.

In regards to the recommendation to ?immediately adopt and implement written
policies and procedures over subrecipient the new Executive
Director of the DHSEM started in May 201 1; the new Director of Financial Controls
and the new Grants Manager started in August and October 20 11, respectively.
DHSEM immediately began the development of a Grants Policies and Procedures
manual, which also included subrecipient monitoring processes. in August of 2011.
Over the course of the 2011 ?scal year, the document was in review in draft form
and then made effective as of December 1, 2011 to coincide with the new ?scal year.
The policies and procedures contained within the manual were being utilized from
August onwards.

The DHSEM will continue to audit the grant in question and. if possible, perform
subrecipient monitoring ofthe subrecipients associated with this grant program, if
necessary.

The Director of Financial Controls, along with the Grants Manager, will be
reSponsible for performing sub-recipient monitoring 

 

The DHSEM did include language in the subgrant agreements to address federal.
state and local requirements for the subrepicient. Per Section VLG. of the Cook
County DHSEM subgrant agreement titled, ?Compliance with Laws, State/ County
Agreement?, it states that the subgra ntees "shall comply with all applicable laws,
ordinances, rules and regulations of the federal, state and local 
may affect the. performance of this grant?. The subgrantees also "agrees to adhere to
all provisions imposed upon the Cdunty under the State/ County Agreement". This

Page of 218

agreement was attached as an exhibit to all subgrantee agreements between the
DHSEM and the subgrantees.

Additionally, the DHSEM has revised and improved the language in all subgrant
agreements beginning in 2012. The new grant agreement format contains detailed
language on subrecipient requirements imposed on them by federal. state and
county laws and regulations. The revised subgrant agreements have also been
approved by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, DHSEM's grantor.

In regards to the recommendation to ?immediately adopt and implement written
policies and procedures over subrecipient the new Executive
Director of the DHSEM started in May 201 1; the new Director of Financial Controls
and the new Grants Manager started in August and October 2011, respectively.
DHSEM immediately began the development of a Grants Policies and Procedures
manual, which also included subrecipient monitoring processes. in August of 2011.
Over the course of the 2011 ?scal year, the document was in review in draft form
and then made effective as of December 1, 2011 to coincide with the new ?scal year.
The policies and procedures contained within the manual were being utilized from
August onwards. I

The DHSEM will perform subrecipient monitoring for all of its subgrantees. The

Director of Financial Controls, along with the Grants Manager, will be responsible
for performing the sub?recipient monitoring.

CALEB

With the change in administration and the turnover at the Department, the DHSEM
was not able to perform post inspections of all the participants' homes. The new
Executive Director of the DHSEM started in May 2011. In addition, the new Director
of Financial Controls and the new Grants Manager started in August and. October
2011, resnectively. By the time the new DHSEM staff was in place, the grant, with an
expiration date of June 30. 2011 had ended. As a result of this, it was not plausible
for the new DHSEM staff to perform post inspections of the participants' homes.
Grant funds had alreadyr been paid out to the subrecipients prior to the new DHSEM
staff arriving and the grant was closed out with the State' in September 20 11.

The DHSEM has contacted the State to resolve this ?nding since the grant is now
expired.

With regard to the policies and procedures, DHSEM has already put in place and
enforced written policies and procedures for all grant subrecipients.

RE: 2011 Single Audit Action Plan Update

 

Finding 2011-21

Corrective Action Plan:

A number of changes are being implemented through ongoing process improvement to streamline processes and ascertain
compliance with procurement and applicable laws.

1.

Adoption of a review checklist for federally-?rnded projects. Checklists were developed, including one for the

federally-?rnded projects. While we did not go back to review contracts that had already been awarded, the
checklist prompts the inclusion of federal clauses whenever an amendment to an existing contract is being
developed.

Inclusion of federal clauses; As of November I, 2011, the federal clauses were added to the standard general
conditions for federally-?rnded projects. Contracts entered into prior to that date may not include the federal
provisions if it was not known that the contract was federally ?mded. Once the condition was discovered, action
was taken to insert federal provisions on a case-by-case basis for contacts that were in progress.

Backgr_ound Check. A checklist was developed and being tested to record the vendor?s compliance with all County
requirements. Improvements to the checklist are being made to capture all necessary information and make it easy
to read. Once compliance with all requirements is veri?ed, the information will be entered into the contract
management system. The Excluded Parties review is routinely performed as part of the background check process
for contracts equal to or exceeding $10,000.

Noncompliant Purchases: A proposed policy has been developed and submitted to various departments for
operational and legal review. A report has also been developed for the implementation of the policy proposed. The
goal of the policy is to capture information on non-compliant purchases, address using department internal control
de?ciencies, and identify any patterns that may lead to unacceptable or unlawful practices as it relates to the
contracting process at the County.

Record Keeping: A new ?ling process will be implemented to improve record keeping and minimize the loss or
misplacement of documents. This project will be initiated in late fall of 2012. In addition, a contract management
system is being implemented with capabilities to create an electronic central repository of contract information. All
procurement, contract and related documents can be created or scanned into the system. Electronic availability of
documents will reduce the handling of paper ?les, which at times result in incomplete or missing ?les.

Please advise if there are any questions.

Subject: Federal Audit Response

Cook County Health and Hospitals System?s Supply Chain is currently reviewing all policies and procedures related to all
contract and procurement processes which includes those speci?c to federally funded grants. We will be working closely
with the Health System legal counsel in modifying such policies and procedures that are affected as related to the
inclusion of all required language, including that which is speci?c for federally funded grants. Further, we will work with the
Health System leadership and the System Board in presenting and receiving approval for all changes necessary to
cunent policies and procedures to comply with all required language including that for federally funded grants. We will
also be developing training to be given to all applimble staff members for the checking of vendors from all applicable
databases that contain notice of type of disbannent, so that we do not enter into a contract with them inappropriately.

In addition to the above, there will be a documented training session developed for all Cook County Health and Hospitals
System staff that has responsibility for the development, management, or execution of contracts or procurement for all
goods or services required for the Health System. There will be educational sessions provided that will include the- review
of the Cook County Procurement Ordinance that went into effect in October of 2012. The session will also address
speci?cs as related to contract language that is required and necessary as well as that which is not allowed as dictated-by
policies and procedures. To assist in the education of all applicable employees, there will be several checklists developed
including one that will be speci?cally designed for all federally funded projects. 

As the Supply Chain moves forward. we will also be implementing technology that will assist us in identifying the
types of contracts that each contract and procurement is related to. This will assist us in documenting and tracking federal
grants on at least a quarterly basis. The system is anticipated to be available by close of ?scal 2011. Until such time that
the technology is available. Supply Chain is in the process of creating a spreadsheet to appropriately track all of
the critical elements as identi?ed in the Audit for all awarded federally funded grants.

Please ?nd the corrective plan of action including critical milestone descriptions. responsible owner, cunent status. and
resolution timelines presented as a separate document.

Board of Directors
Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago
Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying statements of ?nancial position of Public Health Institute of
Metropolitan Chicago (the Institute) as of December 31, 2011 and .2010, and the related
statements of activities, functional expenses and cash flows for the years then ended. These
?nancial statements are the responsibility of the Institute?s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these ?nancial statements based 011 our audits. The prior year summarized
comparative information has been derived from Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Ch?icago 
2010 ?nancial statements and, in our report dated July 10, 2011 we expressed an unquali?ed
opinion 011 those ?nancial statements. -

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America and the standards applicable to ?nancial audits contained in Government
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
?nancial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ?nancial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and signif cant estimates made by management,
- as well as evaluating the overall ?nancial statement presentati'.on We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the ?nancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the ?nancial position of Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, and. the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in.
conformity with accountino Uprinciples generally accepted 111 the United States of America. 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our reports dated June

20, 2012 on our consideration of Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago?s internal

control over ?nancial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grants. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in

accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be read in conjunction with this

report in considering the results of our audit.

PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE OF METROPOLITAN CHICAGO

NOTES TO STATEMENTS
For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010

NOTE 1 NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Activities

The Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago (the Institute) is a Illinois corporation
exempt from income tax under Section 501 (3) of the US. Internal Revenue Code. The Institute is not
considered to be a private foundation. The Institute was formed in 1994 to cooperate with organizations in
the public and private sectors in developing innovative programs, projects and opportunities to improve
the availability and quality of public health, personal health and mental health services.

The Institute provides the following major programs:

Prevention Project

This Project works to integrate routine, rapid HIV testing into a variety of clinical settings
including emergency departments, STD clinics, and a jail?based clinic. This project seeks to
conduct 50,000 HIV tests per year and indentify 500 HIV- positive persons.

The Affordable Care Act: HIV Prevention and Public Health Fund Activities

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with other federal agencies
launched the Enhanced Comprehensive HIV Prevention Planning and Implementation Program
for Metropolitan Statistical Areas Most Affected by This project places an emphasis
on greater integration of I-HV prevention, care, and treatment as well as integration of HIV, viral
hepatitis, sexually transmitted disease, and tuberculosis prevention.

PHIMC, appointedby the Chicago Department of Health (CDPH) as its bona ?de agent, worked
to assess I-HV funding history, prevention and care programs and other related funding
and activities as well as gathering information from programs and organizations that do not
receive funding from CDPH. Activities included: key informant interviews with a variety of
stakeholders, and focus groups with various community members who are from high risk
populations, community planning leadership, and prevention and care service providers were
conducted to identify gaps, barriers, and opportunities. The resulting Chicago?s Enhanced
Comprehensive I-HV Prevention Plan incorporates ?ndings from these assessments and serves as
the foundation for a CDPH long?term strategic plan.

Communities Putting Prevention to Work

This Funding was appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to
reduce Chronic Disease risk factors, prevent and delay chronic disease, promote wellness, and
better manage chronic conditions in Suburban Cook County. This initiative will address the
following:

Increased levels of physical activity 
Improved nutrition increased fruit/vegetable consumption, reduced salt and
transfats)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010

NOTE 1 NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The Institute working in partnership with the Cook County Department of Public Health
seeks to promote healthy lifestyle policy changes in schools, the workplace,
and community environments. The Institute and will be working with
community organizations and local government entities, engaging in health campaigns,
offering policy advocacy trainings to communities, and awarding grants to communities
and schools that are willing to further the Grant goals.

Basis of Accounting

The ?nancial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

(C) Basis of Presentation

Financial statement presentation follows the recommendations of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board in its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 117, Financial Statements ofNon-f
Pro?t Organizations. Under SFAS No. 117, the Institute is required to report information regarding its
?nancial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net assets,
temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets, if applicable.

Revenue Recognition

The Institute recognizes contract revenue from its contracts either on a pro-rata basis over a twelve month
period, which represents the service period for certain contracts, Or to the extent of expenses. Revenue
recognition depends on the contract. The funding agencies may at their discretion, request reimbursement
for expenses or return of funds, or both, as a result of non-compliance by the Institute with the terms of
the grants/contracts. -

Contributions

All contributions are considered to be available for unrestricted use unless speci?cally restricted by the
donor. Amounts received that are designated for future periods or restricted by the donor for specific
purposes are reported as temporarily restricted or permanently restricted support that increases those net
asset classes. When'a temporary restriction expires, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassi?ed to
unrestricted net assets and reported in the statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions.
The Institute had no temporarily or permanently restricted net assets.

Contributions of donated non-cash assets are recorded at their fair values in the period received,
Contributions of donated services that create or enhance non-?nancial assets or that require specialized
skills, are provided by individuals possessing those skills, and would typically need to be purchased if not
provided by donation, are recorded at their fair values in the period received.

Refundable Advances
The Institute records grant/contract revenue as a refundable advance until it is expended for the purpose

of the grant/contract, at which time it is recognized as revenue.

NOTE 1 NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets acquired by the Institute are considered to be owned by the Institute except for the property
acquired with funds received from the Funding Agencies. Such property shall not be disposed of without
written approval from the Funding Agencies. The Funding Agencies may have a reversionary interest in
the property as well as the determination of use of any proceeds from the sale of these assets.

The Institute follows the practice of capitalizing all expenditures for property, furniture, ?xtures and
of?ce equipment in excess of $500. Depreciation or amortization of all such items is computed on a
straight~line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to ?ve years.

Income Taxes

The Institute is exempt from Federal income taxes under Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code
and therefore has made no provision for Federal income taxes in the accompanying ?nancial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or
less. Fair value approximates carrying amounts

Estimates

The preparation of ?nancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Functional Allocation of Expenses

The costs of providing the various programs and other activities have been summarized on a functional
basis 1n the statement of activities. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs
and supporting services bene?ted.

(1) Valuation:

The Institute adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, expands the disclosure requirements around fair
value and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on (Whether the inputs to those
valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. The value of all of the Institute' 5 assets
and liabilities Which are required to be carried at fair value are valued at quoted prices in active

markets for identical assets and liabilities and are, therefore, considered Level I assets and
liabilities.
