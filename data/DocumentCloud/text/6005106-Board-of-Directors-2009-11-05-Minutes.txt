Report from Chairman of the Board
Report on visit to Grady Health System
Chairman Batts stated that he while he was recently in Atlanta, he visited Grady Memorial Hospital. Their
health system serves a population for Fulton and DeKalb Counties that is one-quarter of the size of Cook
County’s. The Certificate of Need for their one hospital is for 1,000 beds, and their daily occupancy is
approximately 400-450 patients.
Chairman Batts provided examples of some successful initiatives and cost-saving strategies that Grady has
implemented. One such strategy involved bringing in Price Waterhouse Coopers as their turnaround firm.
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer (and former Chief Financial Officer of Grady Health System),
provided additional information on the subject. In response to a question regarding the cost for the work done
by Price Waterhouse Coopers, Mr. Ayres stated that they were paid $28 million, but the benefit to the system
was a savings of $184 million.

Report from Chief Executive Officer
A. Performance improvement update (continued)
Mr. Foley stated that there have been requests from County Commissioners to receive the preliminary
performance assessment report; they are preparing and will be distributing to the Commissioners disks
containing this report.
The next phase is implementation of the plan. Normally, a consulting firm would be engaged to do a fullblown implementation of the plan. This will not be necessary, as some of the pieces are already being
implemented, such as those relating to labor, productivity and workforce rebalancing. However, there is a
need for the engagement of a consulting firm to implement other opportunities and pieces of the plan, such
as those relating to supply chain and other areas. Jeanene Johnson is currently working on the Request for
Proposals (RFP), which will come back through the Finance and Human Resources Committees before it
is sent out.
B. Strategic planning update
Mr. Foley provided an update on strategic planning efforts. He stated that, according to the original
schedule, the plan was to be presented and approved by the Board at this meeting. However, there is still a
lot of work to do. They are in the process of making modifications to the draft strategic plan; he expects to
come back to the Board on November 19th with more specifics and a revised timeline for adoption of the
plan.
John Abendshien, of Integrated Clinical Services, Inc., provided a summary (Attachment #1) of the work
in process for the development of the strategic plan. Because of the longer-term nature of some of the
projects that are proposed, he suggested that the three-year financial plan be extended into a five-year plan.
In terms of the recommended direction, he stated that they are listening, reflecting, and incorporating
changes based upon the input received at the town hall meetings and employee meetings. Additionally, in
reflection of some of the revised priorities and input they have received, he stated that they are suggesting
some changes to the goals structure (included in Attachment #1).
During the discussion of the financial plan that will support the strategic plan, Director Carvalho suggested
that besides the traditional financial plan, there should also be a plan that takes into account such factors as
existing state law and existing reimbursement schemes. He stated that there are financial implications to
some suggestions. For example, would the System still qualify for DSH or can a “hub” even exist under
the current licensing?
Mr. Abenshien stated that the essentials of the plan are very solid – improving access, enhancing service
quality, developing stellar service lines, strengthening caregiver/staff, and ensuring leadership and
responsible stewardship. He stated that they believe these are “go forward” recommendations and
suggested that many of these be put on the front burner for a very intense and short-term implementation.
He reviewed the initiatives identified for short-term implementation, which were included in his materials.
The Board discussed the development or strengthening of clinical service lines in some areas, including
emergency/trauma and diabetes. Additionally, they discussed existing programs at other area institutions,
such as those relating to sickle cell anemia.
Mr. Abendshien stated that going forward, their tasks are to continue to refine the core goals and strategic
initiatives, complete the financial plan, complete the action plans, and then submit it for the Board’s
approval.

Mr. William T. Foley
Chief Executive Officer
Cook County Health and Hospitals System
1900 West Polk Street
Suite 123
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Bill:
The purpose of this letter is to provide a brief summary of ICS’ work in process related to the
development of the Strategic Plan, and to recommend overall direction going forward.

Current Progress Summary
We have essentially completed the steps outlined in Phase I (Engagement Kick-Off and
Board Retreat), Phase II (Discovery), and Phase III (Formulation). Work outstanding
includes the following:


Revisions to Goal structure and Strategic Initiatives (See below.)



Completion of Phase IV (3- year Financial Plan)



Completion of Phase V (Action Plan)

Actually, Phases IV and V are very close to completion. But as a practical matter, we need to
make certain refinements consistent with revisions in the Goals, as well as share these
outputs and related assumptions with you and System leadership prior to finalization.

Recommended Direction
We believe that the conceptual framework for the draft Strategic Plan provides an overall
direction that will best serve the System’s patients and the residents of Cook County. The
goals of improving access, enhancing service quality, developing strong clinical service lines,
strengthening caregiver staff, and ensuring leadership and responsible stewardship are all
high priorities for moving forward into implementation phases.
Accordingly, it is recommended that the System aggressively pursue certain high-priority
initiatives over the next 12+ months:

Page 7 of 16

 2

Mr. William T. Foley
November 3, 2009



Take necessary steps to improve access to health care services by systematically
evaluating and remedying access barriers at all delivery sites.



Move forward with the planning and development of the Hub sites (locations, service
mix, volume projections), with the goal of getting one-to-two sites moving well toward
implementation within the next 12 months. (As we have discussed, the specific scope
of primary care and specialty services will need to be defined, with appropriate indepth research and input from advisory task groups.)



Plan for needed infrastructure improvements, including replacement of the Fantus
Clinic and expanded parking capacity on the Stroger campus.



Aggressively pursue Quality, Service Excellence, and Cultural Competency initiatives
on all fronts. Show measureable results over the next 12 months.



Move forward with planning for selected clinical service lines. (In addition to clinical
service lines already identified, include OB/GYN, pediatrics, and neonatal intensive
care as priorities for focused development.) Also, evaluate potential
expansion/development of other services along the continuum of care, including
rehabilitation and long-term care at Oak Forest site.)



Pursue staff development and related issues, with positive communications, trustand morale-building as high priorities.



Through a focus on leadership and stewardship, lay the necessary foundation blocks
for leadership development, fiscal responsibility, long-term sustaining funding, and
governance oversight.

While the above immediate-term initiatives are underway, pursue longer-term evaluations
and related discussions in the following areas:


Based on in-depth analyses of community-level needs, plan for the optimal long-term
development of Oak Forest, Provident, and ACHN delivery sites.



Explore mutually-beneficial clinical and service partnerships with FQHC’s, private
hospital systems, and other provider organizations.

Revised Goal Structure
Consistent with this overall direction, we are proposing certain revisions to the Core Goals
and Strategic Initiatives. (See “Vision 2012—revised draft,” attached.)

Proposed Next Steps
Our next steps are to:
⇒ Revise and refine Core Goals and Strategic Initiatives, consistent with Board and
management input.

Page 8 of 16

Mr. William T. Foley
November 3, 2009

⇒ Complete the draft financial plan and test assumptions with the senior management
team.
⇒ Complete the Action Plans for ongoing plan implementation processes.
⇒ Finalize the Strategic Plan for Board approval.
It is our intention to make final revisions to the draft Strategic Plan, and submit the completed
plan by no later than early December.
In addition, and at your direction, we would be pleased to develop work plans for specific
areas of in-depth evaluation and implementation as a Phase II work effort. Such areas would
include development of service line plans as Centers of Excellence, design of the Hub
model, in-depth evaluation of community-specific health services needs, etc.

Bill, I hope this summary and direction is helpful. We look forward to working with you and
the System Board in the completion of the Strategic Plan.
