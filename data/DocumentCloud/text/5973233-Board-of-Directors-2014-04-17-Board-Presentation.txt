 Retrofit 3.0: Aquatic Centers

Pool Efficiency Retrofit
Program
description

Catalyst

• Perform comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades for up to 141 aquatic centers
managed by Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Park District

• Aquatic centers consume a substantial amount of energy, both in the form of natural
gas and electricity, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year in order to
maintain the appropriate operating conditions
• Managing an indoor pool area is very complex and requires ongoing monitoring and
adjustment between the internal and external temperatures, humidity levels,
structure types, ventilation, pool water chemistry and equipment
• Obtaining the most effective equipment requires a high up-front capital cost and
managing such a system is not a core competency of either CPS or CPD

CIT’s
Value

• CIT attracted an unsolicited proposal that includes an innovative idea as well as
private sector capital and implementation
• CIT can engage in an Open Bidding Process (OBP) with private firms and negotiate
best value, including off-credit financing
• CIT can work across City Departments and Sister Agencies to aggregate pools

Impact

• Achieves Mayor’s 2015 Sustainability Goal #4 – Improve overall energy efficiency
in municipal buildings by 10%
• Reduced operating costs and enhanced reliability of operations
• Leads by example in energy efficiency for other sectors across the City
• Demonstrates value of unsolicited proposal process
