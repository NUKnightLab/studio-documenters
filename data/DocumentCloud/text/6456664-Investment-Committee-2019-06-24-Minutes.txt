II. Fonnal 1st Quarter 2019 Performance Analysis and Discussion

Mr. Kevin Leonard, Ms. DeAnna Jones and Ms. Kristin Finney-Cook of NEPC reviewed the Fund's fonnal
Quarterly Investment Performance report for March 31, 2019. Mr. Leonard began his conunents by stating tliat the
Fund, valued at $2.6 billion at March 31, 2019 retiimed 7.24% for the quarter. The Fund's 42% allocation to
Domestic and International equities led the way with returns of 11.88% and 11 .76% respectively. The Fund's
Fixed Income investments also had a tremendous quarter, returning 3% overall.
Mr. Leonard noted that the Fund determined to move away from Private equity several years ago and the current
over allocation to Fixed income is a result of that decision. The Fund's current allocation of 27.75% to Fixed

Income investments is currently overweight its target of 22.00 %, while only .67% of the Fund is allocated to
Private Equity compared to the target allocation of 5.00%. The Fund is currently reviewing its Fixed Income
investments and can revisit Private Equity this summer.
