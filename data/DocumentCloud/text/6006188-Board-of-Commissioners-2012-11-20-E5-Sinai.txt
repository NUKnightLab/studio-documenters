The Interim Executive Vice President of the Of?ce of Development Management and the Of?ce
of the General Counsel have completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of
this initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.

CORPQRATE GOAL

The purpose of this item is to activate CHA vacant land to improve the local community.

GENERAL BACKGROUND

The former Lawndale Complex residential development located on the 2600 block of 13'? Place
contained 187 public housing units and was demolished on May 23, 2001. The adjacent 136 unit
Project-Based-Section 8 development known as Ogden Courts (a development) located
on the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue was demolished on May 30, 2006. Both
developments are now vacant land. Sinai Health System (?Sinai?) proposed and entered into a
lease to build and maintain a Sinai staff parking lot on approximately 75% of the Lawndale
Complex/Ogden Courts site The purpose of constructing the parking lot was to reduce
the traf?c and parking congestion in the community. Adjacent to the leased parking lot site on
land formerly owned by the City of Chicago and a portion of the Lawndale Complex site is Park
Douglas, a 137 unit mixed income development (including 60 Public Housing Units) which was
delivered and fully occupied quarter 2012. Sinai constructed a portion of their parking lot on
the 2600 block of Ogden Avenue and plans to build out the remaining portion of the parking lot
on the newly constructed West 13th Street. The remaining portion of the Lawndale Complex and
the 2700 block of Ogden are part of a land exchange and the properties will remain
vacant until such time as Sinai commences construction of their new hospital facility.

The purpose of this lease is to improve the quality of life for public housing residents, Sinai staff
and visitors. and residents residing in the area surrounding the site. The site is being leased at
less than fair market value; however, there is an additional commensurate bene?t to the Park
Douglas community due to the fact that Sinai provides family support and medical services,
training and employment opportunities for CHA residents. Jobs were generated for the
construction of the parking lot, the operation of the parking lot and for hospital support duties.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) laws.

The Interim Executive Vice President concurs with the recommendation to execute the 2"?1 of two
one year options on a land lease agreement between the CHA and Sinai Health System

The CEO/President recommends the approval of the second of two one-year options on a land
lease agreement with Sinai Health System on vacant Lawndale Complex and Ogden
Cogrts property sites located at the 2600 and the 2700 block of Ogden Avenue and 2600 block of
13 Place.
