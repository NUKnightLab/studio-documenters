February 19, 2019

President Adams said that she appreciated Ms. Herrada’s concerns and the
Commission recognizes the lack of representation, however, this matter should be
directed to the Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) Board of Education
because they appoint the Library Commissioners.

Commission vacancy was posted on the DPSCD website in November 2018. It was
also announced at the November 2018, December 2018 and January 2019 board
meetings. January 31, 2019 was the deadline for candidates to submit their resumes.

had not received the legal description of the property from the listing agent and wanted
the staff to provide him with the information if he didn’t receive it in a timely manner.
