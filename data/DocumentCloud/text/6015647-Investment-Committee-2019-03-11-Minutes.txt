Re: Compensation Discussion

After discussion in closed session, Investment Committee of the Police and Fire
Retirement System of the City of Detroit approved a motion adjusting the
compensation of the Chief investment Officer, Ryan Bigelow, and Deputy Chief
Investment Officer, Kevin Kenneally, to the median range of ?salary plus bonus? for
Small Public Funds as referenced on pages 4 and 5 0f the December 4, 2018
Investment Staff Competitive Pay Analysis prepared by McLagan- The McLagan report
was prepared at the request of the PFRS IC. Therefore, compensation will be set at
$315,000 for the Chief Investment Officer and $224,000 for the Deputy Chief
Investment Officer. The motion of the Investment Committee included making the
compensation adjustments effective January 1, 2019. Also, if the Investment
Committee of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit does not approve
the aforementioned adjustments or agree to share in the costs of these adjustments, the
PFRS IC will cause all the expenses associated with these adjustments to be paid for
out of the PFRS trust fund pursuant to its authority under the Plan of Adjustment and
State Contribution Agreement.

Motion #07: Joseph Bogdahn moved to approve the ?salary plus bonus? for the Chief
Investment Officer and Deputy Chief Investment Officer as discussed. The motion
passed by a vote as follows:

Yeas: Bogdahn, Orzech, Skandalaris, Tyler, Williams and Chairperson Smith - 5 1/2
Nays: Pegg and Trozak? 1

Statement from Committee member Jeffery Pegg regarding his ?No? vote:

It's outside the alternative salary range as provided by the McLagan study. An increase
of $57,144 is too much, and for me is not warranted at this time. I also am
against the recommendations to the Deputy Chief Investment Officer which resulted in
an increase to the Chief Investment Officer and we are still a bankrupt city.

Statement from Committee member Gregory Trozak regarding his ?No? vote:

This increase is too excessive at this time.
