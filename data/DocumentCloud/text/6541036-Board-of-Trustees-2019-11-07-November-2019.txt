 Auditor’s Responsibility

AF

 Management’s Judgments and Accounting Estimates

− Property tax allowance

AF

T

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of financial
statements and are based upon management’s current judgment. You may
wish to monitor throughout the year the process used by management to
compute and record the following accounting estimates reflected in City
Colleges’ financial statements:

− Accrued property tax refunds

R

− Allowance for uncollectible student tuition

− Actuarially determined liabilities: other postretirement benefit obligations (OPEB)

D

− Fair value of investment securities

− Defined benefit pension liability (cost-sharing plan)

Comments
During the year ended June 30, 2019, City Colleges did not adopt any

existing significant accounting policies during the current period.

Audit Adjustments

Audit adjustments, other than those that are clearly immaterial, proposed by
RSM and recorded by City Colleges are shown below.

 Other Communications Required by Generally
Accepted Auditing Standards, cont.
Comments

Area

We are not aware of any uncorrected misstatements other than
misstatements that are clearly trivial. The following disclosures were
determined by management to be immaterial and were omitted from the
financial statements:
1) GASB Statement No. 68 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis
of the net pension liability, as well as deferred inflows and outflows of the
plan. City Colleges omitted these disclosures in the notes to the financial
statements for the State University Retirement System pension plan.
Since the plan is a special funding situation, City Colleges’ liability is $0.
2) The worker’s compensation liability at year end is classified as a current
liability, when a portion should be a long-term liability. Additionally, the
accrued property tax refund liability is classified as a long-term liability
when a portion should be a current liability.
3. City Colleges uses the National Association of College and University
Business Officers (NACUBO) guidance for calculating scholarship
allowance and financial aid expenses, which is not authoritative in nature.
4. The OPEB actuarial valuation performed as of the beginning of the year
contained an error of approximately $2.5 million that was corrected
during the current fiscal year. Beginning balances were not restated.

management has selected the preferable accounting practice.

practices related to material items that were discussed with management
during the current period.

significant accounting principles, the basis for management’s judgments on
any significant matters, the scope of the audit, or significant disclosures to be

Historically, a survey went out to student completers to
retrieve gainful employment data from the district office.
The survey and its articulation of the data stalled due to
restructuring of departments and staff at the district
office. CCC will re-implement the gainful employment
survey to students who have completed short-term
programs over the past year.

For the Direct Loan Program,
short-term eligible programs at a
postsecondary vocational
institution be between 300 - 599
clock hours. They must have
been provided for at least one
year and must have a
substantiated completion and
placement rate of at least 70
percent for the most recently
completed award year. 34 CFR
Section 668.8(f) and (g) requires
the college to have documentation
supporting its placement rates for
each student showing that the
student obtained gainful
employment in the recognized
occupation for which he or she
was trained or in a related
comparable recognized
occupation.

For FY20, CCC will early implement the rescission of the
Gainful Employment Rule. Institutions that early
implement the rescission of the GE rule will not be
required to report GE data for the 2018-2019 award year
to NSLDS, which will be due October 1, 2019.
Additionally, those institutions that early implement will
not be required to comply with the current requirements
in 34 CFR 668.412 (d) and (e) that require institutions to
include the disclosure template, or a link thereto, in their
GE program promotional materials and directly distribute
the disclosure template to prospective students, which
will be required starting on July 1, 2019. Institutions that
early implement will no longer be required to post the GE
Disclosure Template and may remove the template and
any other GE disclosures that are required under 34 CFR
668.412 from their web pages. Finally, an institution that
early implements will not be required to comply with the
certification requirements for GE programs under 34 CFR
668.414

For three out of sixty students tested, the

Four out of sixty students tested
withdrew from City Colleges for
which status changes were not
properly reported to the National
Student Loan Data System
(NSLDS). CFR section 685.309
and 690.83(b)(2) requires City
Colleges to notify the NSLDS
within 30 days of a change in
student status or include the
change in status in a response to
an enrollment reporting roster
within 60 days of the student’s
date of determination of
withdrawal.

Timing issues are the primary cause of not fully meeting
the department enrollment requirements. The enrollment
reporting functions are housed in the College’s registrar
office and separate from financial aid. An enrollment file
is generated at the district level and uploaded. However,
students who withdraw before the transcript (last date of
qualified refund) do not appear on the enrollment file and
a manual process takes place to upload students to
National Clearing House.

AF

T

Management Response

Our information technology staff are still reviewing
specific requirements and how National Student
Clearinghouse utilizes data to determine the best course
of action to bring CCC into full compliance. The Office of
Student Financial Aid is reviewing centralization of the
enrollment function under financial aid district office team
for closer oversight. A separate report will be run at the
time NSC files are sent to identify students who withdrew
between the beginning of a term and the transcript date
of that term. Those students will continue to be manually
updated in real time through NSC to reflect the correct
enrollment status and effective date.

In 2019, federal guidelines
required that City Colleges
implement a quality assurance
system over its Direct Loan
program. City Colleges operates
in a decentralized manner and
has numerous process and
control memos in place
documenting controls and
procedures over their direct loan
quality assurance system.
However, these process and
control memos may vary by
campus. City Colleges does not
have a single, comprehensive
document that comprises the
direct loan quality assurance
system therefore City Colleges is
not fully in compliance with this
requirement.
34 CFR Section 685.300(b) (9)
require schools to implement and
document a quality assurance
process to ensure that City
Colleges is complying with
program requirements and
meeting program objectives

The Office of Student Financial Aid currently executes the
functions of the Direct Loan Quality Assurance by:



Reporting loan records, disbursements, and
adjustments to disbursements, correctly to the
Common Origination and Disbursement (COD)
System,
Disbursing and returning loan funds in accordance
with regulatory requirements,
Disbursing the correct loan amount to the correct
student,
Completing monthly reconciliation and Program
Year Closeout.

T




R

While all functions were executed, a documented process
was not in place because there is no updated financial aid
manual in for the colleges. The last active manual was for
the 2015-16 School Year. The Office of Student Financial
Aid is in process of creating a revised financial aid manual
for Fiscal Year 2020. The new manual will document the
Direct Loan Quality Assurance process. In addition, the
financial aid manual will be reviewed on a semi-annual
basis to ensure appropriate changes and updates are
included annually.

For four out of twenty students tested,
exit counseling or mailing of exit
counseling materials did not occur within
the 30 day timeframe. 34 CFR Section
682.604(g) requires that if a student
Stafford loan borrower graduates or
withdraws without notifying the school,
the school must confirm that the student
has completed the online exit counseling
or mail exit counseling material to the
borrower at his or her last known
address. The material must be mailed
within 30 days of the school learning that
the borrower has withdrawn or failed to
participate in an exit counseling session.

The students who were not notified of exit
counseling was due to an oversight within the
automated system. All students records expected
to graduate will update within our system at the
start of their last anticipated semester. The
expected graduation date triggers the letter to be
auto generated and sent out to students. If a
student changes their program, the graduation
date may be delayed or advanced. This will require
a manual entry into the system for these students
to trigger the exit counseling notification.
Additionally, students who withdraw from all of
their classes are not normally sent exit counseling
may reenroll during the mini sessions, which run
12 week and 8 week courses within the same
semester. This again requires a manual report to
be generated of students who withdrew from all of
their classes and did not re-enroll in subsequent
term.
The Office of Student Financial Aid will generate
real time report of all students who withdraw from
all classes weekly. Those students will be added to
an automated report of anticipated graduates to
receive exit-counseling notifications. The Office of
Student Financial Aid will work with IT and
Institutional Effectiveness to add non-graduates
who withdraw from all classes to the automated
process. The Office of Student Financial Aid will
utilize PeopleSoft communication module to
ensure timely notifications.

Strategic Enrollment Management Planning
Summary

 STRATEGIC ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT PLANNING
PROCESSES
Preparation
• City Colleges of Chicago’s first ever strategic enrollment planning process officially launched in January 2019 with the 

T

comprehensive review of internal data and robust SWOT analysis conversations across an array of institutional stakeholder 
groups at the seven colleges and district office. 

AF

• College and district teams formed committees to continue conversations that resulted in the development of strategic 
themes and areas of focus to guide subsequent planning. 

Data Analysis, Interpretation, & Strategy Development
• Northern Illinois University Center of Governmental Studies was commissioned to conduct an environmental scan that 

R

would help to build a strong understanding of the environment in which City Colleges currently operates.
• Socioeconomic and labor market data provided strong evidence of a shifting landscape in Chicago, Cook County, and 

D

Illinois that has immediate impacts on our enrollment and will continue to shape our circumstances in the next five years. 
• College and district teams leveraged internal data, environmental scan data, and SWOT analyses to collectively forumlate 
strategies intended to improve and stabilize enrollment outcomes.

 Key District‐Wide Strategic Enrollment Management Priorities 
Our 3‐year strategic enrollment management plan is built around three, interconnected strategic priorities that will enable us to deliver more value to students

CONNECTIONS

OPTIONS

Put people first. 
1) Understand our students at a deeper 
level in order to serve them better 
2) Create conditions for performance 
excellence among our faculty and staff 
as key drivers of our strategy

Promote meaningful connections and 
touchpoints with students and partners to 
support the realization of improved 
enrollment and retention outcomes

Facilitate multiple student onramps, 
experiences, and pathways to successful 
outcomes aligned to diverse student goals, 
preferences, and needs

AF

PEOPLE

D

R

These three interconnected strategic 
priorities result in 5 key areas of 
transformation 

Areas of Transformation

• Brand: Generation of new demand via inclusiveness and connectedness of our brand
• Pipeline: Processes and touchpoints promoting recruitment and application matriculation  
• Experience: Student‐facing touchpoints and infrastructure supporting deep connections to promote engagement and retention
• Ecosystem: Institutional culture, partnerships, and resources that enable us to deliver value to students

o Retention: The current higher education landscape demands that enrollment 
efforts extend beyond investments in new student recruitment, placing a premium

value to students
o Student Experience: Students come to us with different goals, preferences, and 
needs. Colleges seeks to intentionally facilitate multiple student onramps,
