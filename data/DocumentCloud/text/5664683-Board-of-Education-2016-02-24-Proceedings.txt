THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:

That effective July 1, 2016, the Chicago Board of Education consolidate Mary Mapes Dodge Renaissance
Elementary Academy (School ID 609888) (?Dodge") into Morton School of Excellence (School ID 610257)
(?Morton?) pursuant to a request from both school communities vis a vis their principals. Leadership
recognized that due to Dodge?s declining enrollment their current situation was unsustainable. As a
result, they requested that the Board consolidate Dodge into Morton. Both schools are co-located in the
same facility located at 431 North Troy Street. Morton is an attendance area school, and their boundary
will not be affected by this propoSal. Dodge is a citywide school with no attendance area boundary.

Guidelines for School Actions, 2015 2016 School Year, the Chief ExecutiveOf?cer of the A

hearing was convened on January 28, 2016 at 42 West Madison Street following the issuance of proper
notice. An independent hearing of?cer received oral and written comments and supporting documents at
the hearing and kept the record open after the hearing to receive additional documentation. A transcript
of the hearing and summaries of the community meetings have been provided to the Board. The hearing
of?cer reported that the proposal met the requirements of the law and summarized comments and
documentation received. After receiving the hearing of?cer?s report, the CEO has decided to recommend
that the Board authorize the consolidation of Dodge into Morton.

LSC IMPLICATIONS: The Dodge. LSC will be dissolved at the end of the current school year, June 30,
2016. The Morton LSC Will remain unaffected by this authorization.

PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: The employment status of all faculty and staff at the schools affected by
this authorization will be determined pursuant to Board policies and any collective bargaining agreements.

FINANCIAL The ?nancial impact of this authorization will be addressed during the
development of the ?scal 2017 budget. Because the Illinois School Code prohibits the incurring-of any
liability unless an appropriation has been previously made, expenditures beyond ?scal year 2016 are
considered contingent liabilities only, subject to appropriation in subsequent ?scal year budgets.
