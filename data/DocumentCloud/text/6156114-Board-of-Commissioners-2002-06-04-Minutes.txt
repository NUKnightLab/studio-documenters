Mr. LaMont stated the New Stroger Hospital of Cook County is the largest and most technically complex

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 2/21/02.
*Deferred on 2/27/02.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how a new regulatory requirement could fall under Errors and Omissions?
Michael LaMont responded that there have been some new requirements over the past seven years and
some were requirements that were not incorporated in the original plans and specifications.
Commissioner Silvestri asked how would a design revision be categorized as a potential Error and
Omission and how does the wrap-up insurance policy cover professional liability?
Michael LaMont commented that revisions are categorized at the time the issue is brought up and an
approximate cost is placed on the revision. The Office of Capital Planning and Policy staff are able to
categorize the item as a potential Error and Omission. Currently, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy is going through an analysis of all revisions and have already notified the professional liability
carrier that there are potential Errors and Omissions that will be followed by a claim.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to explain the $856,000 roofing request at the 3rd District
Courthouse?
Michael LaMont stated that the membrane of the roof has significantly deteriorated. The building is
about 15 years old and the roof needs to be replaced.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the life expectancy on a new roof?
Michael LaMont stated that current roofing materials being used are single-ply membrane and have a life
expectancy of about 20 years.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri,

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated May 14, 2002:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a req uest to allocate $10,050,000.00 from the
contingency and equipment line items in the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Budget to the
contract with WALSH/RITEWA Y, Joint Venture Construction Manager. It is respectfully
requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This request can be categorized as follows:

•

MEP Design Revisions - Various revisions to the plans primarily due to mechanical,
ventilation, and electrical changes. Several of these changes are categorized as
potential errors and/or omissions. (Note that the County has a wrap-up insurance
policy to cover professional liability).

2062

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

•

Owner/User Requests - During the final design of the facility, hospital staff
requested improvements to the design for optimum functioning of the new hospital.
Some of these requests included changes to laboratory equipment and minor
adjustments to the pneumatic tube system.

•

Equipment Related Changes - The final preparation of the equipment bid packages
has caused refinements in the utility design of the building, therefore, additional
electrical, mechanical and plumbing work has to be added to the base design.

•

New Regulatory Requirements - The nature of a multi-year construction project is
that there will be regulatory code changes that must be accommodated before the
facility opens. The changes requested here pertain to utility modifications to
stairwell vestibules, transfer corridor ceiling revisions, additional controllers in
ductwork, revisions to the smoke control system, additional firewall s and fire alarm
devices. Several of these changes are categorized as potential errors and/or
omissions.

All of the funds requested at this time will be allocated from the contingency line item and
the equipment line item in the budget. The Board of Commissioners approved this budget on
June 22, 1994.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 5/21/02.
Commissioner Hansen asked what portion of the $2.72 million request would be considered an Error and
Omission?
Michael LaMont remarked that he did not have the answer but after the meeting he would get the
response for the commissioner.
Commissioner Hansen asked the major code changes to the request. He further asked if the changes are
from the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago.
Michael LaMont responded that some changes were requested by the State and the City requested some
changes. He said that they are not all new requirements. Several changes were lumped into this category
by one of the regulatory agencies as they toured the building. Further, he stated that there have been
some changes in the codes during the course of this seven-year project, but other items have not changed
and were not planned for in the original design, which is why they were put into this category .

2063

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Commissioner Collins requested a copy of all code changes that have been made by the City and by the
State.
Commissioner Moreno asked ifthere have been any code changes since 1994?
Michael LaMont responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the inspector's interpretations and that of the architect sometimes
differ. He said building codes could be ambiguous in some respects. He further asked Mr. LaMont if he
had a list of all of the Errors and Omissions where the County is entitled to some type of recovery because
someone else made the mistake and the County now has to pay. Commissioner Moreno asked if the
County plans to pursue any claims.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere is a detailed list of the $6. l million in regulatory requirements?
Michael LaMont stated that a list is available.
Michael LaMont asked Gary Mundinger, Project Manager of CCH Design Group to respond.
Gary Mundinger stated that firewall identification was completed and written documentation of
conversations with the Fire Prevention Bureau was also completed. During the course of the project, he
said the senior person at Fire Prevention Bureau resigned between the time the design was being prepared
and the time the permit was issued for the project.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the code changed.
Gary Mundinger said that the code does not necessarily change but it is subject to interpretation, and the
interpreter who was reviewing the drawing for permit purposes interpreted that section of the code
differently from the person who was working on the design. Mr. Mundinger also stated that the City of
Chicago does not correspond to the builder stating that everything is correct. He said that you typically
only hear from the City when something is wrong, which is also the way in which the State functions.
Correspondence from these agencies generally indicates that they have reviewed the drawings for general
conformance with respect to applicable codes and requirements; however, it is always subject to
reviewing in the field. He also stated that the Fire Prevention Bureau stamps the paperwork by indicating
that everything has been reviewed but not approved.
Commissioner Hansen stated his concern that the request is for a 15 percent increase above the original
contract.
Commissioner Collins asked Michael LaMont what procedures they follow in terms of notifying
architects and construction managers that they are in compliance before the project owner expends any
funds.
Michael LaMont remarked that the New Stroger Hospital of Cook County is a huge project and it is not
unexpected to have contract changes. He stated that ultimately the City of Chicago indicates its approval
of the project by issuing building and occupancy permits. Further, he stated that the State of Illinois does
not give written approval, but the project would be certified, otherwise it would not open.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Mr. LaMont stated that with respect to the professional liability policy and the Errors and Omissions, an
insurance policy was issued for the hospital project and the carrier has been notified that there is a
potential claim. Finally, Mr. LaMont stated that he would provide a list of all contract changes identified
as potential Errors and Omissions and submit the list to the Board.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the City should be put on notice of the financial impact staff changes
during the review process have on County taxpayers.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the total cost of the hospital, when completed, would remain at $623
million?
Michael LaMont stated that the total cost of the hospital project will be less than the budgeted $623
million and the project will be completed within budget.
Commissioner Quigley asked the number of contingency funds.
Michael LaMont commented that there are three components to the contingency funds. He said that the
first two components fall under the heading of Certificate of Need (CON), where the State requires that
the costs be submitted in this parti cular format. He stated that there have been significant savings in the
purchase of medical equipment, which has helped offset other line items.
Commissioner Quigley asked if there will be any additional costs in the future?
Michael LaMont stated as the County goes through the final certification process with the State of Illinois
and the City of Chicago in the next couple of months, something could come up that will need to be taken
care of, but at this time he does not predict anything major costs.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner Collins, moved the approval of Communication
No. 251941. The motion carried.
Commissioners Collins and Hansen voted nay on the above item.

Commissioner Hansen asked the reason for the 13 percent increase in original contract.
Michael LaMont stated that there were some omissions in the design when the contract originally went
out to bid.
Commissioner Hansen asked who signs off on the specifications?
Michael LaMont stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy depends on the architect or
engineer of record. He said that the original prime vendor was Unisource Network Systems and the subconsultant was Knight Engineers. In September 2001, Unisource Network Systems informed the County
that they were no longer in business, which caused the County to award the contract to another vendor,
Executive Construction.
Michael LaMont called on Edward Denson of Knight Advanced Technology, to respond to
Commissioner Hansen's question.
Edward Denson stated that Knight Advanced Technology was the architect for the interior of the project.
He said that the rule of thumb square footage required for pre-action valves within the facility was right
on the margin for the facility and Unisource Network Systems believed that everything was fine. Mr.
Denson further stated that he did not know whether the decision was made on the basis of the total overall
budget in the facility, but when there was a review of the documents, it was determined that another type
of pre-action valve was required.

Commissioner Hansen asked the reason for the 37 percent increase above the original contract.
Michael LaMont stated that the issue goes back to 1994 when design plans for the garage were
consolidated. He said the increase also reflects changes in equipment vendors that occurred after the
construction began in 1999. Also, in 1994, it had not been determined whether the data center would be
in the hospital or on the lower level of the old Hektoen Building, which required technology changes. In
order to keep the project on schedule, during construction, there was an increase in staff and in June 2000,
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy requested that the entire design team move to the hospital site.
All of these requests add to the requested increase.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Ladies and Gentlemen :
Your Department of Corrections Subcomm ittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Thursday, May 9, 2002 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, of
the County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, lllinois to discuss the issue of overcrowding at
Cook County Jail.
Your Comm ittee requested add itiona l information on the subject matter from representatives from various
county agenc ies.
Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Moreno requested that the meeting of the Law Enforcement
and Corrections Committee be combined with the Department of Corrections Subcommittee to conduct a
joint meeting on overcrowding at the Cook County Jail. The Commissioner stated that today' s meeting
was a follow-up on recommendations and information previously requested at the May 23 and October
I0, 200 I meetings of the Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee.
Chairman Steele welcomed all attendees and thanked Chairman Moreno for allowing the Department of
Corrections Subcom mittee to participate in discussions on the issue of jail overcrowding. Chainnan
Steele emphasized the importance of cooperation among Cook County offices of the State's Attorney,
Public Defender, Sheriff and Chief Judge in producing a coordinated and agreed upon plan to the federa l
courts that proactively addresses the fiscal, legal and public safety concerns the county faces due to the
increased number of jai l inmates. She stated a common goal of the discussions should be to improve the
coordination of infonnation in the County's criminal j ustice system in order to comply with the Duran v.
Sheahan federal consent decree.
Chairman Moreno gave a brief opening statement summarizing the discussion and infonnation received at
previous committee meetings. He referenced correspondence, dated May 3, 2002, which the Cha irman's
Office sent to various public safety agencies as well as recent newspaper articles on the j ail overcrowding
issue and updated infonnation submitted by the Sheriff s Office that cited the jail 's current population at
11 ,298. He stated since the inmate population continues to rise, regular meetings of both committees
would be held in order to monitor the issue and prov ide information to the Board regarding I) compliance
with the Duran v. Sheahan consent decree; 2) the fiscal and legal impact o f overcrowding on the County's
budget and crimina l justice system; 3) safety concerns that impact correctional employees, detainees and
the public; and 4) recommendations from the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordi nating Counc il
(CCCJCC). The Chairman asked that letters, news articles and all written information requested by the
members be included in the record. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Chai rman Steele then recogni zed Commissioner Quigley.
Commissioner Quigley remarked that some public safety offices throughout the country have improved
productivity despite limited resources, and c ited a comparison of felony criminal cases disposed of last
year by the j udic iary in Los Angeles, New York and Cook County. The Commissioner stated that data
showed : 37,000 felony criminal cases were disposed of by 150 judges in Los Angeles; 28,000 cases were
disposed of by 139 judges in New York; and 38,000 cases were disposed of by 4 1 judges in Cook County.
He stressed the importance of each Cook County office foc using on solutions to improve the use and
sharing of inmate, case and court informat ion systems, as well as agreeing on a joint methodology to
decrease the amount time it takes to adjudicate a criminal case in Cook County.
The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

1.

Office of the Cook County Sheriff - Department of Corrections

Undersheriff Zelda Whittler said that the Sheriffs Office has been working with the various state and
county public safety agencies on the problem of jail overcrowding for the past 18 months. She
commented that the Sheriffs Office is currentl y part of the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating
Council (CCCJCC), a task force convened by the C hairman of the Judicial Advisory Council. The task
force meets regularly to determine how county public safety agencies can collectively address the
overcrowding problem and better utilize current resources.
Ms. Whittler further remarked that the Sheriffs Office has created several alternatives-to-detention
programs and continues to look for means to improve the utilization of these programs. She said Sheriff
Sheahan is very concerned that the jail population will further increase during the summer months, and is
currently looking into the feasibility of temporarily housing inmates in tents to address the problem. Ms.
Whittler emphasized that the Department of Corrections (CCDOC) is doing everything it can to comply
with the federal consent decree, while at the same time carrying out its responsibilities to house, monitor
and care for persons who have been criminally charged but who have not yet gone to trial.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding the number of inmates held on a $10,000
dollar bond or less, Ms. Whittler said she would forward this information to the comm ittee. In addition,
she stated a review was done by the County's Industrial Engineering Department that was to be made
avai lable to each member of the Board. Commissioner Quigley commented that he was not aware of such
a study and had not received a copy.

Commissioner Quigley requested that a copy of the Industrial Engineering study regarding bonds
and the County's costs of housing and health services to inmates be sent to each member of the
Board and submitted to the Chair for further discussion.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding how often the Sheriff reviews detainees held
in the jail on bonds under $10,000 for placement into the alternative programs, Jim Ryan stated the
Sheriffs Office daily reviews the background of each detainee fo r el igibility into the Day Reporting,
Electronic Monitoring or Administrative Furlough programs. He remarked that judges determ ine the risk
factors that set the type and amount of bond as well as those sentenced to the alternative programs. He
noted that ifthe court determines someone to be a low risk they usually receive an I-Bond.
In response to Comm issioner Quigley's question regarding how often inmates are re-screened after
enteri ng the facility for eligibility into alternative programs, Mr. Ryan stated that when space becomes
avai lable in alternative programs, the inmate population is re-screened fo r eligible detainees as well as
those who might not have originally qualified but whose situations have changed upon review of orders
of the court.
Commissioner Quigley recommended that detainees be re-screened every two weeks to determine if those
who have low bonds are in jail and who might otherwise qualify for Day Reporting, Electronic
Monitoring or Administrative Furlough. In addition, Commissioner Quigley recommended that outside
programs be reviewed to house non-violent inmates who are not eligible for placement in the Sheriffs
alternative programs because they are homeless or mentally disabled.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regarding whether a criteria is in place fo r eligibility to the
Sheriffs alternative programs, Jim Ryan responded that there is written criteria set by the Sheriff.

2072

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding why the average stay of inmates has
increased significantly over the past 6 1/2 years, Jim Ryan stated there are several factors, including
recent rulings by the Court (relating to cases involving weapons and domestic violence) and an increased
passage of penalty enhancement laws by the Illinois General Assembly.
As a follow-up to Commissioner Maldonado's question, Deputy State's Attorney Patrick Driscoll stated
the factors that have increased the average stay of inmates in the County's jail are as numerous as the
various categories of detainees and circumstances of each case before the court. He said there has been a
significant increase in the jail population following legislation initiated by the Illinois Department of
Corrections (!DOC) that resulted in the implementation of an aggressive state parole policy, known as
"Operation Windy City." He said the new law and the IDOC parole strategy specifically targets parole
violators in the City of Chicago, and six months after the policy was implemented, there was a sharp
increase in the jail population. He further commented that the County was powerless to alleviate the
increase due to !DOC restrictions that made parolees ineligible for placement in any alternative programs.
The Sheriffs Office has addressed the potential overcrowding problem with the State's Attorney's Office
in relation to the threat it poses on the county's compliance with Duran v. Sheahan .
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding whether the Sheriff's Office maintains a
waiting list of eligible inmates for the Day Reporting and Electronic Monitoring programs, Mr. Ryan said
a list is maintained and reviewed daily by the Sheriffs Department of Community Supervision and
Intervention (DCSI).
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the capacity of the Sheriff s alternative
programs, Mr. Ryan stated the maximum capacity of the Day Reporting program is 800 and capacity of
the Electronic Monitoring program is 1,300. He noted that both programs are currently at capacity.

Commissioner Maldonado requested written information on the number of detainees eligible for
alternative release, but currently being held in the jail due to the lack of space in the Day Reporting
and Electronic Monitoring programs. He also requested the average daily cost of housing an
inmate in the alternative programs. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
In response to Commissioner Moran's question regarding the status of information previously requested to
alleviate jail overcrowding, Jim Ryan stated that Sheriff Sheahan previously reported on
recommendations made to the CCCJCC and the State of Illinois relating to: I) the establishment of a
special court to only handle new cases brought against parolees; 2) expanding the number of parole board
members and hearings in Cook County; and 3) the opening of a State facility for parole violators or state
inmates awaiting disposition of cases on new charges or appeal. He said Sheriff Sheahan believes these
are viable solutions, which the State of lllinois could consider to assist the county in the future. However,
he noted there has not been a financial commitment by the State or agreement with the Illinois
Department of Corrections on these recommendations.
Commissioner Butler requested a breakdown on the number of pre-trial detainees and their average length
of stay. Mr. Ryan responded and submitted a graph that provided a breakdown of the current 11 ,298
inmates held in custody and awaiting trial or disposition of their case. (The referenced documents are on
file in the Office of the County Clerk.) He noted there are currently 3, 133 inmates who have been in
custody for less than 30 days, 2,4 75 held for 31 to 90 days, 1,905 held for 91 to 180 days, 1,787 held for
181 days or up to a year, 1, 171 held for 1 to 2 years, 381 held for 2 to 3 years, 146 held over 3 years, 54
held over 4 years and 14 held over 5 years and awaiting trial or disposition of their cases.

2073

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Commissioner Butler remarked that the Sheriff's Office is only the landlord for these inmates and has
limited power when it comes to alleviating jail overcrowding. He stated the key to the overcrowding
problem stems from the length of time it takes to adjudicate misdemeanor and non-violent Class 4 felony
cases in Cook County. He commented that the Chief Judge, State's Attorney and Public Defender should
review lists and develop timelines for disposal of such cases as well as study the reasons for and number
of continuances granted to attorneys that help increase the amount of time inmates remain in jail.
In response to Comm issioner Daley's question regarding whether any inmates are currently being held in
the jail on appeal, Jim Ryan remarked that no inmates are currently being held in the jail on appeal.
Chairman Moreno remarked that he agreed with a recommendation previously submitted to the
committee by the John Howard Association, which suggested the County should implement a shared
detainee computer-tracking database that includes: 1) inmates personal data (who they are, where the
come from and what type of charge are they being held on); 2) in and out data (arrival dates, release dates
and length of time served in the County jail); and 3) disposition infonnation (released to a state facility, a
boot camp facility, a drug and alcohol program, a domestic violence program, a Day Reporting,
Electronic Monitoring or Administrative Furlough program.
Chairman Moreno stated he believed a large factor in recent years for the increased population in the jail
could be traced to a serious lack of state mental health and drug treatment facilities. He said a report by
the John Howard Association suggested that the County jail has become a dumping ground for
individuals who have serious mental health and drug problems, and who remain in jail after the
disposition of their cases because there is no other place to put them .
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding the number of "parole holds" in the County jail, Jim
Ryan stated there are currently 1,807 parole hold inmates in the jail on new charges.
In response to Commi ssioner Silvestri's question regarding whether a cost analysis on the tent proposal is
available, Jim Ryan stated whatever impact the proposal may have on the County is still under review.
Mr. Ryan noted that Sheriff Sheahan received assurances that the United States military would
temporarily donate the tents.

Chairman Steele requested that a cost analysis be submitted to members of the Board prior to the
Sheriff moving forward on his proposal to temporarily house inmates in tents during the summer
months.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding whether previous remarks by Sheriff Sheahan
that blamed overcrowding on the increased number of state parolees housed in the jail were accurate, Jim
Ryan stated the correlation between the population increase and the parolee inmates was accurate. He
noted eight months ago there were 2,000 parole violators in the County jail and today there are 1,800
detainees with "parole holds" in the jail classified as pre-trial detainees. Mr. Ryan said the Sheriff had
started returning inm ates with parole warrants to the Illinois Department of Corrections, since he
considered them to be state property. However, since that time, the IDOC has removed the "parole
warrants" and now only have "parole holds" placed on inmates arrested on new charges. He explained
the Sheriffs Office has been advised by the State' s Attorney's Office that the "parole holds" only
mandate that the IDOC be notified prior to an inmate's release. He said Sheriff Sheahan has no authority
to return these inmates to the IDOC, absent a parole warrant, since they are being held on new criminal
charges and are considered pre-trial detainees.

2074

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Commissioner Silvestri remarked that the burden of funding the nation's largest criminal justice system is
unfairly placed on Cook County's property owners and taxpayers. He suggested if the County is
mandated to comply with the federal consent decree and to fund longer stays in the jail because of new
laws and policies, the County must receive matching federal and state funds to implement solutions, such
as a coordinated criminal justice computer tracking system.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding what is being done to combat safety concerns at the
jail as a result of the overcrowding, Jim Ryan remarked that following the recent violence and death of an
inmate, security measures have been increased and all necessary precautions to ensure safety for
correctional officers and detainees has been established.

Chairman Moreno requested written information from the Sherifrs Office on precautions taken to
ensure the safety of correctional officers and inmates as a result of jail over crowding as well as an
updated estimate of daily costs to the Department of Corrections to house inmates.
Chairman Steele then proceeded to the second item on the agenda.

2.

Office of the Cook County State's Attorney - Civil Actions Bureau

In regards to the federal consent decree under the Duran case, Deputy State' s Attorney Patrick Driscoll
said that attorneys for the plaintiffs have not made any contempt requests relative to the current
overcrowding situation. He informed the committee members that the parties would meet again in Judge
Marovich's courtroom on Tuesday, May 14, 2002. Mr. Driscoll assured the committee that the State's
Attorney's Office is making all attempts to comply with the decree and will keep the Board informed of
any new information. Jn closing, he noted that there are no quick fixes to the overcrowding situation;
however, the State's Attorney's Office continues to work with Judge Biebel and the Judicial Advisory
Council task force on a coordinated resolution to the problem in addition to continuing to expedite its
management of cases.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the responsibility of the Illinois
Department of Corrections (!DOC) to house state parolees held in the County jail on "parole holds",
Deputy State' s Attorney Driscoll stated that all technical parole violators with parole warrants are sent
back to the IDOC. He explained that current inmates with "parole holds," are parolees arrested on new
criminal charges and are considered pre-trial detainees.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding why the IDOC removed parole warrants on
some inmates, Mr. Driscoll said he could not comment on IDOC policy and suggested that a
representative from the !DOC attend a future meeting to address such questions. Chairman Moreno noted
the !DOC was sent correspondence regarding the meeting but no representative was present.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the origin of the tenn " parole hold,"
Deputy State' s Attorney Driscoll commented that it is an IDOC administrative term given to parolees
when they enter the County's criminal justice system to ensure that the !DOC is notified prior to their
release. Mr. Driscoll reiterated that detainees with " parole holds" are not in the County jail because of
technical parole violations, but are awaiting trial or disposition of new criminal charges.

Chairman Moreno requested that the State's Attorney's Office submit any recommendations to
alleviate jail overcrowding and any new information discussed at the hearing with Judge Marovich
be given to the committee chairman for consideration at the next meeting. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

Chairman Steele then proceeded to the third item on the agenda.
3.

Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (TASC)

Pamela Rodriquez, Vice President of Operations, gave a brief overview of TASC's treatment programs
provided to offenders with drug problems. She stated that the agency conducted 6,000 assessments for
the County last year that revealed 75% of Cook County inmates have drug problems. She noted that
currently there is a 45-day waiting period for bed space in the drug treatment program for female
offenders and 65 days for male offenders.
Chairman Moreno requested a written overview of T ASC's programs, including costs, and a report
on the rate of recidivism comparing those who receive no treatment to those who complete T ASC
drug treatment programs. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
He also requested a copy of T ASC's independent study on mental health assessments of inmates
when completed.
Ms. Rodriquez responded she would forward this information to the Chairman's Office when the study is
completed.
The Chairman then proceeded to the fourth Item on the agenda.
4.

John Howard Association

James Coldren stated that he was recently appointed president of the John Howard Association fol lowing
the tenure of former president, John Mahoney. Mr. Coldren assured the committee that he had worked
closely with Mr. Mahoney and been briefed on the issue currently before the committee. He then gave an
overview of the problem from the Association's viewpoint and submitted updated information on the
average daily population at the jail. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Mr. Coldren remarked on three segments of inmates that should be examined in order to decrease jail
population. He pointed out that the County should remember the plaintiff class under the Duran case is
intended to address pre-trial detainees, and not sentenced offenders.
The first segment he mentioned is non-violent drug offenders, with cases resolved but who are still
awaiting assessment or placement in a T ASC program. He said there is a lack of bed space and substance
abuse treatment funding, which is a State responsibility through the Department of Human Services.
The second segment is non-violent offenders who are mentally ill. Referencing Chairman Moreno's
comments relating to the County becoming a dumping ground for individuals with mental illnesses, Mr.
Coldren stated this was unfortunately true. He said since these individuals do not qualify for the Sheriff's
alternative release programs, they serve their time sitting in jail due to the lack of state funding for mental
health programs and facilities. He reiterated a previous suggestion by the Association that a mental health
evaluation and service provision be added in the Sheriffs eligibility screening and service process for
placement in County programs under contracts with mental health agencies, such as Thesholds.
A third segment of the population relates to individuals who serve their time sitting in jail on bonds less
than $1 ,000, who are usually indigent, homeless, non-violent offenders. He said the pre-trial service
agencies should look at this segment of the population to see if any of the individuals might qualify for
administrative release, and work with Chicago's homeless coalitions to coordinate placement into shelters
and prevention programs already provided to this segment by outside, non-profit organizations.

2076

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

In closing, Mr. Coldren stated the County should look into federal and state assistance with expanding the
Sheriff's Day Reporting and Electronic Monitoring programs, which are model programs, nationally. He
also mentioned discussions with the judiciary regarding additional options in a lternative sentencing for
the increased number of inmates sitting in jail on misdemeanor domestic violence charges due to recent
changes in state statutes and court rulings.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question on the number of inmates in the County jail who have
a history of mental illness, Mr. Coldren speculated the number to be approximately 1,000 or I 0% of the
current population.
In response to Commissioner Sutker's question regarding the number of detainees diagnosed wi th mental
illness after being incarcerated, Mr. Coldren stated he did not have this information but would research it
and report back to the committee on his findings.

Chairman Moreno asked Mr. Coldren to submit the Association's written recommendations to
alleviate jail overcrowding to the committee chairman for further consideration. He also asked for
information outlining mental health services provided to inmates by not-for-profit agencies, such as
Thesholds. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
5.

Chief Judge's Office - Criminal Courts

Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Criminal Courts Division remarked that there has been a high level
of cooperation on the issue of alleviating jail overcrowding and improving the coordination and utilization
of the County's criminal justice resources. He noted that he meets weekly, if not daily, with the Sheriff's
and State's Attorney's Offices on the issue and has been conducting meetings for a year now with State
and County public safety agencies.
Judge Biebel made reference to previous statements regarding the num ber of cases disposed of in the
nation's three largest metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, New York and Cook County. He said that it takes
over 100 judges in New York and Los Angeles to dispose of the same number of cases that the 4 1
crimina l judges in Cook County dispose. He noted the criminal courts divi sion has 3 I felony trial
courtrooms, 2 night courts, 7 courtrooms in the s uburbs and provides felony case hearings for the City of
Chicago.
In response to Commissioner Moran's question regarding whethe r increasing the number of night court
calls would assist with the backlog of cases, Judge Biebel stated that at one time there were fi ve night
courts but the number is down to two. Upon review, he said the number of night courts was not costeffecti ve and did not reduce the amount of backlog.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding whether the number of conti nuances granted
might be a facto r in the length of time it takes to adj udicate a criminal case in Cook County, Judge Biebel
stated that tackling the number of continuances granted is difficult to resolve since there are constitutional
issues involved.
In response to Chai rman Moreno's question regarding data collected on daily court calls by the C ircuit
Court Clerk' s Office, Alan Levin stated he would get back to the committee with this information. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County C lerk.)

Commissioner Daley requested that written information from Judge Biebel's office be submitted to
the chair on the number of continuances granted last year, including a time line survey relative to
the disposition of the cases.

2077

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Commissioner Sutker asked that the analysis highlight the number and type of cases granted three
or more continuances.
Chairman Moreno requested a report explaining why there are fourteen cases still awaiting
disposition after 5 years.
Commissioner Silvestri requested that monthly summary reports of Biebel's meetings with the
Sheriff and State's Attorney be submitted to the members of the Board.
6.

Judicial Advisory Council (JAC)

Daniel Coughlin, representing the Judicial Advisory Council provided information on meetings of the
Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council relative to recommendations to reduce jail
overcrowding. He said everyone is cooperating and focused on finding a solution to the problem but to
date, no formal recommendations have been submitted or agreed upon.
Commissioner Quigley remarked that it is disturbing to learn about discussions or proposals on the iss ue
in daily newspapers, and suggested that minutes of the task force meetings be distributed to the members
of the Board in order to keep them better informed.

Chairman Moreno requested that regular status reports of the Cook County Criminal Justice
Coordinating Council (CCCJCC) meetings, from the Judicial Advisory Council (JAC), be
forwarded to the members of the Board until the issue is resolved. He also asked Mr. Coughlin to
provide a copy of minutes from past meetings to the chairman for distribution with the report.
(The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
The Chairman then proceeded to a new item on the agenda.

7.

Cook County President's Office - Department of Facilities Management

William Huffman, Director of Facilities Management was asked to provide information on the
Department's estimated costs relating to facilities at the Department of Corrections.
Mr. Huffman said that since 1978, over $1 billion has been spent on brick and mortar for public safety,
and today, he estimates the costs to be $6.42 per inmate, per day when the jail is at its capacity of 10,000
inmates. He stated this cost estimate includes maintenance contracts and salaried employees but does not
include utilities for the Department of Corrections, which are approximately $2.00 per square feet. In
total, Mr. Huffman estimated his department's annual costs to be $23 million. He noted the Industrial
Engineers are currently verifying these costs.
Based on Mr. Huffman's estimates, Chairman Moreno remarked that it costs approximately $4 million per
month, if medical costs are included, to provide housing and health care services to inmates at the County
jail.
Commissioner Butler asked what the costs would be if the county's debt services were factored . Mr.
Huffman stated he would look into this question and forward a written response to the chairman.

Chairman Moreno requested from the Bureau of Health Services specific costs in terms of medical
and health services provided to inmates at the County jail.

Cook County Jail.
Your Committee requested additional information on the subject matter from representatives from various
county agencies.

2079

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Moreno requested that the meeting of the Law Enforcement
and Corrections Committee be combined with the Department of Corrections Subcommittee to conduct a
joint meeting on overcrowding at the Cook County Jail. The Commissioner stated that today's meeting
was a follow-up on recommendations and information previously requested at the May 23 and October
10, 2001 meetings of the Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee.
Commissioner Steele welcomed all attendees and thanked Chairman Moreno for allowing the Department
of Corrections Subcommittee to participate in discussions on the issue of jail overcrowding.
Commissioner Steele emphasized the importance of cooperation among Cook County offices of the
State's Attorney, Public Defender, Sheriff and Chief Judge in producing a coordinated and agreed upon
plan to the federal courts that proactively addresses the fiscal, legal and public safety concerns the county
faces due to the increased number of jail inmates. She stated a common goal of the discussions should be
to improve the coordination of information in the County's criminal justice system in order to comply
with the Duran v. Sheahan federal consent decree.
Chairman Moreno gave a brief opening statement summarizing the discussion and information received at
previous committee meetings. He referenced correspondence, dated May 3, 2002, which the Chainnan's
Office sent to various public safety agencies as well as recent newspaper articles on the jail overcrowding
issue and updated information submitted by the Sheriffs Office that cited the jail's current population at
1.1,298. He stated since the inmate population continues to rise, regular meetings of both committees
would be held in order to monitor the issue and provide information to the Board regarding 1) compliance
with the Duran v. Sheahan consent decree; 2) the fiscal and legal impact of overcrowding on the County's
budget and criminal justice system; 3) safety concerns that impact correctional employees, detainees and
the public; and 4) recommendations from the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council
(CCCJCC). The Chairman asked that letters, news articles and all written information requested by the
members be included in the record. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Commissioner Steele then recognized Commissioner Quigley.
Commissioner Quigley remarked that some public safety offices throughout the country have improved
productivity despite limited resources, and cited a comparison of felony criminal cases disposed of last
year by the judiciary in Los Angeles, New York and Cook County. The Commissioner stated that data
showed: 37,000 felony criminal cases were disposed of by 150 judges in Los Angeles; 28,000 cases were
disposed of by 139 judges in New York; and 38,000 cases were disposed of by 41 judges in Cook County.
He stressed the importance of each Cook County office focusing on solutions to improve the use and
sharing of inmate, case and court information systems, as well as agreeing on a joint methodology to
decrease the amount time it takes to adjudicate a criminal case in Cook County.
The Chairman then proceeded to the first item on the agenda.
1.

Office of the Cook County Sheriff - Department of Corrections

Undersheriff Zelda Whittler said that the Sheriff's Office has been working with the various state and
county public safety agencies on the problem of jail overcrowding for the past 18 months. She
commented that the Sheriffs Office is currently part of the Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating
Council (CCCJCC), a task force convened by the Chairman of the Judicial Advisory Council. The task
force meets regularly to determine how county public safety agencies can collectively address the
overcrowding problem and better utilize current resources.

2080

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Ms. Whittler further remarked that the Sheriffs Office has created several alternatives-to-detention
programs and continues to look for means to improve the utilization of these programs. She said Sheriff
Sheahan is very concerned that the jail population will further increase during the summer months, and is
currently looking into the feasibility of temporarily housing inmates in tents to address the problem. Ms.
Whittler emphasized that the Department of Corrections (CCDOC) is doing everything it can to comply
with the federal consent decree, while at the same time carrying out its responsibilities to house, monitor
and care for persons who have been criminally charged but who have not yet gone to trial.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding the number of inmates held on a $ I 0,000
dollar bond or less, Ms. Whittler said she would forward this information to the committee. In addition,
she stated a review was done by the County's Industrial Engineering Department that was to be made
available to each member of the Board. Commissioner Quigley commented that he was not aware of such
a study and had not received a copy.

Commissioner Quigley requested that a copy of the Industrial Engineering study regarding bonds
and the County's costs of housing and health ser vices to inmates be sent to each member of the
Board and submitted to the Chair for further discussion.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding how often the Sheriff reviews detainees held
in the jail on bonds under $ I 0,000 for placement into the alternative programs, Jim Ryan stated the
Sheriffs Office daily reviews the background of each detainee for eligibility into the Day Reporting,
Electronic Monitoring or Administrative Furlough programs. He remarked that judges determine the risk
factors that set the type and amount of bond as well as those sentenced to the alternative programs. He
noted that if the court detennines someone to be a low risk they usually receive an I-Bond.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding how often inmates are re-screened after
entering the faci lity for eligibility into alternative programs, Mr. Ryan stated that when space becomes
available in alternative programs, the inmate population is re-screened for eligible detainees as well as
those who might not have originally qualified but whose situations have changed upon review of orders
of the court.
Commissioner Quigley recommended that detainees be re-screened every two weeks to detennine if those
who have low bonds are in jail and who might otherwise qualify for Day Reporting, Electronic
Monitoring or Administrative Furlough. In addition, Commissioner Quigley recommended that outside
programs be reviewed to house non-violent inmates who are not eligible for placement in the Sheriffs
alternative programs because they are homeless or mentally disabled.
In response to Comm issioner Daley's question regarding whether a criteria is in place fo r eligi bility to the
Sheriffs alternative programs, Jim Ryan responded that there is written criteria set by the Sheriff.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding why the average stay of inmates has
increased significantly over the past 6 112 years, Jim Ryan stated there are several factors, including
recent rulings by the Court (relating to cases involving weapons and domestic violence) and an increased
passage of penalty enhancement laws by the Illinois General Assembl y.
As a follow-up to Commissioner Maldonado's question, Deputy State's Attorney Patrick Driscoll stated
the factors that have increased the average stay of inmates in the County's jail are as numerous as the
various categories of detainees and circumstances of each case befo re the court. He said there has been a
significant increase in the jail population following legislation initiated by the Illinois Department of
Corrections (!DOC) that resulted in the implementation of an aggressive state parole policy, known as
"Operation Windy City." He said the new law and the !DOC parole strategy specifically targets parole

2081

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

violators in the City of Chicago, and six months after the policy was implemented, there was a sharp
increase in the jail population. He further commented that the County was powerless to alleviate the
increase due to !DOC restrictions that made parolees ineligible for placement in any alternative programs.
The Sheriff's Office has addressed the potential overcrowding problem with the State's Attorney's Office
in relation to the threat it poses on the county's compliance with Duran v. Sheahan.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding whether the Sheriff's Office maintains a
waiting list of eligible inmates for the Day Reporting and Electronic Monitoring programs, Mr. Ryan said
a list is maintained and reviewed daily by the Sheriff's Department of Community Supervision and
Intervention (DCSI).
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the capacity of the Sheriff's alternative
programs, Mr. Ryan stated the maximum capacity of the Day Reporting program is 800 and capacity of
the Electronic Monitoring program is 1,300. He noted that both programs are currently at capacity.
Commissioner Maldonado requested written information on the number of detainees eligible for
alternative release, but currently being held in the jail due to the lack of space in the Day Reporting
and Electronic Monitoring programs. He also requested the average daily cost of housing an
inmate in the alternative programs. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
In response to Commissioner Moran's question regarding the status of information previously requested to
alleviate jail overcrowding, Jim Ryan stated that Sheriff Sheahan previously reported on
recommendations made to the CCCJCC and the State of Illinois relating to: I) the establishment of a
special court to only handle new cases brought against parolees; 2) expanding the number of parole board
members and hearings in Cook County; and 3) the opening of a State facility for parole violators or state
inmates awaiting disposition of cases on new charges or appeal. He said Sheriff Sheahan believes these
are viable solutions, which the State of Illinois could consider to assist the county in the future. However,
he noted there has not been a financial commitment by the State or agreement with the Illinois
Department of Corrections on these recommendations.
Commissioner Butler requested a breakdown on the number of pre-trial detainees and their average length
of stay. Mr. Ryan responded and submitted a graph that provided a breakdown of the current 11,298
inmates held in custody and awaiting trial or disposition of their case. (The referenced documents are on
file in the Office of the County Clerk.) He noted there are currently 3, 133 inmates who have been in
custody for less than 30 days, 2,475 held for 31 to 90 days, 1,905 held for 91 to 180 days, 1,787 held for
181 days or up to a year, I, 171 held for I to 2 years, 381 held for 2 to 3 years, 146 held over 3 years, 54
held over 4 years and 14 held over 5 years and awaiting trial or disposition of their cases.
Commissioner Butler remarked that the Sheriff's Office is only the landlord for these inmates and has
limited power when it comes to alleviating jail overcrowding. He stated the key to the overcrowding
problem stems from the length of time it takes to adjudicate misdemeanor and non-violent Class 4 felony
cases in Cook County. He commented that the Chief Judge, State's Attorney and Public Defender should
review lists and develop timelines for disposal of such cases as well as study the reasons for and number
of continuances granted to attorneys that help increase the amount of time inmates remain in jail.
In response to Commissioner Daley's question regarding whether any inmates are currently being held in
the jail on appeal, Jim Ryan remarked that no inmates are currently being held in the jail on appeal.

2082

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDJNGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Chairman Moreno remarked that he agreed with a recommendation previously submitted to the
committee by the John Howard Association, which suggested the County should implement a shared
detainee computer-tracking database that includes: I) inmates personal data (who they are, where they
come from and what type of charge are they being held on); 2) in and out data (arrival dates, release dates
and length of time served in the County jail); and 3) disposition information (released to a state facility, a
boot camp facility, a drug and alcohol program, a domestic violence program, a Day Reporting,
Electronic Monitoring or Administrative Furlough program.
Chairman Moreno stated he believed a large factor in recent years for the increased population in the jail
could be traced to a serious lack of state mental health and drug treatment facilities. He said a report by
the John Howard Association suggested that the County jail has become a dumping ground for
individuals who have serious mental health and drug problems, and who remain in jail after the
disposition of their cases because there is no other place to put them.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding the number of "parole holds" in the County jail, Jim
Ryan stated there are currently 1,807 parole hold inmates in the jail on new charges.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding whether a cost analysis on the tent proposal is
available, Jim Ryan stated whatever impact the proposal may have on the County is still under review.
Mr. Ryan noted that Sheriff Sheahan received assurances that the United States military would
temporarily donate the tents.

Commissioner Steele requested that a cost analysis be submitted to members of the Board prior to
the Sheriff moving forward on his proposal to temporarily house inmates in tents during the
summer months.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding whether previous remarks by Sheriff Sheahan
that blamed overcrowding on the increased number of state parolees housed in the jail were accurate, Jim
Ryan stated the correlation between the population increase and the parolee inmates was accurate. He
noted eight months ago there were 2,000 parole violators in the County jail and today there are 1,800
detainees with "parole holds" in the jail classified as pre-trial detainees. Mr. Ryan said the Sheriff had
started returning inmates with parole warrants to the Illinois Department of Corrections, since he
considered them to be state property. However, since that time, the IDOC has removed the "parole
warrants" and now only have " parole holds" placed on inmates arrested on new charges. He explained
the Sheriffs Office has been advised by the State's Attorney's Office that the " parole holds" only
mandate that the IDOC be notified prior to an inmate's release. He said Sheriff Sheahan has no authority
to return these inmates to the IDOC, absent a parole warrant, since they are being held on new criminal
charges and are considered pre-trial detainees.
Commissioner Silvestri remarked that the burden of funding the nation's largest criminal justice system is
unfairly placed on Cook County's property owners and taxpayers. He suggested if the County is
mandated to comply with the federal consent decree and to fund longer stays in the jail because of new
laws and policies, the County must receive matching federal and state funds to implement solutions, such
as a coordinated criminal justice computer tracking system.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding what is being done to combat safety concerns at the
jail as a result of the overcrowding, Jim Ryan remarked that following the recent violence and death of an
inmate, security measures have been increased and all necessary precautions to ensure safety for
correctional officers and detainees has been established.

2083

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Chairman Moreno requested written information from the Sheriff's Office on precautions taken to
ensure the safety of correctional officers and inmates as a result of jail over crowding as well as an
updated estimate of daily costs to the Department of Corrections to house inmates.
Commissioner Steele then proceeded to the second item on the agenda.

2.

Office of the Cook County State's Attorney - Civil Actions Bureau

In regards to the federal consent decree under the Duran case, Deputy State's Attorney Patrick Driscoll
said that attorneys for the plaintiffs have not made any contempt requests relative to the current
overcrowding situation. He informed the committee members that the parties would meet again in Judge
Marovich's courtroom on Tuesday, May 14, 2002. Mr. Driscoll assured the committee that the State's
Attorney's Office is making all attempts to comply with the decree and will keep the Board informed of
any new information. In closing, he noted that there are no quick fixes to the overcrowding situation;
however, the State's Attorney's Office continues to work with Judge Biebel and the Judicial Advisory
Council task force on a coordinated· resolution to the problem in addition to continuing to expedite its
management of cases.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the responsibility of the Illinois
Department of Corrections (IDOC) to house state parolees held in the County jail on "parole holds",
Deputy State's Attorney Driscoll stated that all technical parole violators with parole warrants are sent
back to the IDOC. He explained that current inmates with "parole holds," are parolees arrested on new
criminal charges and are considered pre-trial detainees.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding why the lDOC removed parole warrants on
some inmates, Mr. Driscoll said he could not comment on IDOC policy and suggested that a
representative from the IDOC attend a future meeting to address such questions. Chairman Moreno noted
the IDOC was sent correspondence regarding the meeting but no representative was present.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the origin of the term "parole hold,"
Deputy State' s Attorney Driscoll commented that it is an IDOC administrative term given to parolees
when they enter the County's criminal justice system to ensure that the IDOC is notified prior to their
release. Mr. Driscoll reiterated that detainees with " parole holds" are not in the County jail because of
technical parole violations, but are awaiting trial or disposition of new criminal charges.

Chairman Moreno requested that the State's Attorney's Office submit any recommendations to
alleviate jail overcrowding and any new information discussed at the hearing with Judge Marovich
be given to the committee chairman for consideration at the next meeting. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Steele then proceeded to the third item on the agenda.

3.

Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities (T ASC)

Pamela Rodriquez, Vice President of Operations, gave a brief overview of T ASC's treatment programs
provided to offenders with drug problems. She stated that the agency conducted 6,000 assessments for
the County last year that revealed 75% of Cook County inmates have drug problems. She noted that
currently there is a 45-day waiting period for bed space in the drug treatment program for female
offenders and 65 days for male offenders.

2084

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

Chairman Moreno requested a written overview of T ASC's programs, including costs, and a report
on the rate of recidivism comparing those who receive no treatment to those who complete TASC
drug treatment programs (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.) He
also requested a copy of T ASC's independent study on mental health assessments of inmates when
completed.
Ms. Rodriquez responded she would forward this information to the chairman's Office when the study is
completed.
The Chairman then proceeded to the fourth Item on the agenda.

4.

John Howard Association

James Coldren stated that he was recently appointed president of the John Howard Association following
the tenure of former president, John Mahoney. Mr. Coldren assured the committee that he had worked
closely with Mr. Mahoney and been briefed on the issue currently before the committee. He then gave an
overview of the problem from the Association's viewpoint and submitted updated information on the
average daily population at the jail. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Mr. Coldren remarked on three segments of inmates that should be examined in order to decrease jail
population. He pointed out that the County should remember the plaintiff class under the Duran case is
intended to address pre-trial detainees, and not sentenced offenders.
The first segment he mentioned is non-violent drug offenders, with cases resolved but who are still
awaiting assessment or placement in a T ASC program. He said there is a lack of bed space and substance
abuse treatment funding, which is a State responsibility through the Department of Human Services.
The second segment is non-violent offenders who are mentally ill. Referencing Chairman Moreno's
comments relating to the County becoming a dumping ground for individuals with mental illnesses, Mr.
Coldren stated this was unfortunately true. He said since these individuals do not qualify for the Sheriffs
alternative release programs, they serve their time sitting in jail due to the lack of state funding for mental
health programs and facilities. He reiterated a previous s uggestion by the Association that a mental health
evaluation and service provision be added in the Sheriff's eligibility screening and service process for
placement in County programs under contracts with mental health agencies, such as Thesholds.
A third segment of the population relates to individual s who serve their time sitting in j ail on bonds less
than $1 ,000, who are usually indigent, home less, non-violent offenders. He said the pre-trial service
agencies should look at this segment of the population to see if any of the individuals might qualify for
administrative release, and work with Chicago's homeless coalitions to coordinate placement into shelters
and prevention programs already provided to this segment by outside, non-profit organizations.
In closing, Mr. Coldren stated the County should look into federal and state assistance with expanding the
Sheriffs Day Reporting and Electronic Monitoring programs, which are model programs, nationally. He
also mentioned discussions with the judiciary regarding additional options in alternative sentencing for
the increased number of inmates sitting in jail on misdemeanor domestic violence charges due to recent
changes in state statutes and court rulings.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question on the number of inmates in the County jail who have
a history of mental illness, Mr. Coldren speculated the number to be approximately 1,000 or I 0% of the
current population.

2085

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 4, 2002

In response to Commissioner Sutker's question regarding the number of detainees diagnosed with mental
illness after being incarcerated, Mr. Coldren stated he did not have this information but would research it
and report back to the committee on his findings.
Chairman Moreno asked Mr. Coldren to submit the Association's written recommendations to
alleviate jail overcrowding to the committee chairman for further consideration. He also asked for
information outlining mental health services provided to inmates by not-for-profit agencies, such as
Thesholds. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
5.

Chief Judge's Office - Criminal Courts

Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Criminal Courts Division remarked that there has been a high level
of cooperation on the issue of alleviating jail overcrowding and improving the coordination and utilization
of the County's criminal justice resources. He noted that he meets weekly, if not daily, with the Sheriff's
and State's Attorney's Offices on the issue and has been conducting meetings for a year now with State
and County public safety agencies.
Judge Biebel made reference to previous statements regarding the number of cases disposed of in the
nation's three largest metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, New York and Cook County. He said that it takes
over 100 judges in New York and Los Angeles to dispose of the same number of cases that the 41
criminal judges in Cook County dispose. He noted the criminal courts division has 31 felony trial
courtrooms, 2 night courts, 7 courtrooms in the suburbs and provides felony case hearings for the City of
Chicago.
In response to Commissioner Moran's question regarding whether increasing the number of night court
calls would assist with the backlog of cases, Judge Biebel stated that at one time there were five night
courts but the number is down to two. Upon review, he said the number of night courts was not costeffective and did not reduce the amount of backlog.
In response to Commissioner Butler's question regarding whether the number of continuances granted
might be a factor in the length of time it takes to adjudicate a criminal case in Cook County, Judge Biebel
stated that tackling the number of continuances granted is difficult to resolve since there are constitutional
issues involved.
In response to Chairman Moreno's question regarding data collected on daily court calls by the Circuit
Court Clerk ' s Office, Alan Levin stated he would get back to the committee with this information. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Daley requested that written information from Judge Biebel's office be submitted to
the chair on the number of continuances granted last year, including a time line survey relative to
the disposition of the cases.
Commissioner Sutker asked that the analysis highlight the number and type of cases granted three
or more continuances.
Chairman Moreno requested a report explaining why there are fourteen cases still awaiting
disposition after 5 years.
Commissioner Silvestri requested that monthly summary reports of Biebel's meetings with the
Sheriff and State's Attorney be submitted to the members of the Board.

Judicial Advisory Council (JAC)

Daniel Coughlin, representing the Judicial Advisory Council provided information on meetings of the
Cook County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council relative to recommendations to reduce jail
overcrowding. He said everyone is cooperating and focused on finding a solution to the problem but to
date, no formal recommendations have been submitted or agreed upon.
Comm issioner Quigley remarked that it is disturbing to learn about discussions or proposals on the issue
in daily newspapers, and suggested that minutes of the task force meetings be distributed to the members
of the Board in order to keep them better informed.

Chairman Moreno requested that regular status reports of the Cook County Criminal Justice
Coordinating Council (CCCJCC) meetings, from the Judicial Advisory Council (JAC), be
forwarded to the members of the Board until the issue is resolved. He also asked Mr. Coughlin to
provide a copy of minutes from past meetings to the chairman for distribution with the report.
(The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
The Chairman then proceeded to a new item on the agenda.

Cook County President's Office- Department of Facilities Management

William Huffman, Director of Facilities Management was asked to provide information on the
Department's estimated costs relating to facilities at the Department of Corrections.
Mr. Huffman said that since 1978, over $1 billion has been spent on brick and mortar for public safety,
and today, he estimates the costs to be $6.42 per inmate, per day when the jail is at its capacity of I0,000
inmates. He stated this cost estimate includes maintenance contracts and salaried employees but does not
include utilities for the Department of Corrections, which are approximately $2.00 per square feet. Jn
total, Mr. Huffman estimated his department's annual costs to be $23 million. He noted the Industrial
Engineers are currently verifying these costs.
Based on Mr. Huffman's estimates, Chairman Moreno remarked that it costs approximately $4 million per
month, if medical costs are included, to provide housing and health care services to inmates at the County
jail.
Commissioner Butler asked what the costs would be if the county's debt services were factored. Mr.
Huffman stated he would look into this question and forward a written response to the chairman.

Chairman Moreno requested from the Bureau of Health Services specific costs in terms of medical
and health services provided to inmates at the County jail.
Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

ORDINANCE

Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN W. DA VIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
respectfully requesting authorization to have certain property known as the Sutherland Cemetery declared
as "excess" by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County and to convey the property by Quit Claim
Deed to the Township of Palatine. The property is located on the Westside of Long Grove Road and
North of Rand Road in the Township of Palatine. Since the real estate is not essential for County
purposes and the Township of Palatine has asked to obtain title to the real estate, for the public purpose of
improving and maintaining the real estate as a cemetery and open space to the extent permitted by law,
the Real Estate Management Division concurs that it would be appropriate and in the best interest of the
County to convey this property to the Township of Palatine.
Therefore, I respectfully request that the Cook County Board of Commissioners declare the property to be
"excess" and authorize the conveyance of the property by approval of the Ordinance submitted hereto.
The property is legally described in the Quit Claim Deed submitted with the Ordinance.
