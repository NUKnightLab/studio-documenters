COMMUNICATION FROM COUNTY COMMISSIONER, CARL R. HANSEN,
dated February 14, 2005.
Enclosed is an added starter for the February 15, 2005 meeting of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners. It is recommended that this new item be
referred to the Committee on Finance. It recommends consideration of the
following issues as alternatives to balance the FY 2005 Budget without
increasing taxes:
•

•
•
•

An upward revision of fee revenue estimates in the FY2005 budget of
approximately $23,000,000 which is close to the minimum difference
between Actual and Estimated Fee Revenues in 2001.
Reductions in the recommended appropriation for Constitutional Officers
for a savings of $14,658,038.
The deletion of the under funded Full Time Equivalent positions (FTEs) in
the FY2005 budget for a savings of $25,961,064.
A two percent reduction in the recommended appropriation for all the
offices under the President for a savings of $23,569,408.

The latter two items are not mutually exclusive since the under funded FTEs
account for part of the appropriation for offices under the president.

* Referred to the Finance Committee 2/15/05
** Commissioner Hansen has requested this item be received and filed.

*The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, May 3, 2005.
