Cash
Balance
Plans

Illinois General Assembly via
SB1673 included a cash
balance plan.

Employees first
participating on or after
July 1, 2013 are
automatically enrolled in
the newly created Cash
Balance Plan.

. Members, including Tier
1 employees who elect
Option 1, may elect to
make additional
contributions into an
optional Cash Balance
Plan at 2.0% of pay.

 

- Three types of contributions to

pension:
- Employee contributes of salary

- Pay Credit: Employer contributes of an
individual?s salary into a notional account.

- Employer contribution no longer tied to a multiplier or percent
of total payroll.

. Interest credit. Employee?s notional account
receives a credit based on market yield. There is
typically a floor: minimum amount, usually tied to
30 year T-bonds and a ceiling: the minimum a
share in the upside if there are higher returns.

- At Retirement:

- Employee can purchase an annuity in the private
market

- Employee can take lump sum or opt to receive a
annuity.

Comparing Types of Pension Plans

Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution vs. Cash Balance

 

 

 

- A de?ned benefit pension
plan guarantees an
employee a 
pension benefit annuity
upon retirement until their
death. Many defined
benefit plans allow for the
pension benefit to be
transferred to a surviving
spouse or dependent, but
this varies from plan to
plan.

The retirees are paid by a
pension fund which
consists of money from
the employer and
employee. The pension
fund is generally invested
by an asset manager
whose main responsibility
is investment and growth
of the fund.

 

 

- Defined Contribution
plans or 401k plans. The
employer and employee
both contribute an
established amount into
the employee's defined
contribution plan.

- The employee then works
with an investment
manager to invest his
funds. When the employee
retires he receives
whatever monies have
accumulated in the plan.
Withdrawals are limited
only by tax provisions.

 

- A cash balance plan is a
?hybrid" DBIDC plan. in a
typical cash balance plan.
a participant's account is
credited three ways. the
EE contribution a "pay
credit" (such as 5 percent
of compensation from his
or her employer) and a
guaranteed annual interest

. if investment returns were
higher than assumed for a
specific period of time a
formula allows for
em pioyee's to receive an
increased investment
credit.

Participant can decide to
take annuity or lump sum
payout at retirement.
