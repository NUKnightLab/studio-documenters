STAFF REPORT 8/14/2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6367
ADDRESS: 601-607 SHELBY
HISTORIC DISTRICT: DETROIT FINANCIAL
APPLICANT: TYSON GERSH

PREPARED BY: J.ROSS

PROPOSAL
The property, 601-607 Shelby (AKA, the U.S. Mortgage Bond Building), is a steel-frame, nine-story,
Italian Renaissance Revival style building that was erected 1924-1925 to house a bank and offices.
At its south and east elevations, the resource displays a high granite base (measuring 6’-6” at its
highest point), and is faced in Indiana limestone at stories 1-3 and brick at the upper stories. A
classical cornice of limestone separates the three-story lower section from the smooth-finished
limestone upper façades. The original cornice remains in place. The building is rectangular in plan
and is adjacent to 220 West Congress as well as the building at 625 Shelby Street to the north. There
are five window bays on the Shelby façade, and six on the West Congress façade. The building
displays tall arched aluminum windows which extend the height of first and second stories. The
windows at stories 3-9 are 1/1 aluminum units and are paired, with a single window on each end bay.
In 1962, a pedestrian bridge was built at the first floor, mezzanine level, connecting 607 Shelby to
the State Savings Bank Building’s (151 W. Fort Street) second story, west elevation. The bridge
features a steel frame construction with glass windows. The bridge’s under carriage is clad with steel
panels which have been covered with a latex coating

−1−

 With the current submission, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval of the following
proposal:
•
•
•

Remove the existing black text coating from the steel panel at the underside of the pedestrian
bridge (method of removal not provided)
Prime the steel panel (name of the material/product not provided)
As per the submitted rendering, paint the steel panels at the underside of the pedestrian
bridge (name of the material/product not provided)

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
It is staff’s opinion that the bridge is a significant structure and the steel panel exterior cladding is a
distinctive material that characterizes the property. As noted above, the applicant is seeking to paint
a new mural at the stainless steel panels/underside of the pedestrian bridge. The work will also
involve the removal of the existing latex covering at that location and priming the panels prior to the
installation of the mural. However, the current application does not provide the following
information:
•
•
•

The method which the applicant will employ to remove the existing latex coating
The name/specs of the product which will be used to prime the steel panel
The name/specs of the product which will be used to paint the steel panel

Note that it is staff’s opinion that the proposed mural will not have a negative visual impact on the
building or surrounding district as it will be located at the underside of the bridge. However, it is
unclear to staff if the proposed installation/treatment (removal of the current coating, priming, and
−2−

 installation of the new material) is not likely to permanently damage the steel panel. Staff has
contacted the applicant and requested that they provide the above-listed outstanding information
prior to the 8/14/2019 meeting.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)
Relationship of Materials. A great variety of building materials exist throughout the
district, with concentrations of finished, pressed or glazed brick, limestone, Mankato
stone, terra cotta, marble; cast and porcelain enamel and glass facing primary façades.
Base stories are commonly faced or partially faced in granite. Materials utilized for
window surrounds and frames are cast concrete, steel, aluminum, bronze and wood.
Architectural embellishments tend to be in cast and carved stone, glazed terra cotta,
Pewabic tile, and red sandstone. Common brick appears on side elevations that were
not intended to be visible. Bronze grills, metal fire escapes, and aluminum and steel
framing elements are also visible. In general, the district is rich in its varieties and
relationships of materials.
(2)

Relationship of Textures. The smooth surfaces of glazed or painted brick, glazed terra
cotta, polished marble, polished granite, and large expanses of glass contrast with the
matte finishes of limestone and unpainted brick with mortar joints. Where the bases
of buildings are rusticated, they contrast with the smoother wall surfaces above.
Repetitive pilasters and ornamental detail in masonry, terra cotta or metal, primarily
on belt courses and cornices, and the fluting of columns, contribute significantly to
textural interest. Subdivided window sashes and treatments also contribute to textural
interest, as do receding windows and wall planes, resulting in textural effects created
by light and shade. Where those International style buildings have glass bases, a
smooth, transparent textural effect results. In general, the district is extremely rich in
textural relationships.

(3)

Relationship of Colors. Major materials of light colors, such as beige, white, and
cream, dominate the district. The natural brick colors of red, orange, and buff are
also contrasted with beige or light gray trim elements and details. Painted brick,
where it exists on the east side of Woodward Avenue, is in dark red and cream.
Granite bases, where they exist, are black, red or gray. Window surrounds and sashes
are shades of green, black, cream or white. Window and curtain wall glass is either
colorless or tinted in shades of light green, black or gray. Stainless steel and
aluminum are silver in tone; grills and grates are green or black. The Guardian
Building at 501 Griswold Avenue is a historic landmark featuring orange brick and
colored tile. Light poles tend to be deep green, black or gray. Fire escapes, where
they exist, are generally painted black. The original colors of any building, as
determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building and may
provide guidance for similar buildings.

RECOMMENDATION
As previously noted, it is staff’s opinion that the bridge is a significant structure and the steel panel
exterior cladding is a distinctive material that characterizes the property. The applicant is seeking to
paint a new mural at the stainless steel panels/underside of the pedestrian bridge. The work will also
involve the removal of the existing latex covering at that location and priming the panels prior to the
−3−

 installation of the mural. However, the current application does not provide the following
information:
•
•
•

The method which the applicant will employ to remove the existing latex coating
The name/specs of the product which will be used to prime the steel panel
The name/specs of the product which will be used to paint the steel panel

Note that it is staff’s opinion that the proposed mural will not have a negative visual impact on the
building or surrounding district as it will be located at the underside of the bridge. However, it is
unclear to staff if the proposed installation/treatment (removal of the current coating, priming, and
installation of the new material) is reversible/not likely to permanently damage the steel panel. Staff
therefore refrains from proffering a recommendation re: the proposal until they are able to review the
specs/details around the method for the removal of the existing coating and installation of the mural.

Description of Existing Conditions
Description of existing conditions​ ​including materials and design
While the building located at 607 Shelby was constructed in 1925 and exemplifies the aesthetic
of the Historic Detroit Financial District within which it sits, the bridge itself was erected in 1961
(as can be seen in the building permits below) and reflects an entirely different era of
architecture.
From an architectural standpoint, the modernism of the 1960s was characterized by simple
forms dictated by function and a celebration of color. True to the era, the original design of the
bridge features clean lines and repetitive geometry. The sides feature floor-to-ceiling window
panes, with perpendicular stainless steel fins at consistent intervals between glass panel that
wrap around the top of the structure. Clean horizontal/vertical lines and distinct simple
geometric shapes are major themes of the structure.
The ‘undercarriage’ of the structure features a grid of metal panels that are secured by
perpendicular steel straps at regular intervals (lining up with the metal fins mentioned above). At
some point, there appears to have been a black latex coating added to the panels, which is
currently deteriorating. Several professionals have suggested that the material is not original to
the structure. Rather, it was added later on as a means of waterproofing the base of the bridge.

Description of Project
Description of Project including an explanation as to why replacement--rather than repair--of
existing and/or construction of new is required
We (Basco, owner of 607 Shelby and the Bridge in its entirety) propose removing the
black latex coating and adding new waterproofing and color to the existing grid panels. The grid
pattern already exists on the underside of the bridge today. This art installation is intended to
not only acknowledge the architectural detail of the original design, but to amplify it as part of a
historically respectful effort to add interest to the otherwise deteriorated and in poor condition
underside of the bridge and activate the Shelby corridor.
The artwork has been intentionally designed to target those standing under the bridge,
and add interest without disrupting the original architecture. This is further achieved by
respecting the existing grid and repetitive nature of the bridge as well leaving a consistent black
border on the vertical portion of the bridge and underside creating a clean black frame around
the new artwork.
Below, please see the rendering depicting the proposed mural, which captures the
general spirit of the art installation (a modernist randomized color grid).
Please note that the rendering may appear much brighter than it would actually look in
real life. The underside of the bridge is constantly shaded. The rendering otherwise captures the
general spirit of the proposal, but the actual order of the colors, colors actually used, and
dimensions could change.
