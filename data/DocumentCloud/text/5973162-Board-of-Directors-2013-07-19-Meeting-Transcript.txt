CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good morning.

I see we

2

are a little past 10:00 o'clock and all the

3

Board Members are here, so I would like to call

4

this meeting to order and thank all of you for

5

attending and participating in this important

6

process, especially in light of what just came

7

out with the downgrade of the City.

8
9

I think this puts more onus and
emphasis on why what we're doing is so important

10

to try and create some alternative sources of

11

financing to help support the City as it

12

continues to try to improve its infrastructure.

13

I'm going to jump right into the

14

agenda.

First I want to apologize to our Board

15

Members for the lateness of the material we got.

16

I just wanted to be sure that we had it as

17

complete as we could and have as current of data

18

as we can have in the package.

19

And since we are at a real critical

20

decision point, I thought it would just be good

21

to have this update since we haven't had any

22

update for ourselves or for the public in four

23

months, and I just wanted to be sure we

24

understand where we were in the process.

 3
1

Going forward we're going to do a

2

better job with that, so I just wanted to make

3

that commitment to our Board Members and to all

4

you all that if we get material late, we may

5

have to look at moving the meeting so that the

6

Board really has ample time to review it because

7

now it becomes critically more important as we

8

work our way through the detail of a deal that

9

we do understand it and that we vet it properly,

10

and that's what we will do, so my apologies.

11

First order of business today is

12

the approval of the minutes from the

13

April 13th -- April 3rd meeting.

14

discussions, corrections?

15

MR. RAMIREZ:

Motion.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Second.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18
19

Any comments,

All in favor?

(A chorus of ayes.)
Second order of business.

Some of

20

you may have met Tracy Mendrick (phonetic).

She

21

helped us in the announcement.

22

with the press around the hiring of a CEO.

23

she is still helping us to deal with -- you

24

know, help us to coordinate with the press in

She helped us
And

 4
1

order to have consistency of message, the

2

interface with the City to make sure we are all

3

on the same page and to help us in anyway she

4

can in terms of getting our message out.

5

Now, Tracy has 25 years of

6

experience in this area, public relations,

7

strategic thinking and within management, and

8

we're absolutely pleased.

9

stand up so everyone can see you?

10

MS. MENDRICK:

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Tracy, would you

Thank you.
Welcome and thank you

12

for your past support and thank you even more

13

for what you're going to do for us.

14

appreciate that.

15

We

Moving to the second agenda item,

16

the contracting manual.

17

over to Steve to sort of run us through that.

18

I'm not sure you all had an opportunity to read

19

it, but essentially this is the document that

20

will document how we're going to conduct our

21

business.

22

I'm going to turn it

Now it's a living document, but I

23

think it's important that we get a framework in

24

place so that we can get going.

We're pretty

 5
1

far downstream on the retrofit project.

2

to make sure that we have documented how we're

3

conducting our business.

4

We want

And, again, I know you haven't had a

5

lot of time to read it, but why don't you

6

briefly walk us through it, Steve?

7

Board can decide if they are ready to make a

8

motion or not, but I would encourage us to, if

9

we feel comfortable enough, just to have a

I think the

10

framework in place and then we can obviously

11

review and revise it, review and revise it.

12

Steve?

13

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you, James.

14

Basically on Page 3 of the manual is the table

15

of contents.

16

room.

17

It's in everybody's book in the

And as in a typical manual, there's

18

a set of definitions and best practices concepts

19

and so on.

20

two things.

21

if you want to respond to something, here is

22

where you mail it, this is how many copies are

23

required and those types of items, which I don't

24

think we need to go over today.

The heart of the manual really is
One, it's procedural.

It's sort of

 6
1

And then there's the proposal

2

selection process which is largely starting on

3

Page 15 of the manual, and this takes us through

4

the different processes that are available for

5

the Trust from the perspective of conducting

6

business.

7

So it ranges from the typical

8

competitive process where you might have RFIs or

9

RFQs, RFPs to a process where there could be a

10

predevelopment agreement or there could be an

11

unsolicited proposal that gets submitted and

12

then a competitive process occurs after that

13

unsolicited proposal is received.

14

So it provides for multiple

15

methodologies for the purposes of considering a

16

proposal, and that's probably the heart of the

17

manual in these two or three pages.

18

The rest of the manual is largely

19

again administrative in nature and determines

20

just how to go about doing the procedure of

21

submitting a procurement.

22

So that's really the manual.

It's

23

not a very long manual.

It's a short manual.

24

We've looked at a lot of analog organizations to

 7
1

be able to create the manual, so we've gone to

2

Partnerships BC, Infrastructure Ontario, the

3

State of Virginia, the State of Texas, the

4

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in particular to get

5

information to be able to craft this particular

6

manual, and those five organizations or

7

locations are considered the leading edge places

8

to go.

9
10
11

CHAIRMAN BELL:
the wheel.

So we didn't reinvent

We did sort of piggyback on the --

MR. BEITLER:

Actually we removed the

12

footnotes at advice of counsel, but it was

13

heavily footnoted as we went actually, and I

14

hate to say it because there's probably no novel

15

ideas in here.

16

We basically went and looked at all

17

the analog organizations, talked to them and

18

took what was working at those organizations and

19

crafted it in this particular manual.

20
21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Questions?

Comments

from the Board?

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Steve, this does not in

 8
1

anyway take us away from the commitments we have

2

in terms of City requirements, MBE, WBE, public

3

solicitation?

4

to ensure that it all meets public policy.

5

I just want to go on the record

MR. BEITLER:

It's not to meant

6

supplement anything of that nature.

Well, it is

7

not meant to eliminate anything of that nature.

8

It's a supplement as to how we do business.

9

And, in addition, it's not meant to

10

eliminate the need to discuss in an RFP aspects

11

of business that are requirements that would be

12

laid out in an RFP.

13

manual as to how we would conduct business and

14

then the RFP would contain specifics pertaining

15

to any business requirements.

So this is a procedural

16

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Scott?

18

MR. FALK:

19

Falk with Kirkland & Ellis.

20

Alderman Pope, it's Scott

Alderman Pope, it may be worth

21

pointing out there's also no formulaic procedure

22

by which proposals are evaluated.

23

number of factors that are cited beginning on

24

Page 20 for how you would take into account

There are a

 9
1

various facets of a proposal received by the

2

Board, but the Board has retained flexibility to

3

weigh those various factors in whatever way in

4

its best judgment would be appropriate for any

5

particular project, and so you can take into

6

account those factors that are deemed to be in

7

the best interests of the City of Chicago and

8

the taxpayers when evaluating proposals.

9

There's no set formula baked into

10

this manual as to how you need to, on a rote

11

basis, process every proposal.

12

flexible.

13
14

ALDERMAN POPE:

It is very

Nor does it exclude any

particular process or requirements.

15

MR. FALK:

Correct.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

David?

Two quick

18

comments/questions.

19

first of all, kudos to you and all the folks at

20

the Trust.

21

working on this.

22

First on the -- Steve,

I think you have some interns

MR. BEITLER:

Actual Adam Hullin

23

(phonetic) is here and Adam is a principal

24

architect of the manual.

He came to us from

 10
1

Coca Cola and is processing leaving.

2

interrupt.

3

Sorry to

Just to say thank you to Adam.

MR. HOFFMAN:

That was a little bit

4

where I was headed.

5

you to you.

6

project, and I know it took a lot of time and it

7

is not a finished product.

8

I'm sorry, Adam, to see you go.

9

you in the future.

10

Thank you to Adam.

Thank

I think this is a really worthwhile

Two points.

So thank you both.
Maybe we'll see

First on Page 10 you

11

talk about initial programs and project

12

selection and there's something that defines how

13

we're going to do project selection.

14

words, post -- in addition to or other than

15

Retrofit, how is the Trust going to select

16

general topics and projects?

17

In other

And I want to say how happy I was at

18

how broadly this was written.

19

identify projects from a range of sources, its

20

own research about emerging technologies and

21

best practices, the City of Chicago and sister

22

agency operational goals, infrastructure needs

23

and capital budget constraints.

24

The Trust will

Of course we're going to be hearing

 11
1

from the City about their thoughts in this and

2

input from potential investors, citizens, public

3

interest groups and other potential users.

4

In other words, it's as wide as it

5

should be about where the ideas will come from.

6

They may come from your own shop, our own shop.

7

They may come from just anyone outside.

8

know this is what you want to do as well as you

9

find time for this, but I would encourage us,

And I

10

as soon as is practical, to set up something on

11

the website that allows for citizens or anyone

12

else to say here is an idea.

13

be -- that will really help us in the future.

14

So I want to give you praise for saying it

15

exactly the way you did.

16

I think that would

The second point I want to say is

17

something about transparency with regard to our

18

processes.

19

spending significant time on because the manual

20

says this will evolve over time, and obviously

21

we can adjust and change and add and improve

22

over time, and my guess is that that's what will

23

happen.

24

So to me this is not a point worth

I just want to make a preliminary

 12
1

comment that, and you and I have discussed this,

2

I don't think the manual says anything about how

3

our process will be transparent.

4

In other words, it doesn't say --

5

and at this point in the process that part of

6

the process will be we will provide all this

7

information publicly or we will post all this

8

information.

9

line between what may be kept confidential in

10

the middle of the procurement process or what

11

will be transparent.

It doesn't attempt to draw the

12

You know my view that we should be

13

pushing as hard as possible to have everything

14

transparent in the procurement process unless we

15

can articulate some very compelling reason not

16

to.

17

procurement yet, although that may be coming

18

relatively soon, with that being a next step,

19

but I think that needs to be a next step, as you

20

and I have discussed.

21

I'm comfortable, since we haven't done a

So I think it's perfectly fine that

22

it exists the way it does now, but I think in

23

short order what needs to be added to this is

24

what is the process for making things

 13
1

transparent and at what point and to the extent

2

those involve difficult decisions, let's address

3

those.

4

there.

To the extent it's easy, let's put it in

5

So I wanted to make that comment.

6

know you and I have discussed that.

7

on your list.

8

near the top of your list with our great

9

advisors from Kirkland would be helpful.

10

I

I know it's

Whatever you can do to put it

MR. BEITLER:

Let me add one comment

11

now that we're addressing this particular manual

12

today, which is the first time it's in a decent

13

form.

14

to various constituencies and asking them for

15

comment, so we would expect that many people

16

will come back and say like well, what about

17

this or what about that or what about this, and

18

so I would expect over the next several Board

19

meetings that there will be potential changes to

20

the manual.

21

Basically we're hoping -- we're going out

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

On those lines,

22

and again this goes to the website, I know the

23

website is an agenda item later so I don't want

24

to push hard on this because I know there's

 14
1

been issues with the website.

2

in the form of encouragement, I think that if

3

it's feasible as soon as possible to put

4

something on the website that allows for public

5

comment.

6

But again, just

For all we know the best expert that

7

will help us answer the question about how this

8

can be improved is someone out there, they may

9

be in a different state, they may be in a

10

different country, who can see this online and

11

give us a comment.

12

I think the more we set up our

13

website so that it's easy to hear their

14

thoughts, the better we can do.

15

encourage that if that's not set up already, I

16

see you scrolling, if that's not set up already,

17

I'd like to --

18

MR. BEITLER:

So I would just

Well, we have a schedule

19

of things, but we just put on a contact us on

20

the website to make sure that at the very least

21

we had a place where somebody could send a

22

comment.

23

places on the website where you can contact us

24

for different purposes.

There's actually about five or six

 15
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm no website designer.

2

I'm imagining something bigger, more prominent,

3

but you decide.

4

MR. BEITLER:

That's just an interim.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, I understand.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7

that's at.

8
9

That's just one place

MR. HOFFMAN:

You decide.

Thank you

very much.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

11

Any other comments?

Just one other thing, Steve, we'll

12

probably get a lot of suggestions for revisions

13

so let's block them, let's not do them one at a

14

time.

15

so we're not always in that state of asking us

16

as a Board to approve revisions.

Let's gather them and let's do a revision

17

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, sir, we will.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

With that I

19

guess I'd like a motion if we're comfortable in

20

putting this in play and then recognizing it's

21

going to be a living document.

22
23
24

ALDERMAN POPE:

Move do pass the

resolution for the contracting manual.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Second.

 16
1
2
3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

(A chorus of ayes.)
Great.

Okay.

We've been working

4

hard on the budget for 2013.

5

tried to look further out and I concentrated on

6

'13 because I think we got to give Steve some

7

authority to go out and get him a little help

8

and get this infrastructure in place.

9

We've actually

And I think, as you all know, we

10

have been relying on the pro bono support from

11

everybody that has been supporting us, including

12

office space for Steve, and at some point we got

13

to grow up and decide we're going to have

14

permanent infrastructure.

15

Now, we are mindful we're spending

16

public money so we are going slowly, and, you

17

know, I've had Steve really drag his feet and

18

that's been difficult, but I think we're okay

19

for now, but I think now is the time for us to

20

decide to give him some authority, and we've

21

worked this budget pretty hard from where it

22

originally was to get it down to what we think

23

our spend rate given the first part of the year

24

has been and what we think we'll spend in the

 17
1

second part given the things that we know we

2

have in front of us.

3

So, Steve, why don't you sort of

4

walk through it?

5

the money if we don't have the expenses, but we

6

do need to provide for this and help the City

7

plan in terms of what they're going to have to

8

give to us over the next six months.

9

And again we will not spend

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

Basically you

10

can see the budget on the two -- the Board can't

11

see it, but it's in your book.

12

see the budget.

The audience can

13

The largest item is payroll.

14

Basically the payroll item is for me for

15

11 months and then for three additional persons

16

that we would hire in the last quarter of this

17

year and the payroll related expenses that go

18

with those four individuals.

19

Then you can see the expense

20

categories that we created for purposes of

21

managing the Trust.

22

on the bottom of the page, there are some notes

23

that address some of the major expense

24

categories, so I think one difference today as

I think that as you'll note

 18
1

opposed to for those of us who may have been

2

running a corporation a decade ago is that

3

software now comes as a service and so there's a

4

large expense item for software.

5

The two largest expenses in that

6

software area are actually for something called

7

ShareVault which is a data vault that we would

8

use in the deal process to provide information

9

to potential investors and GIS mapping software

10
11

that we're using or will be using.
Then there's all of the typical

12

expenses that you would expect.

13

very large expense area, and the D&O insurance

14

in particular for the Trust is a very expensive

15

insurance item.

16

Insurance is a

The next particularly large expense

17

area is consulting.

The major areas in

18

consulting at this point are accounting audit,

19

IT support, website design.

20

facets to our website design that we are

21

spending money on, and so those are large

22

expense areas this year in terms of website

23

design and IT support which in subsequent years

24

will decline as the website gets mature and the

There's a number of

 19
1

capabilities for engaging with investors in

2

particular, but also the public are also put

3

into place on the website.

4

So basically we have a total budget

5

for this year of about $835,000.

6

large miscellaneous expense.

7

big fan of miscellaneous expenses.

8

hundred thousand dollars.

9

There's a

I've never been a
It's a

The reason for that is because of

10

project expense which is very hard to get a

11

handle on as we're just beginning to do

12

projects, and we have certain expenses related

13

to those projects that we're already committed

14

to, such as an independent financial opinion for

15

the deal that we're currently considering.

16

So those expenses for the moment are

17

lumped into here until we can create project

18

budgets which hopefully we'll begin to do in the

19

next quarter.

20

So basically that takes us to a

21

budget of about 835,000 between payroll and

22

the other expenses, and that's for the entire

23

2013.

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Questions or comments

 20
1

from the Board?

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'll ask you a few

3

questions.

4

each, can you just give us a little bit of

5

information about your thoughts about what kind

6

of positions you're thinking about?

7

The three new hires for one quarter

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

Basically one

8

person is an admin person and also doing IT

9

work, so somebody who's versatile, who can do

10

bookkeeping and IT and whatever other

11

administrative activities we require at the

12

Trust.

13

And then the other two individuals

14

are financial people that will be able to do

15

financial analysis, heavy duty spreadsheet work

16

and who have experience managing projects, doing

17

project finance and so forth.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm glad that the first

19

position is the one that you described.

I know

20

given how hard you've been working and how much

21

is on your plate, I don't need to encourage you

22

to put that right at the top of the list, but I

23

would encourage, having observed how much you're

24

working, to put that up at the top of your list.

 21
1

I think that would, as in any situation like

2

this, help.

3

Question about -- on the

4

miscellaneous expense, couldn't it be more -- I

5

don't like items that say miscellaneous.

6

MR. BEITLER:

I don't either.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me just respond.

8

think what you said was really not

9

miscellaneous.

I

What you said was project

10

expenses that are undefined at this time, which

11

I think is fine.

12

because I think that's more limited than just

13

miscellaneous.

14

Let's define it that way

And I think defining it that way,

15

which therefore is not as open, wide open

16

discretionary, it's just basically anything

17

would be helpful.

18

sense, and I think what I would -- on consulting

19

I was also going to ask.

20

although it's not necessarily inappropriate, it

21

just depends, so I had a couple questions.

22

much have we spent approximately from that

23

already?

24

With that I think it makes

MR. BEITLER:

That's a large number,

Well, it's more a

How

 22
1

function I think at this point of obligation as

2

opposed to the amount that's been spent.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Spent or obligated,

that's fine.
MR. BEITLER:

Right.

So of the

6

$189,000 that is down here, we probably spent in

7

the neighborhood of 40 to $50,000 and the

8

remaining has been obligated based on the

9

projects that we've agreed to conduct with the

10
11

various consulting organizations.
MR. HOFFMAN:

So this is an amount that

12

we -- that, you know, we are going to have to

13

spend by year end because of either what's out

14

the door already or obligations?

15

MR. BEITLER:

That's correct.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

As long as the timing

17

holds, David.

18

doesn't hold and we don't get to all of them, it

19

could slip to 14.

20

If it doesn't hold, if the timing

MR. BEITLER:

21

is the website.

22

the website.

23
24

But a significant portion

We have a project planned for

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Remember he's got IT in

there, he's got the accountants in there that's

 23
1

going to do our accounting, and he's got -- what

2

was the other major thing, Steve?

3
4

MR. BEITLER:

Well, the audit which we

have --

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

The audit which will be

6

at year end where we got to do an audit and get

7

the financial statements.

8
9

MR. HOFFMAN:

So can you just give us

a general breakdown since it's known now how

10

it's being -- it's expected to be spent?

11

you give us a general breakdown of this

12

$190,000?

13

MR. BEITLER:

Can

I can give you a general

14

breakdown.

I'm not exactly sure how things will

15

wind up completely.

16

bills that we've had to date are about $5,500,

17

but I'm not exactly sure how much our total

18

accounting will be by the end of the year

19

because as we set up systems that involve the

20

accountants and the accountants participate in

21

establishing those systems, our accounting bills

22

will be slightly higher this year than they

23

would be in a normal year where those systems

24

exist.

For example, the accounting

 24
1

So I think our accounting bills, you

2

know, I would presume would come in at about

3

15,000, maybe 20,000 this year.

4

haven't hired an audit firm yet.

5

company is helping to make recommendations for

6

our audit firms, and then the treasurer will, of

7

course, need a process to determine who the

8

audit firms will be.

9

just beginning to look at audit firms.

10
11
12
13

The audit -- we
The accounting

So at this point we're

support -CHAIRMAN BELL:

What do we think an

audit would cost us, 20,000?
MR. BEITLER:

14

that neighborhood.

15

might want to --

I think it's somewhere in

I don't know.

The treasurer

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

this is the first year.

18

they will look at.

19

20, 25 grand for it but we'll see.

20
21
22

The IT

We have no idea because
We have no idea what

Just say we're provisioning

MR. BEITLER:

I'm hoping that it's

somewhere in that ballpark.
And then the software, so the

23

website design is about $68,000.

The SharePoint

24

internal portion of the site is another 20 or

 25
1

$30,000, and the ShareVault site that goes with

2

the SharePoint site is another 10 or so thousand

3

dollars on top of that.

4

significant component.

5

almost $40,000.

6
7

MR. HOFFMAN:

The D&O insurance is

I just wanted to stay

with the consulting.

8
9

So the software is a

MR. BEITLER:

So those are the major

consulting.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's helpful.

I mean,

11

basically what I hear you saying is the website

12

design is actually around half or more than half

13

of that.

14

MR. BEITLER:

More than half.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's fine.

I think

16

that over the next -- you know, up to the next

17

Board meeting I think that as you're -- it would

18

be helpful to get something that's a breakdown

19

of this, especially as the money is getting

20

spent more to show us the specifics of this line

21

item since I think it's a big line item within

22

the total budget.

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

I've committed for the

next Board meeting to have actuals forecast and

 26
1

the budget financials.

2
3

MR. HOFFMAN:
this line item down.

4
5

But if you could break

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We will do better on

that.

6

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, I will.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

8

MR. RAMIREZ:

Mr. Chairman.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes, sir.

If I could, I just want

11

to go back a little bit and talk about

12

miscellaneous again.

13

miscellaneous being in budgets.

14

many folks do, but it's a necessary thing at the

15

same time.

I too do not like the
I don't think

16

Although I do think we should show

17

with specificity where the money is going, I'm

18

in favor of keeping a miscellaneous item because

19

especially we're still in our infant stage or

20

maybe toddler, I don't know, however you want to

21

describe it, but things happen and things come

22

up and miscellaneous is allowed to give

23

flexibility.

24

as long as it's accountable.

I'm in favor of that flexibility

 27
1

So I am in favor of keeping that

2

miscellaneous in the items and just encourage

3

you to do it.

4

thing, leave yourself some room for flexibility

5

and never undercapitalize your projects.

6

I always tell folks the same

I think it's an important and

7

necessary thing to do, although I do agree with

8

Director Hoffman's suggestion that it should be

9

accountable to where it's going.

I don't think

10

you are suggesting otherwise.

11

you define it too narrowly then it takes away

12

your flexibility to any of the issues that come

13

up later.

14
15

MR. BEITLER:

I'll work with the

treasurer to make sure that we do that.

16

MR. RAMIREZ:

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

TREASURER NEELY:

19

I just think if

Okay.
Any other comments?
Mr. Chairman, can I

ask a question?

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Sure.

21

TREASURER NEELY:

Can we have further

22

breakdown on the three people you're looking to

23

hire on what you're expecting to pay them?

24

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

Base salary for the

 28
1

assistant/accountant is $65,000.

2

for the associate is 120.

3

managing director is 170.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

5

Base salary

Base salary for the

Other questions?

I just want to remind you that as a

6

Board that we're a start up so we're going to

7

get better at being able to figure out what the

8

budget should be and is once we operate a year

9

and then get some experience behind us.

10

Obviously I would not have asked --

11

allowed us to spend a hundred thousand on a

12

website except that's the fundamental basis of

13

our transparency and making sure that we're open

14

and so we just had to do it.

15

been the last thing I would have put money in

16

the budget for.

17

that together.

18
19

You did a good job of putting

MR. HOFFMAN:
comment.

That would have

I've got one more

Sorry, James.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

Just to clarify, Steve,

22

all of this $835,000 is a -- is within, easily

23

within the amount that's already been

24

appropriated by the City to the Trust.

 29
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Absolutely.

It is actually less than

3

half of that amount.

So this doesn't require us

4

to ask for anything at all from the City because

5

it's based on money already appropriated; is

6

that right?

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're just trying to

10

get more finite with what we need and then let

11

them -- and we got to start giving them insight

12

on next year and the following year because they

13

got to get it into their planning process.

14

So in the next meeting we'll

15

probably be coming forth or the next two

16

meetings coming forth with what that

17

recommendation would be for the next couple of

18

years.

19

Okay.

Any other questions?

20

(No response.)

21

Do I have a motion?

22

ALDERMAN POPE:

So moved.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Second?

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'll second.

 30
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

(A chorus of ayes.)

3
4

All in favor?

Great.

Thank you very much.

Website?

5

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

So actually the

6

website is on the screen behind the Board.

7

is the home page.

8

on the website on the top with the latest news

9

that you can click through.

10

This

Basically there is a section

So in this case the meeting notice

11

and agenda are posted twice on the website, once

12

there, and you can click through to see the

13

whole thing.

14

And then ideas and projects are

15

actually focused on the left side of the page

16

when you are facing the page.

17

latest Board meeting is also posted on the page

18

in terms of the next Board meeting that will

19

occur.

20

And then the

Then on the bottom and the top are

21

the typical menus that will occur.

In this

22

particular case there's a video on the top that

23

you can click on that shows President Clinton

24

and Mayor Emanuel introducing the Trust and then

 31
1

there are initiatives that we're considering

2

that are ideas or projects that are on the

3

initiatives page.

4

There's an about page, and as you

5

can see here, there's several menus in terms of

6

how the Trust works, its strategy, operational

7

principles, who we are, alumni.

8

Now, the website was hacked in the

9

not too distant past so we remain in the process

10

of restoring some of the functionality that was

11

previously on the website and are in the process

12

of doing that.

13

There will also be press information

14

coming soon and then public records will be on

15

the site and that will include scheduled

16

meetings, meeting records and documents.

17

today, for example, in meeting records is the

18

agenda for today's meeting.

19

For

The previous information that was on

20

the website will be posted again to the website

21

as we get to it hopefully in the next week or

22

so.

23
24

And then the blog is, in fact, that
portion in the front of the site on the home

 32
1

page that lists today's agenda and the next

2

meeting.

3

So that's simply the website.

It

4

has been built so that we can add significant

5

functionality in there over the next few months

6

for the purpose of interacting with the public

7

and for the purpose of interacting on projects.

8
9

So there will be, for example,
functionality so that anybody will be able to

10

sign up at any time there's a significant

11

information that's posted on the website, that

12

person who signs up will get notice that there's

13

a change on the website and they can come and

14

look and see what that information is.

15

So in particular if you are in a

16

company that would be interested in an RFQ that

17

we're posting then you will get notice of the

18

fact that that RFQ is posted, which would be

19

helpful because while we may have a list where

20

we go out and send the RFQs to those people on a

21

list, there may be others who would be

22

interested in receiving the RFQ.

23

CHAIRMAN BELL:

24

Steve, are you

comfortable that this web design has better

 33
1

security and is less likely to be hacked?

2

mean, did we -- do we know that up front?

3

MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

I

As far as we know

4

basically we did not have a very good situation

5

in terms of where the website was previously

6

located so it was on a sort of free server which

7

you couldn't even contact by telephone and so

8

there were a whole host of issues.

9

The WordPress as far as we know, and

10

I didn't want to spend so much money to figure

11

all of this ought distinctly, but based on

12

spending enough money to see if we could recover

13

the website, it would appear that that

14

particular site did not maintain the WordPress

15

security properly and that there are people that

16

just troll on the web and they look for these

17

security flaws and then they don't care who you

18

are.

So basically we fell victim to that.

19

The site was not really recoverable.

20

Fortunately we were working on the design of the

21

new site anyway, and we rushed to put that site

22

up at least bare bones and now we're putting the

23

functionality back that we were lacking that was

24

previously on the previous site and adding

 34
1

functionality that will enable us to better

2

conduct business.

3
4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Great.

Thank you.

Any

questions, comments for Steve on the web?

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Steve, I know no one is

6

more frustrated about this than you.

You and I

7

have discussed this.

8

here, I would ask the folks who are working on

9

the website that we're paying to put it at the

Just to state it out loud

10

top of their list to get the documents that were

11

posted and our key documents back up.

12

I say that because A, it feels like

13

it should be a relatively simple thing for them

14

to do; and, B, it's at the heart of allowing

15

someone on the outside to assess what's going on

16

here.

17

At this point they go to the

18

website, they can't figure out what's going on

19

because they can't see the documents.

20

saying anything that you don't feel even more

21

strongly than I feel, I know, because you told

22

me that, but I think, therefore, what I would

23

ask is when it's up, when the documents are up,

24

which as I said hopefully is in a week or so,

I'm not

 35
1

would you send us an email saying just wanted to

2

let you know, Board Members, the documents are

3

up so that we know that that particular part of

4

the frustration could end because somebody has

5

fixed it.

6

Steve.

7

I would appreciate that.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

Thank you,

Any other questions?

(No response.)

9

Okay.

The next item on the agenda

10

are some of the other things the Trust is

11

working on, so, you know, you're wondering --

12

just in case you're wondering is all the time

13

being spent on just Retrofit One, it's not, so

14

there isn't a lot of downtime when we're not

15

making, you know, progress or we're in between

16

steps on what we should be doing in the Retrofit

17

process.

18

So I've asked Steve to sort of give

19

us a feeling for what other things are being

20

considered and what are the things they are

21

working on and do a brief overview of that so

22

that we have the bulk of the time available to

23

really talk about the update on Retrofit.

24

Steve?

 36
1

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

As you can

2

see on the chart in your book or behind you,

3

there are four areas that we as the Trust have

4

begun to focus on, energy, underutilized

5

property, transportation and opportunistic, but

6

really the first three areas.

7

One of the reasons that we're

8

focusing on these areas in particular is

9

because there are clear paybacks available from

10

the projects in these project areas, and they

11

are also potentially quite beneficial to the

12

City.

13

So among the focus areas in energy

14

are retrofits that go beyond the current

15

retrofit program that we're talking about today,

16

including projects for lighting, the Lincoln

17

Park Zoo, O'Hare Airport and then PACE, Property

18

Assessed Clean Energy, which we can do under

19

current legislative authorization for commercial

20

buildings and are reviewing.

21

Citywide solar and wind which for

22

solar the economics appear to be there for the

23

purposes of doing a very large solar project in

24

the City and so we're examining that.

We're

 37
1

also looking at wind.

2

about large wind turbines in an urban area, so

3

we are looking at distributed wind, particularly

4

on right-of-ways around the City.

5

Some people get skittish

And then we're also looking at

6

geothermal which is an idea.

7

of cities in the United States that actually

8

have eliminated the need for snow plowing

9

through the use of geothermal melting in our

10

streets, so we have to do an analysis of the

11

cost per square meter of snow removal versus the

12

cost per square meter of geothermal.

13

There are a number

And then we're looking at compressed

14

natural gas as an option for use in the City

15

fleets and for filling of non-city vehicles as

16

well.

17

In the underutilized property area,

18

which is I think is a very exciting area, we're

19

looking at the development of many properties

20

that the City owns.

21

15,500 vacant lots as well as significant air

22

rights that are not developed, and we believe

23

that there are areas of great potential in terms

24

of developing those air rights for transit

So the City actually owns

 38
1

oriented development, for agriculture, for data

2

centers and for affordable housing.

3

So we are in the process of

4

cataloging all of the property for the City and

5

the sister agencies in a single database and

6

looking at which properties are congruent to

7

each other and which properties have adequate

8

space for development, and that project should

9

probably be done in the next month or so and

10

then we will be able to come back with

11

recommendations about the property.

12

For transportation we've begun

13

discussions in particular with the CTA and are

14

looking at how the Trust can collaborate with

15

the CTA regarding the red line and on station

16

redevelopment as well as aps for parking, for

17

park and ride and neighborhood parking.

18
19
20

So those are the major areas that we
are looking at.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Give them a sense of

21

the number of identified projects you have even

22

though we're not off and running, but there's a

23

lot of opportunity in these areas.

24

MR. BEITLER:

There's a tremendous

 39
1

amount.

2

underutilized property really affects most of

3

these projects areas.

4

developers, the thing that they're looking for

5

are customers and property, and there are some

6

significant swaths of property in the City.

7

One of the surprising things is how the

For example, for solar

We have actually been approached by

8

some corporations to see if there's property

9

that we, the Trust, might be interested in that

10

they have that they feel is underutilized for

11

them.

12

developments, and I think that these program

13

areas have significant potential.

So there's some very interesting

14

Additionally, if we can be

15

successful and structure these program areas

16

properly so that the Trust can make a certain

17

amount of money from these program areas, then

18

we could theoretically funnel that money back

19

into programs and projects that don't have a

20

return.

21

So if there's a bridge that needs to

22

be rebuilt and the Trust is able to make money

23

from one of these programs, then we could

24

theoretically spend that money on the bridge for

 40
1

which, for example, we're never going to charge

2

a toll to go over the Chicago River.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And I think all of you

4

know that the intention is that this Trust be

5

self-funded over time and so that's why we're

6

looking at some of these other projects that

7

would have a greater return and would allow us

8

to do something to benefit the City but also to

9

pay for the effort that's spent in order to make

10

it happen.

There's a lot -- he showed me

11

hundreds of them.

12

talk about these yet.

13

MR. BEITLER:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I said we're not ready to

No.
We got to get through

15

this first one to get the process down and make

16

sure we are comfortable with how transparent we

17

are and that we have a real way to get down to

18

understanding that the deal we come up with is

19

really is in the best interests of the City, and

20

that's not as easy as it seems.

21

It just isn't.

We got to figure that out on this

22

first one and then I think we'll let them know

23

on the others.

24

MR. BEITLER:

If I may, I think we have

 41
1

learned that we should probably think about

2

these things as ideas, projects and programs,

3

and that principally at the moment we're

4

investigating ideas as opposed to creating

5

projects.

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Any questions of

7

Steve on that activity, on the other things the

8

Trust is engaged in?

9
10
11

MR. HOFFMAN:

No questions from me.

would just say nice job, keep it up.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Why don't we get

12

into the major agenda item and that's the

13

Retrofit update?

14

and then let us know how we're going to go

15

through this.

16

I

Steve, why don't you set it up

MR. BEITLER:

I think the best thing to

17

do here is to go through the presentation which

18

is in the back of everybody's book.

19

last tab.

20

It's the

For that purpose I will be assisted

21

at a certain point by David Winters who's the

22

Chief Assistant Corporation Counsel of the City

23

and Jerry Wallack from Kutak Rock who is

24

representing the City for bonding.

So would you

 42
1

like to proceed?

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

Yes.
Yes, do it.

And, by the way, as we go through

5

this, be mindful we're going to ask questions as

6

we go, we're not going to wait until the end so

7

I don't want anybody to think we should do that.

8

It may be a little disruptive, but I would

9

rather people at the end of this have a good

10

feeling and understanding of where we really are

11

and what you're really asking us to do based on

12

that.

13

MR. BEITLER:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

personal.

16

understand it.

17

Yes, sir.
Everybody, it's not

I just want to make sure we

MR. BEITLER:

The first slide discusses

18

the CPS lighting project.

It's approximately

19

$20 million of funding, exclusive of grants.

20

the first line in the next three slides would be

21

an approximate number because it includes fees

22

that are associated with the financing and we're

23

not precisely sure of what those fees are so

24

we've estimated them.

So

 43
1

In this particular case the grants

2

and rebates that CPS has or will receive have

3

not yet been recognized as revenue so we're

4

looking for $20 million exclusive of grants.

5

TREASURER NEELY:

Do we know how many

6

grants we're going to receive?

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, $7 million.

We

8

expect that the annual energy savings will be

9

$2.2 million for project purposes.

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And on that, we are

11

comfortable that the methodology used to

12

determine and estimate those savings there like

13

meet standards of some sort for developing

14

energy savings?

15

MR. BEITLER:

Well, in each of these

16

projects there are several gates that have

17

already been gone through.

18

agency involved does their own analysis.

19

Second, there is a consulting organization that

20

has done an analysis for the Trust, an

21

engineering consulting organization with

22

expertise in energy that has done an analysis

23

for the Trust.

24

So, first, the

Then the Trust through PFM has also

 44
1

done a financial analysis beyond the engineering

2

analysis.

3

independent financial organization for the

4

purposes of an opinion as to whether or not we

5

correctly did the analyses, as well as whether

6

the deal structure is appropriate.

7

those four wickets, if you will, for the

8

purposes of --

9

And then finally we will engage an

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So we have

What I'm trying to get

10

at is are those sort of recognized, an industry

11

standard?

12

try and sell these revenue streams, and I want

13

to be sure -- the only way we're going to get

14

good pricing is if they don't think it's high

15

risk, and there's got to be a way for that

16

assessment to take place.

17

Essentially what we're going to do is

MR. BEITLER:

The Energy Services

18

Corporations who did the analyses used standard

19

methodologies, and all savings have been vetted

20

against standard methodologies.

21

So once again we're not reinventing

22

anything.

We're not creating any methodologies.

23

We're adhering to best practices within the

24

industry.

 45
1
2
3

MS. FERGUSON:

Can you remind us who

those firms are?
MR. BEITLER:

There are three ESCOs

4

that were involved, AE Com, Schneider and

5

Ameresco.

6

we hired through the PBC whose name escapes me

7

at the moment.

Then there's one additional firm that

8

MR. FALK:

Arcadis.

9

MR. BEITLER:

Thank you.

And Arcadis.

10

They did the additional analyses beyond the ESCO

11

analysis for the Trust and the City to determine

12

on a financial level, and then PFM did a

13

financial analysis for the Trust to determine

14

savings rates and terms.

15

So in the case of CPS, we believe

16

that we have sufficient cash flow to fund

17

improvements based upon a 10 year term.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

I had questions on this

20

area as well that I think relate a bit to all

21

three of the categories, but since we're talking

22

about it now let me just -- what you're saying

23

is responsive to it.

24

You know, we hadn't heard from the

 46
1

City departments since December so some of this

2

is me trying to get a handle on whether you

3

received different information or what

4

additional information you may have.

5

My sense, Steve, is that a lot of

6

what we're doing is relying on information from

7

the City, but to the extent that it's

8

independently verified, you know, it would be

9

helpful to flush that out.

10

I remember the 2FM Department came

11

in and said that they had ESCOs that were doing

12

verification with regard to the 2FM projects,

13

but I don't think we heard that from Water

14

Management and then the schools.

15

So when you're talking about this

16

slide and the schools estimated savings, is that

17

from the Arcadis estimate or is it from Arcadis

18

plus others who have looked at the school

19

lighting savings?

20

MR. BEITLER:

Well, it's from CPS and

21

their consultants who I can't tell you who those

22

are at the moment.

23

it's from Arcadis at the request of us.

24

I don't remember.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

And then

So the Arcadis

 47
1

numbers as I understand them showed savings as

2

listed there, but really my question with regard

3

to the --

4

MR. BEITLER:

This is our savings

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right, the 2.17.

7

MR. BEITLER:

Yes, that's correct.

8

MF. HOFFMAN:

But in terms of the cost

5

9
10

number.

and what funding they're seeking, I'm confused
about that.

11
12

If you want to punt that until --

MR. BEITLER:

I'm sorry, when you say

cost, you mean?

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Meaning how much of

14

the -- when I say cost, that may have been the

15

wrong term.

16

seeking from this project and how much funding

17

we would be -- how much CPS funding we would be

18

including in the Retrofit.

19

I mean how much funding they're

The original number I think that we

20

were told with regard to these lights back in

21

December by CPS was 14 million.

22

the numbers that Arcadis had been using to

23

define the cost was 11 something and now it's

24

18.

Then I think

 48
1

And so I'm wondering where that

2

change in numbers comes from, number one, and

3

help us -- help us think about the CPS part of

4

this versus the other two because unlike the

5

other two, what we were told from CPS was that

6

the project of replacing the light bulbs was

7

almost all done when they met with us in

8

December and they expected it to be done in

9

February 2013.

10

So unlike the other two parts of

11

this, it feels like it's a project where CPS --

12

the money is out the door.

The work has been

13

done.

It looked like what

14

we were going to be asked to include in -- what

15

the schools was asking us to include in our

16

funding project was 11 million and now it's 18

17

million.

18

because those are both concerns.

19

It's been paid for.

So help us address those two things

MR. BEITLER:

So first the numbers

20

shift principally because of the amount of

21

rebates and grants, and the total amount of

22

rebates and grants to my knowledge were not all

23

static on any particular day.

24

So they, you know, apply for

 49
1

different rebates, they apply for different

2

grants and at different times they receive

3

responses as to whether or not they will receive

4

them, and so the numbers fluctuate based upon

5

how much in grants or rebates they will be

6

receiving as of a particular day.

7

So that doesn't -- I mean, I expect

8

that type of fluctuation in project finance.

9

don't think there's been anything unusual that

10

has occurred in that regard.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

general.

13

million.

14

I

You know.

That's kind of

I mean, it goes from 11 million to 18

MR. BEITLER:

Well, the 11 to 18 is a

15

different set of numbers.

16

the difference between the total set -- the

17

total final grants and rebate number and the

18

fact that the Chicago Public Schools have a

19

particular revenue recognition methodology and

20

that how they do revenue recognition, which I'm

21

not making a comment on about whether it's

22

proper or improper or anything like that, is

23

just the business of the Chicago Public Schools.

24

So the 11 to 18 is

So we as the Trust in support of

 50
1

them need to adopt our work on the basis of how

2

they conduct their finances, and so at the

3

moment they have not recognized revenue for the

4

7 million in rebates or grants.

5

it.

They don't have

They don't have it in hand.

6

So because they don't have it, we

7

are now asking -- we are asking for

8

approximately 20 million because that is to

9

cover the entire cost of the project plus other

10

expenses related to the project, and that number

11

could change if the CPS says to us okay, we've

12

received the rebates and grants and now we would

13

prefer to use a lower number.

14

that.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

They could do

Well, I don't think we

16

were called upon to make a decision on this

17

today.

18

all of us it should get more detailed

19

information on this if it's going to be included

20

in Retrofit because I think the numbers we've

21

gotten from CPS have been inconsistent, and it

22

starts with the fact that in their capital

23

budget a year ago, before we had even met, they

24

said we're going to be getting $40 million from

Let me just register a concern.

I think

 51
1

the Trust, which was impossible for them to say

2

because we hadn't even met yet.

3

And then it was, you know, we are

4

asking for $14 million with some, and this was

5

in December of 2012, with some information about

6

presumably grants that they had or if they were

7

going -- if the total cost of the project to

8

replace these light bulbs, which has already

9

happened, is 18 million, they will know whether

10
11

they received some of this money.
And so I would -- we're going to

12

need I think more detailed information from them

13

that's hard about what did your project cost,

14

how much have you received or do you know that

15

you're going to receive and what really do you

16

need if the Trust decides that we're going to

17

reimburse the schools for light bulbs that have

18

already been installed.

19

So I don't think we're called upon

20

to decide that today, but if we're called upon

21

to decide something like do we include this in

22

the retrofit next time, we need to get more

23

specific information.

24

MR. BEITLER:

Does that make sense?
Yes.

We do have specific

 52
1

information, and I do believe that the schools

2

are aware, you know, presumably of approximately

3

how much money they will be receiving or expect

4

to receive in rebates and that the project cost

5

is 11.2, the rebates are 7, the total project is

6

18.2.

7

The 44 million to which you're

8

referring basically is for two other projects in

9

addition to --

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

I know that when they

11

were presented, they gave us three projects.

12

This is just about the lighting.

13

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

So basically the

14

two other projects were dashboard and something

15

called retro commissioning which is calibration

16

of operating --

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

So if we have more

18

specifics -- Let me just be clear.

19

we are going to be called upon to say let's

20

include this, I will need, and I think we should

21

all receive, those specifics.

22

Next time if

If the money that they need to

23

reimburse them for the cost they have already

24

had is 11 million, then that's the maximum that

 53
1

should be put in.

2

MR. BEITLER:

I will work with the

3

Board to figure out what type of exhibit we need

4

in order to be as specific as possible.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Steve, what it gets

6

down to is what are they asking us to go out and

7

finance.

8

MR. BEITLER:

$18.2 million.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And how do they get to

10

that number, costs, rebates and how do they get

11

to that net?

12

now, but this is what we want to have so that we

13

can understand the flow as to, you know, how

14

they get down to their request.

15

I'm not asking you to answer this

And I'm assuming that they're going

16

to -- they want to do that so they can

17

reallocate that money to other projects that

18

would not be funded, something that we could go

19

out on.

20

I mean, what David is getting at is

21

we need to have an understanding and

22

appreciation of it, that's all.

23

we are going to say yea or nay but we ought to

24

know why we're doing it, and so that's what I

It's not like

 54
1

would ask that we go do is just simply

2

understand how they get to the request and then

3

why.

4

MR. BEITLER:

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

spent.

7

from.

8

We'll try to -That's money already

And that's where I think you're coming

MR. HOFFMAN:

And, Steve, look, what

9

we're going to hear shortly I think is going to

10

be a description of what some people, including

11

experts, think is an interesting, somewhat

12

novel, somewhat complicated perhaps approach to

13

financing.

14

And maybe it's exactly the right

15

answer, but I think what it's going to do

16

ultimately is it's going to force an even

17

greater scrutiny on what are these projects and

18

are they really a good idea.

19

this thought, okay?

20

Let me just finish

Maybe all these projects are

21

exactly -- are really great things, but the

22

schools one seems different than the other two

23

in a couple of respects.

24

already done.

Number one, it's

The light bulbs are already in.

 55
1

When I look at how the Water

2

Department is handling this, they came to us in

3

December and said we're going to need 75

4

million.

5

already spent 36 million on this project so we

6

don't need that.

7

$37 million.

8
9

Now they're coming and saying we have

What we need is only

The schools are doing the opposite.
They're saying we've already spent all of it and

10

we need all of it from you.

11

exactly how to assess that, but it raises an

12

eyebrow in my mind.

13

I don't know

So we're going to need more

14

information about that to determine does that

15

make any sense.

16

into this decision today, but I want you to be

17

aware that we're going to need to get a handle

18

on this.

19

And again we don't need to get

You know, the Tribune had a good

20

story today about how some of these light bulbs

21

that have been put into these schools that are

22

going to be closed apparently.

23

the lights are going to be off so the energy

24

savings are going to be a hundred percent.

Presumably then

 56
1

Well, if we enter into a deal that

2

obligates the schools to be paying out what they

3

expected to have in energy savings, isn't that a

4

worst deal with regard to the schools where it's

5

a hundred percent savings?

6

Now, I'm not expecting you to answer

7

that question.

8

burden is on the schools it seems to me.

9
10

The burden is not on you.

CHAIRMAN BELL:
MR. HOFFMAN:

The

Right.

But if we're going to

11

be asked to include it in there, I would expect

12

you to get that information from the schools or

13

the schools to come in front of us and tell us.

14

MR. BEITLER:

So, if I may, I think the

15

Board is raising a broader philosophical issue

16

which we haven't necessarily had to encounter

17

yet which is given in this particular project

18

we're doing financing as opposed to the actual

19

project, to what extent do we reach into our

20

agencies and get how much information from them

21

pertaining to their projects and their

22

engineering.

23

for that purpose, for the purpose of doing the

24

analysis for this project.

We don't need to be very far in

 57
1

For the second point, we actually

2

have had, just to reassure you, discussions

3

about whether or not there would be any schools

4

that were on a closing list.

5

that question was asked, the closing list did

6

not yet come out, and the Board of Ed knew --

7

did not know whether any of the schools would be

8

on the closing list.

9

At the time that

They were proceeding with their

10

project plans and retrofitting lighting in the

11

schools according to their project plan from an

12

engineering standpoint, and eventually a

13

decision was made on whether or not to close the

14

schools.

15

So we are putting up a data vault at

16

the moment for the purposes of our investors

17

looking at the data pertaining to these

18

projects.

19

available in that data vault, it will be

20

correctly displayed in terms of schools that are

21

open or schools that are closed.

22

When all of the data is ultimately

MR. HOFFMAN:

Let me just ask one more

23

follow-up because I do think all of this jumps

24

directly off of the first question that James

 58
1

asked which was what is the level of guarantee

2

or confidence or process that has been done to

3

confirm these savings because that's going to be

4

one of the critical things for investors.

5

Hang on.

Let me -- You say well,

6

you know, we have to decide how much data

7

we're going to be getting from them.

8

all, absolutely, we should be feeling free to

9

ask them for whatever we need to make our

10

First of

decision.

11

Second, more than that, and this is

12

not on you, this is for the City, our

13

expectation should be that we shouldn't have

14

to read about it in the Tribune if their

15

situation has changed, and if now some of the

16

schools they're asking about have closed, they

17

should be proactive providing us with that

18

information.

19

Another question that comes to mind

20

is if they've already put the light bulbs in, it

21

seems great that they put the light bulbs in in

22

general.

23

guess what, I would assume they did it to save

24

money and energy.

They put the light bulbs in.

Well,

 59
1

They have been getting monthly

2

bills.

They should have data already over the

3

last bunch of months that show what the savings

4

are.

5

what the savings are, and I'm sure investors

6

would want to see that.

That's the best data you can have about

7

We should have that too.

If you

8

haven't received that, I think it's incumbent

9

upon the City to provide that to you, and if you

10

haven't received it and you want to ask them, we

11

should.

12

So, again, I know these are

13

decisions for next time, not this time, but if

14

there's uncertainty in this regard, as there is

15

for me, we're going to need to see that level

16

of detail from them to justify why it's not only

17

a good project but a good project where some

18

sort of novel alternative financing is

19

appropriate.

20

MR. BEITLER:

So first there is a

21

significant amount of data that's available that

22

is being prepared for purposes of providing to

23

the investors; and, we can, of course, provide

24

access to the Board to the data room to review

 60
1

any data in there that you would care to review,

2

which includes all of the financial analyses

3

that impact on how we arrived at savings

4

numbers.

5

And, second, in terms of the work

6

that the staff and his representatives have

7

done, we have not just simply accepted the

8

savings number from other agencies, but, in

9

fact, the savings numbers that you're looking at

10

right now are not the same as the savings

11

numbers that were provided to us by other

12

agencies as we have asked questions regarding,

13

you know, what about this or what about that and

14

so on.

15

So we have done significant

16

analysis, and the savings numbers that are here

17

are based upon our analysis as opposed to the

18

analysis of the agencies that are involved in

19

this project.

20
21
22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

I want us to

keep going.
TREASURER NEELY:

23

question on this topic?

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Can I ask a quick

Let me make this

 61
1

comment first.

2

going to want to know a couple of things, that

3

there's an independent verification of the

4

revenue stream going to support the service of

5

the debt; and, secondly, we want to have a good

6

idea of what we're borrowing for.

7

Philosophically this Board is

It's clear on the other ones because

8

they haven't spent it.

9

project.

It's going to be on this

On this they've already spent the

10

money, and we want a sense of well, why are they

11

going out and financing it now because we want

12

to be able to answer that question.

13

You know, it may not be -- it may

14

not be something that we're going to influence,

15

but we do want to know that they are borrowing

16

the money because they got this other project

17

that they needed to do and they used that money

18

to put the lights in early.

19

I mean, philosophically we're going

20

to need that kind of info.

21

answer it now.

22

that that what's the Board expects.

23

TREASURER NEELY:

24

I don't want you to

I just want you to just know

And I'm not sure if

you have the answer to this question yet, but as

 62
1

we try to monetize this revenue stream, what is

2

the coverage the marketplace is asking for?

3
4

MR. BEITLER:

I don't have that answer

to that question.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We don't know.

6

TREASURER NEELY:

Do we know what the

7

coverage, and maybe, Steve, you know the answer

8

to what the coverage is in the municipal market

9

for it?

10
11

MR. BEITLER:

I don't know offhand what

that coverage is.

12

TREASURER NEELY:

I think that's an

13

analysis that we need to know, what the public

14

market versus the private market requires in

15

terms of coverage.

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes, definitely.

As we

17

look at the alternatives, we've got to -- we

18

have to have a way to sort through that the

19

alternatives that we came up with is the best

20

value for the City, and that can be a lot of

21

things.

22

Pricing is part of it.

Some it can

23

be to reduce what their reliance is on the

24

public market and start to open up other

 63
1

avenues, and there's a value to that, but we got

2

to make sure the pricing isn't so disparate that

3

that --

4

TREASURER NEELY:

In terms of pricing

5

also, it's coverage of how much money we're

6

actually pulling out and monetizing it.

7

different than pricing.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

TREASURER NEELY:

That's

I got it.
We might be getting

10

50 percent on the dollar versus 70 percent on

11

dollar.

12

So when we talk about $2.2 million in expected

13

savings, I'm just trying to get a sense of what

14

we're talking about after the coverage is

15

calculated.

That has to be part of the analysis.

16

MR. BEITLER:

Right.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

MR. SILVERS:

Yes.

This is a rather limited

19

point for the Board to consider, but the

20

experience of the AFL/CIO where I work with

21

retrofitting our headquarters building,

22

replacing the light bulbs was a key component of

23

what you would do and that it has the economic

24

characteristics that are appropriate for

 64
1

considering alternative financing because

2

essentially what it does is it generates an

3

energy savings that can be capitalized if you've

4

got your engineering right and if the

5

alternative financing provides better terms both

6

in terms of interest rate and coverage to

7

conventional financing.

8
9

Those are all big ifs that your
Board is appropriately discussing.

I just want

10

to make the point to you all that refinancing,

11

and I think refinancing is the appropriate term

12

for what you're discussing, refinancing light

13

bulb replacements with alternative financing may

14

turn out to be a wise and useful thing to do if

15

you get the right answers to all those

16

questions.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Right.

18

and we'll say that at the time.

19

MR. SILVERS:

Or it may not

Or it may not, but it's

20

just -- sort of conceptually it's an appropriate

21

thing to look at in the way that the Trust is

22

looking at it.

23
24

CHAIRMAN BELL:
comments on this page?

Okay.

Any other

 65
1

(No response.)

2

Okay.

Next page.

3

MR. BEITLER:

The next project is with

4

the Department of Water Management.

5

$73 million project requiring approximately

6

$40 million in funding and it has 4.6 million in

7

annual labor maintenance and energy savings of

8

which actually 1 million is energy savings and

9

the remainder is operations and maintenance, and

10

there's sufficient capital and fund improvements

11

based upon a 15 to 20 year term.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

It is a

Quick question along the

13

same lines as the other ones about verification.

14

There seems to be one difference here is, as

15

you've said, and I remember Tom Powers came and

16

told us this, that really the bulk of the

17

savings here are personnel.

18

70 percent.

19

It's maybe 50 to

I forget the numbers.
So we can think about, you know, how

20

do you normally -- how do investors normally

21

want to see some sort of verification of energy

22

savings.

23

it's 50 to 70 percent.

24

This is different, right?

Because

In terms of either what Arcadis has

 66
1

done or anyone else who's looked at this and

2

says here is the verification we can give of the

3

savings, what's your impression of where we are

4

and what information we have about that?

5

Is that in the same category as an

6

ESCO who says I can put a guarantee around this

7

level of savings?

8

is it just analogous and not the same?

9

How do we think about that or

MR. BEITLER:

Well, what we looked at

10

is where are the people going, for example.

11

many cases they are retiring and they're not

12

being replaced, so, in fact, you can ascertain

13

that savings are occurring.

14

City, for example, to reduce the Department of

15

Water's budget by X amount.

16
17

MR. HOFFMAN:

20

Now, it's up to the

Exactly.

I mean, how do

you guarantee that?

18
19

In

MR. BEITLER:
that.

Well, I don't guarantee

The City has to guarantee that.
MR. HOFFMAN:

So when we're talking

21

about what Arcadis or someone in that situation

22

is doing, how does that --

23
24

MR. BEITLER:

We can reflect what the

results will be if the City takes those

 67
1

actions.

2

MR. WINTERS:

Steve, if I could, what

3

Arcadis has done has been to evaluate what our

4

measurement of the savings has been to date to

5

get us to a point where we think it's prudent to

6

continue to proceed.

7

The next step in this is going to

8

the marketplace, and by the time that the

9

marketplace is done with this, all of these

10

questions will be answered in detail, but at

11

this point they're not.

12

We think we know what we're doing to

13

this point, but as Mr. Silvers just said and as

14

the Chairman just said, it may work, it may not.

15

We're still in the process of not only

16

collecting the data and analyzing the data but

17

also talking with the marketplace about what

18

level of data they're going to want, and I'm

19

certainly going to want everything that you

20

want.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that makes sense

22

to me, although one potential -- one additional

23

point is that you say we'll have all of the

24

questions answered before we go to the

 68
1

marketplace, but you also need -- I'm sorry, did

2

I misstate what you said?

3

MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

5

MR. WINTERS:

We had questions about

Go ahead.

6

whether it's prudent to continue to proceed, but

7

we don't know the answer to everything as yet.

8

We don't know precisely what the market is going

9

to tell us.

We have ideas and we want to

10

present some of those ideas to you in a few

11

minutes, but it's still very much a question.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

So just then to clarify

13

my thinking on this for the City, before the

14

Trust decides whether to agree to what the City

15

is proposing and maybe what Steve ultimately

16

agrees is recommended to us, before the Trust

17

agrees to that, we're going to need to see what

18

you said, you know, that's going to be flushed

19

out before it goes to the marketplace, we're

20

going to need to know the answer to well, how is

21

the City going to verify, guarantee or provide

22

some statements about what's going to happen in

23

the future about operations and maybe savings,

24

especially in the uncertain area of personnel

 69
1

spending.

2

So if the answer is we don't know

3

yet, that's fine, but I just think if we're

4

going to be asked at the next meeting -- Wait.

5

Wait, David.

6

MR. WINTERS:

The answer is we do know

7

well enough for the purposes that we have had to

8

date, and what we have done to date has been to

9

work with the Trust and with Steve and with

10

their counsel at Kirkland and with BFF and we

11

have collectively agreed that we have enough

12

knowledge to continue to proceed along these

13

lines.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

Would you mind

15

passing on that knowledge to me with regard to

16

Water Department operation savings?

17

MR. WINTERS:

We have Arcadis who will

18

give the numbers.

19

consistent with what the industry standard is,

20

and they've agreed that consistent with the

21

industry standards, there is a savings in there

22

that will support the escrows in the amounts

23

that we're looking for.

24

As we stated, they are

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm not sure I

 70
1

understood.

2

terms of what you just said, but the question is

3

how can there be -- since the City could say

4

yes, we're going to have fewer employees who

5

would work on this water plant and then the

6

Water Department budgeted --

7

I mean, I understood the general

MR. WINTERS:

Are you asking me if the

8

Water Department's budget is sufficiently

9

detailed to identify the individuals that will

10

be gone out of the budget from this particular

11

plant?

12

The answer is yes.
MR. HOFFMAN:

And then that would mean

13

that there would be fewer overall employees in

14

the Water Department and that's how --

15

MR. WINTERS:

That's correct.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that's the kind of

17

analysis that the City would need to do and be

18

communicating to potential investors to say

19

here's --

20

MR. WINTERS:

That's correct.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- how you can have

22

assurances that these will be real savings?

23

MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

Thanks.

 71
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And you can bet the

2

investors are going to have their own opinion of

3

that.

4

the team is saying is that we're comfortable now

5

that these savings can be reduced and we've done

6

enough independent verification to go to the

7

next step.

8

are going to weigh in on that.

9

MR. WALLACK:

They're going to challenge that.

What

We're not done because the investors

The investors are

10

ultimately certifying that they have asked the

11

questions they need to ask to feel comfortable,

12

and they're prepared to take the risk that the

13

estimates aren't wrong.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Sure.

But, I mean, look,

15

we're going to be discussing this, Jerry, when

16

we're talking about the slide that you have, but

17

the fact that an investor is willing to say this

18

is a deal we'll do, I'm not convinced that

19

that's the end of the analysis for us because if

20

the deal goes bad down the road and the

21

investors want to take some recourse against the

22

City or the Trust, we need to think about that

23

now.

24

So I wouldn't want to end the

 72
1

analysis with the investors will be satisfied

2

they'll have enough information.

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

4

heading down is no recourse, right?

5

MR. WINTERS:

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

7
8
9
10
11

I think the path we're

Yes.
So that's the

protection.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, that's an important

part of it.
ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, James.

From my experience too working in

12

the Budget Office with the City, there are

13

specific details within the City budget.

14

we have plenty of folks who worked on that that

15

will be sufficient in terms of demonstrating

16

that there is cost savings as detailed as a

17

specific line item with the title as well as

18

specific line items with maintenance that will

19

show or should show a reduction to accommodate

20

the savings as being predicted here.

I know

21

So you can physically look at the

22

budget and see that in year one there was ten

23

personnel budgeted, in year two there's eight.

24

That should be sufficient enough to support the

 73
1

savings that we're anticipating.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't want to belabor

3

this.

I think the obvious point is when light

4

bulbs are in, the light bulbs are in and you can

5

have a company come in and say here's what we

6

expect in savings given these factors.

7

When you're having fewer employees

8

you can say here is the budget for next year, we

9

can verify that next year's budget has the

10

savings.

11

after that or the year after that or the year

12

after that is going to include those savings

13

because the City government may decide we're

14

going to increase the funding of the Water

15

Department and then the savings that the

16

investors are relying on would go away.

17

What you can't verify is the budget

TREASURER NEELY:

That's like an annual

18

appropriation, so it will be priced if it's an

19

annual appropriation.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

And I understand if

21

that's the risk that gets priced by the

22

marketplace, then that's the risk, but that was

23

the source of my question which was is there

24

anything -- I assume the answer, which it sounds

 74
1

like, is no, there's nothing that's ESCO

2

equivalent that's being done to provide

3

assurance with regard to personnel savings but

4

that was what was behind the question.

5

understand that it's an appropriation risk.

6
7
8

10

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

I

Steve, next

project.
MR. BEITLER:

The next project is for

the Department of Fleet and Facility Management.
It's approximately $26 million in funding.

11

I should mention here that we had

12

three alternatives for the Department of Fleet

13

and Facility Management, sort of small, medium

14

and large, if you will, in terms of the numbers

15

of projects that were considered in each of the

16

three alternatives, and this particular number

17

represents the large project, which is the

18

maximum number of projects, that we could do

19

for the Department of Fleet and Facility

20

Management.

21

There's approximately $2 million in

22

new energy savings from these projects and

23

sufficient cash flow to fund the improvements

24

based upon a 20-year term.

 75
1

This project includes buildings like

2

City Hall, the Cultural Center and many other

3

major City buildings.

4

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any questions?

I'm

5

assuming you have a similar methodology to

6

ascertain these savings.

7

MR. BEITLER:

This particular project

8

is, in fact, where the three ESCOs did all of

9

the work.

10

ALDERMAN POPE:

Mr. Chairman.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

John.

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

Quick question.

Steve,

13

the overall project cost of this one?

14

$26 million in funding request of the Trust, but

15

do you recall the overall?

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24

You see

MR. BEITLER:

It's about 24.2 million I

MS. FERGUSON:

I'm sorry, the overall

believe.

cost is 24.2 but they're asking for 26 million?
MR. BEITLER:

There's other fees in

there for the ESCOs.
TREASURER NEELY:

This is 100 percent

for the Trust?
MR. BEITLER:

Yes.

 76
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

And they had come in

2

originally and asked for 30 something, so this

3

is actually decreased from when David Reynolds

4

was here.

5

seem like --

They were asking for more.

Does that

6

MR. BEITLER:

It was before my time.

7

MR. WINTERS:

That's correct.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

discussion.

Okay.

By the way, good

I mean, there's no point in going

10

through the rest of it if we can't get through

11

the first three pages.

12

MR. BEITLER:

So to date we've released

13

the RFQ.

14

and we received responses from the firms that

15

are on the chart in your book or on the screen

16

and came to the conclusion on a number of terms,

17

and the City, in particular, deciding what would

18

be acceptable for the City or would not be

19

acceptable for the City.

20

We also circulated a model term sheet

So if we go to the next page

21

basically we wound up with a set of potential

22

retrofit delivery models that run from being

23

publicly financed, to an alternative structure,

24

to be being privately financed and gauging those

 77
1

based upon the impact on balance sheet and

2

credit.

3

So you can see here a list of

4

considerations and potential benefits on each of

5

those methodologies.

6

down in the center from an alternative structure

7

perspective, and to assist us in addressing that

8

particular perspective and structure are David

9

Winters and Jerry Wallack who will go through

And largely the City came

10

the next couple of slides in terms of the

11

structure that they perform.

12
13

MR. WALLACK:

the Departments of Law and Finance --

14
15

MR. HOFFMAN:

MR. WALLACK:

20

Yes, Jerry Wallack and

Dennis --

18
19

Can you introduce

yourself, Jerry?

16
17

Basically we worked with

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We're bringing you a

mic.
MR. HOFFMAN:

And so you guys may not

21

know, we have a wonderful court reporter here

22

who actually creates a transcript of this that

23

gets posted, so if you gentlemen -- I see Jerry

24

your named is spelled there, but if you wouldn't

 78
1

mind spelling your names for her, that would be

2

great.

3

MR. WALLACK:

4

W-a-l-l-a-c-k, Jerry with a J.

5

Holsapple.

6

H-o-l-s-a-p-p-l-e.

7

Firm of Kutak, K-u-t-a-k, and Rock, R-o-c-k in

8

Chicago.

9

Jerry Wallack,
Dennis

Dennis normal way of spelling it,
We are partners in the Law

We were brought in by the

10

Departments of Law and Finance of the City to

11

bring our municipal finance expertise to the

12

public policy concerns of the City and the Trust

13

and CPS all of whom we have worked with over the

14

years, the City and CPS, in order to create a

15

financing model that hopefully will achieve

16

certain public policy goals, which I'll say in a

17

minute, but primarily we -- not to make a

18

judgment on the credit which are the questions

19

you were talking about whether savings are real

20

or not, these are things that relate to the

21

investment market and not the legal structure.

22

So we were looking at basically five

23

goals of the City in putting together a

24

financing structure which were inherent in the

 79
1

creation of CIT itself and all of the background

2

work.

3

First of all, the City wanted to

4

alleviate some of the risk off of its budget

5

from a general obligation point of view, and we

6

were lead to believe that financing these

7

projects, given the limited budget resources,

8

necessitated a new approach that wasn't tax

9

based.

10

Second, not to surrender ownership

11

or control of the assets.

The City wants to

12

continue to own these assets.

13

assets.

14

to pledge them.

They're public

It needs to maintain and run them, not

15

Third, to create a public/private

16

partnership in a way by shifting risk and not

17

ownership, so how to shift some of the risk

18

away from the taxpayers into the private market,

19

whether that's through investments or

20

otherwise.

21

context.

22

That's what ESCOs do also in the 2FM

Then structurally how to blend

23

disparate credits.

You had three different

24

payment streams here as you've been going

 80
1

through these projects, and you can see that the

2

CPS is one versus the ESCO backed 2FM project

3

versus the personnel related Water Department.

4

Another gloss on the Water

5

Department that is in there is that the water

6

system is financed through a very complicated

7

bond structure which as I look back on it

8

historically we were involved in financing the

9

second lien years ago and now we're up to the

10
11

sixth lien.
There is kind of a flow of funds of

12

water revenues that are grabbed by different

13

bondholder groups over time.

14

capitalize the residual stream there?

15

How do you

And then how to take advantage of

16

tax exemptions which is really our forte is

17

tax-exempt bonds and how to try to get debt from

18

the market, the benefit of tax exemption and the

19

structure that kind of went through you where

20

you're not really a governmental body, you're

21

kind of a quasi governmental body, but you're

22

not a political subdivision of the City.

23
24

So taking all of those concerns
together, we worked with the City departments

 81
1

and they are more knowledgeable and David is

2

more knowledgeable about all the background here

3

and the verification of savings.

4

But we set out to create a revenue

5

obligation, not a general obligation, and one

6

that would be limited recourse to the City and

7

CPS.

8

aggregating the Water Department and 2FM for

9

this purpose, but they would be separate

10

obligations and separate savings streams.

When we speak of the City, we're just

11

So we started with that, how to

12

create an obligation that preserved tax

13

exemptions and with limited recourse that could

14

get through to the credit market and get a blend

15

of credits of the three entities.

16

And what we came up, you'll see on

17

the next slide when you flip your books, which

18

is kind of a simplified version of a flow chart,

19

we have CIT making loans to these three

20

entities.

21

These are limited recourse loans to

22

the three entities payable solely from the

23

savings, whatever that is denominated to be.

24

the case of 2FM, the intention was that the

In

 82
1

savings would have a pass through of the ESCO

2

payments that underlie it.

3

The City wanted to keep ESCO kind of

4

outside the financing because of the -- they

5

don't really want the investment market having

6

to go and diligence, you know, the different

7

ESCO providers.

8

to take the risk that the ESCO would pay the

9

City the money that was promised and the City

You know, the City was willing

10

basically would pay savings that were based upon

11

the projections that the ESCOs were

12

guaranteeing.

13

Then separately a risk shifting

14

mechanism was the City believes that there's

15

room for private indemnity of a portion of the

16

risk, so almost like an insurance policy that

17

would take a portion of the savings risk that

18

would be there, and the City would arrange that

19

and CPS would arrange that with private

20

entities.

21

I don't know who those entities are

22

other than they talk about various -- David

23

could say who they are if he wanted to, but

24

various funds and, you know, public trusts.

 83
1
2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

It's like an insurance

policy and they would have to pay for it?

3

MR. WALLACK:

It's like an insurance

4

policy that the City would pay a premium from

5

the savings for and it would transfer maybe --

6

it would create what we call in the bond world a

7

debt service reserve.

8
9
10

TREASURER NEELY:

risk profile because this is (unintelligible)
revenue bonds?

11

MR. WALLACK:

12

TREASURER NEELY:

13

Would it increase the

Yes, it would.
So it's like a bond

insurance.

14

MR. WALLACK:

Exactly, but it's

15

limited.

It's not a hundred percent.

It's

16

basically like -- in the discussions it was like

17

take the top 10 percent of the risk that there

18

might be a shortfall and the savings that would

19

project and then give the note back to the

20

indemnitor that would be payable from the future

21

savings when they were realized.

22

And before you even got to that,

23

there would be an aggregation of any savings

24

that weren't capitalized into the debt already,

 84
1

so you would be creating not only a payment

2

obligation from the savings stream, but say the

3

savings stream was supposed to be $5 a year --

4

TREASURER NEELY:

5

MR. WALLACK:

6

TREASURER NEELY:

7

MR. WALLACK:

I've done public

I've done it for 34.

TREASURER NEELY:

Is it a debt service

reserve fund?

12

MR. WALLACK:

Actually it's not going

13

to funded with cash.

14

the guarantee of the loan payments.

15

TREASURER NEELY:

16

It

must have been those other nine years.

10
11

Okay.

finance for 25 years so --

8
9

You lost me.

It's going to be basically

But you said

something about 10 percent.

17

MR. WALLACK:

Well, the City was

18

talking about an amount that would be the

19

exposure of a certain number of dollars.

20

MR. SILVERS:

21

loss up to 10 percent, right?

22

MR. WALLACK:

23

way.

24

years.

It would be first dollar

Exactly.

That's a better

You must have been there for those nine

 85
1

MR. SILVERS:

Not one day.

2

MR. WALLACK:

But, yes, he's stating

3

it, basically a first loss reserve in the form

4

of a guarantee.

5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13

MR. SILVERS:

I have a second question

MR. HOFFMAN:

Damon, can you speak up

for you.

just a little bit?
MR. SILVERS:

Oh, I'm sorry, I'm

turning the wrong way.
MR. HOFFMAN:

No, no, you're turning

the right way, I just can't hear you.
MR. SILVERS:

I have a second question

14

for you in terms of what you're describing.

15

the credit insurance, the first dollar loss

16

credit insurance that you're describing, and I

17

know that legally it cannot be in the form of an

18

insurance policy, but that's economically.

19

If that's being paid for out of the

20

savings realized, what happens if

21

catastrophically there are no savings?

22

If

MR. WALLACK:

What we've been told, and

23

of course this is not something that we don't

24

make a credit analysis, but what we've been told

 86
1

they have been looking at it, it's almost like a

2

term amount after the debt is paid.

3

So they would give a note back to

4

the indemnity provider.

5

payable from future savings.

6

there was $6 of savings but only $5 of debt

7

service, they would pay the note, the indemnitor

8

back.

9

That note would be
So if in year two

If the indemnitor didn't get paid

10

back at the end, then when this debt is

11

ultimately retired, then future savings would

12

pay the indemnitor back and if not --

13

TREASURER NEELY:

14

MR. WALLACK:

(Unintelligible).

Until they're paid back.

15

They are making an advance to pay the debt

16

service and getting reimbursed on a deferred

17

basis.

18

MR. SILVERS:

I'm not sure I follow.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm not sure I follow

20

either, but just to clarify one point.

21

understand what we have is one power point slide

22

and then a graph so obviously this needs to get

23

flushed out.

24

MR. WALLACK:

Look, I

I didn't get out of the

 87
1
2

first box yet.
MR. HOFFMAN:

The indemnity or the

3

insurance, the quasi insurance policy or

4

whatever we're talking about here, would the

5

obligation of these third parties who would be

6

coming in if the savings didn't provide enough

7

money to pay the investors, would the obligation

8

that would be contemplated that they would only

9

be responsible for paying a portion of the

10

shortfall?

11

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

So to the question that

13

was just asked, if there are close to no savings

14

there still, even with this indemnity or

15

insurance fund, they're still contemplated there

16

would be a significant shortfall to the

17

investors.

18

MR. SILVERS:

Let me just be clear.

19

The question I was asking was not the question

20

of ultimately -- of who ultimately would bear

21

the loss in case the policy is called upon, if

22

the guarantee is called upon.

23

My question was if we're paying the

24

premium, if the Trust is paying the premium for

 88
1

to 10 percent --

2

MR. FALK:

3

MR. WALLACK:

The borrower would be

MR. KLEEMAN:

The City is paying for

4

paying.

5
6

the premium.

7
8

No.

TREASURER NEELY:

That's another cost

that has to be layered in.

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

MR. SILVERS:

Right.

Exactly.

So the City is paying the

11

premium for that 10 percent guarantee and

12

therefore it's not being paid for out of the

13

savings.

14

pay that premium.

The City has an absolute commitment to

15

MR. KLEEMAN:

Correct.

16

MR. SILVERS:

That answers my question.

17

Then the concern I was raising is not -- I'm

18

satisfied.

19

MR. WALLACK:

The nature of the

20

reimbursement to the indemnity provider is

21

outside of the scope of what we've discussed,

22

whether it's payable solely from savings or

23

whether there's some other thing the City is

24

going to use to make the indemnitors --

 89
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

But, Jerry, just to

2

clarify.

I mean, we're in the weeds on this,

3

but there's two different things here.

4

said reimbursement, but I think the question

5

was about basically the fee, that even if

6

they're never asked to pay anything on the

7

guarantee, the City is going to be paying

8

basically a fee --

You

9

MR. WALLACK:

Facility fee, yes.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- for the guarantee to

11
12

be in place.
MR. SILVERS:

But the concern I was

13

raising was circularity, was that you're buying

14

insurance against the possibility that there are

15

no savings, but you're using the savings to pay

16

for the insurance.

17

If you're paying for the insurance

18

out of some other source, my concern is

19

resolved.

20

I think means that you're paying --

21

And the lawyers are all nodding which

MR. WALLACK:

I think there's two

22

answers to that.

One, it probably will have to

23

be paid out of some other source; but, two,

24

they're trying to program into the cash flow a

 90
1

fee to pay for it and to repay it if it's drawn

2

upon would be payable not only from other

3

sources but only if -- it's also not just meant

4

to cover a shortfall, it's meant to cover

5

fluctuations.

6
7

TREASURER NEELY:

But I still go back

it's up to 10 percent.

8

MR. WALLACK:

9

TREASURER NEELY:

10

MR. WALLACK:

I don't know.
Well, you said that.

That's what we were told.

11

Okay?

12

first loan loss reserve of a limited amount from

13

private parties as a way to shift some of the

14

risk.

15

We were told that they're looking at a

MR. HOFFMAN:

And, Jerry, when you say

16

we were told, I mean, I just -- I think I

17

understand what you're saying, but just to

18

clarify, your clients are -- your client is the

19

City.

20

guys were just brought into this relatively

21

recently, right?

You're talking to City departments.

You

22

MR. WALLACK:

Yes, fairly recently.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

A week or two ago?

24

MR. WALLACK:

Fairly recently.

 91
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

And so -- I mean, I

2

think this is all a completely good and

3

appropriate process, I'm just trying to clarify

4

what it is.

5

City departments as they're trying to figure out

6

what they want to recommend, and that's what

7

you're describing?

8
9

You're getting information from

MR. WALLACK:

We've met extensively

with the CFO, the director of debt for the City,

10

the Comptroller's Office, the Finance

11

Department, the Law Department a number of times

12

where they presented their economics of how they

13

would like to do this.

14

The concept of paying debt service

15

reserve, whether funded with cash or with

16

instruments such as this, was presented.

17

decided to put it as a first loan loss guarantee

18

on each note that would be coming from the three

19

entities and that repayment of that -- payment

20

of the fees for that would be programmed into

21

the cash flow or would come from some other

22

source, and repayment of draws on that facility

23

would come from future savings if they were

24

there, but if that turned out not to be

It was

 92
1

marketable would have to be backed up by some

2

other unnamed source.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

But just to be -- I mean,

4

because we're in the weeds on this important

5

discussion, and you say I don't know, it's

6

because this is still in development with

7

regard to some of the key details, is that fair

8

to say?

9

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

10

MR. WINTERS:

The marketplace will

11

provide a lot of these answers.

12

MR. WALLACK:

That's what I was going

13

to say mostly is that they are not at the point

14

of negotiating with actual parties.

15

more conceptual structural terms that they plan

16

to now go to parties who they've had some

17

preliminary discussions with who would be

18

interested in doing this, kind of hammer out the

19

details.

20
21

MR. HOFFMAN:

These are

And when you say they

plan to go to those parties, you mean the City?

22

MR. WALLACK:

City Finance Department.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

24

involve the Trust at all?

So does that

 93
1
2
3

MR. WINTERS:

Of course.

Steve and I

talk every day.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I certainly know

4

you do, but I'm just reacting to Jerry's point

5

that the City -- look, we can address those

6

issues with the City, and I know that you

7

guys -- that your firm is relatively new in this

8

process and you're trying to provide what is

9

excellent expertise about what might be an

10
11

alternative financing structure.
I just want to be, you know -- let's

12

be -- let's be sharing information about what

13

the process has been which is that there's been

14

extensive talks before you arrived for months

15

with the City, with Steve and the Trust with an

16

RFQ issued to try to get information and there

17

was another -- there were rounds of discussions

18

with the respondents to the RFQ.

19

Things seemed to be heading in a

20

certain direction that Kirkland and Steve were

21

working with the City on something, and then I

22

think it's a beneficial development that the two

23

of you or your firm was brought in, and we have

24

this now new concept that was provided to Steve

 94
1

and the Trust advisors Tuesday evening and we're

2

walking down this road to see what this -- how

3

this concept gets flushed out.

4

So that's my understanding of what's

5

happened.

I think that's part of this good

6

process of brainstorming, figuring things out,

7

but it's all -- we now have sort of a three or

8

four-day old concept that you're starting to

9

explain, and I think some of it is going to need

10

some more time to get flushed out.

11

with that?

12

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

Do you agree

This is not unusual

13

in a municipal transaction because to be at a

14

preliminary stage where you go to a board and

15

you present a concept, the board listens and

16

asks questions to try to understand what's going

17

on, and then the financing team, whatever that

18

is, goes back and spends a substantial amount of

19

time, you know, putting it in the shape where

20

the financial advisors, investment bankers and

21

others, the finance people then go out and

22

implement the types of things, negotiate term

23

sheets and flush out.

24

Then you come back to the board with

 95
1

the deal and the board understands that again

2

before it votes on it.

3

It's just like the question you were

4

asking about the CPS light bulbs at the

5

beginning.

6

analysis and discussion with CPS about where the

7

money is being spent, you know, every dollar in

8

order to gain tax-exempt debt, the IRS requires

9

that, and, you know, certifications and things

10
11

There will be a complete tax

would be disqualified or qualified.
We're not at that point yet.

12

haven't been given that opportunity.

13

the structuring of the deal stage.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

We

We're at

To be clear, when you say

15

come back with a deal, it may be -- we don't

16

know what the investor appetite is for any of

17

this in part because some of the details haven't

18

been worked out on what's going to be

19

communicated to the investors, in part because

20

this concept hasn't yet been -- we haven't yet

21

asked potential investors.

22

we just don't know and we have to go down -- the

23

request is --

24

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

So is it fair to say

 96
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- let's go down this

2

road and figure out more about the investor

3

appetite.

4

MR. WALLACK:

Yes and no.

I think the

5

Department of Finance has, through its

6

experience in these things and through talking

7

to whoever it talks to on an informal basis,

8

kind of not just throwing this out there to see

9

if it sticks, I think that they have enough

10

substance in back of it to think this is an

11

idea.

12
13
14
15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is the Department of

Finance here?
MR. WINTERS:

They are otherwise

engaged today.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

That's fine.

But

17

the City, to press that point, the City believes

18

that this is going to be well accepted by the

19

marketplace or --

20

MR. WINTERS:

We do.

21

MR. HOFFMAN:

-- is my impression, we

22
23
24

just don't know?
MR. WINTERS:
appetite for it.

We think there will be an

 97
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

And what's that based on?

2

MR. WINTERS:

It's based on what Jerry

3

just described.

4
5

MR. HOFFMAN:
experience of Lois?

6
7

Is that the idea?

MR. WINTERS:

Lois and, you know,

commissioners, and I know you know this, but --

8
9

In other words, the

CHAIRMAN BELL:
see.

Well, we'll see.

We'll

Because the other thing we haven't said

10

that in this construct, the investor is going to

11

take 90 percent of the risk if their savings

12

don't materialize, correct?

13

MR. WINTERS:

That's correct.

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

15

MS. FERGUSON:

So we'll see.
Can I ask one clarifying

16

question on this?

The concept of a debt service

17

reserve, of course, is not new, and the concept

18

of some sort of bond insurance type structure is

19

not new, but what you're describing it sounds

20

like is the provider of that insurance is a new

21

private party.

22

MR. WINTERS:

23

MS. FERGUSON:

24

this that's novel?

Yes.
And that's the part of

 98
1
2

MR. WALLACK:

Yes, that's exactly

right.

3

MS. FERGUSON:

Can you characterize the

4

type of party you're envisioning would be this

5

private provider?

6

MR. WALLACK:

No.

7

MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

8

MS. FERGUSON:

9
10

yes.

He says no and he says

I like your answer better.

I like John's

answer better.

11

MR. WINTERS:

There are a variety of --

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

David, can you speak up a

13

little bit because she's having trouble hearing

14

you.

15

MR. WINTERS:

Sure.

16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you very much.

17

MR. WINTERS:

There are a variety of

18

people that there have been discussions with

19

dealing with facilities foundation, for

20

instance, as one of the parties that we want to

21

engage with.

22

about how they might possibly help us assemble

23

the sum of either notes or cash that we're

24

looking for.

You have heard the discussions

 99
1

And so there are labor unions that

2

have expressed interest in working with us to

3

that effect.

4

also foundations, and those would be who we're

5

talking with.

Those would be the type -- and

6

MS. FERGUSON:

7

MR. SILVERS:

Thank you.
Can I just ask a question

8

that might be perceived as a little skeptical?

9

I just want to express the view that there's a

10
11

lot of logic to what you're talking about.
If you're going to go to public

12

market -- public credit companies for a

13

structure of this kind, it could very well be

14

the case that it would be possible to explain

15

the savings and get comfort with those savings

16

with a private guarantor who then is recognized

17

by the public markets as creditworthy, right,

18

and thereby create genuine savings because of

19

this information I assume that you're getting

20

that exists, that the public markets are not

21

going to feel comfortable going through all the

22

kind of details that we went into, not feel

23

comfortable that they really understand.

24

A private guarantor who's

 100
1

creditworthy may be able to do that.

2

a real economic benefit to that, we don't know

3

obviously.

4

financing an innovative operational exercise

5

that we're going through, this idea makes a lot

6

of sense at least to me.

7

If there's

But that for the type of innovative

MR. HOFFMAN:

Jerry, can I get -- I

8

think when we went on this side track which was

9

important and a lot of time on the reserve fund,

10

part of what you were in the midst of describing

11

was putting aside the reserve fund, the sort of

12

core elements of the structure, and I want to

13

make sure you get back to that and are able to

14

fully describe that.

15

I like this slide, but I also like

16

the prior slide, so feel free to tell Steve to

17

toggle back and forth if you want.

18

MR. WALLACK:

Steve, toggle back.

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

I want to make sure

20

there's a full flushing out from your expertise

21

about what this structure is.

22

MR. WALLACK:

Okay.

If we didn't, and

23

we flipped before, I didn't feel I was at

24

liberty to answer the question because we're not

 101
1

supposed to talk about financial things.

2

In any case, the basic elements here

3

are a loan structure from CIT to the three

4

entities, each of the loans being represented by

5

a note.

6

will have an interest component which will be

7

tax exempt to the extent that the property

8

finance qualifies for tax exemption.

9

The note will represent debt.

The note

And part of establishing the tax

10

exemption is to investigate all the uses of the

11

property and all the uses of the money to

12

finance the property.

13

So your question about if it's

14

otherwise paid for has two answers in the tax

15

world.

16

can reimburse expenses that have been already

17

paid for and still for IRS purposes treat it as

18

essentially a new bond.

19

I can get off on a tangent.

One is you

On the other hand, if you've been

20

given money to pay for something and you've paid

21

for it, then the question becomes if you get

22

more money, what are you doing with it and

23

that's argues that it's working which has

24

different meanings.

 102
1

So we have to get to that as part of

2

the next step of asking the questions that you,

3

David, are asking which is in each structure

4

what's the money used for and is it qualified

5

property.

6

That's kind of the side show to the

7

structure because you could do this with taxable

8

debt as well as tax exempt.

9

cost structure of whether the ultimate investor

10

It's a borrowing

will value the tax exemption.

11

So we're creating a structure at the

12

request of the Department of Finance that allows

13

it to be tax exempt and allows it to be passed

14

through up to the ultimate investors.

15
16

So the concept -MR. HOFFMAN:

I have a question on the

17

tax exempt point you were just making.

I think

18

I follow you and not as a tax lawyer.

19

saying that even if the payments are coming from

20

the investor to the Trust, a nongovernmental

21

entity, who is then providing those payments

22

back to the City pursuant to the note or

23

pursuant to the loan agreement, that those

24

payments from an investor to a nongovernment

You're

 103
1

entity could be considered tax exempt because

2

the ultimate recipient and the ultimate use of

3

them is for a public entity.

4

MR. WALLACK:

5

That's two questions.

6

proceeds of selling the notes, securitizing the

7

notes, which is what we're doing with the notes

8

when we put them into a trust, is we basically

9

break them up into the trust and sell those to

10
11

Well, it goes two ways.
The application of the

public investors.
That's a pass through entity for tax

12

purposes so that the people who are ultimately

13

purchasing the investment are really buying an

14

interest in an underlying municipal obligation,

15

the notes that evidence the loan obligation.

16

The payments upwards on those loans,

17

which would be tax exempt to the payee, are

18

assigned or transferred to those investors so

19

that they are for tax purposes deemed to be the

20

owners of the underlying City note, the 2FM

21

note, the DP -- Department of Water, DPM note,

22

the CPS note.

So, yes, the middle of the chart

23

is a conduit.

It doesn't affect the tax status.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that's the theory.

 104
1

It's not known for sure at this point but that's

2

the theory to pursue about what it can be.

3

MR. WALLACK:

That's the law.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

So these will be tax

6

MR. WALLACK:

Depending on what the

7

property financed is.

8

municipal improvements like we've been told when

9

we got down to dotting the Is and crossing the

5

10

exempt?

If we're financing

Ts, yes, the property will be tax exempt.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

12

structure you are proposing is.

13

MR. WALLACK:

14
15
16
17

That's what the

That's the structure.

That's what we were -CHAIRMAN BELL:

Otherwise there's no

point in doing it.
MR. WALLACK:

We, like you guys, we do

18

an investigation.

19

If it turns out that the money was being used

20

for something else, it wouldn't necessarily have

21

the same tax stream.

22

for infrastructure improvements that are

23

publicly used, it will be tax exempt.

24

We want to see it on paper.

Assuming that it's used

The idea here is for CIT as an

 105
1

intermediary basically to lend the money it gets

2

from sellers from securitizing the municipal

3

notes on a limited recourse basis payable from

4

the savings, however they are quantified,

5

ultimately to private investors who are able to

6

evaluate the risks here where the City has

7

created and CPS had created some kind of

8

protection of a limited nature with privately

9

organized indemnification arrangements.

10

TREASURER NEELY:

I have a quick

11

question.

So the potential investors, their

12

cost of borrowing would be at whatever their

13

bothering rate probably would be higher than the

14

City because they are not public, and then we

15

would blend -- the CTI would blend at a tax

16

exempt rate.

17

MR. WALLACK:

18

TREASURER NEELY:

19
20
21

Exactly.

arbitrage position?
MR. WALLACK:

You're going to lend as a

pass through whatever the blended rate is.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

TREASURER NEELY:

24

Isn't that a negative

Jerry, speak up, please.
But the people who

are investing, their cost of bothering in theory

 106
1
2
3
4

would be higher than the City's.
MR. WALLACK:

Why?

They're buying tax

exempt -TREASURER NEELY:

Because their cost of

5

borrowing is higher because they don't borrow at

6

a tax-exempt rate.

7
8
9

MR. WALLACK:

Then they might not be

the people you want to sell this to.
TREASURER NEELY:

But in general

10

municipalities have a lower cost of borrowing

11

because of their tax exempt status of

12

borrowing.

13

MR. WALLACK:

This would be tax exempt.

14

TREASURER NEELY:

Okay.

Maybe I'm just

15

confused because if we're saying that people who

16

are potentially investing, their cost of

17

borrowing is going to be higher than the City's

18

just by the nature because municipalities'

19

tax-exempt rates are lower.

20

with that, the tax-exempt rates are lower

21

than tax --

22

MR. WALLACK:

Would you agree

It's a tax-exempt bond,

23

just like any other tax-exempt bond.

If the

24

investor has tax liability that can protect

 107
1

against by buying a tax-exempt investment --

2

TREASURER NEELY:

I guess I'm saying

3

the rate that we'll be getting from our

4

investment is a higher rate.

5
6

MR. WALLACK:

higher rate because it's a revenue obligation.

7
8

You'll be getting a

TREASURER NEELY:

Is that taking an

arbitrage position?

9

MR. WINTERS:

We are cognizant of the

10

possibility that we're creating a higher rate

11

than we would over our general obligation bonds.

12
13

MR. WALLACK:

it's limited obligation.

14
15
16

If that's your question,

TREASURER NEELY:

Why are we willing to

do that?
MR. WINTERS:

We're willing to do that

17

to be able to do the projects that we intend to

18

do with this money or to reimburse the projects

19

that we did, and we're willing to do it because

20

this is a way that we can take the savings, not

21

tax dollars, and put them to work in

22

infrastructure, and that's the whole point.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can I ask --

24

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Damon?

 108
1

MR. SILVERS:

Yeah, I want to follow

2

this up a little bit because this is the

3

critical trade off in what infrastructure is

4

doing.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can I just pause for a

6

second?

I'm not sure if anyone in the back can

7

hear.

8

speak up I know for the reporter and everyone

9

else.

10

you.

Can I ask just ask everyone involved to

It's a little bit of a big room.

Thank

Sorry, David.

11

MR. SILVERS:

I'll just repeat myself.

12

This is the critical trade off that this Trust

13

is always going to be faced with is the trade

14

off between freeing up access to capital that

15

might not otherwise be available for projects of

16

important public benefit against the possibility

17

that sometimes the structures are going to have

18

higher cost of capital than if you went simply

19

with general obligation of the City.

20

TREASURER NEELY:

21

revenue.

22

City.

23
24

But I'm saying

I didn't say general obligation of the

MR. SILVERS:

Well, it might be that a

bond issued by the Trust as a new entity might

 109
1

be more expensive than a revenue bond.

2

know.

I don't

That's a revenue bond issued by the City.

3

MR. WALLACK:

I think the answer to

4

that question is the nature of the revenue

5

stream.

6

quality of the revenue stream being determined

7

by savings.

8

and --

9

What makes it more expensive is the

If the savings are speculative

TREASURER NEELY:

I guess I disagree

10

with you on that.

I'll take the mic.

11

because the City can borrow the tax-exempt rate

12

and non municipalities can't.

13

debatable.

MR. WALLACK:

15

understand what your point is.

17

That's not

That's a fact.

14

16

Only

Okay, but I don't

TREASURER NEELY:

David has already

said that they are willing to take that risk.

18

MR. WALLACK:

They are borrowing at a

19

tax-exempt rate.

20

rate, whether it's 3 percent versus 4 percent,

21

is determined by the risk associated with the

22

payment.

23
24

The level of the tax-exempt

It's a different question.
TREASURER NEELY:

Who is "they"?

is "they" in that sentence?

Who

 110
1

MR. WALLACK:

The City.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think Stephanie is

3

saying that the investor's borrowing cost.

4

investor has to borrow money in order to fund

5

this.

6

It may be that their payments on this count as

7

tax-exempt payments, but that they can't borrow.

8

I think that's where she's going with

9

The

They can't borrow at a tax-exempt rate.

MR. WALLACK:

this.

Every bond purchaser who

10

buys a bond, whether it's from the City or

11

Boeing or anybody else, to the extent they don't

12

have free cash sitting in the bank, borrows at a

13

cost to finance and their rate of return on that

14

investment, which from their point of view

15

they're arbitraging the money, so I'm borrowing

16

it and I'm going to buy a City investment which

17

has a tax return of X is going to be determined

18

by the tax status of the investment whether I

19

have income to offset it and the likelihood of

20

me being repaid.

21

The likelihood of being repaid here

22

is not as great as if it was a general

23

obligation of the City.

24

enjoy the same tax status as instruments of

They're both going to

 111
1

municipalities.

The cost of an investor

2

borrowing money to purchase that investment or

3

to fund a loan is going to be the same to them.

4

It's really a risk return issue.

5

MR. SILVERS:

6

back to you if you don't mind?

7

MR. WALLACK:

8
9

Jerry, can I read that

Maybe you can do it

better than I can.
MR. SILVERS:

Maybe.

I mean, you're

10

telling us that the obligations that will be

11

sold to the public as a result of this structure

12

would be tax exempt in your opinion?

13

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

14

MR. SILVERS:

The difference would be

15

that the issuer of the obligations and their

16

revenue obligations are based on a cash flow

17

statement, not a general obligation?

18

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

19

MR. SILVERS:

The difference between --

20

potentially in terms of what we have to -- what

21

this structure would have to pay in terms of the

22

cost of borrowing is largely going to be a

23

function of the fact that this is the Trust

24

issuing these bonds, issuing revenue bonds and

 112
1

not the City issuing revenue bonds.

2

MR. WALLACK:

No.

3

MR. KLEEMAN:

No.

4

MR. WALLACK:

The issuer of the tax

5

exempt obligation is really the City.

6

credit quality of the repayment that will affect

7

the rate.

8

MR. SILVERS:

It's the

And the credit quality of

9

the repayment is the function of the projects,

10

is a function of the liabilities, the cash flow

11

stream.

12

MR. WALLACK:

It's a function --

13

Exactly.

14

designating as the source, the limited source of

15

funds.

16

It's a function of what you are

The difference between the general

17

obligation and the special limited obligation is

18

the breath of the cash flow to pay it.

19

no tax base supporting this.

20

MR. SILVERS:

There's

So this structure is not

21

creating a higher -- in your view is unlikely to

22

create a higher cost of capital than a simpler

23

structure because of what you just said, because

24

the fundamental issue is the quality of the cash

 113
1
2

flow that's coming in.
MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

The judgment made

3

by the Department of Finance of CPS and others

4

has to be that the cost of capital here is worth

5

the relief from the general obligation.

6

MR. SILVERS:

And I'm coming to that.

7

So my next question to you is this, and this I

8

think goes to what Stephanie was asking, which

9

is the investors, people who buy these bonds,

10

are people who buy tax exempt bonds normally,

11

largely high net worth individuals with high tax

12

liability.

13
14
15
16
17

MR. WALLACK:

These would be

institutions -MR. SILVERS:

These would be

institutions.
MR. WALLACK:

Credit investors and

18

whether the city, CIT or others can open up new

19

investor markets is not my question.

20
21
22

MR. SILVERS:

It's the same pool of

institutions.
MR. WALLACK:

Yes, people who buy tax

23

exempt municipal bonds or institutions that buy

24

it, whether it's for the treasuries or for funds

 114
1
2

will be the ones.
MR. SILVERS:

Do you have a view coming

3

back to the slide that we went through a couple

4

places before where you basically say that there

5

is a cost of capital trade off between this

6

rather sophisticated structure and a simple

7

public borrowing.

8

MR. WALLACK:

Yes.

9

MR. SILVERS:

Do you have a view as to

10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

what that trade off is?
MR. WALLACK:

No.

The market is going

to tell us that.
CHAIRMAN BELL:

The market is going to

tell us that.
MR. SILVERS:

We don't have a guess

right now?
MR. WALLACK:

The market is going to

18

tell us that.

The City and particularly the

19

treasurer would know the cost of borrowing on a

20

GO basis, but I believe, and I'll pass it to

21

David to answer this --

22

TREASURER NEELY:

You keep saying GO.

23

You can issue revenue bonds also.

24

supposed to be off balance sheet.

This is

 115
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

And let me join Stephanie

2

in that question.

3

bonds.

4

than anyone sitting at the table or Stephanie or

5

probably a lot of people in this room.

6

There's general obligations

I know far less about public financing

But there's general obligation

7

bonds, there's revenue bonds, there's asset

8

backed securities, but this looks like a revenue

9

bond, and one question would be -- I guess

10

there's two questions.

11

One, therefore, isn't that going to

12

be the relevant comparison; and number two, why

13

can't the City do exactly what we're describing

14

and either, let me finish the question, and

15

either issue a revenue bond or if you want to do

16

some sort of other alternative structure, do it

17

in the exact same way?

18

MR. WALLACK:

I have an answer.

19

going to sound sarcastic but it's not.

20

are no revenues here.

21

that we're talking about.

22

It's

There

I mean, this is savings

The City is trying to quantify

23

almost like a negative revenue and so it's not

24

like the water revenue bonds that are sold by

 116
1

the water system which are payable from the

2

water revenues that you can look at, you know, a

3

million users in 74 municipalities that buy

4

water.

5

This is something that the City says

6

we're going to save X dollars by doing this.

7

want to capitalize --

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

We

You're saying the City

could not issue a revenue bond on this?

10

TREASURER NEELY:

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

And I disagree.

Let me get here for a

12

process check because we're running out of time.

13

I think we got to get to what do we want to do

14

with this discussion.

15

I think the sole purpose of this

16

discussion is do we want to go forward and

17

create this alternative so we can look at it to

18

see if it makes more sense than conventional

19

financing or not, and it may not.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree, but I think --

21

and I appreciate how long this meeting has been

22

going.

23

of getting a sense of what this thing is is

24

really important.

On the other hand, I do think this kind

I think we have made progress

 117
1

in the last 20 minutes, but I hope that we can

2

continue discussion at least for a little bit

3

longer because what this is and then how we make

4

that judgment about what we compare it to I

5

think are the key questions which we're kind of

6

in the middle of discussing right now.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yeah, but I don't think

8

we have to answer them today.

9

make sure we got an understanding of is what

10

What I got to

this is.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

This is what you see.

13

Believe it because they've said and that's what

14

it is.

15

the whole intent is to expand capacity for the

16

City, and whether it's affordable or not in

17

comparison to the conventional, the market is

18

going to tell us that.

19

It's a more complicated structure, but

I mean, the market is going to say

20

this is more expensive than conventional

21

financing and then the City has to decide is

22

that difference worth the additional capacity in

23

a new market.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

But I don't understand at

 118
1

this point, and maybe the next five or ten

2

minutes will clear this up, how it expands

3

capacity.

4

expand capacity --

5

I mean, one way it might

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You're not going to

6

the same market for the money.

7

to the conventional sources for the money.

8

You're not encumbering the balance sheet

9

basically.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

You're not going

But doesn't revenue bond

11

encumber the balance -- it certainly doesn't

12

encumber the balance sheet in the same way and

13

it may not encumber the balance sheet at all

14

since it's based on revenue.

15

the idea that it somehow frees up other general

16

obligation bonds to really be responsive to --

17
18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So I don't hear

That is the intent

though, is it not?

19

MR. WINTERS:

Yes.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

I'm confused.

21

it connect with the capacity issue of GO bonds?

22

MR. WINTERS:

23

MR. FALK:

24

How does

Well, first of all --

I think David's question is

relevant, but I think actually without people

 119
1

from the Finance Department here it's really

2

hard to put the lawyers on the spot to answer

3

that question.

4

this has been preliminary.

5

What you're pointing out is that

If we can just drop back five yards

6

and understand where we've been.

7

months we've tested various versions of

8

financing structures.

We've created a bunch of

9

different term sheets.

We've worked it through

10

So for four

with the markets.

11

Steve has talked to investors,

12

talked to the City.

13

identified concerns they have about various

14

iterations of the prior term sheets.

15

The finance personnel have

There are lots of other ways this

16

could have been done.

17

that the feedback from the market and a lot of

18

the market participants gave us indicative

19

interest rates that suggested that these were

20

financeable at a rate that would be attractive

21

if the City gave certain levels of credit

22

support.

23
24

What we determined was

The City didn't care for that
alternative.

The City didn't want to provide

 120
1

those sorts of credit support and brought in

2

municipal bond experts to make this look more

3

like a tax exempt because the incremental

4

savings from a tax-exempt bond, which was not

5

the structure previously envisioned, might help

6

offset some of additional coupon expense

7

associated with the lack of credit support from

8

the City, lack of budget commitment, lack of

9

collateral, back stopping the loans and so on.

10

And so now we're at a place where

11

we've got an alternative structure that removes

12

some credit support but provides tax exempt

13

status.

14

least gets us back in a neighborhood where the

15

rates will be hopefully at a level that will be

16

acceptable to the City and to the Trust.

17

Those won't entirely offset, but it at

But because this structure is the

18

latest of say four iterations of different

19

variations on a theme, we don't have all the

20

answers yet.

21

test this latest structure so we don't know --

22

we don't have indicative pricing on this

23

particular structure.

24

We've not gone to the market to

So what we're hoping to get out of

 121
1

this meeting frankly is to get authorization to

2

go do that work, finish that work, answer some

3

of the questions through the Finance Department

4

that you're asking right now, David, authorize

5

your CEO to engage a placement agent to do some

6

market testing, that's in the resolutions in the

7

Board book, and get to a place where within

8

hopefully the next several weeks we have market

9

driven answers to help solve some of these

10

concerns that are still there.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

I appreciate we need to

12

wrap this up so let me just ask one question of

13

David which if you can't answer now and we need

14

Finance Department consultation then it can be

15

answered on a going forward basis.

16

But the question is what is the

17

relevant comparison in terms of what the City

18

could do?

19

discussion is the relevant comparison is what if

20

the City issued a revenue bond and that we would

21

be looking at information we don't have now but

22

ultimately a comparison between what it would

23

cost the City to do a revenue bond or something

24

that's like a revenue bond that's similar to

What I'm picking up from this

 122
1

this --

2

TREASURER NEELY:

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

Can I just add?

Listen.

Versus this.

4

That to me is -- If the answer as Jerry said the

5

City couldn't do this, the City couldn't issue a

6

revenue bond or do this, I'd like to know that.

7

That's not my sense.

8

TREASURER NEELY:

So the thing I would

9

add to that is very similar that cities across

10

this nation have issued tax increment financing

11

where you freeze the tax rate and you bond them

12

against whatever the increment is.

13

It would be very similar to what

14

we've budgeted in terms of energy savings are.

15

That is a way -- that's the only thing I would

16

add to what you said is that's the comparison I

17

would like.

18

MR. HOFFMAN:

And the reason is that if

19

what we are describing is more complicated than

20

what the City can do and more expensive than

21

what the City can do then we need to ask why.

22

Why are we doing something more complicated and

23

more expensive?

24

MR. WINTERS:

The first box answers

 123
1

that question.

2

TREASURER NEELY:

3

MR. WINTERS:

4

Investors?

No, the one on the bottom

right over Mr. Bell's head.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MR. WINTERS:

The limited recourse.

Not the limited recourse.

7

The fact that it's the City and CPS, and maybe

8

the next time we come before you it's the City

9

and the Chicago Park District.

Maybe the time

10

after that it's the Metropolitan Water

11

Reclamation District and the City's Water

12

Department.

13

Who knows?

MR. HOFFMAN:

But that's why we're --

What's so interesting

14

about that, which we'll have to discuss some

15

other time, but the idea that combining

16

different legal entities here, Chicago Public

17

Board of Education and the City of Chicago

18

Municipal Corporation somehow we can't do

19

otherwise.

The only way to do it is through

20

this Trust.

First of all, I'm a little bit

21

dubious about that.

22

so much pressure on what is it --

23
24

Second, that's what has put

MR. WINTERS:

I don't see the reason we

can't, but we're choosing to at this time.

 124
1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, if you're choosing

2

to and it's more complicated and more expensive

3

then we have to ask well, if you didn't choose

4

to and if you just decided to do it as the City,

5

could you do that, what would be the price and

6

why would we do it in a more complicated way.

7

The answer -- there may be very good

8

answers to that, but that's the question.

9

That's why I think it puts so much pressure on

10

the CPS thing because if the City thinks it's so

11

important to get the benefit of combining these

12

things, but the CPS one is ultimately going to

13

be more expensive and higher risk because of

14

the things we've discussed, why would we combine

15

it?

16

MR. WINTERS:

I think Mr. Bell touched

17

on it right at the outset of this meeting when

18

he said that because of the downgrade yesterday,

19

the role of the Trust is more important than

20

offer.

21

The role of the Trust has not been

22

completely defined as yet, but the fact is that

23

as we face a future in which our credit has been

24

downgraded, the school's credit has been

 125
1

downgraded and eventually this is going to roll

2

into affecting Park District and it's going to

3

affect all of the other agencies around the

4

City, the fact is there is no help coming from

5

anywhere else.

6

Washington.

7

Springfield.

8

fix this.

9

There's no help coming from

There is no help coming from
We need to think of other ways to

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Got it, guys.

Listen,

10

we're going to have much more opportunity to ask

11

more questions and to sort through this, but

12

today I think we have to do two things.

13

We've got to decide do we want to

14

pursue this option so that we can further sort

15

it out, and I think we'll have better questions

16

and we'll have the City's Finance Department

17

come to support it or not.

18

I mean, that's the thing.

I don't

19

know the right answer.

I'm not suggesting that

20

us saying that we should pursue this course so

21

that we can really sort out and really

22

understand this as an option means we'll select

23

it.

24

doing that is going to say that this option is

I don't think anybody should feel that us

 126
1

going to prove out to be better than, you know,

2

us saying go back to conventional financing.

3

But I think it is in our best

4

interests to start, you know, this first round

5

through to figure out what other options we do

6

have.

7

like us to get to that point and because I

8

surely want us to open it up to public comment

9

before they start leaving.

10

We can't make that decision.

MS. FERGUSON:

So I would

Thoughts?

I actually have a

11

question.

12

exploring the structure.

13

need to retain, does the Trust need to retain a

14

placement agent to do that and does that

15

retention of the placement agent, if we approve

16

it, obligate us to use that firm in executing

17

the structure or is this just an exploratory --

18

what exactly are we asking the placement agent

19

to do?

20

I fully support the notion of

MR. FALK:

My question is:

Do we

I think it's highly likely

21

that if you're going to get a bank to sign on to

22

help you explore the structure that they are

23

going to expect that they're going to have fair

24

opportunity to bid to do the actual placement

 127
1

work.

2

I don't know that you're locked into

3

a commitment to use them for the full deal, but

4

I would expect as a matter of efficiency you

5

would want to get somebody on board today that

6

has the capability of taking you through the

7

full process.

8
9

The reason to let Steve engage a
placement agent now is so that we have the best

10

conduit into market intelligence that we can

11

get.

12

to talk to the right participants.

We need somebody who plays in this market

13

This is not a typical tax-exempt

14

bond marketplace.

15

features.

16

higher than a typical tax exempt bond because of

17

the lack of credit support.

18

This has quasi equity

The coupon is probably going to be

We need someone who knows the

19

marketplace and can help us survey and probe to

20

what's available.

21

explore it, you need to permit him to get a

22

professional assistance.

23
24

So I think if you want us to

CHAIRMAN BELL:

But we're not committed

to do the deal by doing that?

 128
1

MR. FALK:

Of course not.

2

MR. KLEEMAN:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

No.
We can stop and say

4

okay, we don't like it, we think we ought to go

5

another route?

6

MR. KLEEMAN:

Correct.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Any other comments on

8

this that need to be addressed today relative to

9

us moving forward with just exploring this as an

10

option?

11

(No response.)

12

Are we comfortable?

13

Can I get a

motion from the Board?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I have some

15

questions about the private placement agent

16

aspect of this.

17

the -- I know all of us appreciate the Advisory

18

Board Members and the comments today have been

19

helpful.

20

I think the comments from

I think I would reframe your

21

question is if there's very strong objection to

22

moving forward with the private placement agent

23

given what's been described and I would want to

24

hear as well, I know we all would, from the

 129
1
2

Advisory Board Members.
The process point that would be

3

important to me that I've discussed with Steve

4

is that if we're going to get a private

5

placement agent now to advise us on market

6

intelligence but that likely ends up as the

7

private placement agent as the deal goes

8

forward, we should have some at least informal

9

competitive process to say we are interested in

10

having a private placement agent, give us

11

information if you're interested in being our

12

private placement agent, and then Steve and

13

Kirkland and so on can judge those people and we

14

can choose one.

15

It doesn't seem like that should

16

take very long, but as long as we're going to

17

use that -- something like that as a process

18

then and it's exploratory and it doesn't --

19

certainly doesn't commit us to using the

20

information in deciding whether it makes sense,

21

then I don't have any objection to proceeding as

22

you described.

23
24

MR. BEITLER:
the last page.

There is a timeline on

 130
1
2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Can we

agree to do it the way he described it?

3
4

Hold on, Steve.

MR. BEITLER:

That's what the timeline

describes.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We don't need to look

6

at it.

Under that agreement that we're going to

7

have some kind of competitive process to select

8

him, I think you guys have already done some of

9

that, and that's fine, but we have to document

10

it.

Do we have an agreement on this Board that

11

we'll go forward and explore this?

12

ALDERMAN POPE:

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

We do.
Okay.

Now, I know

15

everybody wants to talk more about this.

16

will be plenty more opportunities to do that.

17

This is an interesting topic.

18
19

But before we close today, I do want
to open this up for public comment.

20

MR. HUMMEL:

Yes?

Greg Hummel from Bryan

21

Cave.

22

advisors.

23

process that you're going through.

24

There

I'd like to commend the Trust and their
I think this is really a thorough

I had one technical question really

 131
1

in the form of a comment.

2

the base line of energy use?

3

it?

4

How do you establish
How do you monitor

And what about landscape changes?
Because that really is the thing

5

which is going to create the savings that you're

6

going to pay as the security or using the

7

security for the bonds.

8

how that might be done.

9

I haven't thought of

Is that something the ESCOs are

10

going to do or how is that baseline going to be

11

settle and measured?

12

assumptions that could change that would effect

13

the realization of the savings?

14

MR. BEITLER:

And are there a set of

We are looking at M & B

15

methodologies right now as part of this process,

16

and there is not an M & B methodology that has

17

been agreed to as the methodology yet, and the

18

City has to essentially decide what methodology

19

is acceptable to it.

20

MR. HUMMEL:

21

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thanks.
But I think to sort of

22

answer your question, we're going to have to go

23

through that.

24

it.

We're going to have to validate

It's got to be something we can market

 132
1

because that's going to be very contingent on

2

what the investment community is willing to, you

3

know, offer up as rates.

4

we're going to have to --

5
6

MR. BEITLER:

It's an active subject of

discussion.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. JOHNSON:

9
10
11

So, I mean, clearly

and Members.

Exactly.

Yes?

Thank you, Mr. Chairman,

My name is Dan Johnson.

I am with

the Midwest High Speed Rail Association.
Just briefly, on the website you

12

have got some great ideas.

13

steps back, some of the ideas you're are

14

exploring solar power, wind power.

15

Sort of taking a few

I ask you to ask consider building

16

railroad tracks as well.

17

about looking for new market participants and

18

there is a mature global marketplace for design,

19

build, maintain, operate and finance high speed

20

rail developers.

21

We discussed earlier

IC rail just opened, literally just

22

opened up a brand new high speed rail network,

23

grants at 7.5 billion euro project I think last

24

year, and Chicago can be the hub of a midwest

 133
1

high speed rail network where the infrastructure

2

owner of the tracks can charge an operator fees

3

to use these new tracks, and I think expand out

4

into the midwest.

5

It's consistent with Mayor Daley as

6

you'll recall in his last year of office put out

7

a blue ribbon panel to discuss an O'Hare to

8

downtown express train for a lot of the city

9

folks to take a look at it and trying to get it

10

privately financed.

11

As this innovative entity is getting

12

created, I would ask you to consider as part of

13

your ideas raising the flag that all these

14

global developers that are looking for

15

investments, infrastructure investments to make

16

to consider Chicago as a place to start.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Thank you.

Thanks for

18

those comments.

I think that falls in your

19

transportation.

We are sort of looking at that,

20

but thank you very much for that.

21

MR. DOODY:

My name is Larry Doody,

22

D-o-o-d-y.

Thank you, Commissioner, Board and

23

Mr. Beitler for allowing me a quick opportunity

24

to speak.

 134
1

I maintain a high level of expertise

2

in the PACE financing industry starting in 2009

3

so I am very proud to see you guys have that as

4

an idea that you want to consider, and it sounds

5

like that might be something you want to go

6

forward with in the future.

7

But I would like to just expound on

8

a couple of things for your own data.

I became

9

an early stage employee and investor in what has

10

became the largest -- a company that supports

11

the largest PACE program in the country, Western

12

Riverside Council, the government's HERO

13

financing program.

14

That program to date in a year and a

15

half has approved more than 10,000 homeowners in

16

one half of one county for over $225 million of

17

privately funding capital that doesn't cost the

18

taxpayers a cent.

19

In essence, a PACE program allows

20

the Chicago Infrastructure Trust to tell the

21

constituency of the City of Chicago and the

22

State of Illinois that you too, homeowner, you

23

too, commercial building owner have access to

24

your own personal infrastructure trust.

 135
1

And I think that's a very important

2

branding and messaging that can be included in

3

the Chicago Infrastructure Trust Program because

4

the general public hears all these programs in

5

the press.

6

never really see how is this benefiting me.

7

They don't see how things benefit a lower tax

8

bill.

9

They hear the negatives and they

With PACE financing it provides that

10

upfront critical capital that allows building

11

owners to make the important decision to align

12

the consumer's goals with the municipality's

13

goals to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon

14

emissions that reduces their utility bills,

15

creates payroll taxes, sales tax and creates

16

jobs.

17

Those 10,000 applicants that have

18

been approved for 225 million where 6 million

19

has already been funded created 2,500 jobs.

20

The four most important letters I think are

21

j-o-b-s.

22

This creates jobs today with

23

privately funded dollars costing the Trust

24

nothing, the City nothing, the County nothing,

 136
1

the State nothing other than the cost that it

2

takes to put the manpower in play to service at

3

the various levels.

4

comments.

5

Not a question, just

Thank you for your time.

If I can

6

do anything as an expert as a resident of

7

Chicago, I'd love to help with that.

8

you.

Any other public comment?
MR. SNYDER:
question.

Yes?

Tom Snyder, just a quick

OM on your slide?

MS. FERGUSON:

Offering memorandum.

15

Also on that slide I'm assuming that what he

16

meant to say is the Board would consider

17

approval of the offering memorandum and the

18

Board will consider approval of the

19

transaction.
