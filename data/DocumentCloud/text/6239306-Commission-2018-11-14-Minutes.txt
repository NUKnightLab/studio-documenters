the motion, and the motion was approved with three affirmative votes (Kelly, Zbigniew,
Mark), and two abstentions (Darlene, Mike).
Kelly continued to question the eligibilities of the commissioners because their
nominations do not conform to the establishment ordinance. Mark responded that the
establishment ordinance no longer conforms to the standard practice of nominating
commissioners in other SSAs; therefore, the establishment ordinance needs to be
amended. Kelly motioned to table the bylaws until after the February municipal
elections; Ziggy seconded the motion, and the motion was approved with two affirmative
votes (Kelly, Zbigniew), and three abstentions (Darlene, Mike, Mark).
