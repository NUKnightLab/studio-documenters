 Vision Zero Chicago Update
Action Plan Status:
• Throughout 2016, a dozen City departments have contributed to the
draft Action Plan, setting City priorities and identifying resources.
• CDOT staff are now collecting input from transportation advocates
and citywide nonprofits. Please send comments or contributions.
• The Action Plan calls for extensive community-based outreach and
additional planning in High Crash Areas once it is released.
• Anticipate Action Plan release early 2017.

 Vision Zero Chicago Update
Action Plan Priorities:
• Vision Zero Chicago will reflect our commitment to equity and a datadriven approach, as well as best practices reflected among other
Focus Cities in the Vision Zero Network.
• The Action plan is focused on utilizing data to focus our resources –
engineering, education, and enforcement – where they will make the
most impact. A high priority is placed on building a culture of safety;
creating safety in numbers by encouraging more people to walk, bike,
and take transit; and responding specifically to crashes that involve
large vehicles and professional drivers.

2016 FINAL REPORT

Executive Summary
The Bicycling and Safe Routes Ambassadors are the education and outreach arm of the Chicago
Department of Transportation (CDOT). The program is funded through a Federal 402 safety grant
administered by the Illinois Department of Transportation and through CDOT with Divvy and
sponsorship dollars from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois.
The goal of the Ambassadors is to encourage and educate Chicagoans through bicycling, walking
and transit and to do so more safely. The program does this by attending events and visiting
locations all over the City of Chicago, in every ward and police district. The program has been
running since 2001, focusing first on bicycle issues and then adding a pedestrian component
in 2005. The Ambassadors work year round; in 2016 there were 4 full time Ambassadors and 2
seasonal Ambassadors. The program is supported by a program manager and three full-time office
staff who also attend events.
The Ambassadors reach people through attending events organized by the program outside
organizations. These events include education at schools, parks and senior centers on safety and on
foot activities.
In 2016, the Ambassadors attended 800 events and directly educated 100,175 people. Of that
number, the Ambassadors reached 41,355 youth and children and 11,676 seniors with safer walking
and biking messaging.

Learn To Ride
This year, for the first time ever in Chicago, the Bicycling
Ambassadors taught free bike-riding lessons to adults at Kennedy
King College (pictured) and the Garfield Workforce Center. The
Ambassadors worked in conjunction with the Divvy 4 Everyone
Program to teach adults of every age the necessary skills for riding
a bike. The Ambassadors instructed a maximum of two students at
a time, and often worked one-on-one with the participants during
each 2 hour class. Divvy provided bikes and Blue Cross Blue Shield
provided helmets for each student. After the class, students were
encouraged to sign up for the Divvy 4 Everyone program. In total, this
summer the Ambassadors taught 37 adults how to ride a bike.

 Enforcement
Each year, the Ambassadors work with the Chicago Police
Department to stage events that address behaviors that endanger
people walking and biking. The Ambassadors and Police work at high
crash locations to address a variety of behaviors including parking
or driving in bike lanes, failing to obey traffic signals, riding on the
sidewalk, and talking on a cell phone. The Ambassadors conducted
66 of these events in 2016. Cyclists received 850 warnings and
motorists received 700 warnings during these events which took
place in 18 Wards across 14 Police Districts.

Safe Routes for Seniors
In 2016, the Ambassadors expanded an initiative that has been a
minor part of our program for years: Safe Routes for Seniors. Senior
citizens, along with children and youth, make up some of the most
vulnerable road users. By helping seniors to navigate safe walking and
transit options at 38 senior centers across Chicago, the Ambassadors
were able to learn more about the concerns seniors have surrounding
transportation. Safe Routes for Seniors will continue to be a major
part of the program as the Ambassadors work to connect more
seniors with city resources such as 311, Aldermanic offices and transit
options. In 2016, the Ambassadors talked with 11,676 seniors during
outreach, representing more than 10% of our total people reached.

 Working with Youth
One of the most important aspects of the Ambassador program
is our work with children and youth. The Ambassadors present
throughout the year at High Schools, Elementary Schools and
Chicago Park District day camps to teach students safe walking
and biking skills. In 2016, Ambassadors visited 106 schools and 145
day camps and educated 41,355 children and youth.

Bike parking benefits your
tenants and your building

“Tenants appreciate the
added storage and security
that bike parking gives them.”
– Operations Manager in Gold Coast

 BENEFITS for Tenants
More places to park their bikes
Sidewalk space for racks is limited

Indoor parking to protect

Chicago weather can be tough on bikes

Long-term, secure spots for bikes
Outdoor racks aren’t ideal for daylong
or overnight storage

 “I installed bike parking in
my building so that tenants
choose to stay here.”
– Property Manager in Streeterville

 BENEFITS for Your Building
Attract more tenants
and stay competitive in the real estate market

Lower maintenance costs
with fewer scuffs from tenants bringing bikes inside

Progress
Big Marsh (564)
• Water control structure
installed
• Improved hydrologic
connectivity
• Buckthorn clearing
• Phragmites treatment
• Prescribed burn

• Vegetation monitoring
• Periodic birding
• Recent community outreach
& stewardship
– Open house in Sept 2015
– Nature walk/shrub clearing
March 2016
– Bird walk at IRM May 2016
– Scheduling upcoming events
for fall and 2017 with SETF
and others

 If you start the restoration, will
they come?
“It seems clear that the rehabilitation is
attracting a wide variety of migrant birds to
Big Marsh, including a number of unusual
species.” – Walter Marcisz

 What is Eco-Recreation?
Eco-recreation is the mutually beneficial relationship
between responsible leisure activities and the natural
environment. It is about uniting conservation, local
culture, and sustainably developed recreational
facilities. This means that those who implement and
participate in eco-recreation should follow the
following:
• Minimize negative aspects of
conventional recreation
• Enhance local culture
• Commit to conservation, protection
and enhancement of nature
