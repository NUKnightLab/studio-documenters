Banners & Holiday Decorations: Holiday decorations to be installed 1st week of
November.
➢ Michael asked Kace to get a quote for how much it would cost to get new
decorations for NEXT winter VS re-garlanding the ones we currently have
VS renting holiday decorations.
➢ Amy suggested (if we get new ones), to salvage the decorations we
currently have but then put the new decorations down Chicago Ave since
it’s the main thoroughfare.
➢ It was also suggested to think of cost if we purchased ½ new holiday
decorations, and re-garlanded ½ the old decorations.
