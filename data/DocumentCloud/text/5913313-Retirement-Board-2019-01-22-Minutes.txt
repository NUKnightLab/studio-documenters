Public Act 100-0023 Employer Contribution Mechanics
Mr. Walsh presented a table which summarized several possible approaches for implementing employer
contributions for City of Chicago (“City”) employees who are on approved leaves of absence from the City
to work for a local labor organization (“LOA Employees”). Mr. Walsh explained that with respect to these
members, Article 11 of the Illinois Pension Code requires that “the participant, or the labor organization on
the participant's behalf, makes contributions to the Fund as though it were the employer, in the same amount
and same manner as specified under this Article [11]...based on his current salary with such labor
organization…”. Mr. Walsh summarized how employer contributions have in the past been made on behalf
of LOA Employees based on the historical “multiplier” funding mechanism; however, Mr. Walsh explained
that the requirement that contributions be made in the “same amount and same manner” is open to
interpretation following the passage of Public Act 100-0023 (“Act”) which changed the employer funding
mechanism to a multi-year “ramp” followed by actuarial based funding. Mr. Walsh also discussed IRS
plan qualification issues.
The Trustees discussed the issues at length and agreed that it was necessary to get clarification from the
City of Chicago’s Corporation Council on the ambiguities related to this matter. The Trustees directed Mr.
Walsh to write to Corporation Council seeking clarification and to send separate letters to Fund members
who are affected by this issue.
Legislative Matters
Mr. Walsh reported that House Bill 166 passed and was signed by Governor Rauner before he left office.

LEGAL REPORT
Holmon Matter
Mr. Grady reported that he was contacted by the attorney representing Debbie Holmon, a former widow
annuitant, regarding changes with respects to her ongoing bankruptcy case and requested a modification to
her repayment agreement with LABF. Mr. Grady suggested that the Board give Mr. Walsh the authority to
alter Ms. Holmon’s repayment plan, to which they agreed.
Hearing Request
Mr. Walsh reported that the LABF had received a request for a hearing from Rick Osborn, an LABF member
who is disputing the requirement that he repay certain disability payments to LABF after receiving a
settlement with respect to a claim filed with the Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission. Mr. Walsh
explained that the LABF had paid Mr. Osborn duty disability benefits, but that he later received a settlement
which resulted in him receiving benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act totaling greater than 75% of
his salary, which eliminates his entitlement to related disability benefits from LABF based on the Illinois
Pension Code. The LABF requested that Mr. Osborn repay the approximately $9,500 in benefits he received
from LABF. Mr. Walsh recommended that the Trustees grant Mr. Osborn a hearing tentatively scheduled to
take place at the March 19, 2019 Board meeting. The Trustees agreed to schedule the hearing for March 19,
2019 and Mr. Walsh stated that he would circulate a Notice of Hearing prior to the meeting.
