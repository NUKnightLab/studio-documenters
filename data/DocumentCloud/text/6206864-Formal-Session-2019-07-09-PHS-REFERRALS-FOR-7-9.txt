Honorable City Council:
RE: BSEED Fee Study

The Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED) is pleased to submit
our newly proposed fee schedule with a resolution for your consideration of approval with an
effective date ot'Angust 1, 2019.

BSEED has not conducted a comprehensive t?ee evaluation since 1996, as a result could not
reasonably determine whether our fees are aligned with the services that we provide to our
customers. While it is not the intention ot'this department to make any profit from the services that:
we provide, we however are obligated to cover our cost for providing such services.

The fee study was conducted by an independent consultant consisting ot?a joint collaboration of
MGT Consulting Group. and Pierce, Monroe Associates, LLC, which was selected through a
competitive bid process conducted from the RFP by the Of?ce of Contract Procurement of the
City of Detroit. Some of the considerations and basis used in the approach include but are not
limited to the following considerations:

It The fee study conducted by an independent consultant was based on "time and activity"
which measured the average time required to ef?ciently complete a unit of activity relating
to BSEED services.

-9 surpluses posted in the previous years have been a result ot?turnover savings due
to hard to ?ll positions. These positions are nearly tilled at a 100% level due to increases
in salaries which has bridged gaps between the City and the other competing industries.

0 Due to the increase in Administrative initiatives, ordinances, business development, and
construction activities, there has been an uptick in demand for faster ef?cient services to
meet the demands of the developers which has resulted in an increase of our budgeted full
time equivalent positions and for skilled trade employees to keep up with the level of
development activities.

I Conducting this fee study has also allowed BSEED to decrease fees where there seem to
be a disparity between the fees and the level of services provided as well as enabling the
elimination of certain Business, Trade and Occupational licenses which are no longer
relevant to our business operations and industry standards.

 

a The fee study also gives the department the ability to justify and defend our fees and service
charges and eliminates susceptibility to be challenged within any jurisdiction.

Your consideration and approval of this fee study will be greatly bene?cial to BSEED and our
valuable customers as well. Please feel free to contact me if you have any question at (313)471-
5108.

Sincerely,

By Council Member

Whereas, The City of Detroit through its Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department has not proposed any increase in fees since April I, 2013; and

Whereas, By Charter of the City of Detroit and the State Construction Code mandates that the
department must cover its cost of operation by user fee charges; and

Whereas, The Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department: of the City of Detroit
has conducted an independent fee study justifying the user the charges, using an Activity-Based
Costing (ABC) approach; and

Whereas, The proposed fees re?ect the true cost of covering the services that are provided and
that the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department does not intend to make
any pro?t out of the services that are provided through its licensing and inspection fees; and

Whereas, The attached ?schedule "(Cost Analysis)? illustrates the current fee and the
newly proposed fee for each item; and

Whereas, The Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department proposes to
discontinue certain business, trade, and occupational licenses which are no longer relevant to our
business operation and do not conform to industry standards and to the extent that the elimination
of these licenses do not adversely impact the revenue of the department,

Now therefore be It Resolved, That the Detroit City Council approves the proposed fee changes
and remove certain business, trade, and occupational licenses with an effective of date August 1,

2019.

Elevator inspections

- Boiler inspections

Short Terms Rental Housing inspections

9 Calculate the full costs of providing specific services,

0 Compare costs with fees currently being charged for these
services, and

0 Recommend levels to recover more of the full cost of services
when such fees are practical.

The following report is being provided to BSEED to too used as a tool to support the
establishment, and adjustment, of fees based on the calculated full cost to
perform the services. Note that in this Cost Study when we speak of ?costs" we
are typically referring to Full Costs. Full costs comprise both direct and indirect
costs in which the latter includes all program, divisional, departmental, and city-
wide overhead layers.

created as a separate legal entity and public body corporate in accordance with an
Intergovernmental Agreement dated September 15, 2008, by and between the City

blighted structures, and develop, maintain, and resell those residential parcels to
reduce blight in the City and strengthen and revitalize the economy of the City; and

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL
ADDRESS: 9975 Bishop
NAME: Stanley Morgan
Demolition Ordered: July 8, 2014

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (B SEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on June 10, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The owner has
paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the deferral request for this

 

property.
Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within _te_n (10) business days from the date of the City Council
decision.

2. BSEED will schedule a Progress Inspection within forty-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation
permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every fortv-I'Ive (45) calendar
days, for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions
of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without
further notice. In addition, pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code we will issue a Blight Violation Notice.

Any request exceeding three (3) deferrals must be made by petition to City Council through the of?ce of the City Clerk.

Attachment 
MAINTENANCE REMOVAL AGREEMENT

 

It is understood and agreed that during the initial display, and subsequent renewal periods if applicable, the permittee
shall be responsible for inspecting banners and poles, replacing and/or removing banners that are torn, defaced or in
general disrepair, including rigging. Where any street banner is found to present an immediate threat of harm to the

public health, welfare or safety, the City shall summarily cause its removal.

It is also understood and agreed that banners are to be removed within seventy-two (72) hours of the revocation date of
the permit. Any street banner not removed within that time period shall be removed by the City without notice to the

permittee.

If the City removes banners because they are in disrepair, present a threat or harm, or because the permit has expired, it
is understood and agreed that a portion or all of the refundable deposit will be forfeited by the permittee in order to
cover the City?s expense. If the expense of removal exceeds the amount of deposit, it is understood and agreed that the

excess amount shall be collected from the person/entity to which the permit was issued.

It is also understood and agreed that in such cases when the City removes banners there is no guarantee that the banners

can be reclaimed by the permittee.

A. Hanging Banner from Utility Poles

Nothing may be attached to a utility or light pole without the permission of the City. The City Council can grant
permission to attach banner to Lighting Department poles. To get permission to hand banners you must petition the
City Council. The petition should identify where you want to hang the banner(s), what the banner(s) will say and how

No banner will be allowed to block the View of traf?c signals or signs. The Public Lighting Department will inspect the
poles before advising the City Council about allowing any banners to be attached. The permission given by the City

Council is good for up to six months. If you want to hang banners for more than six months, you should petition the
City Council for an extension.

The Petitioner is responsible for purchasing, installing and removing the banners and the hardware needed to hang
them.

The Public Lighting Department will supply a copy of its Banner Speci?cations upon request.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition o. 935 Department of Public Works - City Engineering Division, request
to dedicate the following public right-of-way at the eastern portion of McDougall
from Wight to its southern terminus.

Petition No. 935 - The Department of Public Works City Engineering Division in conjunction
with Stroh Companies Inc. and Talon Center Partners, LLC request to dedicate McDougall
Avenue at a width of 49.00 feet wide from the south line of Wight Street, 50 feet wide, to the
south line of vacated Atwater Street, 50 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility
clearance) and report. This is our report.

McDougall Avenue was an open public right-of-way, 60 feet wide, at this location. At the
request of Stroh Companies, Inc. the street was vacated and converted to easement by your
Honorable Body on July 30, 1986, J.C.C. pages 1556-1558. The street re-opening in this area is
made as a part of a project designed to provide enhanced public access to the Detroit Riverwalk.
The project is part of an agreement between the City of Detroit Department of Public Works,
Stroh Companies Inc. and Talon Center Partners, LLC.

A separate, related resolution for the acceptance of a public access easement located at Joseph
Campau Avenue near the Detroit River, drafted by the Law Department, is being submitted by
the Department of Public Works.

All other city departments and utilities have reported no objections to the prOposed right-of?way
dedication.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

Honorable City Council:

Re: Spirit Plaza; Petition No. 1773 The Department of Public Works City
Engineering Division, in conjunction with The General Services Department
requests the permanent closure of Woodward Avenue, from Jefferson Avenue to
Larned Street, for the purpose of continuing the activation of the Spirit Plaza
programming.

On June 12, 2017, the City of Detroit closed the referenced segment of Woodward to
activate the Spirit Plaza for an initial pilot period of 90 days.

On November 21, 2017, City Council originally approved Petition No. 1773, which
provided for extending the temporary closure of the above referenced segment of
Woodward through the spring of 2018, so that the evaluation period could continue
through the fall and winter seasons.

In October of 2018, DPW requested City Council approval to extend the temporary
closure for a period to culminate on November 15, 2019, upon which time a
recommendation was to be brought back to City Council for the Plaza?s optional
additional year extension.

DPW is now requesting, on behalf of the General Services Department, City Council to
vacate as a public right-of-way and convert into a private easement for public utilities of
the full width of the above referenced segment of Woodward to facilitate the established,
ongoing and future programming.

This vacation to easement, if authorized by Your Honorable Body, establishes GSD as
the agency, who is responsible for ensuring that the Plaza is appropriately maintained. In
addition, this vacation will allow for coordinating all outreach efforts to impacted
stakeholders, as well as providing the mechanism for continued planning for events and
space programming. of Detroit?s Recreation Department and Special Events
team to will continue to operate with the established agreement outlining speci?c
responsibilities for each agency, thereby ensuring that the Plaza is being programmed in a
manner that maximizes its usage and is consistent with the vision of it being the
?People?s Plaza?. We will continue to provide the opportunity to employ a more
expansive outreach effort to individuals that encounter the space on a daily basis,
including all employees and regular visitors to the CAYMC. The vacation to easement
will also provide the opportunity to install semi-permanent structures to enhance the
quality of pro gramming and the overall experience in the public space.

Provisions protecting all utility installations in the right-of?way have been made a part of
the attached resolution.

I am recommending the adoption of the attached resolution.

A?i'l' 2372013
Honorable City Council:

RE: Spirit Plaza; Petition No. 1773 The Department of Public Works City Engineering 
Division, in conjunction with the General Services Department and the Downtown Detroit

Partnership, requests the extension of the temporary closure of Woodward Avenue, from

Jefferson Avenue to Larned Street from May 1, 2018 through November 16, 2018 for the

purpose of continuing the activation and evaluation of the Spirit Plaza.

On June 12, 2017, the City of Detroit closed the referenced segment of Woodward to activate the
Spirit Plaza for an initial pilot period of 90 days.

On November 21, 2017, City Council originally approved Petition No. 1773, which provided for
extending the temporary closure of the above referenced segment of Woodward through the
spring of 2018, so that the evaluation period could continue through the fall and winter seasons.

DPW is now requesting to extend the temporary closure for a period to
culminate on November 16: 2019 upon which time a recommendation with be brought back to

City Council for the Plaza?s potential permanency.

This extension, if authorized by Your Honorable Body, establishes GSD and DDP as the agencies
who will take responsibility for ensuring that the Plaza is appropriately maintained throughout the
extended evaluation period. In addition, the extension will allow for coordinating all outreach
efforts to impacted stakeholders, as well as providing the mechanism for continued planning for
events and space programming this year, which will include celebrating the 60 year anniversary
of the Spirit of Detroit. DDP will enter into a separate 3-party agreement with the City of
Detroit?s Recreation Department and Special Events team to establish specific responsibilities for
each agency, thereby ensuring that the Plaza is being programmed in a manner that maximizes its
usage and is consistent with the vision of it being the ?People?s Plaza?. In addition, it will provide
the opportunity to employ a more expansive outreach effort to individuals that encounter the
space on a daily basis, including all employees and regular visitors to the CAYMC. The extension
will also provide the opportunity to continue analyzing the impact to traffic on surrounding streets
as DDP will employ an independent traf?c consulting firm to study impact on traf?c in the
adjacent as well as surrounding streets. Prior to the end of the extended evaluation period, city
agencies (DPW, Planning, GSD, Special Events), along with DDP will summarize to City
Council our findings, which will be utilized in making a determination for the future use of the

public space.

Provisions protecting all utility installations in the right-of?way have been made a part of the
attached resolution.

I am recommending the adoption of the attached resolution.

RE: SPIRIT PLAZA
Dear Honorable City Council:

With regard to the closure of Woodward for the temporary activation of Spirit Plaza, the Police and Fire
Departments have recently been engaged in interdepartmental meetings to go over safety and risk
management for the proposed summer activation. These meetings have occurred on a weekly basis.

On April 2018, Fire and Police Departments were present at the Spirit Plaza interdepartmental
coordination meeting held at the Planning and Development Department. The Fire Department expressed
concern with the fire lane location initially proposed on the southbound portion of Woodward. Similarly,
the Police Department identi?ed areas of concerns regarding barriers on the Larncd side of the proposed
plaza. Both concerns were taken into consideration and we were able to find a mutually agreeable solution
that met both the Fire Department?s and the Police Department's concerns. This included a ?re lane/public
safety access lane on the northbound side of Woodward closest to the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center.

These interdepartmental meetings have been helpful in identifying the safety concerns and mitigating risks.
We look forward to continuing coordination regarding Spirit Plaza.

The following individuals have been present during the coordination meetings:

Fire Department Shawn F. Battle, Chief of Fire Prevention
Fire Department Mathew Fauls, EMS Assistant Supervisor
Fire Department - Eugene V. Biondo, Deputy Fire Chief
Fire Department Sean Larkins, Superintendent of EMS

Police Department Assistant Chief Arnold Williams
Police Department - Captain Octaveious Miles Downtown Captain

 

 

Respectfully,

Detroit, MI 48226

Honorable City Council

The Department of Public Works - City Engineering Division submits this petition to request the
temporary closure of Woodward Avenue, fromjefferson Avenue to Larned Street for a period of five

vears.

The new ?Spirit of Detroit PlaZa,? is a vibrant new public space located in front of the Spirit of Detroit
statue. The 20,000 square-foot civic square on \Voodward, between Larned and left-erson, exists to
celebrate Detroit?s diversity and complement recent enhancements to Woodward Avenue, such as the
new esplanade between IZarned and Campus Martins.

During the initial trial period, the civic space, as well as adjacent streets in the immediate area, have
been closely monitored to evaluate the overall impact. Similar public spaces have been created in many
cities around the world to improve walkability, increase access to public space, and create new business
development without negatively impacting area traf?c Flow.

The project improves both safety and mobility for all users, creating a more direct pedestrian link
between Downtown and the Detroit Riverfront, while reducing delay times for motorists travelling
on .Jefferson Ave, one of the cities? busiest thoroughfares. The project also marks the latest step
towards the City?s goal of establishing smarter, safer mobility for all and improving the city?s economy
by reimagining Detroit?s Streets to serve everyone.

'I'his petition is being requested so that ?Spirit of Detroit Plaza? may continue as a public space on
Womlward Avenue between jefferson Avenue and Larned Street.

RE: Legal Opinion(s) and/ or Comparative Study Regarding Facial Recognition
Technology
Mr. Whitaker:

I am interested in a comparative study as it pertains to the Facial Recognition Technology and its use by

our Detroit Police Department as an investigative tool relative to crime investigations. I would like to know if
you could research any applicable laws, pending legislation and/ or an unbiased analysis of the technology in

use on

the market today. Perhaps if there are any established legal opinions, practices, industry standards or

suggested uses relating to the below listed questions?

1. Is the current technology any more invasive than the collection of ?nger prints or DNA samples?

2. How fast is the technology changing from day-to-day?

3. What legal parameters would you suggest be the minimal standard when using this technology?

4. Are there any Constitutional Rights infringements with the use of this technology when supplementing
an investigation with the results of the facial recognition technological search and a possible
identi?cation of a potential suspect?

5. What if any safe guards do you recommend we employ to protect the City of Detroit in front of the use
of the new technology?

6. Are there any current legal precedents anywhere in the United States relative to the new technology? (If
so, please attach.)

Sincerely,

Roy McCalister, Jr.
