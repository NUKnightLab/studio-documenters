REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY REGULAR MEETING
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 26, 2017
DETROIT ECONOMIC GROWTH CORPORATION
500 GRISWOLD SUITE 2200 DETROIT, MI - 4:00PM
CALL TO ORDER
Chairperson Matt Walters called the meeting to order at 4:14 PM. Mr. Walters noted that a
quorum of the board was not yet present, but asked that in the interest of time staff begin their
presentations on Projects as several board members have indicated they will be arriving soon.
PROJECTS
Former Free Press Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the Former Free Press Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan and
noted the addition of the construction timeline and a voluntary Tier I Community Benefits
Agreement (“CBA”) that have been added to the board memo. Mr. Ogden and Mr. Collins
provided additional information on the project including an overview of the project and the
voluntary Tier 1 CBA as well as board member questions regarding project timing, design, Detroit
employment and contractors, future tenants and affordable housing.
Project Introduction
Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former Detroit
Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on the second and
third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for the basement and subbasement. First through third floor tenants have not been determined at this time.
It is estimated that 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and 10 direct permanent jobs
will be created in connection with the redevelopment. Additional permanent jobs are expected to
be created by the retail and office tenants. The Developer has agreed to comply with City
Executive Orders.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,660,000.00. The Developers are requesting
$7,029,190.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the Free Press
Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of downtown Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility

 The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located
within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property
is determined to be Functionally Obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition, selective building
demolition, lead & asbestos surveying, asbestos abatement, air monitoring, hazardous material
removal, site preparation, and preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be
financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible
activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in the summer of
2017 and be complete no later than December 2020.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
