Board Committee Members Other Board Member

Jennifer Liptak Stephanie Turman

1. Approval of Minutes:

 

Minutes from the February 15, 2018 Performance Oversight Committee meeting were
approved.

Proposed Resolutions:

There were five resolutions reviewed by the Performance Oversight Committee for
recommendation.

Mr. Trona first reviewed three procurement items and the Committee found the bids to
be in accordance with the Authority?s procurement policies and procedures, the prices
to be fair and reasonable, and the bidders to be responsive and responsible.

The Performance Oversight Committee agreed to recommend the three items outlined
in the resolution for award for the total amount of $459,524.00.

Mr. Cetra presented the next resolution authorizing to extend and amend agreements
to provide legislative consulting services. He reported that the Board previously
authorized the award of two agreements to Greenlee Partners, LLC and Buchanan
lngersoll Rooney PC to provide the services and subsequently, the Board authorized
the Authority to extend the term of the agreements and to increase the total not-to-
exceed amount.

As the agreements expire on March 31, 2018, staff has determined that it is in its best
interest to further extend the term of the agreements, on a month-to-month basis, for a
period not to exceed an additional one year through March 31, 2019, with an increase
to the total not?to-exceed amount of $204,000.

Mr. Cetra noted that the Authority shall maintain the ability to terminate the agreements
on 10 days' written notice.

The Performance Oversight Committee agreed to recommend extending the
agreements with the two firms, on a month-to-month basis, for a period not-to?exceed
one additional year through March 31, 2019, and to increase the previously authorized
total not-to?exceed amount to $1,122,000.

Mr. Miller presented the next resolution authorizing the Authority to enter into an
agreement with Clever Devices Ltd. for automatic vehicle monitoring reporting system
and related services.

Mr. Miller explained that the Authority has previously and successfully implemented
certain Clever Devices' software and hardware modules for performing the core
functions of automated voice announcements, automated passenger counting and
automated vehicle monitoring for buses.

Mr. Miller reported that as part of the Authority?s ongoing initiative to enhance the
Authority?s on-board Intelligent Transportation System, management desires to provide
its Operations and Maintenance staff with real-time vehicle health monitoring services.

Mr. Miller explained that Clever Devices? software and related hardware are proprietary
to Clever Devices and may only be purchased from, integrated by, modified by and
installed by Clever Devices.

The Performance Oversight Committee agreed to recommend entering into an
agreement with Clever Devices for the purchase of these additional services for a total
not-to-exceed amount of $1,732,489 dollars.

Mr. Miller also presented the next resolution authorizing the Authority to amend its
agreement with GIRO, Inc. He explained that the Board previously awarded an
agreement to GIRO to provide a software system to replace the existing Bid Dispatch
System and Customer Service Complaint System; noting that to date, GIRO has
performed these services in a satisfactory manner.

Staff has determined that it would benefit from applying Bid and Bid-Web
software to the Authority?s Maintenance personnel pick and job vacancy bidding
process.

Mr. Miller also noted that the software offered by GIRO is the only such software which
can readily and economically interface with the Authority?s existing Bid Dispatch System
and allow the Authority to maintain the integrity of its system.

The Performance Oversight Committee agreed to recommend amending the
agreement with GIRO to increase the not-to-exceed amount by $472,091 to $4,000,263
dollars.

The final resolution requesting authorization to award a construction contract for the
Embedded Light Rail Turnout Replacement project was presented by Mr. Wargo. He
reported that the work includes removal of the existing rail turnout and pavement,
installation of a new supplied turnout, drainage, new reinforced concrete pavement and
signal modifications.

3.

Mr. Wargo noted that this is a very important turnout as it is the merging point of the
Blue and Red lines.

The Performance Oversight Committee agreed to recommend awarding the contract to
Delta Railroad Construction, Inc., in the amount of $1,011,962.00 dollars, subject to
completing all pre-award requirements.

Financial Report:

Mr. Schenk reported that the total operating revenues through February were
approximately $4.5 million dollars higher than budget principally due to higher
passenger revenues. Total expenses midway through the fiscal year were
approximately $14.5 million dollars under budget.

Mr. Schenk also reported that total subsidies were approximately $5.7 million dollars
under budget, which is a timing issue with operating assistance.

With no further business, the meeting was adjourned.

services within and for Allegheny County pursuant to the Second Class County Port
Authority Act, as amended. As part of its public transportation system, the Authority
owns and operates various fixed guideways, including the Martin Luther King, Jr. East
Busway (East Busway).

The Department of Transportation (PENNDOT) is planning a
project to rehabilitate and improve the Kenmawr Bridge (Bridge), located in the
Boroughs of Swissvale and Rankin and adjacent to the East Busway. The project will
consist of the replacement of the existing span of Bridge, along with the associated
Bridge approach roadway and intersecting roadway reconstruction and retaining wall
construction.

As part of the project, PENNDOT has completed design work to include the
construction of an additional span on Bridge replacement structure to accommodate
potential future expansion and extension of East Busway to the east side of South
Braddock Avenue (Additional Bridge Span).

PENNDOT is willing to proceed with the construction of Additional Bridge Span,
subject to the Authority entering into a contribution agreement and agreeing to
reimburse PENNDOT for the costs associated with the construction of Additional Bridge
Span, which costs are currently estimated to be $1,387,000 (Contribution Agreement).

way to Allegheny County, subject to Federal Transit Administration review and
concurrence, necessary for completion of the project and Additional Bridge Span. The
proposed Contribution Agreement is further summarized on Exhibit A to the resolution.

Additional Bridge Span would be more costly and difficult to implement in the
future if not included in the project.

This resolution authorizes the Authority to enter into Contribution Agreement with
PENNDOT, in a form approved by counsel, for a total not-to-exceed amount of
$1,460,000, which includes the $1,387,000 estimated construction cost and an

SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION
Authorization to Extend and Amend Agreements for Investigative Services

In February 2015, Port Authority of Allegheny County (Authority) issued Request
for Proposals No. 15-02 to obtain firms to provide investigative services (Services) that
can be utilized on an as-needed basis.

In May 2015, the Authority?s Board authorized the award of four agreements
(Agreements) to Specialty Private Investigators, Inc.; CSI Corporate Security and
Investigations, Inc.; Pittsburgh Information and Research Company d/b/a 
Investigative Services; and Investigations by King, LLC., to provide Services for an initial
term of three years and for a total not-to-exceed amount of $300,000 to be allocated on
an as-needed and task specific basis. Agreements also contain two option years to be
exercised by the Authority in its sole discretion.

Pittsburgh Information and Research Company d/b/a Investigative
Services has ceased doing business and is no longer performing Services. To date,
Services performed by the remaining three contractors have been satisfactory and in
compliance with Agreements.

The initial three-year term of Agreements expires on June 30, 2018. The Authority
has determined that it is in its best interest to exercise the first option year extending the
term of Agreements to June 30, 2019, with no increase in the previously authorized total
not?to-exceed amount for Agreements.

The attached resolution authorizes amendments to Agreements with Specialty
Private Investigators, Inc., CSI Corporate Security and Investigations, Inc., and
Investigations by King, LLC., to extend the term of Agreements for an additional year to
July 30, 2019 with no increase in the previously authorized total not-to-exceed amount of
