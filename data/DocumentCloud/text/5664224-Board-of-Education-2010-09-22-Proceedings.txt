authority to place schools on probation and to correct de?ciencies in their academic performance (105
ILCS The Illinois School Code further grants the Chicago Board of Education (Board) the

105 ILCS 

Pursuant to that authority. in June 2009. the Board adopted the "School Performance. Remediation and

It. Hearing on Principal Removal

Pursuant to the "Guidelines for the Removal and Replacement of Principals of Schools on Probation for
the 2009-2010 School Year? and the ?Procedures Governing Principal Removal Hearings?. Mary
Rodgers. Till's principal. and the Till Local School Council (LSC) were duly noti?ed that the CEO was
contemplating the removal of Mary Rodgers as principal pursuant to Section to further the
school's educational improvement. Mr. Fred Bates. Esq.. an independent hearing of?cer. presided over
the Till principal removal hearing on Wednesday. August 31. 2010. in an ef?cient and impartial manner

The Law Department. representing the CEO. presented the statements of the Area 15 Chief Area Of?cer
and the Manager of Performance Policy as well as documentation to support a recommendation to
remove Mary Rodgers as Till?s principal to the hearing officer. The hearing was uncontested by Mary
Rodgers.

The hearing officer has submitted a written report to the CEO summarizing all relevant evidence offered
during the hearing. making ?ndings of fact. and recommending the removal of Mary Rodgers as the
principal of Tilt.

Ill. Chief Executive Officer's Recommendation

The CEO has reviewed the Hearing Of?cer?s ?ndings of fact and recommendation and hereby
recommends that Mary Rodgers be removed and replaced as the principal of Till. The CEO further
recommends that Mary Rodgers' Uniform Principal's Performance Contract. with a term beginning July 1.
2010. and ending June 30. 2014. be terminated effective September 23. 2010. These recommendations
are based upon the following factors:

A. Emmett Louis Till Math 8. Science Academy has a history of poor perfOrmance Till has
been on probation for the last three consecutive school years. including the 2009-2010
school year. Mary Rodgers has served as the principal of Till since February 11, 2001

B. In the 2007-2008 school year. Till earned 28.6% of the total available points under the
Chicago Public Schools' School Performance, Remediation and Probation Policy. in the
2008-2009 school year. Till earned 19% of available points. Till's decline in points is
attributable to the fact that Till is achieving well below the District. and is not making
significant progress in catching up. which is demonstrated by the lotlowing

(1) Title 2009-2010 performance on the Illinois Student Achievement Tests 

Composite. which is the combined result of the ISAT reading, mathematics. and
science assessments. was 45.4%. compared to a District average of 71.8%.

13

September 22, 2010

(2) In reading. the percentage of Till students meeting or exceeding state standards
for the 2009-2010 school year was 44.5%. compared to a District average of
68.4%. In mathematics Till's performance was 48 compared to a District
average of 76 5% In science Till's performance was 38 compared to a
District average of 67.9%.

(3) The gap between Till and the District has been persistent over time. and in recent
years has been widening. Despite increases on the ISAT Composne between
the 2004-2005 school year and the 2007-2008 school year. His performance
has since declined. from a high of 49.5% in 2007-2008 to 45.4% in 2009-2010. a
decrease of 4.1 percentage points. During that time period. the District continued
to improve. from 67.8% to 71.8%, an increase of 4 percentage points.

(4) The performance gap between Till and the District is consistent across subiects
In reading. the percentage of students meeting or exceeding at Till deCIined from
a high of 52.2% in 2007-2008 to 44.5% in 2009-2010. a decrease 7.7 percentage
points. Over that same time period. the District average increased from 66 7% to
68.4%. an increase of 1.7 percentage points

(5) In mathematics. Till's performance declined from 51.8% in 2008-2009 to 48.5%
in 2009-2010. a decrease of 3.3 percentage points. Over that same time period.
the CPS average increased from 73.6% to 76.5%. an increase of 2.9 percentage
points.

(6) In science. Till declined from 44.7% in 2007-2008 to 38.5% in 2009-2010. a
decrease of 6.2 percentage points. Over that same time period. the CPS
average increased from 62.6% to 67.9%. an increase of 5.3 percentage points.

C. In 2008. Till developed and the Board approved a School Improvement Plan in
which it set priority goals for the ISAT that. by 2010; (1) 60% of Till?s students would
meet or exceed state standards in reading; (2) 65% would meet or exceed state
standards in mathematics. and (3) 50% of all and grades students wOuId meet or
exceed state standards in science. On the 2010 44.5% of Till's students met or
exceeded state standards in reading. 485% met or exceeded state standards in
mathematics and 38.5% of 4th and grade students met or exceeded state standards
in science. Overall on state assessments the school?s performance declined between
2009 and 2010 by 2.5 percentage points. After nearly two full academic years of growth
data under the current it is clear that Till will not reach it priority goals
and that it is not making adequate progress to remove itself from probation status or to
make adequate yearly progress under the No Child Left Behind Act

0. This low performance has taken place at Till despite significant efforts and supports given
by the CEO and his designee. Dr. Judith Coates. Chief Area Officer for Area 15. for the
school. They provided Mary Rodgers with signi?cant supports and coaching to improve
her performance and the performance of the school. Dr. Coates issued a Corrective
Action Plan to Mary Rodgers in April 2010. to provide speci?c guidance and suggestions
to improve her and the school's performance. Nonetheless. no significant changes
occurred in Mary Rodgers' performance or the performance of the school during this
school year.

E. Based upon her performance. it is the CEO's and his designee's judgment that Principal
Mary Rodgers failed to remediate her performance deficiencies and that she is not
leading the school to meet its priority goals Or to take the school off of academic
probation. It is also the CEO's and his designee's judgment that new leadership at Till IS
necessary to lead the school to meet its priority goals and off of academic
probation.

If the Board adopts the CEO's recommendation to remove principal Mary Rodgers the following actions
will occur:

1. The CEO will appoint an interim principal for Till. based upon the recommendations of the Chief
Area Officer. The interim principal will serve at the pleasure of the and

2. The LSC shall have no authority to select a new feur-year contract principal until Till makes
sufficient academic progress to be removed from probation.

LSC REVIEW: LSC approval is not applicable to this report.
FINANCIAL: The interim principal position will be filled at a cost within current budget appropriations.
PERSONNEL IMPLICATIONS: An Interim Principal will be selected. who will serve at the pleasure of the

CEO. Until the school comes off probation. the Local School Council of Till will have no authority to select
a new four-year contract principal.

President Richardson-Lowry indicated that if there were no objections. Board Report
10-0922-EX14 would be adopted by the last favorable roll call vote. all members present voting

therefore.

The Vendor will continue to provide the TLC Library Solution for schools. an integrated. centralized
library automation system. including all selected enhancement products and related senrices. The library
automation software will continue to provide a searchable catalog of library collections. It also will
continue to automate tasks such as the circulation of library materials among patrons and the generation
of library statistics and reports. The integrated library automation system will include Web-based Online
Public Access Catalog. Cataloging and Authority Control. Circulation. Serials Controls. and Reporting
capabilities. In addition to this core functionality. the system will continue to support integrated searching

DELIVERABLES:

Vendor will continue to provide TLC Library Solutions for School Software Licenses. implementation and
project management services. installation and configuration of servers. end-user training. data conversion
and enhancement services. help desk design and deployment. and software technical support. upgrades
and maintenance.

OUTCOMES:

The integrated library system will result in:

Effective teaching/Curriculum Intergretion: Teachers and librarians can use an integrated library
system for a multitude of purposes. from posting reading lists. bibliographies and path?nders online to
creating easy title searches by reading program. Furthermore. library professionals are freed from the
time consuming task of manually performing the circulation and cataloging functions of running a library.
This change enables them to spend more time working with students and collaborating with teachers.

Collection Development: Schools and the Board can use the system to identify collection gaps.
determine collection age. and understand resource usage trends. thereby driving better purchase
decisions. In additiOn. librarians can electronically share collection information with other librarians
considering similar purchases.

Library Automation: An integrated library system will provide benefits on two levels. First. all schools will
have a state-of-the-art. fully maintained system. Second. a centralized system will relieve librarians and
tech coordinators of the time-consuming administrative tasks associated with independent systems. Such
as the purchasing of systems and servers. installing upgrades and backing-up data. Again. this is
valuable time that can now be spent with students.

Use of online resources: CPS libraries currently invest $300.000 of grant funds annually in online
subscription databases Thomas Gale. Britannica). An integrated library system will
increase the use of these databases. as they can be included in a variety of searches. thereby
dramatically expanding the quantity and quality of resources that students use.

Coordination of Library Technology with other technology in the school: The centralized system will
interface with other district-wide and school databases. such as the new student information system.
Furthermore. students and educators will be able to access the library from all school classrooms with an
internet connection. transforming a basic computer into a virtual extension of the library.

Grant applications and implementation: Most library grant applications require detailed information
about library collections and trends. Furthermore. the ability to be accountable for specific goals is a
maior driver of success in attaining grants. Without library automation. even basic questions such as
?number 0! books In collection" or "percent increase in circulation" are nearly impossible to answer
