 Executive Summary
Introduction
In the last decade, there is growing recognition about the importance of environmental
context in shaping obesity risk at the individual level. Several studies have found that food
environments in low-income and minority communities are particularly “obesogenic”
including limited availability of healthy food options, such as fruits and vegetables, high
availability of energy-dense foods, and greater availability of smaller stores compared
to supermarkets/full service grocery stores.1,2 While multiple strategies have been proposed,
increasing availability of healthy foods in corner stores as an approach to improve food
access has gained momentum. This has been particularly true in communities with low food
access, also referred to as food deserts, that are underserved by traditional supermarkets.3
To gain a deeper understanding of corner stores across suburban Cook County, Illinois,
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) commissioned an assessment
to describe distribution between communities of different races and income levels and the
kinds of food options offered, as well as present recommendations based on the findings.

Methodology
Since there is no standard trade group definition, this assessment defined corner stores as
small-scale, independent grocery stores that are smaller than a supermarket, which is defined
as having less than 2.5 million annual in sales.4 This assessment excluded chain convenience
stores and stores whose primary classification was as a gas station or liquor store. Of 201
qualifying stores, a total of 182 corner stores or 91% were successfully assessed.
In-person audits were conducted at each corner store to assess store characteristics and
the food environment. Additionally, store characteristics hindering or promoting healthy
food purchasing were collected; and availability, variety and price of the corner store food
environment were examined.
Data analysis consisted of both spatial analysis to explore the spatial relationship between
store locations and community demographics and other characteristics and survey
analysis to gauge the relationship between food environment and community and store
characteristics.

Findings
In summary, key findings are outlined below.

Distribution & Density of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County
•  While corner stores of any size are relatively evenly distributed between suburban
  Cook County regions, compared to other grocery store types, they are somewhat more  
  concentrated in the South and West regions and least concentrated in the Northeast
 region.

1

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 •  Hispanic communities have the highest densities of corner stores and African-American
  communities have a higher density of corner stores than the overall average for suburban
  Cook County.

Distance to Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County
•  The distance to the nearest corner store is generally lower in areas with lower incomes
  and higher Hispanic populations. Additionally, areas with higher Hispanic populations
  tended to be nearer to corner stores with 10 or more fresh produce items.
• 
 
 
 

While the distance to a corner store of all types, in general, was somewhat closer in
African-American areas than the average in suburban Cook County as a whole,
percent Hispanic and low income were better predictors of the distance to a corner store
than percent African-American.

Availability of Healthy Items
•  The percentage of corner stores carrying 10 or more fresh produce items was    
  significantly different by region. It was higher in the Northwest, Southwest and West
  regions, and lower in the Northeast and South regions.
•  Fruit and vegetable availability and variety in liquor stores was lower compared to other
  store types.
•  Corner stores in Hispanic areas were much more likely to stock and have greater variety
  of fresh fruits and vegetables and dried/canned beans than those in African-American,
  White or racially mixed areas.
•  Predominately White and racially mixed communities were more likely to carry low fat
  and fat free milk compared to predominately African-American and Hispanic
 communities.
•  A low percent of corner stores in the predominately African-American South region
  carried 10 or more produce items and other healthy food options despite the generally
  high concentrations of corner stores.
•  Higher poverty areas stocked more fresh fruits and vegetables.

Availability and Marketing of Unhealthy Items
•  Predominately Hispanic, African-American and racially mixed communities were more
  likely to carry gallon size fruit juice drinks (<10% juice), single serving size (8oz) juice
  drinks (e.g. Little Hugs), and Flamin’ Hots compared to White neighborhoods.
•  Corner stores in African-American communities were more likely to sell tobacco
  products and alcoholic beverages.
•  Indoor and outdoor marketing environments in African-American neighborhoods
  were saturated with more advertisements of unhealthy items than in other racial/ethnic
 neighborhoods.

 Conclusions
In general, the geographic pattern of corner stores in suburban Cook County correlates with
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic variables. In particular, the South region and AfricanAmerican areas of suburban Cook County generally do not seem to be well served by
either traditional supermarkets or corner stores in terms of produce availability.5 The limited
availability of fresh produce, low fat milk, and frozen fruits and vegetables in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods highlights a potential opportunity to work with corner store
owners in these neighborhoods to increase their produce offerings. Findings further suggest
that a comprehensive approach to improving foods and overall quality of the corner store
should be considered.access to public transportation than Chicago residents. If areas of
relatively low food access are present, vulnerable populations such as the poor, elderly, and
those lacking access to transportation might have difficulty accessing healthy food.
“Finding Food in Chicago and the Suburbs,” a 2008 report on food access in the 6-county
Chicago metropolitan area, found a number of areas of low food access in Chicago’s
suburbs. Particular areas of concern included the Maywood, Riverdale, and Calumet City/
Lansing areas. As in Chicago itself, these low food access areas were predominantly
African-American. In many cases, communities in these areas have since worked to bring
full service grocery stores into their neighborhoods, but the success, or lack thereof, of
these efforts has yet to be documented. Food access research is also about what is in areas
with poor food access. Often, low food access communities do have large numbers of
smaller “corner” stores, as well as fast-food restaurants. In addition, innovative solutions to
improving food access, such as implementation of farmers’ markets, community gardens,
and farm stands, have not been mapped for suburban Cook County.

Recommendations
Based on the findings in this report, the following is recommended.

For County & Local Government
• 
 
 
 
 

Identify strategies to make the data and conclusions of this report useful and    
 
understandable to residents who live in, as well as organizations and leadership who
serve, communities with low access to healthy corner stores and other healthy
food options. Barriers between community and the data that describes their daily living
conditions should be removed.

•  Develop a system to routinely analyze and disseminate data related to food access that is
  based on information already gathered by governmental agencies.
• 
 
 
 
 
 
3

Facilitate cross-sector collaborations (e.g., public and private economic development
agencies; suburban Cook County municipalities; academic institutions) to: 1) develop
healthy corner store models in areas where they would improve food access; and 2)
lead or support securing of resources to implement and evaluate initiatives that increase  
availability of healthy food options at corner stores, particularly in the South region and
in predominately African-American neighborhoods.
An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 • 
 
 
 

Support policies and approaches that improve residents’ overall access to healthy foods
in corner stores (e.g., financing; store development and layout; product sourcing
and purchasing such as requiring fresh produce as a condition of operating a store; and
marketing such as limiting number of advertisements).

For Corner Store Owners
•  Display nutrition and health messages in and around the store to promote the sale of
  healthy food.
•  Reduce in-store marketing of unhealthy foods and competing products such as liquor
  and tobacco.
•  Increase availability of healthy items by, for example:
  -  Increasing allocation of shelf space to healthy foods.
  -  Offering low-sodium or no sugar added fruits and vegetables, canned or frozen.
  -  Working with your current suppliers, local farmers and farmers markets to add more
   fresh produce options.

For Community Organizations
•  Work with local corner stores to identify ways to increase customer demand and provide
  support for healthy items.
•  Organize local marketing campaigns for stores, in collaboration with corner store
  owners and other agencies, that increase purchase of healthier food options.
•  Assist store owners in identifying food purchasing preferences of community members.
•  Seek out assistance to learn more about what the data means and how the results of
  this report help explain health inequities including potential higher rates of disease and
  premature death.

For Researchers
•  Examine how community residents use corner stores for food and other products and
  how the food from corner stores contributes to dietary intake.
•  Conduct a focused market basket study, similar to this corner store assessment, for gas
  stations and chain convenience stores in the Cook County region.
•  Further explore predominantly White areas of the county to study shopping patterns
  by residents of these areas and to determine whether vulnerable populations in these
  areas would be assisted through increased produce offerings.

 Introduction
In the last decade, there is growing recognition about the importance of environmental
context in shaping obesity risk at the individual level. Several studies have found
that food environments in low-income and minority communities are particularly
“obesogenic” including limited availability of healthy food options, such as fruits
and vegetables, high availability of energy-dense foods, and greater availability of
smaller stores compared to supermarkets/full service grocery stores.1,2 While multiple
strategies have been proposed, increasing availability of healthy foods in corner stores
as an approach to improve food access has gained momentum. This has been especially
true in communities with low food access, also referred to as food deserts, that are
underserved by traditional supermarkets.3
This strategy, while proving to be successful in some places,4 is controversial. Corner stores
are often seen as negative in the community and perceived to primarily carry unhealthy
food items. Supporting these claims, a 2009 study found that over 50% of a group of inner
city Philadelphia 4th to 6th graders bought food at a corner store at least once a day,
and most frequently consumed items like chips, candy and sweetened beverages that are
energy dense and have low nutritional value.5 Some evidence suggests that corner store
owners generally are not from the community and are often of a different race – especially in
African-American communities.6,7,8 Focus groups and structured group interviews, conducted
as part of Northeastern Illinois Community Food Security Assessment, found mistrust
between consumers in African-American neighborhoods in Chicago and corner stores owners
and managers.9 The differences in race between the corner store consumers and owners
also may serve to remind the consumers of the lack of business ownership within the
community, especially in African-American neighborhoods.10 Additionally, stocking healthy
food options may be difficult for corner stores when many face unique challenges such
as limited capital, storage equipment, and access to suppliers.
Despite these challenges, corner stores still present opportunities to improve the availability
of healthy, affordable food. Corner stores have an existing presence in low-income
and minority communities that can be leveraged. Since they are smaller in size, they have
the potential to respond quickly to community needs.
To gain a deeper understanding of corner stores across suburban Cook County, Illinois,
the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) commissioned this assessment
to supplement the 2012 Food Access in Suburban Cook County report. This assessment
describes distribution between communities of different races and income levels and the
kinds of food options offered. Based on the findings, recommendations are also presented.

 Methods
Data Collection
Since there is no standard trade group definition, this assessment defined corner stores as
small-scale, independent grocery stores that are smaller than a supermarket, which is defined
as having less than 2.5 million annual in sales.11 This assessment excluded chain convenience
stores and stores whose primary classification was as a gas station or liquor store.
To initially identify corner stores in suburban Cook County, a database of companies
maintained by Hoover’s, a division of Dun & Bradstreet, was used.12 Review of the database
led to the creation of an initial list of 360 stores that included food, meat, and produce
stores with stated sales of less than 2.5 million annual revenue. Deleted from the list were
duplicates; wholesalers, large chains, dollar stores, restaurants and stores visited in previous
studies and determined to be supermarkets. In addition, in-person visits showed that 61
addresses of the 360 were residences – possibly store owners’ homes, 26 were closed, and 33
were larger supermarkets. Other “store” addresses on the list led to an adult book store, an
art gallery, restaurants and delis, a disco, and a carpet store. To this original 360 store list, 69
stores already participating in a corner store intervention project were added, many of which
were duplicates to stores in the original 360 store list. All together, a total of 208 stores were
judged to meet the qualifications for surveying. Seven of these were eliminated from the
analysis after surveys were completed because they had three or more checkout lanes and nine
or more shopping aisles or rows. Based on previous research, these types of stores, although
meeting the annual sale limit, are considered small supermarkets. Taking away these seven
stores resulted in a count of 201 qualified stores that we attempted to survey. Of these, 19
refused to participate. Of the 201 qualifying stores, a total of 182 corner stores or 91% were
successfully assessed.
It should be noted that the original store list was very broad so that any store that could
possibly be a corner store was included in the list to survey. However, the number of stores
on the original 360 store Dun and Bradstreet list that were not groceries calls into question
the use of such lists in general without in person site validation.
In-person audits were conducted at each corner store to assess store characteristics and the
food environment. The survey used was adapted from several existing instruments13,14,15,16
and consisted of eight categories: 1) store characteristics, 2) fruits (fresh, frozen, canned), 3)
vegetables (fresh, frozen, canned), 4) beans (canned, dried), 5) grains, 6) dairy, 7) beverages,
and 8) snacks. Store characteristics that may hinder (e.g., in store marketing of unhealthy
food items) or promote (e.g., accepting Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
benefits) healthy food purchasing were collected.
In addition, availability, variety and price of the corner store food environment were
examined. Availability was measured by documenting whether an item was present in the
store (e.g. present/absent). Variety was assessed by evaluating the different kinds of items/
products available (e.g. number of types of fruits/vegetables). Price was determined for a
subset of foods, including a selection of six fruits and vegetables and other food products
such as dairy foods and snack items. The list of foods included mostly healthy items (e.g.,

 skim milk vs. whole milk), commonly consumed foods in the USA, and culturally specific
foods for African-American (e.g., collard greens, okra) and Hispanic (e.g., tomatillo, mango)
communities.
To gain a clearer understanding of factors that contributed to differences in food availability,
we developed a liquor store index score using three store characteristics which were perceived
to be consistent with a liquor store -- namely cigars sold, rolling papers sold, and liquor
being the largest permanent outdoor sign. To examine availability of unhealthy foods, we also
calculated a sugar-sweetened beverage score (sum of gallon size juice drink, single serving
small juice drink, single serving large juice drink and soda) and poor snack score (sum of
Flamin’ Hots, regular chips, cookies, and HoHos/snack cakes).
A team of eight students from Chicago State University were hired to complete the store
assessment. Assessors attended two trainings. The first was to review the survey, and the
second was at two corner stores to practice completing the survey. Assessors were then
“certified” to a level of 90% correct (compared to an assessment completed by an experienced
lead assessor) on a third store. In addition, 40 stores were assigned to two reviewers in
order to test for inter-rater reliability.

 Analysis
This assessment aimed to identify corner store locations in suburban Cook County,
examine the food environment, and compare location and availability patterns to
community characteristics. Data analysis consisted of both spatial analysis to explore
the spatial relationship between store locations and community demographics and other
characteristics and survey analysis to gauge the relationship between food environment
and community and store characteristics.

Spatial Analysis
Methods used to identify areas of concentrations of corner stores followed similar methods
to a previous assessment of food access in suburban Cook County.17 Suburban Cook County
was divided into five regions. Three of these, the South, Southwest, and West regions, were
identical to CCDPH district regions. The CCDPH North region was divided into Northwest and Northeast regions since these areas had very different characteristics in previous
food access studies. The number of stores within each region were tallied and the ratio of
stores to population within each region was calculated (Table 1). The relationship between
region and produce availability class was assessed using a chi-square test (Table 2). Distances
to the nearest corner store, the nearest corner store with any fresh produce, and the nearest
corner stores with at least 10 fresh produce items of those surveyed were calculated to the
nearest 100 feet to all residential and mixed residential zones in suburban Cook County.
Mean distances were then calculated by census block group. Population standardized means
were then calculated for quartiles based on seven demographic variables: median household
income; aggregate household income; percent of households below 200% of poverty;
percent of households that are renters; and percent African-American; Non-Hispanic White;
and Hispanic (Table 3). This was also done for a distance index that minimized the effect
of population density on the mean distance to the nearest store (i.e. in general, as population
density increases, distance to the nearest store decreases), using the formula: distance index
= mean distance/(1/(log of population density)) (Table 4). Finally, the distance indexes were
correlated with demographic variables (Table 5). Analyses were run using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (version 18.0, 2009, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and ArcGIS
(version 10, 2011, ESRI, Redlands, CA).

Survey Analysis
Availability and variety of each food item in corner stores overall, as well as by community
racial/ethnic composition, poverty level, and region were measured using simple frequencies.
Data were available for defined geographies from the U.S. Census (e.g., census block groups,
census tracts). Census block group was used to define “neighborhood” and as the unit of
analysis because it is the smallest spatial scale for which poverty data are available. Racial
composition of each census block group was defined using Census 2000 data (2000 Census

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 Summary File 1). Based on the racial/ethnic distribution, block groups were categorized
as greater than 50% White, greater than 50% African-American, and greater than 50%
Hispanic. Community areas with no majority racial/ethnic group were designated as racially
mixed. The percentage of individuals in the Census block group who reported annual family
incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level was used to classify neighborhood poverty
(2000 Census Summary File 3). Suburban Cook County regions were classified based
on geographic areas designated by CCDPH. Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests were
used to test for differences in the availability and price by racial/ethnic distribution and
poverty level. Analyses were run using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version
16.0, 2007, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

 Corner Stores Compared to Other Store Types in SCC
Map 2 presents the distribution of Chain Full Service Supermarkets, Discount Supermarkets
(e.g. Aldi and Save-A-Lot); and Chain Convenience Stores (mainly 7 Eleven stores) for
comparison with corner stores across suburban Cook County. Particularly in the near southern suburbs, independent corner stores appear to be “filling in” for other store types, in
particular chain convenience stores. In other areas, particularly the northeastern suburbs
(i.e. North Shore) independent corner stores are lacking compared to other store types.

 Corner Store Locations Compared to Poverty in SCC
Map 3 superimposes the percent of population living in households that have annual
incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level with the corner store locations. While
corner stores are not confined to areas with higher levels of poverty, it is apparent that they
are more often concentrated in these areas.

 Corner Store Locations by Region in SCC
Maps 4-8 present a clearer pattern of the within-region distribution of corner stores. In these
maps, corner store symbols are sized by the number of produce varieties available. Census
tract classification for African-American and Hispanic areas is also highlighted. The Northeast region (Map 4) shows only three corner stores that carry a large amount of produce
and an overall low concentration of corner stores. The Northwest region (Map 5) shows a
wide variety of independent and chain supermarkets, as well as concentrations of corner
stores with larger amounts of produce in the eastern portion of this zone, including those in
the municipalities of Des Plaines, Wheeling, and southern portions of Arlington Heights.
It should be noted that some of these stores specifically focus on serving the Asian-American
population in this region. The West region (Map 6) is characterized by a large number
of corner stores with relatively large amounts of produce especially in the predominantly
Hispanic areas of Cicero and Berwyn, although such stores also exist in areas of Maywood,
Melrose Park, and Schiller Park. The Southwest region (Map 7) is characterized by corner
stores with larger produce sections in the predominantly Hispanic areas of Summit and
Blue Island, with lower amounts of produce at corner stores elsewhere in the region. Finally,
the South region (Map 8) shows a large number of corner stores with little or no produce,
with a few scattered stores carrying larger amounts of produce, mainly in areas that are not
predominately African-American.

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

18

 The general patterns presented in the corner store maps parallel and are confirmed by the
spatial analysis as shown in tables beginning on page 23. Table 1 shows the number of corner
stores per region, including stores with no produce, stores with 1-9 produce items, and stores
with 10 or more. Note that the density of corner stores compared to the region’s population
is highest in the predominately African-American South region (high densities are indicated
by low populations per store). However, differences between regions are relatively low
compared to those seen with corner stores with higher amounts of produce. For instance,
the density of stores with 10 or more produce items is highest compared to the population in
the West and Southwest regions, which generally have larger Hispanic populations. The
concentration of stores carrying 10 or more produce items is particularly low in the Northeast region, which has a predominantly White population.
The relationship between region and classes of produce carried (i.e. none, 1-9 items,
10 or more items) is shown on Tables 2 and 2a. Differences were examined using chi-square
and ANOVA tests. In the tests, region was not found to be a significant predictor of produce
availability at a significance level less than .1 (p=0.19). However, a comparison of stores in
the “10 and Above” class shows that region is a minimally significant predictor in the percent
of stores that carry 10 or more fresh produce items (p=0.07). Tables 2, 2a, and 2b indicate
relationships that follow the variation in produce available by region. This is demonstrated by
the variation in produce available in corner stores by region. Not only did the Northeast
region have the lowest number of corner stores, only 11.5% of these had 10 or more
produce items, compared to 29.1% for all regions. The South region, despite having the
second highest number of corner stores overall, had the second lowest percentage of stores
(20.9%) that carried 10 or more produce items. The other regions surpassed these with
the West, Southwest and Northwest regions having 32.7%, 37.0%, and 40.5%, respectively,
of the stores carrying 10 or more produce items.
Tables 3 and 4 show distance and distance index quartiles by demographic variables for the
corner store data and comparison store types. Table 5 shows correlations between these
demographic variables and the distance index. In addition, calculations by quartile were
added for percent Asian, as well as percent Asian combined with percent Hispanic. This
addition was in response to inquiries about whether produce access at stores might correlate
with the locations of recent immigrant populations.
Table 5 shows correlation coefficients between race and income variables and distance to the
nearest corner store. Pink-colored boxes are significant relationships with correlations of -.1
or less, meaning that as the variable goes up, the distance to the nearest corner store goes
down. Grey colored boxes are significant relationships with correlations of +.1 or greater,
meaning that as the variable goes up, the distance to the nearest corner store goes up. It
should be noted that correlations of .1 or -.1 are not very high. Even stronger correlations,
such as .3 or -.3 still do not indicate causation. When reading this table, it is important to
concentrate more on the overall patterns than particular relationships.

19

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 Concentrating specifically on correlations between percent African-American and the
distance index on Table 5, an unexpected relationship emerges. For most store types,
percentage African-American correlates moderately positively with distance to the nearest
store, meaning as percentage African-American goes up, distance to the nearest store also
goes up. One exception is with discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Save-a-Lot, where
distance goes down as African-American percentage increases. Even though the distance to
get to other kinds of groceries generally is well correlated with percent African-American,
distance to the nearest corner store does not correlate well.
On the other hand, percent Hispanic is negatively correlated at a level of .3 or greater with a
lower distance index, meaning that the distance to the nearest store declines as the percentage
of Hispanics in a region increases) for all corner stores and for corner stores with between
1-9 produce items and 10 or above produce items. Percent Non-Hispanic White correlates
positively with the distance index, as does both median and aggregate household income,
meaning that one must generally travel further to reach a corner store in Non-Hispanic
White and higher income areas.
Percent Asian itself is not a strong enough predictor of store access to create its own patterns,
generally showing fairly weak correlations. For this reason, analysis results for percent Asian
alone are not presented here.

Survey Results
This section presents survey results that describe store characteristics and food environment.
Store Characteristics
Detailed results from in-person audits are presented in Tables 6-22 and Figures 1 and 2.
Table 6 highlights characteristics of corner stores across suburban Cook County (n=182).
A majority of stores (76.4%) accepted SNAP benefits (known as LINK in Illinois).
However, about 24% of stores participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). About 50% of stores had signage in languages other
than English. Slightly over 30% of stores sold prepared foods, such as pizza or sandwiches.
Many corner stores included in the survey sold alcoholic beverages (40.1%) and at least one
tobacco product (54.9%). In addition, several of the stores also promoted alcoholic beverages
and tobacco products through in-store ads, displays/built-ins, outdoor signage, and/or functional items such as trash cans, mats, etc. (Table 7). Store characteristics differed based on the
racial/ethnic composition of the community. Stores in African-American neighborhoods were
significantly more likely to sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes; have industry produced ads
for tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and sugar sweetened beverages displayed inside the store;
and sell cigars, smokeless tobacco, and tobacco rolling papers compared to all other racial/
ethnic neighborhoods (Table 8). Likewise, corner stores in African-American neighborhoods
were more likely than other neighborhoods to have outdoor ads for alcoholic beverages and
feature “liquor” as the largest permanent outdoor sign (Table 8).

 Food Option Availability
Analysis of data on fruit and vegetable availability showed that less than half (43%) of the
corner stores in suburban Cook County carried fresh produce with 15% carrying 1-5
varieties, 11% carrying 6-9 varieties, 17% carrying 10-20 varieties, and 14% carrying 20 or
more varieties (Table 9). The Northeast region had the highest percentage of stores
without fresh produce (58%) whereas the Northwest had the lowest percentage of stores
without fresh produce (35%) (Figure 1, below). Predominately White neighborhoods had
the highest percentage of stores without fresh produce (55%) and Hispanic neighborhoods
had the lowest (23%) (Figure 2, below).
Figure 1   Fruit and Vegetable Categories  
 
by Region (n=182)

Figure 2   Fruit and Vegetable Categories  
 
by Race (n=182)

Of the corner stores that carried fresh produce, the type of produce that was carried
most frequently was white onions (45.6%) followed by apples (38.5%), bananas (35.7%),
and oranges (33.5%) (Table 10). White potatoes were not included in this assessment;
however, previous studies suggest that corner stores frequently carry white potatoes as a staple
item.18,19 Availability of other food items is presented in Table 11. Most stores stocked
canned beans, dried beans, canned fruits, white bread, white rice, white pasta, whole and
reduced fat milk, regular cheese, and a selection of regular snack chips.
Stores in White and racially mixed neighborhoods were more likely to carry low fat and fat
free milk compared to stores in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods.
Stores in Hispanic, African-American and racial mixed neighborhoods were more likely to
carry orange juice, gallon size fruit juice drinks (<10% juice), single serving size (8oz)
juice drinks (e.g. Little Hugs), and snack chips compared to stores in White neighborhoods
(Table 11). Stores in predominately Hispanic neighborhoods were significantly more
likely to stock canned and dried beans whereas stores in racially mixed neighborhoods had
greater availability of frozen fruits and vegetables.
In our sample of corner stores, mean availability of fresh fruits and vegetables differed by
both neighborhood racial/ethnic composition and poverty level (Table 12 and 13). Mean
21

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 fresh fruit and vegetable availability in Hispanic and racial mixed neighborhoods was significantly greater than in predominately White and African-American neighborhoods. Mean
availability of culturally specific Hispanic and African-American fresh fruits and vegetables
was also significantly greater in Hispanic than African-American, White and racially mixed
neighborhoods. Mean availability of fresh fruits and vegetables was also directly associated
with neighborhood poverty level, with the highest poverty category (>41.29) having a
higher mean availability of fresh fruits and vegetables overall and culturally specific AfricanAmerican and Hispanic fruits and vegetables compared to the lower poverty category. In
contrast, mean availability of both fruits and vegetables was significantly lower in corner
stores with the highest liquor store index score compared to the stores with the lowest score
(p<0.05) (Table 14).
Selection
Consistent with the availability of fresh produce items, mean availability of canned fruits,
canned vegetables, frozen fruits, and frozen vegetables was significantly greater in Hispanic
and racially mixed neighborhoods compared to White and African-American (Table 15).
Mean availability of frozen vegetables was significantly lower in African-American
neighborhoods compared to Hispanic, White, and racially mixed neighborhoods (Table 15).
Canned and frozen fruits and vegetables did not differ by neighborhood poverty level.
Mean availability of canned and dried beans was significantly higher in Hispanic
neighborhoods compared to racially mixed neighborhood types (Table 16). Additionally,
mean availability of canned beans was also significantly higher in the highest poverty
category compared to the lowest poverty category (Table 17). Consistent with the greater
Hispanic population, mean availability of both canned and dried beans was highest in the
South and Southwest regions (Table 18).
The poor snack score in predominately White neighborhoods was significantly lower than in
neighborhoods of all other racial/ethnic groups (Table 19). Mean sugar-sweetened beverage
score was significantly higher in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods compared to
White neighborhoods (Table 19). Sugar-sweetened beverage and poor snack scores for stores
in neighborhoods in the lowest poverty tertile were significantly lower than scores in the
highest poverty tertile (Table 20). The liquor store index also predicted poor snack score with
a significantly higher mean poor snack score in corner stores with higher liquor index scores
(not pictured).
Price
Mean price was calculated for a selection of fresh produce in the corner stores and compared
to the national average. Mean prices for all selected fruits and vegetables except mangos
exceeded the national average pricing (Table 21). There were no significant differences in
mean price of selected produce items by neighborhood racial composition. However, mean
prices of mangos differed by poverty level with higher levels of poverty being associated
with lower prices. Mean prices of milk items were lower than the national average with no
significant differences by race, poverty, or region (Table 22).

 Spatial Analysis – Tables
Key
Findings
In summary, key findings are outlined below.
Distribution and Density of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County
•  While corner stores of any size are relatively evenly distributed between suburban
  Cook County regions, compared to other grocery store types, they are somewhat
  more concentrated in the South and West regions and least concentrated in the
  Northeast region.
•  Hispanic communities have the highest densities of corner stores and African
  American communities have a higher density of corner stores than the overall average
  for suburban Cook County.
Distance to Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County
•  The distance to the nearest corner store is generally lower in areas with lower incomes
  and higher Hispanic populations. Additionally, areas with higher Hispanic popula  tions tended to be nearer to corner stores with 10 or more fresh produce items.
• 
 
 
 

While the distance to a corner store of all types, in general, was somewhat closer in
African-American areas than the average in suburban Cook County as a whole,
percent Hispanic and low income were better predictors of the distance to a corner
store than percent African-American.

Availability of Healthy Items
•  The percentage of corner stores carrying 10 or more fresh produce items was
  significantly different by region. It was higher in the Northwest, Southwest and West  
  regions, and lower in the Northeast and South regions.
•  Fruit and vegetable availability and variety in liquor
  stores was lower compared to other store types.
• 
 
 
 
 

Corner stores in Hispanic areas were much more
likely to stock and have greater variety of fresh
fruits and vegetables and dried/canned beans than
those in African American, White or racially
mixed areas.

• 
 
 
 

Predominately White and racially mixed communities were more likely to carry low-fat and fat-free
milk compared to predominately African-American
and Hispanic communities.

•  A low percent of corner stores in the predominately
  African-American South region carried 10 or more produce items and other healthy
  food options despite the generally high concentrations of corner stores.
•  Higher poverty areas stocked more fresh fruits  and vegetables.

31

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 Availability and Marketing of Unhealthy Items
•  Predominately Hispanic, African-American and racially mixed communities were
  more likely to carry gallon size fruit juice drinks (<10% juice), single serving size
  (8oz) juice drinks (e.g. Little Hugs), and Flamin’ Hots compared to White
 neighborhoods.
•  Corner stores in African-American communities were more likely to sell tobacco
  products and alcoholic beverages.
•  Indoor and outdoor marketing environments in African-American neighborhoods
  were saturated with more advertisements of unhealthy items than in other racial/
  ethnic neighborhoods.

32

 Limitations
This assessment did not include chain convenience stores such as Seven Eleven, or stores
attached to gas stations like AM/PM. While the focus on independent corner stores is
important because they are often in food desert communities and may be most open
to interventions, exclusion of gas stations and chain convenience stores means that the
report cannot be taken to represent the full range of small food retail options in
suburban Cook County.
A further limitation is the reliance on the Dun and Bradstreet list to shape the stores assessed,
as well as the store classification. In the same way that many of the addresses in the list were
not corner stores, it is likely that some corner stores were not included or were differently
classified. Corner stores open and close often, and data vendors may tend to focus on larger
entities more than corner stores. In addition, some of the residences on the list could represent home addresses of owners for which the actual address of the store is unknown.
In addition, it should be noted that on Tables 3, 4, and 5, some errors in the calculations for
the comparison data (distance to supermarkets and other store types) were corrected since the
release of the 2011 “Food Access in Suburban Cook County” report, where these data were
first reported. These errors would not have led to major changes in the conclusions seen in
the earlier report, but the data is updated in this report.

33

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 Conclusion
In general, the geographic pattern of corner stores in suburban Cook County correlates
with race/ethnicity and socioeconomic variables. Percent Hispanic is a strong predictor of lower distances to the nearest corner store and the availability of fresh fruits
and vegetables, canned and frozen fruits and vegetables, and dried and canned beans.
The highest poverty neighborhoods also stocked more fresh produce than lower poverty
neighborhoods.
This was likely based on an interaction between ethnicity and income, with Hispanic
neighborhoods having higher poverty compared to white neighborhoods. Predominantly
Non-Hispanic White areas, especially in the Northeast region, have lower levels of corner
stores in general, as well as a greater number of corner stores with no produce. This may be
explained by the fact that these areas are already being served by number of larger grocery
stores and supermarkets.5
The pattern for African-American areas, however, is complex. In general, while there are a
great number of corner stores in the largely African-American South region, the even larger
concentration of corner stores in predominately Hispanic areas with low African-American
populations means that percent African-American by itself does not, overall, correlate well
with distance to the nearest corner store. Of concern is that while distance to any corner store
is somewhat less in African-American areas, distance to the nearest corner store with at least
10 produce items is somewhat higher in African-American areas. The South region in
particular has a low number of corner stores with at least 10 produce items compared to the
total number of corner stores there. While this is also true in the Northeast region, as seen
in the earlier “Food Access in Suburban Cook County” report, unlike the Northeast region,
the South region has a lower concentration of supermarkets. Combining the two reports, the
South region and African-American areas of suburban Cook County in general seem to not
be well served by either traditional supermarkets or corner stores in terms of produce availability.20 African-American neighborhoods not only had limited availability of fresh produce
but also low fat milk, frozen fruits and vegetables. This highlights a potential opportunity to
work with corner store owners in African-American neighborhoods to increase their produce
offerings.
Furthermore, a comprehensive approach to improving foods and overall quality of the corner
store should be considered. Store characteristics (e.g., liquor and cigarette advertisements)
and other findings like the higher poor snack and sugar sweetened beverage scores in AfricanAmerican and Hispanic neighborhoods as compared to predominately White neighborhoods
point to other potential intervention strategies that can be implemented to support reduced
access to unhealthy snacks and sugar sweetened beverages, limited advertisements of unhealthy items, and promotion of nutrition messaging that encourages sales of healthy items.

 Recommendations
Based on the findings in this report, the following are recommended.

For County & Local Government
• 
 
 
 
 

Identify strategies to make the data and conclusions of this report useful and    
understandable to residents who live in, as well as organizations and leadership who
serve, communities with low access to healthy corner stores and other healthy food
options. Barriers between community and the data that describes their daily living
conditions should be removed.

 

•  Develop a system to routinely analyze and disseminate data related to food access that is
  based on information already gathered by governmental agencies.
• 
 
 
 
 
 

Facilitate cross-sector collaborations (e.g., public and private economic development
agencies; suburban Cook County municipalities; academic institutions) to: 1) develop
healthy corner store models in areas where they would improve food access; and 2)
lead or support securing of resources to implement and evaluate initiatives that increase  
availability of healthy food options at corner stores, particularly in the South region and
in predominately African-American neighborhoods.

• 
 
 
 

Support policies and approaches that improve residents’ overall access to healthy foods
in corner stores (e.g., financing; store development and layout; product sourcing
and purchasing such as requiring fresh produce as a condition of operating a store; and
marketing such as limiting number of advertisements).

For Corner Store Owners
•  Display nutrition and health messages in and around the store to promote the sale of
  healthy food.
•  Reduce in-store marketing of unhealthy foods and competing products such as liquor
  and tobacco.
•  Increase availability of healthy items by, for example:
  -  Increasing allocation of shelf space to healthy foods.
  -  Offering low-sodium or no sugar added fruits and vegetables, canned or frozen.
  -  Working with your current suppliers, local farmers and farmers markets to add more
   fresh produce options.

35

An Assessment of Corner Stores in Suburban Cook County, Illinois – Cook County Department of Public Health, August 2014

 For Community Organizations
•  Work with local corner stores to identify ways to increase customer demand and
  provide support for healthy items.
•  Organize local marketing campaigns for stores, in collaboration with corner store
  owners and other agencies, that increase purchase of healthier food options.
•  Assist store owners in identifying food purchasing preferences of community members.
•  Seek out assistance to learn more about what the data means and how the results of
  this report help explain health inequities including potential higher rates of disease and
  premature death.

For Researchers
•  Examine how community residents use corner stores for food and other products and
  how the food from corner stores contributes to dietary intake.
•  Conduct a focused market basket study, similar to this corner store assessment, for gas
  stations and chain convenience stores in the Cook County region.
•  Further explore predominantly White areas of the county to study shopping patterns
  by residents of these areas and to determine whether vulnerable populations in these
  areas would be assisted through increased produce offerings.
