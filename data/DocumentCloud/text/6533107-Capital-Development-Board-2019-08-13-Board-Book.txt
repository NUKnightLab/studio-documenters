Project Manager:

Emily Zgonjanin

Project History: This project consists of the construction of a 200 bed, 5 story precast concrete veterans’ home, located
at the southwest corner of West Forest Preserve Road and North Oak Park Avenue. The facility will include private
bedrooms and private bathrooms, 16 residential kitchens, a commercial kitchen, administrative, recreational, and support
spaces, outdoor space and parking for 181 vehicles. The completed building will be LEED Silver Certified.
During excavation of the west parking lot a large pocket of unsuitable soils (organic topsoil) was discovered. This
excavation found top soil and then clay soil at a depth of approximately 12 inches below the existing subgrade. This type
of soil is unsuitable to provide the base for the construction of the parking lot.
The west portion of the project site had six (6) soil borings completed during early design; however, none of the soil
borings indicated the unsuitable soil condition. Both the civil engineer and the soil engineer for the project are requiring
the unsuitable soil be removed and replaced with stone.
This change is to remove 12 to 24 inches of organic topsoil and replace it with compacted stone. The excavated quantities
will be monitored by the project soil testing company and the construction manager, Turner Construction. All quantities will
be documented and confirmed for final pricing on the change order.
The change is for the General Contractor– IHC Construction Companies, LLC
Description of RFP Change: This proceed order will allow for the excavation of the unsuitable soil in the west parking lot
and replacement with compacted stone. This will be classified as an undiscovered soil condition.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of proceed order G-55 in the amount of $192,935.37. Approval of
this proceed order will allow the general contractor to continue work to complete the west parking lot and meet the project
schedule.

Proceed Order G-55 to remove and replace unsuitable soils in west parking lot
area of the site in the not-to-exceed amount of $192,935.37.
The west parking lot is approx. 26,000 SF area with permeable paver
construction and natural drainage swales in island areas. Six (6) soil boring
samples were taken from the west parking lot area early in design, three (3) of
the borings fell within the parking lot design area. The soil borings did not show
the unsuitable soils, the boring data indicated 6-12” topsoil with clay below.
GC in mid July 2019 started excavating the site for the west water retention area
and west parking lot. 6-12” of existing topsoil was removed, an additional 18” of
clay soil was removed to the specified parking lot grade elevation. Black organic
topsoil was discovered at this elevation.
The soils testing company SEECO and contractor proofrolled the areas on July
26th and July 31st, 2019 with a fully loaded dump truck. More than 39 spots failed
to pass proofroll observation. Four (4) test pits were dug down to 24” in the
parking area. The test pits indicate pockets of 12 to 24” of top soil. Based on the
proofrolling and test pits the CE and Soils Engineer recommend removing all the
black topsoil down to clay and filling with compacted stone.
The team investigated the possibility of replacing the removed soil with clay soil
stockpiles onsite, but there is not enough stock piled clay to be used on the west
parking lot. The stock piled clay is designated to be used to bring the south
parking lot up to grade.
FUTURE SITEWORK: The south parking lot soil borings do not show unsuitable
soil, but excavation will start in that parking in the next month. We could
encounter additional soil issues in the south lot.

Project History: The scope of work for this project provides for the construction of a new In-Patient Treatment Center at
the Joliet Department of Corrections. Construction includes 150 mental health beds, 50 medical beds, a medical clinic,
mental/medical health support spaces, dietary, laundry and vehicular sally port areas. The scope also provides for the
construction of a new administration building that includes a public lobby, security area, pedestrian sally port, training
area, staff offices and staff fitness center spaces. A new central utility plant will be constructed to support the new
buildings. Also included are utility upgrades, site lighting, access roads and additional parking as needed to support the
new construction.
Phases one and two of the project are underway. The temporary fencing, mass excavation and site fill work for phase one
are complete. The footing/foundation work in the phase one area has begun. Phase two mass excavation and
underground utility work is underway. Site demo and excavation for the administration building is also underway.
During excavation of the phase two area, and in the vicinity of boring #22, the geotechnical engineer noticed what
appeared to be undocumented fill throughout the soil. The geotechnical engineer directed the contractor to dig three test
pit areas to determine the soil content of each of these test pits. All three of the pits contained undocumented fill to a
depth of approximately eleven feet. This undocumented fill must be removed to an approved site and support foundations
need to be constructed in the affected areas.
Description of RFP Change: Approval of proceed order G-2 will allow for the necessary work involved with disposing of
the classified soils and installing geo-piers to support foundations in the affected areas. Compacted fill will be used in
areas requiring smaller excavations. This will be classified as an undiscovered soil condition.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of Proceed order G-2 in the amount of $350,000.
