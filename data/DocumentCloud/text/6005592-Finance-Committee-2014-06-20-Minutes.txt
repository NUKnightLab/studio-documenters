VI. Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (Attachment #5)
This item was taken out of order.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Clinical Integration, provided an
introduction to the update on financial matters. Following are his verbatim comments that he provided.
I want to comment on impressions at the 18 month mark of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as
it is being exercised in our area. It is important to remind ourselves that the realities that are
shaping the strategic direction that the organization decided to go in 2012 are very real.
Those included two phenomena outside Cook County. One, being the passage and the
testing, and passing the test in the Supreme Court of the ACA in 2012; the second being the
decision of the General Assembly in Springfield in 2011, that by 2015, 50% of the State’s
Medicaid enrollees would be in Managed Medicaid. The operational impact of that and
expectation was that 100% of Medicaid enrollees in the County of Cook would be in
Managed Medicaid by January of 2015. So those realities were really the drivers that
prompted the organization to take the opportunity that it could, with a lot of support to get the
waiver for the Demonstration Project that we now know as CountyCare.
CountyCare is having the exact desired effect for which it was designed, and I want to talk
about that with a little bit of the clinical and human face of that. We’re going to hear about the
financial parts of that, and appropriately spend a lot of time on that, but it is really important to
recognize that the organization has now reached out to and initiated applications from at
least half of the estimated eligible enrollees for Medicaid expansion in this County, and that is
a signal achievement. I saw on a news feed this morning that no less than David Frum was
actually suggesting to the Illinois Legislature that they should repeal Medicaid expansion
because of the problems that we’re seeing with the bills being paid for people who were
dead. Obviously that kind of fraud and abuse is something that can happen with a large
program, but the intention of getting care, coverage and access for people who are poor and
uninsured and unable to access health care, is a very serious one.
As Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, laid out last month, our members that
we have enrolled into the Medicaid Managed Care plan of CountyCare are young and old,
male and female, and they’re diverse - they represent the people that we work for. They live
in every part of this country - they’re real people with real health needs, and now their needs
are being met in an organized and coordinated fashion, I think, for the first time.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (continued)
I want to just highlight a couple of these stories, because these are the stories that get lost in
the numbers.
This story (http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-03/news/ct-acamedicaid-expansion-met-20140203_1_health-insurance-cook-county-health-health-care) that
ran in the Chicago Tribune, was around a former nurse named Lela Morgan, who lived for
years without health insurance. She used to have to travel for simple needs like blood
pressure management that would culminate in complications like kidney disease, stroke and
heart disease later on. Forty-five minutes from her home and wait an hour ED to get a simple
refill for her blood pressure medications. Now enrolled in CountyCare, she is seeing a
primary care physician fifteen minutes from her home, where she can get ongoing
coordinated care in a geographically easier manner. And one that can provide continuity that
should pay off and forestall some of those serious complications.
We also saw stories (http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-26/health/ct-managed-caremedicaid-aca-met-20140427_1_health-care-system-care-program-affordable-care-act
and
http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2014/01/29/countycare ) in the Chicago Tribune and on
WTTW’s Chicago Tonight program about Richard Romanowski, who is a musician from Old
Town with a number of chronic medical problems, including high cholesterol, high blood
pressure and diabetes. Without insurance, he was forced to make decisions between
groceries and a $30 co-pay for visits, and that was a burden that he couldn’t keep up with.
He is now impaneled in primary care at one of our federally-qualified health centers (FQHC),
Erie Health Center. And now, again, just like Ms. Morgan, he is getting coordinated primary
care that should be able to put off some of the complications that would be much more
expensive in the long run.
Finally, I think many people saw this story (http://politics.suntimes.com/article/chicago/hedoesn%E2%80%99t-have-home-he%E2%80%99s-got-health-insurance-%E2%80%94-andhope/fri-06062014-744pm) in the Chicago Sun-Times recently, about Mr. Bochenek. Mr.
Bochenek was brought into CountyCare as a result of our outreach and partnership with
Heartland Health Alliance. This is centered on the Near North and Northwest side, taking
care of predominantly homeless populations. And I think it was surprising to a lot of people, it
was certainly surprising to me, to read through this story and see how this gentleman, who
has been homeless for almost two years, is actually coordinating his own care, and as the
story recounted, was making sure he had the right referrals after he had a fall that resulted in
some orthopedic injuries, and that he was now able to get those referrals - even though he
is homeless, he is managing those problems.
So it is really important to recognize that CountyCare is touching real people. Starting with
CountyCare was a way to more efficiently achieve the mission of our organization that we
have had historically, and to do it in a way that was relevant to realities that were set out by
the federal government and the state government ahead of us. Without a strategy to grow
and maintain our Medicaid population, this organization would have really, I think,
degenerated into irrelevance and into worse fiscal problems than the ones that we have
always historically faced in taking care of the uninsured.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (continued)
CountyCare is a start-up health plan. The patients that it cares for do not have an accessible
claims history; this is so different from an organization taking on, for instance, people with
well-described health problems, like the family health plan patients who are the seniors and
persons with disabilities, where the State and the federal government have years of claims
histories to predict the future utilization. This was terra incognita - these people, by
definition, have been historically uninsured. They go to multiple places for their care, and
there’s no single database that can tell you where and how Ms. Morgan, Mr. Romanowski
and Mr. Bochenek used health care over the last ten years. So we had to take a certain
amount of unpredictability into this. We knew that this was going to be a large scale, large
dollar preposition, but I want you to know and you’ll see as we go through this, that the
bottom line on the Cook County Health and Hospitals System’s finances has been a positive.
We have to remember that CountyCare, even though it is a managed care plan, is not
independent of the Health System; rather, it is a tool for the Health System to more effectively
manage the patients that we’ve historically taken care of.
Phase One of that health plan was all about enrollment; attracting, taking applications,
enrolling and growing the plan, and with a plan like this, if you don’t have size, you won’t be
successful in the long run. We got political support, appropriately, from a lot of partners,
including all of those federally-qualified health centers that are in our network now. At the
same time that we’ve been building this business, though, we have maintained our traditional
business of being a provider. So this is the managed care plan, and we have continued to be
a provider to all the people who need our many doors across the County. Many people think
or thought that there was going to be some magic associated with this managed care plan
and that it was going to be some kind of a profit center for the Health System. It is very
important to recognize that when the ACA was devised and we were given the waiver, it was
not meant to underwrite a lot of the other care in the Health System. What it was meant to do
was expand Medicaid and pay for the health care costs associated with people who are
eligible for Medicaid under the expansion. Not anything more and not anything less than
that.
We did know that before Medicaid Managed Care and before CountyCare, this organization
historically had been spending $500-600 million on uncompensated care. This was an
opportunity for us to bring in resources that would offset those significant dollars. As you’ll
see this morning, the initial costs of this program are indeed high, but I want to remind us that
people are, in fact, getting care. The reality is, that historically we’ve been paying for these
emergency room visits and unplanned visits for routine things like prescription refills, and in
the long run, CountyCare will pay off and will reduce costs related to this. As you’ll see,
CountyCare brought into the Health System more than $100 million in payments that this
Health System historically would not have seen without it. If we can make Cook County
Health and Hospitals System more accessible and more satisfying to the people that we’re
taking care of under CountyCare, we should see even greater benefit in the years to come.
We’ll talk about that as part of our strategies going forward to improve the finances of
CountyCare.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (continued)
We had a meeting this week with Health System leadership, and we shared much of this
information and talked with them at a high level on how we need to improve clinical
operations and how we need to improve access to care for our patients, particularly in the
ambulatory and diagnostic environment, and how, if we didn’t do that in a way that was
convenient and pleasing as an experience to the patients that we serve, we would lose that
business, and that will be a formula for failure of this kind of plan. I think we’ll be able to
deliver on that. The senior leadership has been tasked with developing and executing a fullscale plan to vastly improve everything from scheduling, creating capacity within our
ambulatory system, after-hours call support, and the like. These things will be critically
important, and we will report back to the Board on how we’re doing on that, overall as it
progresses.
I do want to just reiterate, though, one last thing. While the short-term goal of the ACA was
to provide immediate coverage to these individuals and others without it, the long-term goal is
bending the cost curve - we recognize that and take that very seriously. The vignettes that I
shared with you this morning are only a snapshot, but the real story should be thought of in
terms of tens of thousands of individuals who today have health care. They’ve got primary
care access, specialty care access, behavioral health and prescription medication access,
that they didn’t have before. So I’d ask us all to be serious as we look at the finances about
this, but to recognize that behind those finances are tens of thousands of individuals who are
benefiting from this program. Thank you for the opportunity to set that context .
Following Dr. Shannon’s comments, John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, reviewed the
information presented in his update on financial matters. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
With regard to the information provided on the calculation relating to the repayment of $33,464,575, Director
Hammock asked Mr. Cookinham to confirm that, under the waiver in 2013, the System had to make this
repayment, but post-waiver, the System will get 100% and it does not have to repay. Mr. Cookinham
responded affirmatively.
Board Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the repayment amount is finalized, or whether the amount is an
estimate of the repayment. Mr. Cookinham responded that this amount was the estimate that was included in
the audited financial statements; however, it is subject to review once the System files its cost report, which is
then reconciled with the State by the end of November. If in fact there are other expenses that have not yet
been accounted for, or are learned about after the audit is done, but before the System has to pay that amount
back, then the repayment amount could go down.
Board Chairman Carvalho provided a medical analogy to describe the issue. When a person is suffering from a
fatal disease, and someone says, “here is a lifesaving cure. There might be some side effects during the
treatment, but it will save your life,” so the person agrees to the treatment to save their life. The person starts
the course of treatment, and after a couple of months into the treatment, the person says they don’t like the side
effects. That is a foolish way of looking at things.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (continued)
Chairman Carvalho stated that, in the past, Medicaid was the primary source of funding, and a fee-for-service
intergovernmental transfer (IGT)-funded fee-for-service system was reasonably good for the System. But
going forward, the State is saying that 50% of Medicaid in the State is going to be in managed care; the only
way that the System is going to get that mathematically is basically to say 100% of Medicaid in the County is
going to be managed care. Staying in a fee-for-service with an IGT arrangement was not going to be one of the
choices, because that arrangement is going away. So the question was, did the System want to be a plan or did
it want to be a provider to other plans? If an entity wants to be a provider to other plans, those plans have to
want that entity to be in their plan. That entity has to be low-cost, located where they want the entity to be,
providing great customer service, and then maybe they’ll let the entity in the plan at whatever rate they
negotiate with it. If an entity is a provider, it does not control its own destiny.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that the System’s destiny is not to exist simply to exist. CountyCare was a
survival strategy. Historically, maybe people thought that under a different form of governance, the reason the
System survived was to provide jobs and contracts. It does not survive for that - it survives because hundreds
of thousands of people will continue to be uninsured when the ACA goes into place. There are going to be
people who slip between the cracks of the exchange and Medicaid expansion and the like. The System has
always historically been there for them and it needs to continue to survive to be there for them. The only
survival strategy that this Board saw under the vision that was shared by the former Chief Executive Officer,
Dr. Ram Raju, was to survive as a plan, not as a provider to other plans. It was, is, and remains the path to
survival to be that safety net for the people who need a safety net, and it involves certain start-up costs, certain
bumps along the way that were fully anticipated - exact numbers might not have been anticipated, but it was
certainly anticipated that they would be there. So in some respects, there are people who are looking at this and
saying that they did not expect this; that is a shortcoming of their imagination, not something gone wrong here.
For those who might say to abandon CountyCare, they need to recognize that abandoning CountyCare means
no survival path for this System. It can’t go back to fee-for-service, and it cannot survive as a provider to other
plans. It needs to be the plan to control its own destiny. This repayment was built in from the beginning and
was one of the elements of operating under the waiver. Operating under the waiver meant that when January
1st came around, the System had tens of thousands of patients already enrolled in the System – it was beneficial
to get that head start in enrollment with the waiver, before the January 1, 2014 date.
Director Collens inquired whether this information suggests that CountyCare operated much more efficiently
than was predicted, and whether this in fact is a benefit to the taxpayers. Board Chairman Carvalho responded
affirmatively. Mr. Scheer requested that Mr. Cookinham provide an idea of what the finances would have
looked like had there not been CountyCare for that particular year. Mr. Cookinham responded that, for
example, if one looks at the CountyCare pharmacy costs, without CountyCare, the System would have
provided some of that expense to people coming to the System, without reimbursement. Another example is
the line detailing the cost of CCHHS Services for 2013 – that was $113 million under CountyCare. A lot of the
people who are covered under CountyCare came to the System in the past, and they were a population that was
not previously insured; this was a population that received care from the System, but the System did not
receive reimbursement for that care. CountyCare provided over $100 million of reimbursement of expenses
that the System potentially would have incurred anyway. Mr. Scheer stated that, if he looked at it both ways,
there would be a gain here to the County of maybe $70-90 million during this particular year; he asked Mr.
Cookinham to confirm. Mr. Cookinham concurred, and stated that he believes that it is in excess of $116
million.

Report from Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on Financial Matters (continued)
Director Gugenheim stated that, once an entity starts managing people’s care, the expenses in the short run are
greater, but in the long run, over the person’s lifetime, the expenses are going to become more manageable.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, from a patient perspective, their chronic diseases are being addressed
better, and their health will be improved through care management - all the good things that happen in
managed care is something that can be accomplished here.
Dr. Shannon stated that this is a group of individuals that the System is caring for now who for many years
have not had insurance. He cautioned that one cannot be too optimistic about how quickly they will
acculturate to an insurance state. It will take some time - these are individuals who have never had a primary
care physician, they are going to be challenged with health literacy, challenged with and perhaps even
suspicion of the systems that they encounter or the support they might get from an individual over the phone.
It will take time for them to become accustomed to a state where they have got a support team with them, not
just a medical home. I think the experience that has been seen in some of the other states that are ahead of
Illinois in Medicaid expansion has been that an overnight reduction in emergency room visits is not
experienced, or overnight improvement in people’s health status is not achieved; however, those should be
expected in the medium distance.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Hammock, moved to receive and file the
update on financial matters. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. FY2015 Budget Update (Attachment #6)
Aaron Galeener, System Director of Budget, reviewed a presentation regarding the FY2015 Budget. The
