Thomas Pavich and Michael Chambers, Department of Public Works, presented. Dale Miller asked if this
process will be simpler once the Enterprise Resource Planning System is fully implemented.
Trevor McAleer asked if the department would need to return for approval to increase the amount if the
threshold is met for any vendor on the approved list; asked if an exemption already exists for legal
advertisement as the Plain Dealer is listed as one of the vendors included in this process and commented
that he was not aware that a threshold was set for the Plain Dealer as they are the only option for
advertising.

 Lenora Lockett clarified that the action taken by the Board for legal advertisements was an exemption
from a bidding process that capped each advertisement at $2,500.00 rather than a cumulative amount
but does not exempt approval for the purchase by the Board. Ms. Lockett elaborated on the County Code
requirements as it relates to bidding and approval processes and clarified Mr. Pavich’s presentation that
most advertisements for construction projects exceed $1,000.00.
Mr. McAleer asked what the advantage to approving this request for $15,000.00 for advertising services
would be and when would a department order need to be submitted for approval; and asked if this
process satisfies the Fiscal Office requirements.
Angela Rich said her office has been working with Public Works and other agencies to permit a blanket
purchase order, per vendor where multiple, individual payments under $500.00 each can be made against
the encumbered amount of the blanket purchase order; provided clarification that the Ohio Revised Code
requires purchases over $1,000.00, per vendor, be encumbered and said that this process will comply with
those requirements. Ms. Rich cautioned that this process will be lengthy in the new Enterprise Resource
Planning System during phase 1, which encompasses requisitions and purchase orders, but will address
situations like this and believes it will be an improvement.
Nan Baker asked for clarification that items will not come to the Board of Control for approval as long as
the total amount, per vendor is not exceeded, as well as clarification on the difference between the new
and current processes.
Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Michael Chambers seconded. Item BC2019-184 was
unanimously approved.

Greg Huth, Department of Development, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the $1,000.00 threshold for
payments to vendors is by department or the County as a whole and asked if the $1,000.00 maximum for
2019 has been reached for this vendor; Angela Rich responded by stating that the maximum cap is by
vendor, not department and that the maximum has been reached for the Plain Dealer for 2019. Mr.
McAleer asked if an exemption and encumbrance of funds will be required for any department advertising
for bids, even if they are below $500.00, since that threshold has been reached. Angela Rich stated that
is correct and that during checks runs, the Fiscal Office staff flags vouchers for vendors whose threshold

 has been reached and contacts the department to explain the appropriate process. Armond Budish
motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-190 was unanimously approved.

Funding Source: General Fund
Jeanelle Greene and Jeremy Mio, Department of Information Technology, presented. Nan Baker asked
why a new contract was not prepared, as it would be expected that services would continue past the
remaining 4 months and result in a cost increase; asked if the additional funds and services were
anticipated in 2018 and whether $50,000.00 is adequate to achieve security-related goals. Trevor McAleer
asked if the policy referred to in the department’s presentation was the Disaster Recovery Plan and
indicated that this plan was brought up during the State audits for multiple years. Mr. McAleer also asked
if the contract will provide the County with a plan that will satisfy the State Auditor’s requirements.

approved.

Revised Code Section 2329.26.
Funding Source: General Fund
Sergeant Joe Greiner and Alison Bilak, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Nan Baker asked why a not-toexceed amount is not being requested, as there is historical data available for the cost of advertising these
notices and asked if it is unusual to not include a dollar amount for this type of request. Lenora Lockett
stated it is a preference and strongly encouraged to include an amount when the amount can be
determined so that the contracting authority understands the financial impact; said that a conservative
value can be set and if that amount is exceeded, the department would bring forth an amendment to
increase the amount, if that is the Board’s recommendation. Trevor McAleer commented that his
preference would be to post notices on-line as opposed to print, to save money, but acknowledged that
is not possible, due to Ohio Revised Code requirements. Armond Budish commented that attempts were
made in Columbus, when he served in the House of Representatives, to change this requirement, but
were unsuccessful. Dale Miller said that the contract should be required to include the dollar amount but
is not required at this stage, as this request is only for the department to conduct an alternate
procurement process. Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item
