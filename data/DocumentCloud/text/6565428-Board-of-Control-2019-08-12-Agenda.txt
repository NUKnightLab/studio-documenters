to city government. Its members include 44 cities, 5 counties, and 59 universities. The Network’s mission is to pair
university researchers with city policymakers to undertake research, development, and deployment projects that
improve our infrastructure, public services, and environmental sustainability. Cuyahoga County is a member of the
MetroLab Network in partnership with Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. Attendance
at the conference will allow for Cuyahoga County to showcase the work we are doing with Case and Cleveland State
as part of the IoT collaborative. In addition, it will allow us to learn more about what other cities and counties are
doing in the areas of data analytics, smart communities and other innovative practices. As a member of MetroLab

BC2019-597
Funding Sources: Road & Bridge Fund, Sanitary Sewer Fund, Airport Operation Fund and Internal Service
Fund
Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Work is requesting to amend a resolution which authorized factory authorized
dealers to be utilized for parts, equipment, services and repairs to ensure compliance with equipment and
vehicle warranties and manufacturer safety standards. The factory authorized program also ensures
equipment and vehicles will return to normal operating efficiency more quickly, reducing down time. In
addition to reducing lengthy down time, diagnostic costs will be minimized and productivity and potential
billable hours in communities will increase due to quicker response times with vehicles and equipment
operating. What’s been experienced on many occasions, repairs, parts, and services require a factory
dealer to diagnose the problem before a quote can be generated. Current guidelines require three quotes,
and this requires a downed vehicle or piece of equipment to be moved to three different dealers for
39

 quotes, which delays the repairs and increases the cost of the repair. This exemption will allow the
department to take the vehicle or piece of equipment to the nearest “factory authorized” dealer that
meets the department’s needs for the repair, parts, or services.
The primary goal of this is to extend the time period of the factory authorized program that ends 3/23/20,
extending it until 12/31/20, and increase permissible funds by $450,000.00. This will allow Public Works
to work directly with factory authorized dealers on repairing and/or obtaining factory dealer equipment
and vehicles in a timely fashion.
Procurement
The procurement method utilized is an alternative procurement which will allow Public Works to
collaborate directly with the authorized dealers for specific vehicles and equipment for needed repairs
and/or equipment.

 History: CON2018-53
In May 2019, the Ohio Department of Corrections proposed awarding the Cuyahoga County Corrections
Planning Board (Cuyahoga County) $4,500,000.00 in T-CAP funds for the supervision and treatment of
low-level, non-violent offenders involved with the criminal justice system. One of the requirements to
become eligible for TCAP funding was the mandatory submission of a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) signed by the County Executive, Sheriff, Public Safety and Justice Chief and the Presiding and
Administrative Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. This required MOU was submitted to ODRC on
June 3, 2019. The accompanying TCAP grant application included a cost per diem payable to the County
Jail, should the number of remanded “TCAP eligible” offender bed day utilization annually to the County
Jail exceeded the original pre-TCAP year’s baseline number of post-conviction bed day utilization.
Pursuant to the TCAP grant language at no time could TCAP reimbursements to the Jail ever exceed 50%
of the total County TCAP award. The anticipated TCAP funding was incorporated in the State Budget that
was passed by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor in mid-June. The overall intent is to
reduce the Ohio prison population through these intervention services.
