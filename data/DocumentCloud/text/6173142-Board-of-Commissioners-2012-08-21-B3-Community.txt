Existing Communig Facilities

Fosco Park Community Center and a portion of the park located at 1312 8. Racine opened in 2006
providing primarily recreational opportunities with an indoor pool, gym, multi-purpose rooms and an
early childhood center. The remaining two acre park site to the south will be completed in 2012
providing additional green space with walking paths, a fountain and open lawn for play. Fosco Park
Community Center is owned and operated by the Chicago Park District.

1254 S. Loomis currently houses the ABLA LAC o?ice, Family Works program, food program, tenant
patrol, computer lab, Employment Plus, summer programming classrooms and community meetings.
This property is owned and operated by the Chicago Housing Authority and is planned for
rehabilitation to consolidate property management services from the 1324 S. Loomis site with the current

. 

resident services available for families residing at Brooks and Loomis Courts and to help save on
operational costs.

1324 S. Loomis currently houses property management services for Brooks and Loomis Courts
serving approximately 456 public housing residents. This building is owned and operated by the CHA
and is planned for demolition to provide up to two acres for future residential development.

Pro sed Communi Hub at Roosevelt uare

Community Hubs for the Roosevelt Square developments are planned under the comprehensive ABLA
HOPE VI redevelopment plan and will provide space similar to community centers at other new mixed
income development sites. Related Midwest and Heartland Housing, Inc. plan to develop the ?rst multi-
purpose Community Hub for Roosevelt Square and community residents near both Phases I and II. The
Hub will be owned and operated by Roosevelt Square 1 Limited Partnership and CHA will
enter into a long-term ground lease with the RSI LP for the property at the northeast comer of W.
Roosevelt and S. Throop Street.

Property Management and Supportive Service Provider Of?ces

This single story, approximately 7,300 square feet Community Hub will serve a broad cross section of
residents living in the area and will complement and expand existing resources in the neighborhood. Of
primary importance, the of?ces of Related Management and Heartland Human Care Services
currently housed in a temporary facility will have a permanent home in the Hub, which
will allow the two organizations to more effectively provide the property management and resident
services which are both key to a successful mixed income development. The Hub?s central location at W.
Roosevelt Rd. and S. Throop St. will encourage all residents of Roosevelt Square and ABLA, regardless
of income, to avail themselves of these key services, as well as engage in community building activities,
such as computer classes, social functions, and resident meetings.

Community Center Programming

Numerous services led by I-II-ICS and the development team are already underway at Roosevelt Square,
including arts programming and urban farming for youth, asset building, case management, and job skills
development. The Hub?s programming will build and expand on existing programming. Educational
opportunities such as employment and technology training are necessary for families to establish self-
suf?ciency, and ultimately, for Roosevelt Square to be a stable community. Depending on the residents
evolving needs and interests, programming may also include ?nancial education, leadership development,
small business incubation, and youth enrichment activities.

Moreover, the Hub will satisfy a need currently not addressed by existing community-serving facilities
such as the LAC Of?ce, which is focused on serving 456 public housing families and Fosco Park, which
focuses primarily on the provision of recreational space and programming.

Community Hub Budget
The development budget for the Hub is approximately $2.5 million and will be managed within the

constraints of the following approximate sources:

- $1,467,000 ABLA Homes HOPE VI funds from the Chicago Housing Authority, subject to
CHA Board and HUD approvals. The CHA Grant Administration Department anticipates
approval from HUD to increase the current $1,250,000 HOPE Vl funding commitment to
$1,467,000 for this Community Hub.

$950,000 - Grusecki Family Foundation has pledged $950,000. Of this amount, $475,000 will be
available at closing, planned for November 1, 2012. The remaining $475,000 is projected for
receipt over the next three years to repay $475,000 of the Ford Foundation construction funds.

$565,000 - Ford Foundation has committed approximately $565,000 toward the construction of
this facility through a combination of Grant and Project Related Investment funds. Of this

amount, $475,000 will be repaid to the Ford Foundation over three years with Grusecki Family
Foundation funds and $90,000 will remain as permanent ?nancing.

1252 W. Roosevelt Road; 2) Enter into a 99-year Ground Lease; 3) Commit up to $1,467,000 in HOPE
