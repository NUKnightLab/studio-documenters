GENERAL BACKGROUND
In 2008, in an effort to promote increased competition and improved services, the CHA
bifurcated the administration and operation of the Housing Choice Voucher Program between
two contractors: Quadel Consulting Corporation (Quadel) and CVR Associates, Inc. (CVR).
The term of the contract is for two years with an option to extend for an additional two year
period. The original term of the contracts will expire in December 2010. The CHA will extend
the services awarded to CVR (HCV Southwest Satellite Office; HCV Inspections; and Call
Center) for an additional two years pursuant to the contract option. The CHA determined that it
would be in the best interest of the HCV program if the services currently provided by Quadel
were solicited through a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) rather than by exercising the
option term available in Quadel’s contract.
The HCV Department desires to continue to foster competition and improve customer service
and has issued a Request for Proposal which covers the following seven areas of service: 1)
Waitlist & Admissions; 2) HCV Satellite Office South; 3) HCV Satellite Office Central; 4) HCV
Satellite Office West; 5) Landlord Services; 6) Project Based and Moderate Rehabilitation
Programs; and 7) Special Initiative Consulting.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
In August 2010, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) issued Request for Proposal No. 1000582 (“the RFP”) to solicit firms to administer and operate portions of the CHA Housing
Choice Voucher and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs. CHA advertised the RFP in the
Chicago Sun Times, El DIA, and the Chicago Defender. Solicitation notice was placed on Buy
Speed, the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (“PHADA”) website, the Council
of Large Public Housing Authorities (”CLPHA”) website, the Chicago Housing Authority
(“CHA”) website, the National Institute of Government Purchasing (“NIGP”) website, and the
National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (“NAHRO”) website. The CHA

 solicited one-hundred-forty-five (145) Vendors of which thirty-seven (37) were minority firms.
In total, sixty-four (64) vendors picked up the solicitation of which twenty (20) were minority.
A pre-proposal conference was held at CHA on Wednesday, August 18, 2010. The CHA issued
Addendum No.1 to provide additional detail on the Fee Proposal on Thursday, August 12, 2010.
Addendum No. 2 to respond to written questions submitted by potential respondents was issued
on Tuesday, August 31, 2010. On the Proposal due date Friday, September 10, 2010, the CHA
received twelve (12) written proposals; one of which was deemed non-responsible. The
Respondents to the RFP were: MD Strum Housing Services, Phoenix Solutions Management
Group, The Habitat Company, Applied Real Estate Analysis, Smart, MRF, Metropolitan
Voucher Partners, The Los Angeles LOMOD Corporation, Thomas & Herbert Consulting, Nan
McKay & Associates, VLV Development, and CVR Associates, Inc.
An Evaluation Committee was established with representatives from: Division of Finance,
Information Technology Services, Mixed Finance Portfolio, Resident Services and Housing
Choice Voucher Program. The Committee evaluated the written proposals for each Respondent
in each area of service responded to, excluding Special Initiative Consulting (this service area is
not included in this Recommendation). The Department of Procurement established a
“Competitive Range” for each service area: Wait List and Admissions = 76 and above; HCV
South Satellite Offices = 77 and above; HCV West Satellite Offices = 77 and above; HCV
Central Satellite Offices = 78 and above; Landlord Services = 75 and above; PBV and Mod
Rehab = 73 and above; and Special Initiative Consulting was not evaluated.
Based on the competitive ranges, three firms were invited to make an oral presentation to the
Evaluation Committee in the area of Wait List; HCV Satellite Offices; Landlord Services and;
PBV Mod Rehab. A fourth firm was invited to make presentations to PBV and Mod Rehab only.
Prepared questions requesting general information as well as additional information specific to
each proposal were provided to the four firms: Thomas & Herbert; Nan McKay & Associates,
LA LOMOD; and CVR Associates. Each firm brought their management team and
subcontractors to the CHA between September 29th and 30th for their presentations averaging 2.5
hours each.
The Evaluation Committee provided the Department of Procurement evaluation scores for each
firm in each area of service in which they presented. The CHA then began the process of
contacting the two highest scoring firms identified as providing the highest quality response and
personnel for the administration and operation of the Housing Choice Voucher Program to begin
negotiations of the Best and Final Offers. Upon further consideration of each Respondent
following the presentations and discussions, the HCV Dept. concluded that CVR and NMA
provide the best overall combination of industry expertise, experienced management personnel,
program approach and cost.
The CHA recommends adding an additional Satellite Office to CVR’s current portfolio as well
as to consolidate Landlord Services under their direct operations. CVR is a minority business
enterprise certified company specializing in consulting and operational services in the affordable
housing industry. CVR presented a strong written proposal and responded to the CHA’s oral
interview to clearly articulate their approach to program management and improvement. CVR’s
strength has been a strong partnership with community groups to address issues related to

60 East Van Buren Street, 12th Floor Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312) 913-7282· www.thecha.org

 program enforcement of landlord and participant responsibilities. CVR also proposes a strong
management team to oversee the expansion of their existing portfolio.
The CHA recommends award of Wait List and Admissions; PBV and Mod Rehab; West and
Central Satellite Offices to NMA. NMA was selected by the Evaluation Team based on the
quality of Approach and Work Plans, qualifications, experience, past performance, oral
interview, and the credentials of the on-site team presented to lead the efforts. All the proposed
managers have either led high performing agency’s in their career or have successfully led
troubled or standard performing HCV programs to recognized high performers within a matter of
years. Along with this dynamic leadership, one of the organization’s strengths is the depth of
knowledge of not only current HUD rules and regulations, but also on the industry leading
practices that may become the standard of every high performing HCV program in the future.
NMA is a large and long standing organization with over thirty (30) years in the affordable
housing and is a nationally recognized leader in training and consulting services. NMA has also
recently been awarded a contract with HUD, as subcontractor to another firm, to provide HCV
Business Process Improvement and Re-engineering for the HCV program nationwide that may
ultimately benefit CHA’s HCV Program.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to negotiate and enter into contract
with CVR Associates, Inc. and Nan McKay & Associates in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$29,860,708 for a two year base period.
