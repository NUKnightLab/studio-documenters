replacement unless the Department Head submits a written
justification to the Vehicle Steering Committee for the exception
which documents the extenuating circumstances.

d.

Only specialized equipment; such as heavy highway construction
equipment will be allowed to use other criteria such as hours of
service, however the criteria utilized by the Department should be
submitted to justify the vehicle replacement request, and the
Vehicle Steering Committee will determine if this information is
adequate and the maintenance cost information required.

e.

A request for a new vehicle which increases the number of
vehicles in the department's vehicle inventory shall be submitted
to the Vehicle Steering Committee with a written justification as to
why the additional vehicles will be required. Such request must
demonstrate that reassignment of existing vehicles would be
unable to meet department needs and that sufficient funding is

use intended for the vehicle, whether the vehicle will be assigned
with 'take home' privileges and whether the vehicle will bear a
municipal license plate.

f.

Departments shall submit draft vehicle requests to the Vehicle
Steering Committee at the same time they submit capital budget
requests to the Department of Budget and Management Services.
