Re: Joint Purchasing Agreement for Independent Inspector General Search
The Office of the President is hereby requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and
execute a Joint Purchasing Agreement for a professional services contract with David Gomez &

assisted the City of Chicago in the city’s recent reorganization of the Chicago Department of Human
Resources, wherein the city hired forty-three (43) director level employees; and, DGA assisted the city in
its recent search of the Superintendent of the Department of Police. Additionally, the City of Chicago
recently entered into an exclusive five (5) year master agreement with DGA for executive search services.
DGA will serve as a collaborative advisor to the Cook County Bar/Chicago Bar IIG Search Committee
(“Joint Search Committee”) and ensure a comprehensive and objective search process in an effort to
produce candidates for the position of IIG who are most qualified and truly independent.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: 1/3 of 1st Year Salary of Independent Inspector General; $50,000.00. Contract
period: February 1, 2008 through January 31, 2009. (490-260 Account). Requisition No. 84900050.

LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT REGARDING THE POSITION OF
CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF HUMAN RESOURCES
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 31, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
As you know, prior to being sworn into Office in December of 2006, I stood along side President Bobbie
Steele and Michael Shakman in order to show my support for the Supplemental Relief Order (“SRO”)
that was being executed by the County. In addition to my presence on the date of the passage of the SRO,
I further attended this meeting to show my support for the Ordinance amendment requiring the
prohibition of unlawful political discrimination.
Since being sworn in as President, I have further supported the principles and requirements of the SRO by
addressing the prohibition of unlawful political discrimination during televised Board Meetings and
Bureau Chief/Department meetings; furthermore, I have instructed my staff to address the principles and
requirements addressed in County Ordinances as well as the SRO to County employees through training
sessions, notices and postings on the County’s web-site. I have supported the efforts of the Compliance
Administrator and will continue to be supportive of efforts addressed in the SRO.

4927

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
I have been advised that the Compliance Administrator has provided you with correspondence regarding
her request to participate in this Administration’s search for a permanent Human Resources Chief. I
wanted to take this opportunity to advise you regarding the steps this Office has taken in the search for a
permanent Human Resource Chief and the role requested of Ms. Nowicki, as advised by the State’s
Attorneys Office.
In addition to personally meeting with Ms. Nowicki, on December 21, 2007 Ms. Nowicki was informed
in writing regarding the steps this Office has begun in its search for a permanent Human Resource Chief.
Ms. Nowicki was informed that a search for a permanent Human Resource Chief was publicly advertised
on the internet and that this Office had received over 65 resumes.
The notice of job opportunity was advertised indicating that the County was seeking a HR Chief with
superior interpersonal skills, a Bachelor’s Degree, Masters Degree preferred, 5-10 years Human Resource
experience and union labor and union contract negotiation experience.
In addition to the above, I have directed my staff to form a Committee that will be responsible for
reviewing the resumes that I have received and for that Committee to recommend three candidates for my
review and interview. The Committee shall consist of internal representation as well as employment
lawyers and human resource professionals. Should the Committee fail to recommend suitable candidates
for review, I may consider further recruitment options.
I have communicated to Ms. Nowicki that I would like for her to meet the members of the Committee
when finalized and speak with them regarding the principles of the SRO, the importance of the HR Chief
position as it relates to compliance with the SRO and the prohibition of unlawful political discrimination.
In addition to her presentation to the Committee, I have asked Laura Lechowicz Felicione, an internal
member of the Committee, to advise the Committee regarding the requirements of the SRO, the County’s
position on the prohibition of unlawful political discrimination, the current climate within the County and
the qualifications/characteristics needed for the HR Chief.
It is important for this Board to know what has been communicated to the Compliance Administrator by
this Office with the advice of Counsel and the steps that this Office has taken to obtain a highly qualified
candidate for position of Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources.

ROBERT B. STEELE AND LARRY SUFFREDIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called home John H. Stroger, Jr., the first
African-American to be elected President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, John Stroger was born in Helena, Arkansas on May 19, 1929 to John and Ella Stroger who
raised him during the Great Depression, instilling in him a strong work ethic and a moral sense of duty
and honor, allowing him to achieve academic success as a graduate of Xavier University in Louisiana;
and
WHEREAS, opportunities for professional advancement and personal success led John Stroger to come
to Chicago in 1953 and join Ralph Metcalfe’s Third Ward Regular Democratic Organization, a turn of
events which would impact the lives of millions; and
WHEREAS, in 1959 John Stroger would marry the love of his life, Yonnie, as the two of them started to
raise a family of their own, their daughter Yonnie Lynn and their sons Hans and Todd; and
WHEREAS, with the support of his family, John Stroger attended DePaul University College of Law and
earned his law degree in 1965 all while working full time; and
WHEREAS, John Stroger set out to make his own mark in Cook County Democratic Party politics by
becoming the first African-American Committeeman of the Eighth Ward in 1968, and he would begin to
make his mark in County government after his 1970 election to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, as Commissioner, John Stroger developed an unmatched knowledge and leadership of
County Government through his Chairmanship of every major Board Committee, his ascendancy to the
Chairmanship of the powerful Finance Committee and his election to the presidency of the National
Association of Counties; and
WHEREAS, John and Yonnie Stroger, devoted parents to all three of their children, were forced to
endure the tragic death of their son Hans in 1982, a dark time which would deepen John Stroger’s faith
and draw him even closer to his family; and
WHEREAS, his personal courage, political strength and professional success developed through both
triumph and tragedy would reinforce John Stroger’s conviction that he could bring positive change to the
lives of those around him, especially those served by Cook County Government; and

4929

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
WHEREAS, in 1994 John H. Stroger, Jr. was elected President of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, where he would serve for 12 years, a validation of the long hard fight President Stroger
waged to build a quality health care system which would serve the residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the lasting political and governmental legacy of President Stroger was his ability to focus
the County on an essential goal, the construction of a new Cook County Hospital which now bears his
name, and to have the political will to get done what was needed to bring quality health care to all; and
WHEREAS, those who remember John Stroger and take him to his rest today think not only of his
service to his County, but also think of the warm handshake, the loud reprimand or the gentle
encouragement; the concern he showed for our families, our neighbors and our futures; we remember the
open door to his office, his love of history, his loyalty to his party and to his friends and the love he had
for his wife, his children, his grandchildren and his entire family; we shall always cherish his almost
always ready smile and his hearty laugh which would fill the room with sound and easily disarm the most
vociferous of opponents; and
WHEREAS, we recall the words of the past few days of those who shared their remembrances of
President John Stroger: that “he treated everyone the same”; “everyone was important”; that “once he
gave you his word, he was there”; that he “changed the lives” of everyday residents throughout Cook
County; that he cared for the “little man”; that his politics were “never about being mean”; that he
provided thousands with the opportunity to excel and succeed; and that he fought for so many who may
not have been able to fight their fights alone.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners on behalf
of the residents of Cook County acknowledge the immense contributions of a political pioneer, a genuine
public servant, a loving father, grandfather, and uncle who was our friend and our colleague; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to the family of
President John H. Stroger, Jr. in honor of his good works and great deeds over a lifetime of service to the
five and a half million residents of Cook County.
Approved and adopted this 6th day of February 2008.

PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His Infinite Wisdom has called The Honorable Eugene Sawyer from our
midst; and
WHEREAS, beginning as a chemist working in Chicago’s Water Filtration Plant and active in Chicago’s
6th Ward Democratic Organization, Mr. Sawyer rose to become an alderman, a position he fulfilled with
distinction for 17 years; and
WHEREAS, in the historic days following the death of Mayor Harold Washington, as a political
maelstrom roiled and raged on, Mr. Sawyer was voted in as Acting Mayor, becoming Chicago’s second
African-American Mayor; and
WHEREAS, during this period of extreme divisiveness, Mr. Sawyer was a man of calm and reason, and
served as a bridge in the forging of compromises necessary for City Hall to serve its constituents; and
WHEREAS, in his position as Mayor, Mr. Sawyer proved to be a dedicated and highly effective public
servant of quiet resolve; during his administration a number of progressive reforms were passed,
including ethics reform and the historic Human Rights Ordinance, which had languished in the City
Council for years and which protected gays, lesbians and bisexuals from discrimination in the areas of
employment, housing, and public accommodations; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Sawyer helped to further heal Chicago’s political divide by continuing Mayor
Washington’s legacy of open and transparent government; and
WHEREAS, in losing Mayor Sawyer we have lost an honorable, humble, and thoughtful leader who
loved and served the City of Chicago and its people with devotion.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Mayor Sawyer’s memory shall be cherished in all of
the hearts of the people he touched and loved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and most
heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as to the many friends and loved ones of Mayor Eugene Sawyer.

RESOLUTION PROPOSING DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CARBON DIOXIDE REDUCTION PROGRAMS FOR
COOK COUNTY BUILDINGS
WHEREAS, there is a consensus among the world's leading scientists that global warming caused by
human emission of greenhouse gases is among the most significant problems facing the world today; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) estimates that commercial and
industrial buildings are responsible for nearly 50 percent of the national emissions of greenhouse gases
that contribute to global climate change; and
WHEREAS, the USEPA estimated that if the energy efficiency of commercial and industrial buildings in
the U.S. improved 10 percent, Americans would save an estimate $20 billion and reduce greenhouse
gases equal to emission from about 30 million vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners have shown environmental accountability by
recently approving resolutions in support of membership in the Chicago Climate Exchange and support of
the Robbins Community Power bio-mass power plant; and

4949

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
WHEREAS, President Todd H. Stroger sponsored and passed a resolution, in July 2007, to support Cook
County founding membership in the Sierra Club Cool Counties Climate Stabilization Declaration, which
challenges counties to create an inventory of our county government (operational) greenhouse gas
(“GHG”) emissions and implement policies, programs and operations to achieve significant, measurable
and sustainable reduction of those operational GHG emissions to help contribute to the regional reduction
targets; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners recently approved The Cook County Climate
Change Mitigation Act, sponsored by Commissioner Quigley, which requires Cook County, on January 1,
2009, to enter into a legally and financially binding agreement with Phase II of the Chicago Climate
Exchange CCX, committing to a reduction of 1.5 percent of its total greenhouse gas emissions from the
buildings and vehicles Cook County operates, equaling each year between 2006 and 2010; and
WHEREAS, once Cook County joins the Chicago Climate Exchange, Cook County will be required to
pay the Chicago Climate Exchange noncompliance fees for lack of meeting the required yearly CO2
reductions of approximately 4053 metric tons of CO2 for the FY 2007 and FY 2008 estimated at
$110,000.00 for both years within 90 days of signing the formal agreement and approximately $70,000.00
yearly until FY 2010; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control has began the process of
addressing its future commitments to Cool Counties Climate Stabilization Declaration and Chicago

Program to reduce the CO2 emissions from diesel vehicles in the Cook County Highway Department; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Environmental Control, in a collaborative effort with the
Bureau of Administration’s Department of Industrial Engineering, the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy, the Sheriff’s Office, the Bureau of Health Services and the Purchasing Department, recently

that would be able to guarantee results reducing Cook County’s CO2 emissions and energy expenditures
from Cook County largest facilities; and
WHEREAS, guaranteed energy saving programs have been implemented for counties and cities across
the United States, by ESCos, by implementing energy efficiency retrofit programs utilizing EnergyStar
supported products and the use of renewable and sustainable energy technologies. Implementation of
these energy efficiency programs has been able to reduce utility cost by hundreds of thousands of dollars
yearly for the customers of ESCos; and
WHEREAS, ESCo will identify and evaluate energy-saving opportunities with an industrial energy audit
of Cook County facilities and then recommend a package of improvements to be paid for through savings.
The ESCo will guarantee that savings meet or exceed annual payments to cover all project costs—usually
over the contract term. In the event the savings do not materialize, the ESCo pays the difference.
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioners appreciates the need to assess each energy
efficiency and carbon dioxide reduction initiative in an effort to: 1) determine the fiscal, personnel, and
operational impact on the using department or agency affected by the initiative; 2) determine whether
fiscal, personnel, and operational resources exist for implementation of said proposed initiative; and, 3)
conduct a cost-benefit-analysis of the initiative so as to determine whether the initiative can be sustained

WHEREAS, the reduction represents 17 percent, or $350 million dollars, of the FY2006 total operating
budget of $500 million dollars, $150 million dollars of which was managed through the restructuring of
debt; and
WHEREAS, since the President presented 17 percent cut as a suggested target, rather than a mandate,
where “some areas of county government will sustain cuts greater than 17 percent, while most will see
cuts of less than that amount,” several departments and independently elected county executive officers
did not achieve the 17 percent reduction; and
WHEREAS, at the reconvened meeting of the Finance Committee on January 22, 2008, the Committee
directed that all General Fund Cook County Departments (except the Treasurer, Department of
Corrections, and Juvenile Temporary Detention Center) be required to meet a 13 percent reduction from
the FY2008 Executive Budget Recommendation; and
WHEREAS, as the Board examines a 13 percent across-the-board spending reduction for FY2008, it
should also reexamine the failure of several departments and independently elected county executive
officers to achieve the 17 percent reduction from FY2007; and
WHEREAS, requiring these departments and independently elected county executive officers to
complete the 17 percent reduction either through making cuts by focusing on their core mission and
consolidating administrative functions, or increasing revenues by enhancing automation and technology
and other innovative methods, will maintain equity and credibility in the budget process and will achieve
a total savings of $103,452,236 to the taxpayers of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners directs the
following departments and independently elected county executive officers (with the exception of the
Bureau of Health Services) to achieve the 17 percent reduction from the FY2008 Executive Budget
Recommendation: Bureau of Human Resources, 4.4%; Office of the County Commissioners, 0.6%;
County Assessor, 4.2%; Board of Review, 9.2%; County Treasurer, 8.7%; Recorder of Deeds, 2.6%;
State’s Attorney, 11.5%; Public Administrator, 10.4%; Chief Judge, 9.4%; Chief Administrative Officer,
9.9%; Sheriff, 13.7%; and Clerk of the Circuit Court, 10.0%; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the aforementioned departments and independently elected county
executive officers submit their budget plans to the Chair and the Members of the Committee on Finance
by February 19, 2008.

THE HONORABLE EARLEAN COLLINS, COUNTY COMMISSIONER
A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
AND CONGRESS TO AMEND THE PROPOSED ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE TO
RESPOND TO THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL WARMING, ASSISTING OUR AUTOMOTIVE
INDUSTRY, REPAIRING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR MAJOR TRANSPORTATION
SYSTEMS AND REDUCING THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THROUGH
JOB TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, our core mission is public safety, healthcare to the indigent and to protect the welfare of the
people of Cook County. Dwindling resources from the State and Federal government poses serious stain
on the taxpayers of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, we recognize the declining state of our national economy and its direct impact on our ability
to secure the necessary revenue to adequately fulfill our mission; and
WHEREAS, the President’s recognition of the need to stimulate the economy cannot go unappreciated
however, the President’s plan of action is not well conceived and focuses on only a temporary fix to the
most immediate problems rather than maximizing the use of dollars to accomplish our economic goals
while at the same time addressing some of the most critical problems facing our nation such as: the
impact of global warming, the need for alternative energy sources, improvement of our basic
infrastructure, the need for retooling our automobile industry with a focus on building environmentally
safe vehicles and less dependency on foreign oil, and job creation for the unemployed; and
WHEREAS, all of these issues are critical to the growth and the vitality of our country and it is critical
that we seek ways by which to solve multiple problems by using the same dollar; and
WHEREAS, we can address the economic problem and the global warming problem at the same time by
creating jobs that work to improve our dams, bridges and shoreline, jobs in the automobile industry
producing energy efficient vehicles, and jobs in the field of science and technology for the creation of
alternative energy sources.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the President of the United States and Congress to carefully consider
reinvesting the estimated handouts to taxpayers and begin the process of building a more solid base for
economic prosperity and taking a step toward minimizing the impact of global warming and creating a
safer environment; and

for each fund, and as such are in violation of 55 ILCS 5/6-24002; and
WHEREAS, under this statute the maximum amount of money that can be held in
contingency accounts is approximately $60 million.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners

WHEREAS, receiving these audits at such a late date makes it increasingly difficult for the

action with regards to any shortfalls that may be discovered; and
WHEREAS, this is not consistent with the best practices and procedures of private sector
organizations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR GENERAL
WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon governments to be good stewards of the taxpayers money
and to foster public trust; and
WHEREAS, the County Auditor is responsible for providing timely audits of the various
county agencies and departments; and
WHEREAS, financial statements should be audited within 6 months of the close of each
fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the County Auditor alone cannot accomplish this task without sufficient
assistance and resources; and
WHEREAS, the Auditor position should be replaced with that of an Auditor General who
would preside over a legislative office that would be responsible for providing timely audits

independent from political influence, with a supermajority vote required to remove the
Auditor General from office; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Auditor General have sufficient personnel and resources
to perform the necessary audits in a timely manner; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has an Auditor General’s office that is governed under 30

County Auditor General’s Office.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CREATION OF A FIVE YEAR OPERATING BUDGET PLAN
WHEREAS, the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners are charged with
passing a budget each fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the County is experiencing a substantial budget shortfall; and
WHEREAS, the current financial situation is caused, at least in part, by a failure to plan
ahead for future years; and
WHEREAS, the County employs many long-term planning techniques, which include the
projection of multi-year revenue trends; and
WHEREAS, the County should also develop a formal long term plan that is reviewed by the
Board of Commissioners and other elected officials; and
WHEREAS, this should take the form of the County Board President submitting revenue and
expenditure estimates for the next five fiscal years along with narrative explanations of
assumptions made in order to reach such projections.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby direct the President and the Department of Management and Budget Services

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN RESOLUTION (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica,
County Commissioner.

5041

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
WHEREAS, employees of the County of Cook are covered by a pension plan which is based
on defined benefits rather than defined contributions; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is a rather generous one which often allows County
retirees to draw out a much greater amount than that which they have contributed; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan provides no incentive for County employees to invest
greater amounts in their own future; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is one which places a great financial burden on the
County taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, the pension benefits for current County employees and retirees are guaranteed
by the Illinois Constitution of 1970 and governed under 40 ILCS 5/9; and
WHEREAS, it is possible for the Illinois General Assembly to create a new retirement
system for new hires; and
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the County create an alternative retirement package in order to
reduce the burden placed on the taxpayers by the current system; and
WHEREAS, a defined contribution retirement system would encourage County employees
to contribute larger percentages to their salaries in order to yield greater benefits; and
WHEREAS, any newly derived system should allow for greater employee involvement in
investment decisions; and
WHEREAS, such a system should be portable so that employees leaving County service
could roll their benefits over to another system; and
WHEREAS, the federal government adopted the Thrift Savings Plan, a portable, defined
contribution plan for their employees in 1986, which allows participants to choose from 6
alternative funds; and which currently covers more than 3 million participants; and
WHEREAS, the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan allows employees to contribute up
to 10% of their salary to their retirement fund; and
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 01-09-08.

The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Murphy, Vice Chairman Butler, Commissioners Gorman, Silvestri, Sims and

Absent:

Commissioners Beavers, Moreno and Schneider (3)

Also Present:

Elizabeth Melas - Deputy Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy; and Zelda
Whittler - Undersheriff, Office of the Sheriff

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Wednesday, January 30, 2008 at the hour of 11:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
291502

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2007:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with ROULA ASSOCIATES ARCHITECTS, CHTD.,
Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for Qualifications/Proposals process. The
services required are design and construction administration for the Residential Treatment
Unit - Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RTU-RCDC) Project at the Department of
Corrections. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Department of
Corrections Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC or intake facility)
which processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC) and
Cermak Health Services of Cook County and a Residential Treatment Unit
(RTU). The program includes new intake, holding, and processing areas, clinics,
medical services and associated administrative functions, dormitories and
auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years, this system has had to respond to
the demands of increasing numbers of inmate admissions and mental health
evaluations and treatment. The existing RCDC and RTU facilities can no longer
accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care required. The
facilities are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are
outdated and in some cases non-functional.
The new facility will meet current “Essential Standards” set by the National
Commission on Correctional Health Care and the American Correctional
Association which are required for maintaining accreditation, and will provide
for an efficient and orderly intake process including screening and provision of
care.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,300,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 01/09/08.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Bruce Washington, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2007:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a
professional services contract with DELTA ENGINEERING, INC., Chicago, Illinois,
selected from the Request for Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are
design and construction administration for the HVAC Upgrade for Buildings 3 and 4 located

can be removed by detainees for egress or dissembled for parts. The provision of
central air conditioning throughout the two buildings will eliminate this security
risk and provide more efficient climate control and energy conservation.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health & Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Tuesday, January 22, 2008 at the hour of 2:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the

291516

COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL ASSESSMENT ORDINANCE (PROPOSED ORDINANCE).
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Todd H. Stroger, President, Forrest Claypool,
Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored
by William M. Beavers, Jerry Butler, John P. Daley, Gregg Goslin, Roberto Maldonado,
Joseph Mario Moreno, Joan Patricia Murphy and Deborah Sims, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY HOSPITAL ASSESSMENT ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 38 Health
and Human Services, Article IV, Sections 38-56 through 38-63 are hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 38-56.
Sec. 38-57.
Sec. 38-58.
Sec. 38-59.
Sec. 38-60.
Sec. 38-61.
Sec. 38-62.
Sec. 38-63.

Definitions.
Assessment.
Exemptions.
Payment of assessment; penalty.
Notice.
Disposition of proceeds.
Applicability.
Hospital access preservation payments.

Effective Date:

This Ordinance shall become effective immediately upon passage.

*Referred to the Committee on Health & Hospitals on 01/09/08.
Chairman Butler asked David R. Small, Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services to address the
Commissioners.
Mr. Small gave the Commissioners a brief overview regarding the State Fiscal Year 2008
Intergovernmental Transfer for Supplemental Payments. Mr. Small provided the Commissioners with a
chart that speaks to how the Intergovernmental Transfer for Supplemental Payments works. (The
referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

5063

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
Further, Mr. Small stated that in terms of the existing Illinois Plan it is due to expire on June 30, 2008,
which means that on July 1, 2008 a new plan needs to be in place or the Federal matching dollars that
come in to help fund the Medicaid Program and the State will not be available. Mr. Small also stated that
Cook County receives zero dollars under the current Illinois plan which is due to sunset. Under the
proposed Illinois Hospital Association (IHA) Model Cook County also would receive zero dollars.
However, under the proposed County Ordinance Safety Net Alternative Model, the County is looking at a
split to be negotiated with the State of approximately $150 million or perhaps as much as $75 million
which still needs to be negotiated.
In conclusion, Mr. Small stated it is incredibly critical from a timing perspective that a plan be put
forward, this is the only plan at this point and time that is on the table that has stated benefits for Cook
County and for the Bureau of Health Services. Under the Proposed Ordinance the dollars that would be
assessed on the hospitals located in Cook County would be collected by the County and put into a trust
fund and forwarded to the State so that the State remains in control in terms of drawing down the
matching funds and distributing those dollars according to State Plan, but Cook County would not be in
control of those dollars.
Commissioners Claypool, Gorman and Suffredin were added as sponsors and Commissioner
Maldonado was added as a Co-Sponsor.
Chairman Butler asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

as evidenced by the Note Register at the close of business on the applicable Regular Record Date, which
check or draft shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America and mailed to the address

proper agent.
If so provided in the Note Order, the Note may be redeemable or prepayable prior to maturity at the

Officer and County Clerk, as they shall determine, and in case any officer whose signature shall appear on
the Note shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of the Note, such signature shall nevertheless be
valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officer had remained in office until delivery.
The execution by the County of the fully registered Note shall constitute full and due authorization of the
Note, and the Note Registrar shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and deliver the Note. The
person in whose name the Note shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the absolute owner
thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of or interest on the Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of the registered owner thereof or the owner’s legal representative. All such payments

Section 2.5.
Sale and Delivery of Note: The Chief Financial Officer is hereby authorized to sell all
or any portion of the Note to the Purchaser from time to time as the Chief Financial Officer shall
determine that the proceeds of such sales are needed and on such terms as he may deem to be in the best
interests of the County. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall limit the sale of the Note or any
portion thereof or any maturity or maturities thereof at a price or prices in excess of the principal amount
thereof. Subsequent to the sale of the Note or subsequent to the sale of any portion thereof, the Chief
Financial Officer shall file in the office of the County Clerk a Note Order directed to the Board
identifying (i) the terms of the sale, (ii) the amount, if any, of the Note being sold as a Floating Rate Note,
(iii) the Dated Date, (iv) the aggregate principal amount of the Note sold, (v) the repayment schedule for
the principal of and interest on the Note, (vi) the optional redemption provisions, if any, applicable to the
Note, (vii) whether the Note is Tax Exempt or Taxable and (viii) any other matter authorized by this
Ordinance to be determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of sale of the Note, and thereafter
the Note as so sold shall be duly prepared and executed in the form and manner provided herein and
delivered to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of sale.
Any Designated Officer and such other officers of the County as may be necessary are hereby authorized
to execute such other documents, as may be necessary to implement the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and to effect the issuance and delivery of the Note, and execution thereof by such
officers is hereby deemed conclusive evidence of approval thereof with such changes, additions,
insertions, omissions or deletions as such officers may determine, with no further official action of or
direction by the Board.

provide funds for the payment of necessary expenses incurred for the general corporate purposes of the
County and to that end shall be set aside in the Working Cash Fund (the “Working Cash Fund”) and shall

procedures of the County.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Note to one or more other
funds or accounts of the County now in existence. The County by its Board reserves the right, as it
becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of the Working Cash Fund
or its accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute
projects, in order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the tax
covenants of the County relating to the Tax Exempt status of interest on the Note if it is issued as Tax
Exempt.
Section 2.7.
General Tax Covenants: In the event that the Note is issued as Tax Exempt, the
provisions of this Section shall apply. The County covenants that it will take no action with respect to the
proceeds of the Note which would result in making the interest payable on the Note subject to federal
income taxes by reason of the Note being classified as an “arbitrage bond” within the meaning of
Section 148 of the Code or rulings or regulations promulgated thereunder.
The County also agrees and covenants with the purchaser and registered owner of the Note from time to
time outstanding that, to the extent possible under Illinois law, it will comply with whatever federal tax
law is adopted in the future which applies to the Note and affects the status of the interest on the Note as
Tax Exempt, if the Note is issued as Tax Exempt; that without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further specific covenants, representations and
assurances as may be necessary or advisable; (b) to comply with all representations, covenants and
assurances contained in a certification regarding tax exemption to be prepared by counsel approving the
Note; (c) to consult with such counsel and to comply with such advice as may be given; (d) to pay to the
United States, as necessary, such sums of money representing required rebates of excess arbitrage profits
5087

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
relating to the Note; (e) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may be required and
in a timely manner; and (f) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ and pay fiscal
agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such compliance; and that
the County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service of the
exemption from Federal income taxation for interest paid on the Note, under present rules, the County is
treated as the “taxpayer” in such examination.
Section 2.8.
Registered Form: The County agrees that it will not take any action to permit the Note,
if it is issued as Tax Exempt, to be issued in, or converted into, bearer or coupon form.
ARTICLE III. MISCELLANEOUS

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES
PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for the purchase of floor care
products for Oak Forest Hospital Cook County and Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Contract period: June 6, 2008 through June 5, 2010. (897-330 and 898-330 Accounts). Requisition Nos.

CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute contracts with the following
vendors for commercial nursing registry services for the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of
Cook County, Cermak Health Services of Cook County, the Department of Public Health, the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, Provident Hospital of Cook County
and Stroger Hospital of Cook County:
Reason:

These contractors were selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it was determined
that they met the requirements of the RFP. It is necessary to contract with multiple
commercial nursing registries in order to supplement the nursing staff, and to meet the volume
and diversity of needs of the bureau’s operating units. Pursuant to the RFP specifications, the
estimated fiscal impact reflected on the summary sheet for each facility represents the same
amount appropriated in the fiscal year 2007 budget
This item should move forward for Board approval because failure to do so will jeopardize
the bureau’s ability to have adequate nursing coverage to provide patient care.

Bergen could not provide preservative free vaccine as required by Illinois Public Law 0940614. AmeriSource Bergen sub-contracted with another vendor to provide the preservation
free flu vaccine in October 2007. The AmeriSource Bergen contract did not include the
provision for the flu vaccine expense. The expiration date of the current contract is July 31,
2009.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $78,000.00. (895-361 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for two (2) months, Contract No. 07-54-26
with Ace Coffee Bar, Inc., Streamwood, Illinois, for the purchase of pre-made sandwiches.
Reason:

This request is necessary to allow sufficient time for the rebid, evaluation, award and
implementation of the new contract for which bids are scheduled to be opened on February 7,
2008. Approximately $19,972.20 remains on this contract. The expiration date of the current

Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $26,000.00 and extend for three (3)
months, Contract No. 05-84-380 with Ames Color File, Division of Ames Safety Envelope Company,
Sommerville, Massachusetts, for the purchase of outpatient and inpatient special medical record folders

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 6, 2008
Board approved amount 01-18-06:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$128,800.00
26,000.00
$154,800.00

This request is necessary to allow sufficient time for the bidding, award and implementation
of the new consolidated bureau-wide contract. Over the past several months, the number of
new outpatient visits has increased significantly. As part of an effort to standardize medical
record folders across the bureau, a bureau-wide bid was assembled which is scheduled to be
opened on March 5, 2008. Failure to extend the contract will delay the restructuring of
medical records which could delay billing and the collection of revenues, as well as
maintaining a complete and organized record of encounters with the patients. The expiration
date of the current contract was January 31, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $26,000.00. Contract extension: February 1, 2008 through April 30, 2008.
(897-350 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the County Purchasing

APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2007 from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $65,500.00 to Liebert Global Services, Westerville,
Ohio, for the emergency purchase and installation of specialized battery cases to replace deteriorated
backup batteries for the hospital Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for the Department of Hospital
Information Systems.
Reason:

It was discovered that many of the 160 batteries showed signs of severe deterioration during
the performance of routine maintenance services on the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
in the Data Center. The computer system in the Data Center is an essential backbone to the
Health Information System operations of the Bureau of Health Services. Since this system
provides backup power to the Data Center, to maintain computer operations during a limited
power outage, it was critical and mandatory to replace these batteries immediately.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $65,500.00. (717/897-521 Account). Requisition No. 88974003.
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
_________________________
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the payment to Liebert
Global Services be made. The motion carried unanimously.
