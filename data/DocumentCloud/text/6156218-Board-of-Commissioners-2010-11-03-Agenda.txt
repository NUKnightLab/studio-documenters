RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called one of the most deeply influential spiritual

RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #2 cont’d
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier became the pastor of Universal Church of Christ on Chicago’s South Side in
1952; in 1960 he merged his congregation with that of the Apostolic Church of God in the Woodlawn
neighborhood of Chicago; Bishop Brazier served as pastor of the Apostolic Church of God from 1960
until 2008 when he became Pastor Emeritus; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier also served as diocesan of the Sixth Episcopal District of the Pentecostal
Assemblies of the World for 31 years; and
WHEREAS, over the course of almost six decades, Bishop Brazier, through his spiritual dispensations,
aided countless many on their personal faith journeys; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his spiritual leadership, Bishop Brazier was a pioneer in community
organizing in the United States; in 1961 he became the founding president of The Woodlawn
Organization, one of the most successful community organizations in the nation; through The Woodlawn
Organization, Bishop Brazier fought against gangs and crime, and agitated for affordable housing and
better schools; Bishop Brazier was a stalwart presence of opposition when the University of Chicago
sought to expand into the Woodlawn neighborhood; this would have displaced residents and used land
that Bishop Brazier had hoped to utilize for low-income housing; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. became acquainted in 1966, when
Bishop Brazier invited Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to the Apostolic Church of God for its annual
Bible Conference; Bishop Brazier supported Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the 1960s in
Chicago, marching in the struggle against segregation in housing and schools despite bomb threats on his
church and threats to his life; and
WHEREAS, in 1969, Bishop Brazier accepted a staff position with the Citizens Crusade Against Poverty
and, in 1970, he resigned as President of The Woodlawn Organization. Bishop Brazier also joined the
staff of The Center for Community Change, a Washington-based institution that provided technical
assistance to community organizations across the country; after several years with The Center, Bishop
Brazier was promoted to the office of Vice President in charge of Major Projects, and remained in this
position until 1986 when he resigned to spend more time with his Church; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier was the founding chairman of the Board of the Woodlawn Preservation and
Investment Corporation, a community-based group organized for the improvement of the Woodlawn
community, and was the founding chairman of the Fund for Community Redevelopment and
Revitalization; this group of community and institutional leaders came together to undertake efforts over
the next five-to-ten years to rebuild two communities, namely East Woodlawn and North KenwoodOakland; and
WHEREAS, the Apostolic Church of God continues to be an obligatory stop on the campaign trail of
those individuals seeking higher office; when President Barack Obama visited the Apostolic Church of
God during his presidential campaign in June of 2008, he paid homage to Bishop Brazier’s moral
rectitude when he called him “one of our nation’s leading moral lights”; and

RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #2 cont’d
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier influenced several generations of young pastors, teaching them–not in the
least by example–how to navigate the junctures of the political and the spiritual, and how to master the
melding of the two; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier was a sought-after speaker and teacher, and he authored a number of articles
for various publications as well as three books, Black Self-Determination, Saved By Grace and Grace
Alone, and From Milk to Meat; and
WHEREAS, despite his full life and many obligations, Bishop Brazier devoted time selflessly to
numerous charitable and civic organizations; as an appointee of Mayor Daley’s, Bishop Brazier served on
the Public Building Commission of Chicago for 20 years, resigning last year; and he chaired both the
Executive Committee of the New Communities Program/Woodlawn, an affiliate of the Local Initiative
Support Corporation, as well as the Woodlawn Children’s Promise Community; and
WHEREAS, in 2008, Bishop Brazier stepped down from the pulpit of the Apostolic Church of God and
became Bishop Emeritus, and his son, Rev. Dr. Byron Brazier, donned the Church’s leadership mantle;
what started out as a 100-member congregation in 1960 had mushroomed, by 2009, into a vital and
vibrant congregation 20,000-members-strong; and
WHEREAS, in a testament to the high esteem in which Bishop Brazier was held, the following are just a
few words that have been used to denote his character and complexity as a human being: dignity, grace,
gentleness, intellect, sophistication, dedication, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, in losing Bishop Brazier we have lost a man who spiritually galvanized and economically
uplifted a multitude of people, and whose profound legacy shall live on for many, many years to come;
and
WHEREAS, Bishop Brazier leaves to mourn his loving wife, Esther Isabelle Brazier, four children, Lola
Hillman, Janice Dortch, Rosalyn Shepherd, and Dr. Byron T. Brazier, seven grandchildren, and eleven
great-grandchildren, as well as a host of extended family and friends.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Bishop Arthur M. Brazier will be remembered in the
hearts of all the people he touched and loved; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that I, President Todd H. Stroger, along with the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby express
our deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as to the many friends and
loved ones of Bishop Arthur M. Brazier, and may a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the
family of Bishop Arthur M. Brazier so that his rich legacy may be so honored and ever cherished.

RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT ILLINOIS GOVERNOR PAT QUINN
APPEAL THE DETERMINATION MADE BY THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
AGENCY THAT COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL
DISASTER ASSISTANCE UNDER THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR THE
FLOODING DISASTER OF JULY 23 AND 24, 2010
WHEREAS, on July 23 and 24, 2010, numerous communities in Cook County experienced major
flooding caused by more than seven (7) inches of rain water in certain areas (the “Flooding Disaster”),
resulting in devastating damage to property and the displacement of residents from their homes; and
WHEREAS, the many municipalities and local governmental bodies submitted to the Cook County
Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (“DHSEM”) an assessment of the
overwhelming damage sustained by those entities during the Flooding Disaster; and
WHEREAS, the DHSEM, on behalf of all of the communities in Cook County, Illinois affected by the
Flooding Disaster, compiled a total of all of the assessed damage in Cook County, Illinois incurred during
the Flooding Disaster, which amounted to Twenty-Six Million Six Hundred Fourteen Thousand Seven
Hundred Five Dollars and Ninety-Five Cents ($26,614,705.95) and forwarded that total to the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (“IEMA”); and
WHEREAS, IEMA, based upon the information received from the DHSEM, completed an application
for public assistance and filed the application with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(“FEMA”); and
WHEREAS, based upon the cost-share regulations governing FEMA (44 C.F.R. §206.47), the Per Capita
Impact Indicator Threshold for Public Assistance in Cook County is Seventeen Million Three Hundred
Sixty-Six Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-Three Dollars and Forty-Three Cents ($17,366,873.43); and
WHEREAS, after reviewing the application filed by IEMA, FEMA determined that only Fourteen
Million Six Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand and Ten Dollars ($14,655,010.00) in assessed damages
sustained in Cook County, Illinois were eligible for disaster assistance; and
WHEREAS, because FEMA has determined that only Fourteen Million Six Hundred Fifty-Five
Thousand and Ten Dollars ($14,655,010.00) in assessed damages sustained in Cook County, Illinois are
eligible for disaster assistance, FEMA has denied the allocation of disaster assistance funds to Cook
County, Illinois and to the various local governmental bodies; and
WHEREAS, each of the local governmental bodies requires disaster assistance to restore its
infrastructure and generally to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REQUESTING AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF THE
COUNTY’S CONTRACT COMPLIANCE PROGRAM
WHEREAS, Chapter 34, Division 6, Cook County Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise
Ordinance states as its purpose that it is the public policy of the County to ensure the full and equitable
participation of minority and female owned businesses in the County's procurement process as both prime
and subcontractor; and

 page 9
POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of November 3, 2010

COMMISSIONERS continued
PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #6 cont’d
WHEREAS, Section 34-272 further states that the County is committed to a policy of preventing
discrimination in the award of or participation in County contracts and eliminating arbitrary barriers to
full participation in such contracts by all persons, regardless of race, sex, or ethnicity; and
WHEREAS, in fulfillment of its policy to promote equal opportunity in its procurement process, the
County established the goal that Protected Class Enterprises shall participate in not less then 35 percent of
the annual aggregate value of all contracts awarded by the County; and
WHEREAS, to achieve the goals stated in the ordinance, the Purchasing Agent shall include in the bid
specifications a requirement that each contractor commit that Minority Business Enterprise and Women's
Business Enterprise participation in the contract will equal at least 25 percent (30 percent in the case of
construction contracts) and 10 percent, respectively, of the total dollar value of the contract; and
WHEREAS, the impetus for the establishment of the County’s MBE/WBE Ordinance was the result of
an investigation directed by the County Board, which found that minority and women's businesses
continued to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in dollar amounts that were disproportionately
lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able to perform County contracts; the County's
procurement practices in the past had contributed to the above identified under-utilization of minority and
women's businesses on County contracts; minority and women's businesses continued to be
disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in the local construction industry and economy when
competing for County contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities on such contracts; the County
was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses, which discriminate against
minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses; and
WHEREAS, just recently, members of this Honorable Body have received complaints from local
MBE/WBE vendors that they are not being allowed to participate in the majority of contracts awarded by
the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (CCHHS), which led to the passage of two resolutions,
namely resolution 10-R-163 and 10-R-228 seeking to shed light on their compliance with the County’s
MBE/WBE ordinance; and
WHEREAS, this body has also received similar complaints for contracts awarded by the County, which
has ultimately led to the audit/survey conducted by the Independent Inspector General’s office; and
WHEREAS, the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) Report No. IIG-08-0122 (M/WBE
Survey and Audit) of October 21, 2010, which includes a random sampling of M/WBE vendors and
concludes that substantial deviations from the program goals as well as potentially fraudulent conduct
exists, such as but not limited to prime contractors not allowing M/WBEs to participate in awarded
contracts according to the County’s program goals or not paying them for said participation, and requests
for M/WBEs to serve as “Pass Through” enterprises for Prime Contractors to win County contracts; and

 page 10
POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of November 3, 2010

COMMISSIONERS continued
PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #6 cont’d
WHEREAS, the report further concludes that these violations could have been discovered or prevented
with the existence of an effective internal control framework in place to monitor M/WBE contract
participation and in several of the cases the Contract Compliance Department failed to successfully
monitor contract performance and that currently there is an almost complete lack on the part of said
department to enforce contractor’s reporting obligations and review of contract activity from the
Purchasing Agent, enabling prime contractors to circumvent program goals and raising major concerns
about the integrity of the County’s M/WBE program; and
WHEREAS, the examples and findings contained in the Inspector General’s report make a mockery of
the meritorious goal and will of this Honorable Body to prevent discrimination in the award of or
participation in County contracts and to ensure that minority and women's businesses are provided full
and equal opportunity to participate in said contracts; and
WHEREAS, the egregious conduct revealed in the OIIG report cannot be tolerated or allowed to persist.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that an independent audit, under the direction of the OIIG, of the County’s Contract
Compliance program be immediately initiated in order to verify and document adherence with the
County’s Minority and Women’s Enterprise Ordinance for contracts subject to the ordinance entered into
by Cook County including the CCHHS and all departments and elected officials over the last three years
to include all current contracts, as well as to verify that the department’s organizational structure and
procedures are optimal for the proper implementation of the ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in advance of said audit, that all of the recommendations
contained in the Inspector General’s report be immediately implemented by the Department of Contract
Compliance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all cases of possible fraudulent activity as found in the report be
investigated to the fullest extent of the law and that any subsequent fraudulent activity found as a result of
the above requested audit also be similarly investigated; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body requests to be informed about the progress of
the implementation of the OIIG recommendations and any further recommendations that result from the
independent audit as well as the results of any investigations regarding fraudulent activity.

WHEREAS, in light of Ms. Oglesby arrest for these criminal charges, President Todd H. Stroger
requested and received a letter of resignation from Carla Oglesby on October 5, 2010; and
WHEREAS, Carla Oglesby recently submitted paperwork to the Illinois Department of Employment
Security (“IDES”) in order to receive unemployment insurance benefits and compensation; and
WHEREAS, under Illinois law, an individual may be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits
if, among other reasons, one voluntarily terminates one’s employment (resigns), was discharged for
misconduct in connection with one’s work; or was discharged for a felony or theft in connection with
one’s work; and
WHEREAS, given the nature of the charges pending against Ms. Oglesby, regardless of whether her
resignation was voluntary or not, Ms. Oglesby should be disqualified from receiving unemployment
benefits from the IDES.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby request that President Todd H. Stroger and his administration object and contest Ms. Oglesby’s
