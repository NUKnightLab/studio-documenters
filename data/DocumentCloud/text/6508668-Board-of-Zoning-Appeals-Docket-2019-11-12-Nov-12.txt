Romia Kirma appeals and requests to reverse the decision of the Buildings
Safety Engineering and Environmental Department (PIN: 16009481-2 BSEED
#97-18) which DENIED the establishment of a Medical Marihuana Provisioning
Center Facility (MMPCF) in an existing building located at 10345 W. Eight Mile
in a B2 zone (Local Business and Residential DISTRICT). This case is appealed
because Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person,
firm, partnership or corporation, or by any City department, commission, board
or other City agency which is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer,
or 2) by any decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department
involving Conditional Uses. Medical marihuana facilities may be permitted on a
conditional basis in the following zoning districts in accordance with this
Article, subject to the provisions of this Division and any other applicable
provisions of this Code, and all applicable state of Michigan requirements: the
subject property is within 1000 ft. of an Outdoor recreation facility; the
proposed MMFCF site is located within 950 feet of a “DRUG FREE ZONE” known
as Wells Playground located at 20159 Griggs. (Sections 50-4-102 Appeals and

Van Dyke Community Association, Johnathan Borrow, Lydia Jamison appeals
the decision of the Buildings Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department (BSEED SLU2019-00063) which (Approved with Conditions)
permission TO modify BSEED Case #153-17 to construct a 10,775 square foot
building to establish a Pre-Release Adjustment Center in an R5 zone (Medium
Density Residential District). This case is appealed because the Appeals to the
Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, partnership or
corporation, or by any City department, commission, board or other City
agency which is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any
decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving
Conditional Uses; Michigan courts have held that in order to meet the
“aggrieved person” standard, the appellant must prove that he or she (or it, if
the appellant is an organization) has suffered special damages related to the
beneficial use and enjoyment of his/her own property that are not common to
other property owners similarly situated. The party filing the appeal must be
more than a mere resident of the City; he or she must be able to show harm or
damages that are unique to him or her, and to his/her property, specifically.

Standard and 50-3-381 General Approval Criteria (Community Appeals).AP
