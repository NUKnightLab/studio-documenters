PROJECTS
Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the Former Free Press Building 321 W.
Lafayette Redevelopment Project
Mr. Vosburg presented the Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan for the Former Free
Press Building 321 W. Lafayette Redevelopment Project. PowerPoint slides provided
maps and renderings of the project. The development team provided additional
information regarding the project’s intended use and the history of the project site.
On July 29, 2010, the City Council of the City of Detroit (“City Council”) approved the
Brownfield Plan for the Free Press Redevelopment Project (the “Original Plan”). As you
may recall, the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) Board of

 Directors (“Board”) previously approved a recommendation to City Council to: (i)
terminate the Original Plan in accordance with Act 381; and (ii) approve a new brownfield
plan for the Former Free Press Building. Due to changes in the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation (MEDC) policy related to Michigan Business Tax (MBT) Credits
that occurred after the aforementioned Board recommendations, DBRA was advised that
in order to preserve the MBT Credit for this project, the Original Plan could not be
terminated. As a result, instead of terminating the Original Plan and approving a new
Brownfield Plan, DBRA staff is now seeking the Board’s approval to begin the process to
amend and restate the Original Plan with the attached Plan which will allow the Developer
(as defined below) to preserve the MBT Credit and include additional eligible activities.
The Plan described is largely the same project previously presented to the Board in April
of 2017.
Project Introduction
Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former
Detroit Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on
the second and third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for
the basement and sub-basement. First through third floor tenants have not been
determined at this time.
It is estimated that approximately 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and
approximately 10 direct permanent jobs will be created in connection with the
redevelopment. Additional permanent jobs are expected to be created by the retail and
office tenants. The Developer has agreed to comply with City Executive Orders 2016-1
and 2014-4.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,663,000.00. The Developers are
requesting $7,989,347.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.
As mentioned previously, a Brownfield Plan, an Act 381 Work Plan, and a Large
Brownfield MBT Credit, titled “Detroit Free Press House” and “Free Press Plaza and
Apartments” were approved for the Eligible Property in 2010. The Developer is requesting
the amendment and restatement of the “Detroit Free Press House” Brownfield Plan,
approved in 2010. The Brownfield Plan, Act 381 Work Plan, and the Brownfield MBT
Credit (the “Credit”) will be amended and restated to modify the following: legal
descriptions, scope of Project, Eligible Activities, and Eligible Investment that was
included in the original approvals.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the
Free Press Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of
downtown Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility

 The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose;
(b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act
381; and (c) the Property is determined to be Functionally Obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition,
selective building demolition, lead & asbestos surveying, asbestos abatement, air
monitoring, hazardous material removal, site preparation, and preparation of a brownfield
plan and work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the
development of the Property and will be financed solely by the Developer. The Authority
is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The eligible
activities began in the third quarter of 2017 and are estimated to be complete no later
than March 2021. Based on the existing Credit, the Project must be completed and
receive a temporary certificate of occupancy by March 8th, 2021 in order to receive the
Credit.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

1. Site Demolition
2. Selective Building Demolition
3. Lead & Asbestos Survey
4. Asbestos Abatement
5. Air Monitoring
6. Hazardous Material Removal
7. Brownfield Plan

$695,493.00
$953,951.00
$344,622.00
$1,944,066.00

The actual cost of those eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for
reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be
governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developers of this Plan will seek additional support through the transfer of the existing
Michigan Business Tax Credit for the property as well as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone

 Abatement (PA 147). In addition, the Developer also anticipates a Commercial
Rehabilitation (PA 210) tax abatement to be approved for the eligible property.
Ms. DeSantis asked about the value of the MBT Credit for the Project and how the MBT
credit works. Mr. Vosburg explained the MBT credit.
Ms. DeSantis asked for details on the funding source. Mr. Fleisher advised that the
financing consists of the MBT credit, TIF financing, and Developer equity.
Ms. DeSantis asked about the Developer’s affordable housing requirement. Mr. Fleisher
explained its affordable housing requirement, when it takes effect, and that most of its
units are priced at 60% of the Area Median Income.
Attached for review and approval was a resolution authorizing the Amended and Restated
Former Free Press Building Brownfield Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory
Committee for consideration and comment within 30 days of their receipt of the proposed
Plan. In addition, it authorizes the President of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation
or any person designated by him, as a representative of the DBRA, to conduct a public
hearing in the area to which the Proposed Plan applies within the next 30 days. This
public hearing may be held jointly with any public hearing conducted by the Community
Advisory Committee.

Former Free Press Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan and its submittal to the
DBRA-CAC as presented. The Board took the following action:
