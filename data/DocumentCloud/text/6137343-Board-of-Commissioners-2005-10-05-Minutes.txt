each non-profit hospital in Cook County beginning with the current year's tri-annual reassessment, be

RESOLUTION TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE BOARD LISTING THE
ESTIMATED ASSESSED VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED EXEMPT DOLLAR
AMOUNT OF EACH NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL IN COOK COUNTY BEGINNING
WITH THE CURRENT YEAR'S TRI-ANNUAL REASSESSM ENT (PROPOSED
RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado,
County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Joan Patricia Murphy, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, over seventy non-profit hospitals benefit from property tax exemptions in Cook
County and have a moral, fina ncial and legal responsibility to provide quality health care to
the poor and uninsured; and

3138

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

WHEREAS, in June of 2005, non-profit hospitals will begin filing an annual report known
as a "Community Benefits Plan," in accordance with state law which will include the amount
of charity care and other community benefits the hospital provides; and
WHEREAS, in addition to receiving exemptions from Cook County property taxes (which
according to independent research accounts for approximately 20% of the total annual value
of the hospital's preferential tax status), non-profit hospitals in Cook County also may receive
exemptions from various federal and state income taxes, state and local sales and use taxes,
tax-exempt bond financing, and tax-deductible donations; and
WHEREAS, in order to qualify for property tax exempt status in Cook County, the property
utilized by the non-profit hospital must be exclusively used in a charitable manner, as
detennined by the Illinois Department of Revenue during its review of certificates of
exemption; and
WHEREAS, currently, the Assessor's Office cannot calculate an approximate assessed value
for tax exempt non-profit hospitals and, therefore, there is no information to gauge the
monetary savings non-profit hospitals accrue through their tax exempt status; and
WHEREAS, unlike a typical homeowner who receives an exemption based on a percentage
of the home' s assessed value through the Homeowner's Exemption, a non-profit hospital
receives a total exemption from the hospital's assessed value; and
WHEREAS, in order to fairly and accurately weigh the monetary value of the non-profit
hospitals' property tax exemption against the dollar amount given back to the community
through charity care and other community benefits, it is necessary to analyze the hospital ' s
Community Benefits Plan along with a report from the Assessor's Office that details each
hospital's estimated assessed value and the estimated exempt dollar amount.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby require the Cook County Assessor's Office to provide an annual report to the
Board listing the estimated assessed value and the estimated exempt dollar amount of each
non-profit hospital in Cook County beginning with the current year's tri-annual reassessment.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

AMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners annually presents an Executive
Budget Recommendation to the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners debates and considers the budget, debates and considers
relevant amendments, and passes a budget for Cook County by the end of February of each calendar year;
and
WHEREAS, in the past the Board of Commissioners has usually had fewer than four months to review
an annual budget that funds over 25 ,000 FTE positions and contains $3 billion in revenues and
expenditures and therefore cannot give appropriate consideration to each aspect of the budget; and
WHEREAS, given the large fiscal deficits that have arisen over the past several years and have needed to
be filled by the President and the Board of Commissioners, and further given the differences of opinions
with regard to closing the deficits, it is important that all parties have adequate time to consider the
budget, write and propose amendments, and arrive at an ultimate decision to either support or oppose the
budget recommendation; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the need for a specified and uniform budgeting process, the U.S. Congress
passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which still forms the basis for
the budget process; and
WHEREAS, the Congressional Budget and lmpoundment Control Act species that the President of the
United States is to transmit his or her budget to Congress on or after the first Monday in January but not
later than the first Monday in February of each year for the following fiscal year, which begins on
October 1, thereby giving Congress eight months to review and act on the President's recommendation;
and
WHEREAS, all governments should be seeking to involve citizens in budgeting and legislating, allowing
for greater time before the presentation of the budget and the ensuing consideration by the Board will
allow for more citizens to make their voices heard and for the President and the Board of Commissioners
to better seek out the opinions of their constituents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County currently has no set date by which the President must provide the Executive
Budget Recommendation to the Board of Commissioners.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, that the Cook County Rules of Organization and Procedure
Ordinance is hereby amended as set forth below:

AMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, allowing the public, media, and civic groups, as well as the Board of Commissioners,
access to the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) at the soonest possible date after the close
of the fiscal year makes the County' s finances more accountable to the public; and

3141

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

WHEREAS, delaying the release of the CAFR in a timely manner diminishes the accountability of the
County because important and final information regarding the health of the budget and the County's
spending is withheld from the public; and
WHEREAS, the last CAFR released by the County for Fiscal Year 2003 was not released until February
17, 2005, or 14.5 months after the close of the fiscal year, and the CAFR for Fiscal Year 2002 was not
released until March 31, 2004, or 16 months after the close of the fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the other large governments within Cook County, the City of Chicago, the Chicago Public
Schools, the Chicago Park District, and the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, and the Forest
Preserve District of Cook County, released their CAFRs within six months of the fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, the budgets of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the City of Chicago are far larger than
the Cook County's, and therefore, the work of the CPS and the City show that it is possible to release
CAFRs for large, complicated budgets within six months of the close of the fiscal ; and
WHEREAS, there is currently no set date by which Cook County must release its Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

AMENDMENT TO THE RULES OF ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURE ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners annually presents a budget to
the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, due to the current manner in which the budget is presented, it is difficult for the Board of
Commissioners to see the prevailing trends in revenue collection, expenditures, and the size of the overall
budget; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners usually has fewer than four months to review an annual budget
that funds over 25,000 FTE positions and contains $3 billion in revenues and expenditures; and
WHEREAS, it serves the interests of any form of government, including Cook County, to plan its

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, homeowners in Cook County are overburdened by the overwhelming increases in property
value, as evidenced most particularly in the last three triennial reassessments; and
WHEREAS, due to the ever-increasing property tax burden, many long time residents are unable to
remain in the prospering neighborhoods they helped to create; and
WHEREAS, the triennial reassessment cycle makes it difficult for Cook County homeowners to predict
and financially prepare for the impact of three years worth of property value increases in each
reassessment period; and
WHEREAS, many residents in gentrifying neighborhoods are so burdened by property taxes that they are
forced to lobby against neighborhood improvements, fearing the subsequent increases in their tax bills;
and
WHEREAS, increases in the median income of Cook County residents has not kept pace with the
dramatic increases in property values; and
WHEREAS, the overall burden of property taxes has steadily been shifting more and more onto owners
of residential properties; and
WHEREAS, the continuation of the Expanded Homeowner Exemption which essentially caps
assessment increases at 7% annually would continue to provide Cook County homeowners with
predictability and affordability, while also providing protection to our neighborhoods, encouraging
diversity and stability.

The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County

ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Collins and Commissioner Quigley (2)

Absent:

Vice Chainnan Goslin, Commissioners Gonnan, Hansen, Maldonado and Murphy (5)

Also Present:

Commissioner Suffredin (I); Dr. Francis S. Muthu - Director, President's Office of
Employment Training (POET); and Charles L. Jenrich - Vice President of U.S.
Operations, GBJD Registrars

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Business and Economic Development of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County met pursuant to notice on Wednesday, September 21, 2005 at the hour of I 0:00 A.M. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee as considered the following item for informational purposes only:
The Subcontracts of the Workforce Investment Act Grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and
Economic Development, which was approved at the September 8, 2005 Board Meeting, Agenda Item
# 120.
The Secretary to the Board infonned the Chairman that a quorum was not present.
Chairman Collins replied that the meeting was being held for informational purposes only.
Chairman Collins stated in 2004 the County appropriated approximately $ 15 million to the POET
Program for job training and development. As Chairman of the Business and Economic Development
Committee, she has never seen the perfonnance data. The federal government was concerned about
maintaining the POET Program because of performance not only in Illinoi s but across the Country.
Chairman Collins said she is concerned about the high number of unemployed and unskilled individuals
in economically depressed communities. Funds should be allocated specifically to job training programs
that offer a potential job upon completion. The rate of unemployment is about 60%; this contributes to
the growth of the underworld drug culture within these communities.
Commissioner Suffredin asked how often the agencies receive grant money.

3251

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

Dr. Francis S. Muthu, Director, President's Office of Employment Training (POET), replied that the
funding is for a two year cycle. Further, Dr. Muthu stated that the President's Office of Employment
Training has put together an evaluation summary of 2004 placements which is a snap shot of May
because the Workforce Investment Board did not meet in July. The funding was received in August from
the State; performance of all the contractors was evaluated after May and presented to the Workforce
Investment Board (WIB). The WIB reviewed and recommended either full funding, provisional funding
or no funding. The provisional funding was recommended because the WIB had to look at the June
performance which is the end of POET's fiscal year. Dr. Muthu also stated that last year the second
installment of funding did not take place until January, therefore the contractors were given an additional
fiscal quarter to meet perfonnance. The WIB looked at the June data and looked at the end of the first
quarter of this fiscal year, and if the contractors are moving towards the perfonnance minimum which is
the job placement of 75% and above, then the contractors' funding would be renewed; if not they would
still be placed in conditional status until December.
Chainnan Collins called upon the agencies present.

Chairman Collins asked Charles L. Jenrich, Vice President of U.S. Operations, GBJD Registrars, to
address the Committee.
Mr. Jenrich slated that the Workforce Investment Board needs to examine what the agencies do and how
their numbers are produced in order to maintain yearly federal funding. The most difficult job is to
identify providers who must be set aside because their funding has not been used in a way such that the
Workforce Investment Board can continue to receive additional funding for the work that the providers
do.
Chainnan Collins concluded the meeting by thanking all the agencies that attended the meeting.

Chairman Collins adjourned the meeting.

RESOLUTION REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE METHODS
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by Gregg Goslin and Mike Quigley, County Commissioners; and Cosponsored by Carl R. Hansen, Anthony J. Peraica, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman and Peter
N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

PROJECT TO SUPPLEMENT BUREAU OF HEALTH'S PHARMACIES
WHEREAS, county residents utilizing the Bureau of Health Services in-house phannacies
routinely wait for hours to get prescriptions fi lled; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
continue to look for methods of more efficient delivery of prescriptions that will alleviate the
chronic wait for medications; and
WHEREAS, Stroger Hospital of Cook County is a qualified 340B covered entity and
therefore eligible to take part in an Alternative Methods Demonstration Project; and
WHEREAS, the Alternative Methods Demonstration Project gives covered entities a process
to obtain approval, through the Office of Pharmacy Affairs, to utilize a network of
phannacies or use a contract pharmacy to supplement an in-house pharmacy; and
WHEREAS, Walgreens Health Services has approached the County following the passage
on October 5, 2004 of a Resolution authorizing an RFP for pharmacy services. Walgreen's is
confident in their ability to develop an Alternative Methods Demonstration Project and to
provide effective methods to improve access to drug therapy and comprehensive pharmacy
services for patients while protecting the program integrity with inventory and dispensing
controls and ensuring statutory and program compliance; and
WHEREAS, Wal greens said one option is to establish a small network of their stores, chosen
by zip codes, to serve as 340B contract pharmacies to provide convenient, alternative
locations for patients in addition to the existing county phannacies; and
WHEREAS, Walgreens has also proposed an option to acquire the operation of the Stroger
Hospital of Cook County outpatient pharmacy providing the County with revenue and taking
over staffing responsibility, system maintenance and upgrade costs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
instructs the Bureau of Health Services to enter into talks with WalgreeBs Health Seri.•ices
various Pharmacy Administrators including all the companies listed in attachment #2 to
discuss an Alternative Methods Demonstration Project and the various options to be included
in that project; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Health Services submit a draft of an
Alternative Methods Demonstration Project for the Board of Commissioners review by
September 20, 2005 January 27, 2006.
*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 07/12/05.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

Vice Chainnan Goslin stated that in response to his earlier legislation to possibly outsource the County's
pharmacy needs, Walgreen's submitted a letter to him outlining what they will provide to the County. In
order to adequately consider the above item, the Committee needs testimony from Walgreen 's explaining
their letter. Vice Chairman Goslin has distributed this letter. (The referenced document is on file in the
Office of the County Clerk).
Commissioner Collins asked whether other phannacies will have the opportunity to make proposals to the
Commissioners. Chairman Butler replied in the affinnative.
Chairman Butler called on Gregg Cygan, R.Ph., Director, Clinic Pharmacies, Walgreen' s Health Services,
to address the Commissioners.
Mr. Cygan thanked the Board for the opportunity to address questions and concerns. He stated that
Walgreen's goal is to ensure that Hospital patie nts receive adequate, quality care. In its proposal,
Walgreen' s focused on the Alternative Methods Demonstration Project. This arrangement would allow
Stroger Hospital of Cook County to offload some of the prescriptions to nearby Walgreen's pharmacies;
the result would be that acute as well as non-acute patients would receive timely service. Walgreen's is
open to assisting the County in other ways, for example by analyzing current operations.
Vice Chainnan Goslin stated for the record that in his conversations with Mr. Cygan, he explained that if
this program were to move -forward, a request for proposal would be issued, and the bidding process
would be open to other phannacies. Mr. Cygan concurred.
Vice Chainnan Goslin stated that the Bureau of Health Services will need to address the financial risk
involved in contracting with outside phannacies.
Mr. Cygan replied that Walgreen's is willing to help analyze both the financial impact and the work flow
impact of Walgreen's project.
Commissioner Quigley inquired about the volume of offload that the demonstration project can handle.
Mr. Cygan replied that this would depend on the number of designated phannacies, and this number has
not been deten11ined by the County, nor by Walgreen' s. The zip code distribution of patients would be
analyzed. Patients on Medicaid and other insurances would be able to use any phan11acies. All
calculations would be submitted to the Office of Phannacy Affairs.
Commissioner Quigley inquired as to how many prescriptions are not picked up at the phan11acies.
Mr. Cygan replied that every day, Walgreen ' s determines which prescriptions have not been picked up by
checking all prescriptions that are seven days and older. These prescriptions are deleted from any billings
to private insurances or Medicaid. The prescriptions are then returned to stock. He estimated that one
percent of the prescriptions are not picked up.
Commissioner Daley stated the following concerns: Possible revenue loss for Stroger Hospital of Cook
County, offloading prescriptions could possibly adversely affect Medicaid and Medicare patients; and the
resolution names Walgreen' s only, perhaps it should be amended to include other pharmacies.
Commissioner Gorman asked how Walgreen' s would handle the surge in prescriptions.
Mr. Cygan replied that the most important factor would be to determine how many patients reside in
which zip codes. Then Walgreen' s could designate the necessary additional staffing.

3257

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to the average dispensing cost that Stroger Hospital of Cook
County would incur.
Mr. Cygan replied that at this point he is not prepared to provide this information. He needs to analyze
the scope of the work. Two components of thi s analysis would be the pure filling of the prescription and,
with regard to the request for information (RFl) the administrative, and behind-the-scenes cost.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to why the phannacists walked out during the strike.
Mr. Cygan replied that he is not certain, because he was not directly involved.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether Walgreen's had enough staff during the strike to continue serving
its customers.
Mr. Cygan replied that Walgreen's has contingency plans to provide adequate staffing at their stores.
Pharmacies were kept open and Walgreen's made every effort to provide services to all patients who
needed prescriptions.
Comm issioner Sims requested that Walgreen 's provide information as to why its pharmacists went on
strike.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired how many phannacies Walgreen's currently operates in the Chicago
market, and whether this market includes Cook County or beyond.
Tony Bono, R.Ph., Sales Manager, Walgreen' s Health lnitiatives, replied that in Cook County there are
255 Walgreen's pharmacies; 57 are open 24-hours. In tem1s of all pharmacies - not just Walgreen's Cook County has 869; 77 are open 24-hours.
Chairman Butler asked Dr. Daniel H. Winship, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, to address the
Committee.
Dr. Winship stated that after his remarks he will call on Daniel Martin, Deputy Chief, Bureau of Health
Services; Dr. Martin has been responsible for developing the Demonstration Project Program.
Dr. Winship stated that the report that was distributed to the Commissioners resulted from the Board
action in September of 2004. At this time the Bureau of Health Services was asked to seek a request for
proposal (RFP); ultimately this was corrected to a request for infonnation. The request for infomrntion
received only one response; therefore, the Bureau of Health Services contacted all of the phannacy
organizations for responses. A meeting resulted, during which cost infonnation was obtained.
Mr. Martin made the following presentation:
Because an RFI was issued, and not an RFP, the County was careful in soliciting cost infonnation.
However, parameters were requested for the following: the cost of filling prescriptions, the cost of
dispensing prescriptions for patients whose care would be uncompensated, and the cost for those patients
not covered under public aid or any other fonn of insurance. Walgreen's and CVS (also known as

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

Mr. Martin continued that when the Bureau of Health Services was directed to issue the RFI , the issue
was raised regarding whether the County would be able to preserve its 340B purchasing rights; a
demonstration project is the means by which 340B purchasing rights are conveyed to a contracted
organization. A discussion ensued regarding the fact that the regulations allow for contracting with only
one individual site pharmacy. At that point the Commissioners directed the Bureau of Health Services to
talk with the Office of Pharmacy Affairs. In July Mr. Martin attended the 340B conference, where he met
with Mr. Mitchell, the Director of the Office of Pharmacy Affairs.
Mr. Martin further stated that Mr. Mitchell advised him that there were no public health systems in the
country currently authorized to conduct this type of program under a demonstration project. Currently
only single or double site, federally qualified, health-center clinics contract with either one or two
phannacies within a certain local. Mr. Mitchell indicated that, if Cook County elected to submit a
proposal, the Office of Phannacy Affairs would look favorably on it; it potentially could increase their
assets. However, the Office of Phamrncy Affairs had three concerns: One, the arrangement would have
to preserve the integrity of the 340B program; were the County to fail to do this, the program itself could
be in jeopardy, and other 340B entities could suffer. Two, the County would have to prove that there
would be an increase in access to the patients. And three, the County wou ld need to contain cost as a
result of doing a demonstration project.
Mr. Martin continued that an individual from Mr. Mitchell 's office walked him through the requirements
for submitting a demonstration project. The County and a contractor would file the application jointly.
The Office of Pharmacy Affairs would entertain an application only from the County to request a
demonstration project. If the application were granted, the County could put out a bid. The 340B aspect
could be addressed at this point.
Mr. Martin continued that recently the Bureau of Health Services has been able to bill for public aid
The County receives a flat-rate, enhanced
medications under the Intergovernmental Transfer.
reimbursement to help offset the cost of uncompensated phannacy care. The Bureau of Health Services
has had numerous discussions with the Illinois Department of Public Aid to determine whether the
County can preserve this revenue; while the Illinois Department of Public Aid does not appear amenable,
it has agreed to further review this issue. The Intergovernmental Transfer Agreement does not allow for
an arrangement whereby a contractor bills the County for Public Aid patients and then the County
submits claims on behalf of those Public Aid patients; the State Plan Amendment requires that all services
be rendered at one of the critical care sites, i.e., one of the three County Hospitals. The State indicated
that their average reimbursement is approximately $ 13.00 per prescription for generic drugs, and
approximately $80.00 per prescription for brand-name drugs. All patients who purchase prescriptions
from contracted phannacies would be required to pay the Illinois Department of Public Aid a co-pay.
ln conclusion, Mr. Martin offered the following analysis of the current cost for the County to provide
prescriptions. In 2004 the cost to the County was calculated to be $5.56 per prescription. Approximately
11 % to 13% of the patients are Public Aid patients. Approximately 80% of the patients are self-paid or
on uncompensated care. If the County were to contract with outside phannacies, it would be responsible
for paying any services not covered under any type of insurance program .

COOK COUNTY OVERTIME POLICY RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, there are legitimate reasons for overtime expenditures, es13eeially iR the areas ef
13liblie health aREI 13liblie safety such as providing adequate staffing to protect the public
health and safety when there exists a severe, protracted nationwide shortage of essential
licensed professionals to perfonn vital functions in the delive1y of government services; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
hereby establishes the following amended policy to guide overtime expenditures and to
protect the employees, patients, detainees and citizens of Cook County:
That all supervisors are required to provide a written report bi-monthly to their department
head relative to staffing needs. This report shall detail the number of vacancies and their
effect on operations as well as the expected overtime needs for the period of the report; and
That all department heads, bureau chiefs and elected officials immediately assign a
member(s) of their financi al team to oversee overtime expenses and that this individual(s),
along with an employee' s immediate supervisor, shall provide written authorization prior to
an employee being assigned or granted overtime; and

326 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

That this written authorization shall be forwarded to the department head, bureau chief and/or
elected official on a bi-monthly basis; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that no Cook County employee shall be allowed to work
more than 20 hours in overtime in any seven day period with the exception of emergency
situations where the bureau chief or elected official will be required to provide written
authorization; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in any one fiscal year no Cook County employee shall
be allowed to work more than 624 hours (30% of 2080 full-time hours) in overtime with the
exception of emergency situations where the bureau chief or elected official will be required
to provide written authorization; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in order to protect the public's basic human right to
quality health care, critical professional staffing positions in the Bureau of Health Services,
including, but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists, and radiology technicians, that are currently
experiencing a severe, protracted nationwide shortage of licensed professionals and
subsequently causing an unsafe patient to professional ratio, shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that these supervisors and managers are expected to adhere
to this policy and will be held accountable for unauthorized overtime expenditures within
their respective departments; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County's labor team is directed to address any
matters pertaining to overtime during the negotiating process and make recommendations that
ensure fairness to both the County's employees and taxpayers.
This amended policy shall go into effect immediately upon passage.
*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 07/12/05.
Commissioner Maldonado delivered the following overview of the Overtime Policy Resolution. The
Commissioners have extensive documentation that there is a severe shortage of certain types of health
professionals. The Resolution would exempt these individuals from the restriction of the twenty-hours
per week in overtime. The management prerogative of immediate supervisors and nurses would not be
usurped; if a nurse supervisor needs a nurse to work overtime she is able to ask that nurse to work
overtime without going through the administrative process. The requests to work overtime must come
from a supervisor.
Commissioner Hansen asked for further explanation of the need for overtime.
Dr. Winship replied that in his opinion the changes are not necessary; he has, however, no objection. This
Resolution addresses issues of emergency and urgency. Additionally, the Bureau has been decreasing its
use of overtime, and has extensive documentation of that this is effective.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether supervisors know how much overtime a given nurse has worked
and, also, why a nurse is punished for working overtime if her supervisor has asked her to work overtime.

3262

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

Dr. Winship replied that it is the supervisors' responsibility, not the nurses', to keep track of ove11ime.
He further stated that there are flaws in the letter submitted to the Commissioners; Mr. Brown has
instructed the supervisors not to use this letter.
Commissioner Peraica requested that the letter regarding the Executive Summary Recommendation from
the National Nurses' Organizing Committee, dated September 26, 2005, be entered into the record. (The
referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk). He stated that the letter summarizes the
concerns that were part of the initial proposal. He further stated that he believes that certain leeway and
discretion should be granted to managers. He stated that the proposed amendments address this, and
suggested that the Committee approve these amendments.
Commissioner Maldonado moved approval of Communication No. 272043, seconded by
Commissioner Collins. Commissioner Maldonado called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays

AND THE CHIEF OF THE BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES TO CONDUCT AN
ANNUAL PHARMACIST SALARY SURVEY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting
a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County Commissioner; and Cosponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the nationwide shortage of phannacists is a serious problem that threatens both
the quality of healthcare and access to health services; and
WHEREAS, since June 2004, pharmacists must obtain a Doctor of Phannacy Degree, known
as a Pharm.D., a six-year program requiring two years of prerequisite courses and four years
of phannacy school, before taking the licensing exam; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005
WHEREAS, the increasing demand for pharmacists has caused a significant escalation in
wage rates attracting hospital pharmacists to leave their jobs for more lucrative positions in
the private sector; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services is facing critical challenges in its
pharmacy operations due to an obsolete salary structure and recruitment and retention
practices; and
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Health Services' failure to recruit a Phannacy Director,
supervisory staff and phannacists to fill twenty-four vacant positions has resulted in a
perilous patient to pharmacist ratio that will only worsen as the prescription volume continues
to soar beyond the estimated 3.8 million prescriptions to be dispensed in 2005 ; and
WHEREAS, although the Cook County Mail Order Pharmacy Refill Program has greatly
improved pharmacy service for our chronically ill patients, patients receiving short-tenn
prescriptions requiring immediate care still face unnecessary and sometimes dangerous
delays in receiving their prescription medications; and
WHEREAS, as one of the largest public health care networks in the country, the Bureau of
Health Services should serve as a leader in giving every patient the basic human right to
quality health care and treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Chief of the Bureau of Human
Resources and the Chief of the Bureau of Health Services are directed to conduct an annual
Pharmacist Salary Survey, comparing the Bureau of Health Services' pharmacist salary rates
with those in the private sector, and to adjust the salary rate to reflect an average of those
rates found in the survey; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief of the Bureau of Health Services provide a
written report to the members of the Board of Commissioners on the phannacist salary
adjustment rate no later than one week prior to each fi scal year's budget presentation.
*Referred to the Health and Hospitals Committee on 07/12/05.

Commissioner Maldonado stated the following that by conducting an annual phannacy salary survey, the
County can compare the salaries of its phannacists to the phannacist salaries of other governmental
entities and to those of the private sector. The County currently has twenty-four vacancies; nine are line
phannacists who dispense prescriptions, seven are supervisors who do not dispense prescriptions pursuant
to union contracts, and one is a phannacy director. The County's salary for a new pharmacist is $70,000.
The Veterans Administration pays its new phannacists $8 1,300. The Veterans' Administration pays its
new phannacists $11,000 in additional salary, as compared to the County's salary.
Commissioner Peraica requested that when the Bureau of Health Services conducts then next survey they
also compare benefits packages.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved the approval

COOK COUNTY PRESCRIPTION RELIEF PROGRAM (PROPOSED RESOLUTION)
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County Commissioner;
and Co-Sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr., President, Jerry Butler, Forrest Claypool, Earlean
Collins, John P. Daley, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Carl R. Hansen, Joseph
Mario Moreno, Joan P. Murphy, Anthony J. Peraica, Mike Quigley, Peter N. Silvestri ,
Deborah Sims, Bobbie L. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
I am submitting the following Resolution for the September 8, 2005 Board Agenda for
approval. The Resolution establishes a "Cook County Prescription Relief Program" in
partnership with MedAssist Direct, an Ohio Limited Liability Corporation .
The Cook County Prescription Relief Program is aimed at helping low income people who
have no prescription drug coverage receive their medications for a nominal cost. Although
Medicaid covers families with children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with
disabilities, low income single individuals and married couples with no children under the
age of 65 are generally not eligible for government assistance and cannot afford private
health insurance. The Cook County Prescription Relief Program will seek to reach out to this
vulnerable population.
Under the program , MedAssist Direct helps participants access more than 1,800 prescription
medications available through pharmaceutical manufacturers for an annual enrollment fee of
$25.00. For a $7.00 per prescription transaction fee, MedAssist Direct completes and
processes the application and handles all the paperwork and necessary follow-up.
Participants receive their medications through the mail and save approximately 90% off the
average retail price on most prescriptions.
Aside from the costs of mailings, printing and distribution of appropriate marketing materials
infonning residents about the potential benefits of their enrollment in the program, there are
no other costs associated with the program.
The Cook County Prescription Relief Program can quickly and efficiently provide vital
savings to chronically ill, low income county residents with no prescription coverage.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, according to the 2000 Federal Census Bureau data, over 700,000 individuals in
Cook County live at or below the federal poverty income levels and many of them are
struggling to afford the cost of their prescription medications because they can neither afford
private health insurance nor do they qualify for government assistance programs such as
Medicaid; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
hereby adopts and approves this Resolution to enter into a marketing partnership agreement
with MedAssist Direct to offer the "Cook County Prescription Relief Program" to low
income residents of Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Health Services shall present a
marketing plan for the Cook County Prescription Relief Program to the Board no later than
sixty days after the enactment of this Resolution; and

3268

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that after the marketing plan has been submitted, the
Bureau of Health Services has forty-five days to fully implement the Cook County
Prescription Relief Program.

County live at or below the federal poverty income levels and many of them are struggling to afford the
cost of their prescription medications because they can neither afford private health insurance nor do they
qualify for government assistance programs such as Medicaid; and
WHEREAS, the majority of these uninsured or underinsured low income individuals, often unemployed
or working in low paying jobs, fai l to receive regular or preventive care and prescription drugs to treat
their illness, resulting in a higher incidence of disease, chronic illness, and disability; and
WHEREAS, the cost of caring for this vulnerable population often falls on the County' s public health
system which acts as a vi tal safety net provider of health care for the uninsured, poor and other patient
populations who may have no other recourse; and
WHEREAS, the growing population of the uninsured and underinsured in Cook County is creating an
overwhelming demand on the County 's public health system to dispense prescription medications; and
WHEREAS, in 2005 alone, the Bureau of Health Services expects to fill 3.8 million prescriptions,
averaging 10,000 prescriptions per day; and
WHEREAS, many phannaceutical manufacturers offer phannaceutical assistance programs that provide
free or low cost prescription medications to low income residents; and
WHEREAS, few residents are aware of the existence of these programs and even those who try to enroll
are overwhelmed by the complicated application process and fail to take advantage of the deep discounts
for their prescription medicines; and

3269

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

WHEREAS, residents without prescription coverage who have annual incomes of less than $19 ,000.00 if
they are single and less that $31,000.00 if they are married {approximately 200% above the federal
poverty income levels) are generally eligible to participate in such programs; and
WHEREAS, acting as an advocate for low income residents, MedAssist Direct works with local
governments, healthcare providers, community organizations, and individuals to promote awareness of
these programs and assist eligible residents to enroll and maintain their eligibility in pharmaceutical
assistance programs; and
WHEREAS, for an annual $25.00 enrollment fee, participants pay only $7.00 per prescription for each
30 day supply received from participating pharmaceutical manufacturers through the mail, saving
approximately 90% off the average retail price on most prescriptions; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners desires to relieve the burden of the high cost of
prescription drugs by enrolling our chronically ill, low income residents in these pharmaceutical
assistance programs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners sees a significant benefit for our residents by
working with MedAssist Direct to promote awareness and enrollment in pharmaceutical assistance
programs; and
WHEREAS, other counties, communities, and organizations across America have successfully adopted
such programs and are currently providing assistance to those in greatest need; and
WHEREAS, the MedAssist Direct Phamrnceutical Assistance Program is modeled after an award
winning program, recognized by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and
the National Association of County Officials in 2004 as an exemplary health initiative to assist low
income residents; and
WHEREAS, as a home rule unit the Cook County Board has a legal mandate to provide for and protect
the health, welfare and safety of the residents of this County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners hereby
adopts and approves this Resolution to enter into a marketing partnership agreement with MedAssist
Direct to offer the " Cook County Prescription Relief Program" to low income residents of Cook County;
and

administrator as well as specific information about the program. A copy of the nearly 1,000
participating phannacies in Cook County is available for your review in my office as well as

WHEREAS, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, an estimated 211,240 new invasive cases of breast cancer are expected
to occur among women in the year 2005 and about 1,690 new cases of breast cancer are expected to be
diagnosed in men; and
WHEREAS, there are slightl y more than two million women living in the United States who have been
diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, in the most recent time period (1987-2000) breast cancer incidence rates have increased
only in women age 50 and older; and
WHEREAS, the risk of breast cancer increases with age. The risk is higher in women who have a
personal or family history of breast cancer. Mammography exams are especially valuable as an early
diagnostic tool because they can identify breast abnonnalities that may be cancer at an early stage before
physical symptoms develop. Numerous studies have shown that early detection increases survival and
treatment options; and
WHEREAS, the American Cancer Society recommends that women age 40 and older have an annual
mammogram and annual clinical breast examination by a healthcare professional, and perform monthly
breast self-examination.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Members of the Board of
Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby take this
opportunity to acknowledge Breast Cancer Awareness Month; and

WHEREAS, the idea for the Law Office of the Cook County Public Defender was born in the 1920s,
from the times that fostered Prohibition and when cases crowded the court system ; and
WHEREAS, when an accused could not afford an attorney, the judges often appointed attorneys who
were their friends and acquaintances, many of whom were considered unqualified to handle criminal
cases; and
WHEREAS, in 1929, based on reports and studies issued by court refonn organizations, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners created the Judicial Advisory Counci l, whose aim was to bring
innovation and efficiency to the criminal court. Among its recommendations was to establish a public
defender's office within Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the criminal justice system in Chicago was seen as corrupt and infected by scandals. Judges
and attorneys were accused of accepting bribes in exchange for guaranteed results. Creating a public
defender's office was viewed as an important step to bring professionalism and honesty to the
representation of those accused of crime; and

3289

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

WHEREAS, the Judicial Advisory Council sought an attorney to head this newly conceived office, and
on September 25, 1930, Benjamin C. Bachrach was appointed the first Public Defender of Cook County.
On September 29, 1930, Mr. Bachrach opened his office on the sixth floor of the recently completed
Criminal Courts Building at 2600 South California. Five assistant public defenders and one stenographer
were hired to round out the Office. Supporting Mr. Bachrach were attorneys Wilbert F. Crowley, Wendell
E. Green, John Alden Ryan, Dennis E. Sullivan, Jr. and Lester N. Grossman. The stenographer, the first
support staff hire of the Office, was Ella E. Spradling; and
WHEREAS, a measure of the Public Defender's success in its first year was recorded in the Chicago Bar
Association Record of 1930, via an open report from Mr. Bachrach. In its first three months, the Office
defended 582 persons, securing 11 acquittals and one not guilty by reason of insanity out of 25 jury trials.
Mr. Bachrach wrote that it was his "sincere belief' that all of the Public Defender s clients "felt that they
were justly treated by the law, and instead of feeling hatred toward the law, now have respect for the
law"; and
WHEREAS, the statistics from those early years are mind-boggling; by August 1934, a total of six
attorneys had represented 283 death penalty clients. By January 1942, with the workforce reduced to five
attorneys, the Office had represented 637 death penalty clients; and
WHEREAS, in 1986, the Office's face changed again. Mr. Doherty stepped down as the Public Defender
returning to his roots as an assistant public defender with the Office. Paul P. Biebel, now chief judge of
the Criminal Courts, was named the Public Defender. Mr. Biebel accepted the position on a temporary
basis, until a more permanent successor could be named; and
WHEREAS, sixteen months later, in May 1988, Randolph N. Stone was selected, after a nationwide
search, to serve as the Public Defender. He also made history as the first African-American Public
Defender. During Mr. Stone's administration, the Office did not merely grow, but its very autonomy
changed. Since 1932, the Office was under the supervision of the Cook County judiciary; and
WHEREAS, for close to 60 years, the Public Defender was nominated by the Chief Judge of the County
and elected by the sitting circuit judges. In August 1991 , new legislation was passed, which made the
Law Office of the Cook County Pubic Defender an independent agency within Cook County; and
WHEREAS, on March I, 1992, the Office changed yet again as Rita A. Fry became the Public Defender.
She had been the First Assistant Public Defender in Mr. Stone' s administration, and made history for
herself and the Office as she became the first female Public Defender of Cook County. The Office was
now bursting with close to 500 assistant public defenders, plus an additional 250 investigators and
support staff; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Fry's administration saw history made concerning the death penalty. Beginning with
Mr. Bachrach, every Public Defender had decried the death penalty on moral and constitutional grounds.
In Illinois, 13 men who had been on death row were exonerated. In January 2000, Governor George
Ryan imposed a moratorium on the enforcement of the death penalty which culminated with his January
12, 2003, pardon of four men and January I 3, 2003, commutation of the death penalty for 160 men and
four women on Illinois' death row; and
WHEREAS, internally, the Office's handling of appeals also changed under Ms. Fry. In 1964, the Office
handled 126 appeals for the year. By 2000, that number had increased to 1,300. In 200 I, legislation was
enacted, increasing the budget for the state agency responsible for appeals throughout the rest of Illinois,
so that it could handle the majority of appeals emanating from Cook County. By January 2003, the
transition was complete; and

3290

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 5, 2005

WHEREAS, on April I, 2003, Edwin A. Burnette assumed the mantle of Public Defender, completing
yet another transition in the evolution of the Office. The First Assistant Public Defender since I 992, Mr.
Burnette began his administration with the need to confront the County s early retirement incentive plan,
which resulted in not merely Ms. Fry's retirement, but also the retirement of almost 20 percent of the
Office. Obstacles to overcome as well as opportunities for the future were in abundance; and
WHEREAS, from its beginning with seven employees, located on the sixth floor of the Criminal Courts
Building, the Office now has 740 attorneys, investigators and support staff, working throughout the
County in I 5 different divisions: Capital Case Coordination, Civil, Felony Trial, First, Municipal,
Forensic Science, Homicide Task Force, Juvenile Justice, Legal Resource, Multiple Defendant, Training,
and the suburban courthouses in Bridgeview, Markham, Maywood, Rolling Meadows and Skokie; and
WHEREAS, based on the past, as the Office celebrates its 75th anniversary, the only certainty for the
future is that it will continue to evolve and change with developments in society and the law, in order to
represent its clients to the fullest.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than fi ve million residents of Cook County, in recognition of 75 years of providing legal
representation to those without the financial resources to afford legal counsel, does hereby applaud the
praiseworthy mission and day-to-day efforts of the Cook County Public Defender's Office; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to Cook County
Public Defender, Mr. Edwin A. Burnette, in recognition of historic milestone.

Approved and adopted this 5th day of October 2005.
JOHN H. STROGER, JR. , President
