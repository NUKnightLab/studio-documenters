 Compliance
Subject to compliance with M/W/DBE and Section 3 participation.
Background
The Harold Ickes Homes development (Ickes), now known as Southbridge was originally situated
on approximately 18 acres within the near south side community area of the city of Chicago and
was located between 22nd Street (North), State Street (East), 25th Street and 24th Street (South)
and Dearborn and Federal Street (West). The Ickes development consisted of eleven buildings
with 1006 total units and the demolition of all buildings was completed in 2010.
Tenant Selection Plan
The proposed resolution also requests approval of the form of Tenant Selection Plan, lease, and
lease riders to be used for Southbridge. It is understood that the owner has an interest and desire
to implement its own lease forms and policy that encourages consistent community standards
for the effective management of the Harold Ickes Redevelopment site, Southbridge.
