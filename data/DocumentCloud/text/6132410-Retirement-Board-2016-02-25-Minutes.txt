The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Discussion was held concerning Public Act 96-1495; ILCS 5-168(g) thereof, which, in part,
indicates that in lieu of levying all or a portion of the tax required under such Section, the City may
deposit with the City Treasurer no later than March 1 of that year for the benefit of the fund, an
amount that together with the taxes levied is not less than the amount of the City contribution. If
such deposit is not received, than the Board can request from the State Comptroller to intercept the
PPRT funds for the benefit of the City for the benefit of satisfying the requirement. Trustee Brown
indicated that the Budget Director will be sending a letter to notify to the Fund no later than March
1 that such funds were deposited with the Treasurer. In the event such deposit does not occur, the
Board requested that the Board’s attorney draft a letter to the State Comptroller notifying the State
of the shortfall.

•

As a follow-up to a request from Trustee Maloney at the Board’s previous meeting, the Executive
Director reported that she has communicated with the City’s Benefit Management Office
concerning health insurance for ‘exempt rank’ members age 55 or over with 20-plus years of
service. As previously communicated by the Benefits Management Office, such exempt members
can participate in the healthcare benefit, but at a 2% charge of the retired officer’s annuity amount.
No further information has been submitted from the City concerning this matter.

•

The Fund has an IT Administrator that manages IT matters for the Fund. However, the current
Firewall needs replacement and the IT Administrator has requested assistance in upgrading and the
Firewall and performing testing on such Firewall. Different providers have been contacted to
complete the upgrade. One firm would provide a representative to assist with the installation of
upgrades; charging a daily rate, no contract or written agreement. The other firm supplied a
statement of work and a lengthy document representing a relationship agreement stipulating
services, akin to a service contract, which would require Board approval and legal review. Through
discussion and review it was determined to research more vendors to provide support services for
the appropriate scope of work needed by the Fund.

•

The Executive Director reviewed with the Board a refund claim of a former prior police officer
(Neeley) who was a member of this fund for approximately 15 years and was over the age of 50 at
resignation. This member terminated her service as a police officer and she has been provided,
through litigation, employment with the Chicago Fire Department as a firefighter contributing to
the Fire Fund and is currently in training at the Fire Academy. This member has requested a refund
of her contributions from this Fund. She cannot transfer the service to the Fire Fund because the
litigation has awarded her prior service to the Fire Fund that overlaps her police service. Illinois
Statutes prohibit a refund to a member over the age of 50, with more than 10 years of service, at
resignation. Through discussion it was agreed that this is a unique situation, with a court decision
involved, that a refund of her contributions should be granted, once the Fund receives appropriate
paperwork and signatures from the member.

• There is interest from Trustees to attend the annual NCPERS conference in May this year.
