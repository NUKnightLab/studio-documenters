 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids to perform demolition work at LeClaire Courts Extension (IL2-015). LeClaire Courts
extends along the west side of South Cicero Avenue from 44th Street to 45th Street. The
structures to be demolished no longer serve a useful purpose and their demolition is needed as
part of the ongoing renovation of CHA developments under the Plan for Transformation. The
demolition work at LeClaire Courts Extension was split into several bid packages to provide
greater contracting opportunities for vendors. Demolition, site work and landscaping is to be
completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00585 on August 17, 2010 for the
demolition of dwelling and non-dwelling units at LeClaire Courts Extension – Group 4. The IFB
was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender and El Dia, and on the CHA
website and at BuySpeed Online. The pre-bid meeting and site visit were held on August 23,
2010. The CHA issued Addendum No. 1 on September 7, 2010. This Addendum distributed
information on the CHA’s new online Contract Compliance System. The CHA received and
opened six (6) bids on September 14, 2010.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with the apparent lowest
bidder, Delta Demolition, Inc. The firm responded to questions on the thoroughness of its bid
and its capacity to perform this work. With the reviews, analysis and meetings completed, the
Department of Procurement and Contracts has determined that Delta Demolition, Inc. is the
lowest responsive and responsible bidder for Group 4 with a bid of $508,900.00.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the CHA’s best interest for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute a contract with Delta
Demolition, Inc. for demolition services at LeClaire Courts Extension – Group 4 for a firm fixed
price of $508,900.00. The demolition work and associated site work and landscaping is to be
completed within ninety (90) calendar days of the date set forth in the Notice to Proceed.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section
3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
