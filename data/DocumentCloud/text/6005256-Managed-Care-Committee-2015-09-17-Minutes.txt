Report on CountyCare Health Plan
A. Metrics (Attachment #1)
B. Corporate Compliance Report (Attachment #2)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare
Health Plan; the Report included metrics and a programmatic update on marketing. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the information on Slide 11, regarding Medicaid cancellations, Chairman Lerner
inquired whether individual follow-up takes place with CountyCare members who receive the notification for
redetermination. Mr. Glass responded in the affirmative; he stated that staff receives a list of the members
who receive the notification – those members receive a phone call and mailing from CountyCare regarding it.
He referenced the Request for Proposals (RFP) currently posted regarding community outreach services
relating to Medicaid eligibility redeterminations; this is to provide support to go knock on people’s doors and
broadly canvass communities. Chairman Lerner suggested that, while talking to people about retaining their
Page 1 of 44

 III.

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
Medicaid coverage, they should at the same time be talking to those community members about their health
– those two things ought to be tied together. Currently, CountyCare/CCHHS is a very broad network; it does
not provide all of those services itself; however, when thinking about a more narrow network, the logical
next discussion point should be regarding the requirements for CountyCare/CCHHS and its partners in
interacting with the community. Director Junge inquired whether there have been any efforts to engage staff
to act in an outreach fashion in their own communities. Mr. Glass stated that this has not been pursued in the
past, but he will look into it, as it is a very good idea.
On a separate note, but also with regard to the subject of outreach activities, Chairman Lerner noted that this
population may not operate with personal computers in their homes, but everyone seems to have a
smartphone of sorts. He inquired whether a CountyCare application (app) exists; he cited text messaging as
an example of a way to communicate with members in today’s technology-driven world. Mr. Glass
responded that an app has not been created for CountyCare; however, the new website is mobile devicecompatible. Board Chairman Hammock noted that utilizing this type of technology does contribute to the
cost of the user’s data systems.
Mr. Glass provided an update on health plan consolidations. He noted that the market is still shifting; he
understands that the State has extended the deadlines for Accountable Care Entities (ACEs) and Care
Coordination Entities (CCEs) to have plans submitted to the State. Advocate has announced that they will
form their own Managed Care Community Network (MCCN), effective January 1, 2016. SmartPlan Choice
has announced that they will be also pursuing an MCCN. Loyola will be claiming their own MCCN, as well
as NextLevel Health. MyCare Chicago has announced that it has entered into a partnership with Molina
Health Plan. Community Care Partners is the NorthShore plan; because NorthShore and Advocate are in
merger discussions, they will likely merge the plans together, as well.
During the discussion of information on Slide 8, Chairman Lerner noted that CountyCare is benchmarking its
numbers against itself. He inquired whether staff have had the opportunity to see if anyone has come out
with any other types of benchmarks for this type of data. Mr. Glass responded that he was unaware of
anything coming out specifically relating to Affordable Care Act Adults; he added that staff will look further
into the subject.
Cathy Bodnar and Ryan Lipinski, CountyCare Compliance Officer, presented the CountyCare Compliance
Annual Report. The Committee received the information.

 Why Market CountyCare?
• Mandatory Managed Care = Competition for
Medicaid health plan membership
• Increase awareness of new plan to broader
Medicaid audience

Page 25 of 44

Managed Care Cte   Sept 17, 2015

 Fall’14 Baseline
Opportunity to influence three key drivers:
Awareness, Favorability & Consideration
• Low brand awareness at 6%
• Respondents familiar with CountyCare have…
– 52% brand favorability; 42% neutral favorability

• As familiarity increases, so does the likelihood of
selecting CountyCare
– 65% ‘somewhat’ familiar = would consider enrolling
– 100% of those who were ‘very’ familiar would consider it as a
plan choice.

 Year 1 Activities
