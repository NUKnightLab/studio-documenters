RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the holiday of Cinco de Mayo commemorates the victory of the Mexican militia over the
French army at The Battle of Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City, on the morning of May 5,
1862; and
WHEREAS, lead by Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin, a small, poorly armed militia estimated
at 4,500 men demonstrated their courage and sacrifice for freedom by stopping and defeating a well
outfitted French army of 6,500 soldiers, which had known no defeat for almost 50 years, therefore
postponing the invasion of the country for a full year; and
WHEREAS, this victory was a glorious moment for Mexican patriots, helping develop a needed sense of
national unity and pride; and
WHEREAS, according to a paper published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and
Culture in 2007, about the origin of the observance of Cinco de Mayo in the United States, the modern
American focus on this holiday first started in California in 1863 in response to the resistance to French
rule in Mexico, and has since been celebrated continuously while virtually ignored in Mexico, where it is
celebrated mainly in the southern town of Puebla and a few larger cities, and has to this day not been
recognized as a federal holiday; and
WHEREAS, celebrating Cinco de Mayo has become increasingly popular in parts of the U.S. that have a
high population of Americans of Mexican ancestry, making this holiday a celebration of Mexican culture,
food, music, beverage and customs unique to Mexico; and
WHEREAS, the cultural impact of the Cinco de Mayo holiday is evident in more than 150 official
celebrations in towns across the U.S. that are predominately non-Hispanic; and
WHEREAS, over 70% of Hispanics living in Cook County are of Mexican descent and make numerous
cultural and economic contributions to the growth and development of our county.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby join in the celebration of Cinco de
Mayo, and encourage all Cook County residents to join in this celebration of Mexican culture and
heritage; and

Body.
