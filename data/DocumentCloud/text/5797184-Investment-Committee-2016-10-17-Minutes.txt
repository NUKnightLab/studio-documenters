Re: Fort Shelby Hotel and Residence Loan Amendments

Mr. Lou Vogt, of Banyan Realty, held discussion, via/teleconference with the Committee
regarding the Fort Shelby requested loan amendments.

David Sowerby joined the Committee, (via/teleconference at 4:30 pm.)

Mr. Vogt reviewed the history of the Retirement System?s investment in the Fort Shelby
which consists of: a $17,100,000.00 construction and permanent mortgage loan (the
"Hotel Loan?) to Fort Shelby Hotel, LLC (?Hotel Borrower") and (ii) a $14,650,000.00
construction and permanent mortgage loan (the ?Residential Loan?) to Fort Shelby
Residential, LLC (?Residential Borrower?) which were originated in 2007 and 2008. On
May 3, 2016, Banyan provided a letter to the Board and the IC on the status of the
efforts of the Borrower to secure refinancing of the hotel and plans for converting the
apartments to condominiums. To allow time for consummation of the refinancing,
Banyan recommended a ninety (90) day extension of the maturity of the loan which
matured April 30, 2016. Board and then IC approved Banya?n?s recommendation for the
extension with a new maturity date of July 29, 2016.

The Borrower has now made a loan modification request to extend both the existing
Hotel Loan and the Residential Loan to December 31, 2018, and to approve conversion
of the apartments to condominiums. Mr. Vogt provided the IC with his recommendation
to approve the borrower?s loan modification request with the exception of the elimination
of balances due under the revolving line, and to include a profit participation in the
condominium conversion upon achieving specified sales achievements. The key
provisions which were recommended by Mr. Vogt after discussion with the Committee
are as follows:

Hotel Loan:

1. Loan extension to December 31, 2018.

2. Interest to remain at 6.5% paid current 

3. Principal amortization based on 30 year term beginning February 1, 2018.
4. Elimination of interest deferral and MCP loan; with a pro rata share of

revolver to remain.

Consummation of City HUD 108 loan restructure by December 31, 2016.
Elimination of Chevron and Shore Bank (Urban Partners) by December
