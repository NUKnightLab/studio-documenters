CLEVELAND ST – PID 110986
Staff Comments:
• Conditions:
• Provide a transition for the westbound bike lane, at the
proposed roundabout intersection

• Recommendations
• Maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible,
to reduce nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the
Black River, & Incorporating habitat restoration along river
5-1

 CLEVELAND ST – PID 110986
Staff Comments:
• Recommendations

5-1

•

Consider using ladder-style high visibility crosswalk markings, in
addition to the “contrasting pavement” that is noted on the plans, to
ensure crosswalk visibility. (Example: W 25th St & Detroit Ave)

•

Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge
islands to improve safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median
refuge islands are an FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasure.

 NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will forward Council’s comments to the
respective project sponsor for their response and
coordinate with the sponsor accordingly

5-1

 NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional
cohesion, PRESERVE existing
infrastructure, and BUILD a
sustainable multimodal transportation
system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality
of life in Northeast Ohio.
