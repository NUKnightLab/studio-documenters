Former Free Press Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan

PowerPoint slides provided maps and renderings of the project. Mr. Ogden and Mr. Collins
provided additional information regarding the voluntary Tier 1 Community Benefits Agreement
(“CBA”) between the City of Detroit and the developer and responded to board member questions

 about project timing, design, Detroit employment and contractors, future tenants, affordable
housing, and previous projects completed by the developer.
Project Introduction
Pyramid Development Co., LLC, a Bedrock Detroit affiliate, is the project developer (the
“Developer”) for the Plan which entails the rehabilitation of the 276,183 square foot former Detroit
Free Press building into a mixed-use building with retail on the first floor, office on the second and
third floors, and residential on floors 4-17 and an undetermined use for the basement and subbasement. First through third floor tenants have not been determined at this time.
It is estimated that 196 temporary construction jobs will be created and 10 direct permanent jobs
will be created in connection with the redevelopment. Additional permanent jobs are expected to
be created by the retail and office tenants. The Developer has agreed to comply with City
Executive Orders.
Total investment is expected to be approximately $69,660,000.00. The Developers are requesting
$7,029,190.00 in TIF reimbursement under the proposed Plan.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of a single (1) parcel containing only the Free Press
Building located at 321 West Lafayette Boulevard on the west side of downtown Detroit.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized or is currently utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located
within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property
is determined to be Functionally Obsolete.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site demolition, selective building
demolition, lead & asbestos surveying, asbestos abatement, air monitoring, hazardous material
removal, site preparation, and preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be
financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible
activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in the summer of
2017 and be complete no later than December 2020.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

The actual cost of those eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for
reimbursement from tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by
the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developers of this Plan will seek additional support through the transfer of the existing
Michigan Business Tax Credit for the property as well as a Neighborhood Enterprise Zone
Abatement (PA 147).
Attached for your review and approval is a resolution authorizing the Former Free Press Building
Brownfield Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory Committee for consideration and
comment within 30 days of their receipt of the proposed Plan. In addition, it authorizes the
President of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation or any person designated by him, as a
representative of the DBRA, to conduct a public hearing in the area to which the Proposed Plan
applies within the next 30 days. This public hearing may be held jointly with any public hearing
conducted by the Community Advisory Committee.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the transmittal of the Brownfield Plan to the Community
Advisory Committee as well as to conduct a public hearing for the Plan for the Former Free Press
Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan.
On a motion by Ms. Grillier, seconded by Mr. Sanders, DBRA Resolution Code 17-03245-01, was unanimously approved.
ADMINISTRATIVE
Designation of Authorized Signatories for DBRA Bank Accounts
Mr. Long stated that with a change in staff at the DEGC the DBRA board needs to approve new
authorized signatories for the DBRA board. In the past the DBRA, and all other public authorities
managed by the DBRA, have historically approved the names of specific individuals as authorized
signatories for bank accounts. This has become difficult administratively for DEGC staff as well
as the operations of the DBRA and other public authorities. Mr. Long is proposing that specific
titles: the board Treasurer and Authorized Agents, be approved as signatories for the DBRA. This
would eliminate the need for the Board to approve new signatories any time there is a change in
the specific individuals who are the Treasurer or Authorized Agents.
Mr. Sanders asked for clarification on what the process would be if the Board had questions or
concerns about a future Authorized Signatory. Mr. Long stated that any board member may ask
questions, discuss and request a vote on Authorized Signatories at any time and that Authorized
Signatories serve at the discretion of the Board.

 Ms. McClain stated that it has been the practice with other boards she serves on that positions,
rather than individuals, are approved as authorized signatories and she supports this change in
practice.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Treasurer and Authorized Agents as Authorized
Signatories for Detroit Brownfield Authority bank accounts.
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins seconded by Ms. Griller, DBRA Resolution Code 17-04-01181 was unanimously approved.
OTHER
None
PUBLIC COMMENT
None
ADJOURNMENT
There being no further business, Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the adjournment of
the meeting. On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Mr. Sanders, the board agreed
unanimously to adjourn the meeting at 4:35 PM.
