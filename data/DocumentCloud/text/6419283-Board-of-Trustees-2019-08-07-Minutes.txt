MEETING NO. 4239
AUGUST 07, 2019

GENERAL COUNSEL’S REPORT- continued
RE: Bankruptcy and ASF Recoupment Issue
This office has discussed with RSCD staff challenges that have been received to
the ASF recoupment. This office recommends retaining Shannon Deeby of Clark Hill
as Bankruptcy Special Counsel to address this matter.
Both the Police and Fire
Retirement System and the General Retirement System had previously retained Ms.
Deeby to represent the Retirement Systems in the City’s bankruptcy. She is familiar
with both the City’s bankruptcy proceedings as well as the ASF recoupment provisions.
RE: Joseph Lebert Burson v. Tina Louise Burson
Macomb County Circuit Court Case No. 18-0241-DM
This office is in receipt of an entered EDRO in this matter. We have reviewed the
entered Order and have certified that it complies with applicable law and plan provisions
and have prepared a resolution for the Board’s adoption.
RE: Carpenters’ Pension Trust Fund v. Cadillac Funding Associates, et al.
Oakland County Circuit Court Case No. 19-174796-CB
Both the General Retirement System and the Police and Fire Retirement System
received subpoenas from parties who have initiated new litigation regarding the Westin
Book-Cadillac requesting certain documents from the Retirement Systems generally
related to the settlement of the Retirement System’s prior litigation. This office directed
Special Legal Counsel Don Wagner, who originally handled this matter, to review the
subpoena and provide an appropriate response. Mr. Wagner has advised that the
Subpoenas are overly broad and objectionable on their face. There are some
documents in their files that are responsive and non-privileged and will be produced.
However, Special Counsel will also prepare a written Objection as to the rest of the
potentially responsive documents, pursuant to MCR 2.305(B) that the subpoena is
overly broad, unduly burdensome, calls for documents already in the party’s
possession, and calls for attorney-client privileged communication and privileged work
product (including expert reports). Accordingly, there is not a need for the Board to
search for responsive documents at this time, though the Board should be prepared to
do so quickly if ordered. General Counsel will provide an update regarding this matter
at today’s meeting
