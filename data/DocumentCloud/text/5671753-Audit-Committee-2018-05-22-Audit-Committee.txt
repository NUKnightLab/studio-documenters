 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S TRANSMITTAL LETTER
May 10, 2018
Board of Directors
Great Lakes Water Authority
Dear Members of the Board,
I am pleased to present the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) of the Great Lakes Water
Authority (“GLWA” or “Authority”) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. These financial statements
were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by a
firm of independent certified public accountants.
Our regional water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The system currently serves an area of 1,069 square miles located in eight
Southeastern Michigan counties and an estimated population of nearly 3.9 million or approximately 38
percent of Michigan’s population.
Our regional wastewater system is also one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment
capacity and population served. The wastewater system currently serves an area of 988 square miles
located in three Southeastern Michigan counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.9 million or
approximately 28 percent of Michigan’s population.
GLWA as a Model of Regional Collaboration
GLWA was incorporated by the City of Detroit (the "City") and the counties of Macomb, Oakland and
Wayne on November 26, 2014 pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended. At the
time of GLWA’s incorporation, the City, through its Detroit Water and Sewerage Department ("DWSD"),
was providing water supply services within and outside of the city through a water supply system and
drainage and sewage disposal services within and outside of the city through a sewage disposal system.
On June 12, 2015, the City and GLWA executed Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Disposal System
Leases (the “Leases”), transferring the regional water and sewer facilities from the City to GLWA for an
initial term of 40 years, as well as a Water and Sewer Services Agreement, pursuant to which GLWA
provides water and sewer services to the City ("Local System"); the City then supplies these services to
Detroit retail customers.
The above agreements required the satisfaction of several conditions before becoming effective. By
January 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), those conditions were met and GLWA, under the terms of the
Leases, became responsible for the assets, all bonded indebtedness as well as other obligations, and
operations for the regional water and wastewater systems.

Page 12

 GLWA leases the regional water and sewer facilities from the City for an allocation of $50 million per year
to fund capital improvements for the City’s retail system and/or for servicing the debt obligations. GLWA
also funds a Water Residential Assistance Program to assist low-income residential households in enrolled
member partner communities.
Financial Highlights
GLWA is committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the water and sewer systems. Below are
three key financial highlights:
1. Strong liquidity with 959 days cash on hand for the water system and 495 days for the sewer system as
shown on the Schedule of Days in the Supplementary Information section.
2. Excellent debt service coverage for all bonds at 1.64 times for the water system and 1.51 times for the
sewer system as described in the Debt Service Coverage schedule in the Statistical section.
3. Sound operational results with an overall positive budget variance of $10.1 million, or 9.1%, for the
water system and $24.5 million, or 14.1%, for the sewer system as shown on the Schedule of Operations
and Maintenance Expense (Budget to Actual) for each system in the Supplementary Information section.
The positive budget variances support subsequent year pay-as-you go capital investment.
Commitment to Excellence
Every month, I highlight the many accomplishments of our valued member partners and talented team
working together to benefit the region in the CEO Report. Here are some highlights for FY 2017.1
July 2016 – Water Operations Receives Water Quality Recognition
GLWA has received the “10-Year Directors Award” from the Partnership for Safe Water, a program
developed by the EPA, American Water Works Association (AWWA), and associated partner organizations
to guide water systems towards improving water quality by optimizing system operations. GLWA was part
of a select group of utilities honored by the Partnership at the annual AWWA conference, the largest and
oldest worldwide organization dedicated to safe water.
August 2016 – Security & Integrity Sponsors Regional Emergency Planning
GLWA’s Security & Integrity Group hosted a table top exercise utilizing its recently updated emergency
response plan. Participants included the City of Detroit, Wayne County, the State of Michigan, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and GLWA staff.
September 2016 – Rating Agencies Recognize Steady Progress
GLWA received positive ratings actions from all three ratings agencies – Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors
Service and S&P Global Ratings, and became an “A” rated utility after nine months of operation as an
independent regional water and sewer authority.
Fitch Ratings provided a substantial upgrade in ratings for senior and second lien debt, moving GLWA’s
outstanding bonds up three notches from “BBB“ to an “A” rating with a stable outlook for its senior lien,
and from “BBB-“ to “A-“ for its second lien.

Page 13

 Moody’s Investors Service upgraded GLWA’s credit rating to A3 and its second lien debt to Baa1 (the
second upgrade in nine months).
S&P Global Ratings revised the stable outlook to positive for both senior lien and second lien bonds.
October 2016 – Thank You to Our Investors
GLWA’s inaugural bond transaction priced which included nearly $1.1 billion for refunding of outstanding
debt and $251.8 million for new capital projects for the regional and Detroit local water systems. As a
result of the favorable interest rates on the bonds, GLWA will realize a net cash flow savings of $309.1
million over the life of the refinanced bonds.
November 2016 – Systems Planning Presents New Capital Improvement Plan
The Asset Management/Capital Planning team presented a new business case evaluation and criteria to
the Board’s Capital Improvement Planning Committee. The in-depth capital analysis and business case for
each capital project supports improved decision making and financial metrics and is based upon best
practices in the water and sewer sectors.
December 2016 – Public Affairs Prepares 2016 “Year in Review”
GLWA Public Affairs Group prepares for the launch of our inaugural “Year in Review” (YIR) for 2016 where
we annually highlight the accomplishments achieved during the previous year. The YIR is presented to our
team members via Town Hall-style meetings at each GLWA location where I get a chance to thank each
team member (across all shifts) for their service and hear firsthand what is on their mind.2
January 2017 – System Analytics Water Audit Consultant Selected
GLWA strives to achieve equity and stability for its customers. For this reason, the System Analytics and
Meter Operations Group engaged a consultant to perform a “Water Units of Service for Non-Master
Metered Customers and System Water Audit”. This project followed the American Water Works
Association standard water audit compilation and review process. Results from phase 1 of the study will
be used in setting the FY 2019 customer charges.
February 2017 – Information Technology Security Updates
GLWA continues to invest in technology and the security of its systems. The Information Technology
Group implemented a Distributed Denial of Services protection for GLWA and for our shared service
partner, DWSD. In addition, the Barracuda web filter was upgraded to provide further protections as well
as other enhanced security measures.

 March 2017 – Organizational Development Launches Apprenticeship Program
Seeking innovative ways to approach hard-to-fill jobs, GLWA launches a three-year apprenticeship
program to hire and train Electrical Instrument Control Technicians (EICTs) in partnership with Focus:
HOPE and Henry Ford College. This program will develop a workforce to fill a GLWA or our customers' skill
gap in the employment market. Upon successful completion of the program, individuals will have
obtained their EICT-I certification from Henry Ford College, receive a U.S. Department of Labor
journeyman card, and full-time employment at a starting wage of $25 per hour.
April 2017 – Regional Collaboration Expands – City of Flint Selects GLWA Water
An historic collaboration among GLWA, City of Flint, Genesee County Drain Commissioner, Karegnondi
Water Authority, and the State of Michigan resulted in the signing of a Statement of Principles for Long
Term Water Delivery to the City of Flint. GLWA has become the primary water source for the City of Flint
and now also provides backup service for Flint, GLWA and Genesee County customers utilizing the public
investments already made by the parties with minimal new investments. This ended a 17-year timeframe
in which Flint considered other water supply options. All agreements were finalized in December 2017.
May 2017 – Systems Planning Group Wastewater Master Plan Study Underway
Beginning in April, the Wastewater Master Plan Steering Committee launched monthly meetings with
engaged stakeholders. The collaboration opportunities are significant not only for GLWA, but other
similar sewage treatment operations in the region as a whole. The master plan is a long-term project
which would ultimately develop a roadmap to go from “clean to green” as we are on a trajectory of being
a clean system to a Utility of the Future.
June 2017 – GLWA Board Approves Budget and Charges for FY 2018
Due to excellent financial performance as we neared the end of FY 2017, the GLWA Board adopted
drinking water charges at 2 percent overall and limited sewer charges to an overall 1.9 percent increase
for FY 2018.
These are a few of the examples of how the good work that is done every day at GLWA leads to excellence
that supports a financially sustainable system for many generations to come.
Overview of the Financial Report
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of GLWA. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all the information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations, GLWA
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both to protect
the entity’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient reliable information for the
preparation of the Authority’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal
controls should not outweigh their benefits, GLWA’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has
been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be
free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that, to the best of our knowledge and
belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.

4

Page 15

 The Authority’s financial statements have been audited by Rehmann Robson LLC, a firm of licensed
certified public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of the Authority for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for
rendering an unmodified opinion that GLWA’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017
are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent auditor’s report is presented as the first
component of the financial section of this report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany
the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of
transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with the basic
financial statements. GLWA’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the independent
auditors.
Acknowledgements
When we say “our” system, it is “our” system that we mutually support and foster with our member
partners, team members, vendor community, Board of Directors, other stakeholders and the public.
Thank you for your continued engaged participation and interest.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
May 10, 2018
To the Board of Directors of the
Great Lakes Water Authority
Detroit, Michigan
Report on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business-type activities and each major
fund of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the "Authority") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017,
and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
Independent Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on auditor judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the financial statements.

Rehmann is an independent member of Nexia International.

 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinions.
Opinions
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the business-type activities and each major fund of the Great Lakes
Water Authority as of June 30, 2017, and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows
thereof for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that management’s
discussion and analysis and the schedules for the pension plan, as listed in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the
basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers
it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an
appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures
to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of
preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses
to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of
the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the required
supplementary information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence
to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that
collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements. The introductory section, combining
and individual fund schedules, and statistical section are presented for purposes of additional analysis
and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.
The introductory section, statistical section and the combining and individual fund schedules are the
responsibility of management and have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any
assurance on them.

GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
June 30, 2017
The management of the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA or Authority) presents this discussion and analysis of
GLWA’s financial position and changes in financial position as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with GLWA’s basic financial
statements and the related notes to the financial statements. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in the
MD&A shall have the meaning given such terms in the transmittal letter from the Chief Executive Officer of GLWA
that accompanies the financial statements and the MD&A.
Introduction to the Great Lakes Water Authority
Our regional water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The Water System currently serves an area of 1,069 square miles located in eight Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 3.9 million or approximately 38% of Michigan’s population.
Suburban wholesale customers comprise approximately 82% of the population served by the Authority while the
retail water customers served by the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) comprise the
remaining 18%.
Our regional sewer system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment capacity and
population served. The Sewer System currently serves an area of 988 square miles located in three Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.9 million or approximately 28% of Michigan’s population.
Suburban wholesale customers comprise approximately 75% of the population served by the Authority, while retail
sewer customers served by the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department comprise the remaining 25%.
GLWA began operations on January 1, 2016. This fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 report represents the first
twelve-month report for GLWA.
A New Organization with a Long History of Quality Service
The creation of a regional water authority was an outcome of the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy.
Collaboration among regional stakeholders, supported by mediation proceedings, resulted in a “Memorandum of
Understanding Regarding the Formation of the Great Lakes Water Authority” signed on September 9, 2014 by the
Mayor of the City of Detroit, the Chief Executives of Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties, and the Governor of
the State of Michigan. The agreement established a framework for a regional water and sewer authority to be
established pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended. The purpose of GLWA is to operate,
control, and improve the regional assets of both the Water System and Sewer System owned by the City and which
were operated by DWSD. The purpose of DWSD is to be the service provider for the retail system which is largely
the City of Detroit customer base.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Subsequently, on June 12, 2015, the City of Detroit and GLWA entered into a Regional Water Supply Lease, a
Regional Sewage Disposal Lease (collectively the “Leases”) and a Water and Sewer Services Agreement (“WSSA”).
Prior to implementation of the Leases, several conditions precedent were necessary to establish the financial and
legal parameters before the GLWA could assume control of the Regional Systems. Those conditions precedent
included execution of the Leases, WSSA, a Shared Services Agreement, and a Detroit General Retirement pension
agreement; adoption of a Master Bond Ordinance ("MBO") for both the Water System and the Sewer System;
confirmation from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that all permits were secured for the
Leased Facilities; certification from the bond trustee that no less than 51% of bondholders of the outstanding
DWSD Water Bonds and DWSD Sewer Bonds, respectively, consented to the adoption by GLWA of the MBO for the
Water System and the Sewer System and to the assumption by GLWA of the outstanding DWSD Water Bonds and
DWSD Sewer Bonds on the Effective Date; certification from the feasibility consultant that GLWA had the ability
to issue at least one dollar of additional indebtedness at each level of lien priority pursuant to the Additional
Bonds Test set forth in the Master Bond Ordinance for each system; legal opinions that each Lease is valid,
binding, and enforceable and that the rates adopted by DWSD for fiscal year 2016 for the wholesale and City
customers were binding and effective; and all necessary consents to the assignment of the wholesale customer
contracts. On December 17, 2015, the GLWA Board determined that all conditions precedent were satisfied to
commence operations on January 1, 2016.
Activity for the Leases was recorded based upon GASB 69, Government Combinations and Disposals of
Government Operations. Equally important to the accounting treatment is the requirement of the flow of funds
in the related MBO. Since GLWA assumed the outstanding bonded indebtedness, retail customer revenues are
pledged for payment of outstanding bonded indebtedness assumed by GLWA. For this reason, pursuant to the
terms of the Leases, DWSD is GLWA’s agent for retail billing, collections and enforcement. The chart below
depicts the DWSD and GLWA customer relationship and the impact of the MBO flow of funds.

Through
December 31, 2015
The Detroit Water &
Sewerage Department
(DWSD) is a provider of
water and sewer services
to regional wholesale and
City of Detroit retail
customers. The Master
Bond Ordinance defines a
flow of funds that is
unique to DWSD as it
functioned prior to the
implementation of the
lease agreements.
The Great Lakes Water
Authority (GLWA)had no
financial activity or
commitments.

Effective January 1, 2016
On the operational effective date, the Water System and Sewer
System Leases define new customer relationships. The GLWA Master
Bond Ordinance defines a new flow of funds for pledged revenues
collected.
Great Lakes Water Authority provides water and sewer service to a)
wholesale customers by a model contract and b) to the City of Detroit
for retail customers pursuant to a water and sewer services contract.
Revenues from all customers are deposited with a trustee and are
pledged for outstanding bonded indebtedness, contractual obligations
arising from the lease agreements, operations and maintenance of
the wholesale and local DWSD systems, and reserves.

Detroit Water & Sewerage Department provides retail services to
primarily City of Detroit Customers. DWSD also provides billing,
collection and enforcement on behalf of GLWA for system pledged
revenues.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Leases Accounting Treatment
Key Statement of Net Assets implications include the following:
Capital Assets: Capital assets subject to the Leases were recorded at “acquisition value” based upon an
inventory valuation performed by a certified appraisal firm as of January 1, 2016. This resulted in an overall
increase in capital asset value from the predecessor entity’s historical cost. Accordingly, the depreciable
lives were reviewed and, in several cases shortened, which has increased annual depreciation expense.
Bonded Indebtedness: The outstanding bonded indebtedness of the predecessor entity was assumed in its
entirety by GLWA. GASB 69 also required debt to be recorded at acquisition value.
Net Pension Liability: The net pension liability represents the Regional Systems’ share of the frozen, defined
benefit City of Detroit General Retirement (GRS) pension assigned to DWSD in the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9
Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment. On January 24, 2017, the parties agreed that 70.3% of the liability was
allocable to the GLWA regional operations and 29.7% to DWSD and is the basis of allocation for furture
pension contributions. That net pension liability is further subdivided between the Water System and the
Sewer System for each entity.
Obligation Payable: The obligation payable represents the Regional Systems’ share of the B and C Note
Obligations assigned to DWSD in the City of Detroit’s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment. The B and C
Note Obligations refers to the debt service on City of Detroit Financial Recovery Bonds dated December 10,
2014. Those bonds were issued to satisfy claims relating to the City’s pension obligation certificates and
postemployment healthcare benefits. GLWA’s portion of the liability was estimated at 70.3% of the total
liability consistent with the allocation applied to the net pension liability.
Beginning Net Position: The acquisition value of assets acquired exceeded the liabilities assumed by $736.5
million in total with $457.9 million attributable to the Water System and $278.6 million attributable to the
Sewer System. In accordance with GASB 69, the opening capital assets were adjusted by an amount to
establish a total net position of zero as of January 1, 2016.
Contractual Obligation Receivable: This represents DWSD’s allocable portion of the long-term bonded
indebtedness assumed by GLWA on January 1, 2016. This receivable is amortized annually in an agreed upon
amount that approximates debt service. If new debt is issued on behalf of DWSD, the receivable is increased.
Lease Payable: The lease payable is the net present value of the lease payment of $50 million per year for
40 years payable to the DWSD with $22.5 million paid to the DWSD local water system and $27.5 million paid
to the DWSD local sewer system based on a 4.17% borrowing rate for both systems.
2018 Memorandum of Understanding Term Sheet
In the course of operations, GLWA and DWSD determined that it would be in their mutual interest to clarify
certain matters pertaining to the operation of the Leases and WSSA. Discussions began in 2016 regarding creation
of a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to accomplish that goal. This lead to the drafting of a Term Sheet,
and ultimately an MOU, with the intent to (a) provide clarification of specific sections of the Leases, WSSA and
the MBO, (b) make adjustments contemplated by the Leases and the WSSA and (c) address the liquidation of
specific liabilities. On April 3, 2018, the Board of Directors for the Great lakes Water Authority approved the MOU
Term Sheet (“Term Sheet”). On April 4, 2018, the Board of Water Commissioners for DWSD approved the same
Term Sheet. The final MOU agreement is expected to be completed within the subsequent 90 days.

16

Page 27

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The 2018 MOU Term Sheet resulted in a special item of $94.3 million with $32.8 million attributable to the water
system and $61.5 million attributable to the sewer system which increased the deficit. Despite the special item,
the clarifications provided by the Term Sheet provide other long-term benefits for both parties which largely
negate the impact over time.
Financial Highlights
Total business-type current assets of $834.8 million exceed current liabilities of $318.1 million by $516.7 million
in total or 2.6 times. For the Water System, current assets of $426.4 million exceed current liabilities of $136.4
million by $290.0 million in total or 3.1 times. For the Sewer System, current assets of $408.3 million exceed
current liabilities of $181.8 million by $226.5 million in total or 2.2 times.
The liabilities and deferred inflows of resources of the business-type activities exceeded the assets and deferred
outflows of resources as of June 30, 2017 by $102.8 million (a net deficit). The net deficit for the water fund was
$36.5 million and $66.3 million for the sewage disposal fund.
The largest category of expense is depreciation at $329.8 million in total with $144.2 million for the water fund
and $185.6 million for the sewage disposal fund. The depreciation is based upon the assets that were recorded at
acquisition value on January 1, 2016 as previously noted. The second largest category of expense is interest
expense at $291.6 million in total with $132.4 million for the water fund and $159.2 million for the sewage
disposal fund.
Overview of the Financial Statements
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the Authority’s basic financial statements.
The basic financial statements are comprised of the following:
The statement of net position presents information on all of the Authority’s assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources, with the residual reported as net position.
The statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position presents information showing how the
Authority’s net position changed during the year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the
underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues
and expenses are reported for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods.
The statement of cash flows provides information about the Authority’s cash receipts, cash payments and net
changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating, investing and capital and non-capital financing
activities for the fiscal year.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of
the data provided in the basic financial statements.
This report also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements
themselves. These schedules provide additional financial, budgetary, statistical, trend, and economic information
that may be helpful to the readers of these financial statements.

Page 28

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Authority presents a combining statement for each system in the supplementary financial information
classified into three categories that align with the Authority’s strategic and budgetary focus of managing capital
investment for both the Regional Water System and Regional Sewer System: 1) operation and maintenance (low
capital investment), 2) improvement and extension (moderate capital investment and financial mechanism to
lower the cost of capital over the long term), and 3) construction projects (high capital investment). The water
and sewage disposal funds together comprise the activity of these three categories of the Authority in total. The
separate water and sewage disposal funds are required by the MBO, a separate credit rating is established for
each fund, and the customers and services provided by each system are separate and distinct.
Financial Analysis
Summaries of the basic financial statements and related commentaries are presented below.
Net Position
Net position is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other elements presented in a statement
of financial position. It is the difference between (a) assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities
and deferred inflows of resources. A net deficit occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed assets and
deferred outflows. Deferred inflows and deferred outflows generally relate to financing activity and GLWA’s
share of the GRS pension obligation. In total, GLWA ended June 30,2017 with a $102.8 million net deficit. The
net deficit for the water fund was $36.5 million and $66.3 million for the sewage disposal fund.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
There are three general components of a net position or deficit: 1) net investment in capital assets (in its
simplest form, capital assets acquired less debt incurred to acquire those assets); 2) restricted (such as legally
required bond reserves or net proceeds from bonds restricted for capital spending); and 3) unrestricted.
Net investments in capital assets is the largest component of the net position with a total balance of $528.9
million ($134.9 million the water fund and $394.0 for the sewage disposal fund). Increases during the year were
attributable to the acquisition of assets and repayment of debt which were both largely offset by depreciation
expense.
Net position restricted for debt service represents amounts that are required by the related MBO or other thirdparty agreements to be used for the repayment of debt. The total amount restricted at year end was $134.1
million with $26.2 million in the water fund and $107.9 million for the sewage disposal fund.
Net position restricted for capital acquisition primarily represents unspent bond proceeds of $323.9 million in
total with $173.0 million in the water fund and $150.9 million in the sewage disposal fund.
The remaining unrestricted deficit is significant: a total of $1.1 billion with $372.8 million for the water fund and
$722.3 for the sewage disposal fund. Unrestricted net position (deficit) is generally defined as the net result of
the other components of net position. This unrestricted deficit is representative of numerous cumulative
historical financial activities over many years through the predecessor entity. The largest dollar amounts were
driven by swap termination fees paid by debt and capital financed assets that were subsequently written off.
Addressing this deficit is a top priority for the GLWA Board and management but recognizes that it will take time.
GLWA continues to optimize its operations, focus on financial planning with a biennial budget, annually update
the five-year capital and financial plan, and expand its expertise in asset management.
Change in Net Position
Water Fund
As shown in the table below, wholesale water customer charges of $331.1 million account for 94.1% of Water
System revenues from 88 customers. Revenue and charge stability are important goals for GLWA and its member
partners. Working within a collaborative process, the water charge structure is based on the following:
1.
2.
3.

40% is based on the average annual sales for each customer from their 36 prior months of usage ending
September 30th each year.
60% is based on fixed monthly charges.
Fiscal year 2017 revenue billed was 106% of budget meeting the goal of revenue stability.

Local system revenues of $15.5 million account for 4.4% of the total operating revenue. Pursuant to the terms of
the WSSA with DWSD, a $20.7 million credit is applied against water purchases in the charge methodology. This
credit replaces a previous ownership benefit that was in place prior to the Effective Date of the Regional System.

19

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
The remaining 1.5% of revenue is mainly due to the bad debt recovery. Collections on the retail customers prior
balances has resulted in a positive adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

The largest category of nonoperating activities is interest expense of $132.4 million which is net of capitalized
interest on construction work in progress. Interest expense before capitalization is largely attributable to debt
service ($119.4 million) with the remainder related to the Water Lease and obligation payable.
Operating income after operating expenses (including depreciation) equals $105.9 million or 30.1% of operating
revenue.
Sewage Disposal Fund
As shown in the table below, wholesale customer charges of $263.3 million account for 52.1% of Sewer System
revenues from 18 customers. Wholesale customer charges are based on a “share” percentage of the annual
budget billed one-twelfth each month. The shares are established based upon historical flows and are formally
revisited every three years. The result is no revenue shortfall or overestimation.

Local system revenues of $187.3 million account for 37.0% of total operating revenues. Pursuant to the terms of
the WSSA with DWSD, a $5.516 million credit is applied against sewer charges in the charge methodology. This
credit replaces a previous ownership benefit that was in place prior to the Effective Date of the Regional System.
The remaining 10.9% of revenue is due to other charges such as industrial waste charges, pollutant surcharges
which are charged to non-residential users. This also includes a bad debt recovery as collections on the retail
customers prior balances has resulted in a positive adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Capital Assets and Debt Administration
GLWA’s investment in capital assets as of June 30, 2017 is $4.9 billion (net of accumulated depreciation) with
$2.0 billion assigned to the Water System and $2.9 billion assigned to the Sewer System. This investment in
capital assets includes land, buildings, plants, transmission lines, vehicles and other equipment. Total net capital
assets decreased by $230.6 million or 4.5% when compared to the prior year. The net decrease is primarily
attributable to depreciation in excess of current year additions.
Water Fund
Water System additions were largely due to construction work-in-progress of $39.7 million.
Approximately one-half of that amount, $18.9 million, is due to construction related to the following projects:
● Project # 114001: 1958 Filter Rehabilitation at the Springwells Water Treatment Plant (Contracts CS-1425, CS200, SP-563). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures were $11.4 million. Life to date costs through June 30, 2017
total $82.9 million. The project is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2019.
● Project # 122012: 36-Inch Water Main in Telegraph Road (Contract WS-648A). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures
were $7.5 million. Life to date costs through June 30, 2017 total $8.1 million. Project is expected to be
substantially completed in fiscal year 2018.

22

Page 33

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
● The remaining $20.7 million is attributable to the 55 projects that are either near closeout in fiscal year 2018
or are design and study contracts related to larger projects.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Sewer System additions were also largely due to construction work-in-progress of $57.3 million.
Slightly more than one-half of that amount, $33.1 million, is due to construction related to the following projects:
● Project # 260113: Remediation at the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF)-Complex II. Fiscal year 2017
expenditures and life to date costs through June 30, 2017 total $17.0 million. Work performed represents
capital remediation related to a March 2016 WRRF fire and capital improvements and enhancements
prioritized by the event. It is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2018.
● Project # 211001: Rehabilitation of Primary Clarifiers, Rectangular Tanks, Drain Lines, Electrical/Mechanical
Building and Pipe Gallery (Contract PC-757). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures and life to date costs through June
30, 2017 total $10.2 million. The project is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2020.
● Project # 212006: Rouge River Outfall Project (Contracts PC-797, CS-1781). Fiscal year 2017 expenditures

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Water Fund
The total outstanding bonds for the Water System is $2.4 billion, increasing by $80.1 million from the prior year.
In October 2016, new revenue and refunding bonds in the amount of $917,805,000 were issued for GLWA system
improvements ($201,090,000), refunding ($665,975,000) and pass-thru of DWSD system improvements of
($50,740,000). Repayment of GLWA bonds issued are funded by charges to all customers. Repayment of the
DWSD specific bonds are paid by DWSD from retail customer collections.
Less than 1% of the total indebtedness is issued through the State of Michigan revolving fund loan program for the
benefit of the Water System. The Water System received $2.44 million in new state revolving fund loans and
received a $1.17 million in loan forgiveness. The state revolving fund loan activity for the year was a pass-through
to DWSD for system improvements.
Sewage Disposal Fund
The total outstanding bonds for the Sewer System is $3.1 billion, decreasing by $125.7 million from the prior year.
In October 2016, new revenue and refunding bonds in the amount of $421,295,000 were issued. Repayment of
GLWA bonds issued are funded by charges to all customers.
Approximately 15.4% of the total indebtedness is issued through the State of Michigan revolving fund loan program
for the benefit of the Sewer System. The Sewer System received $22.2 million in new state revolving fund loans.

Credit Ratings
The ratings for the Water and Sewer Systems are at the same level. GLWA received positive ratings action from
all three rating agencies in its first nine months of operations. Presently, Fitch Ratings has rated senior lien debt
at A and second lien at A-; Standard & Poor’s has rated senior lien debt at A- and second lien at BBB+; and
Moody’s has rated senior lien debt at A3 and second lien at Baa1.
Additional information on the Authority’s long-term debt can be found in Note 6.
Economic Factors Affecting Next Year's Operations and Rates
On June 7, 2017, the GLWA Board adopted the biennial budget for the Authority for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.
That two-year financial plan remains true to a foundational commitment to control the budget within a 4%
revenue cap.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Management's Discussion and Analysis
Water Fund
Due to favorable Water System financial performance the budget decreased by one percent for FY 2018. This
translated into a system average charge increase of 2% depending on each customers usage in relation to other
customers. An additional consideration was that an agreement was likely for the City of Flint to enter a 30-year
model contract in FY 2018 which has a positive revenue impact.
Sewage Disposal Fund
Due to favorable Sewer System financial performance the budget increased by only 0.3 percent for FY 2018. This
translated into a system average charge increase of 1.9%. This average increase reflects an amended sewer shares
allocation, based on a strength of flow study that will be phased-in over a two-year period (FY 2018 and FY 2019).
This outcome, which shifted shares among customers, was the result of a year-long data collection and research
study by a technical team comprised of GLWA and its sewer customers.
Requests for Information
This financial report is designed to provide a general overview of GLWA’s finances for all those with an interest in
the Authority’s finances. Questions concerning any of the information provided in this report or requests for
additional financial information should be addressed to Great Lakes Water Authority, Office of the Chief Financial

GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Notes To Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Great Lakes Water Authority ("GLWA" or the “Authority” ) is the regional wholesale provider of water and sewer
services in southeast Michigan. The Authority was incorporated by the counties of Macomb, Oakland, Wayne and the
City of Detroit (the “City”) on November 26, 2014 pursuant to Act 233, Public Acts of Michigan, 1955, as amended
(“Act 233”). Pursuant to Leases that became effective on January 1, 2016, the Authority assumed possession and
control of the regional assets of both the water supply and sewage disposal systems owned by the City, which were
previously operated by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (“DWSD” or the “Department”). The City,
acting through DWSD, will continue to manage and operate its own local retail water and sewer system
infrastructure. The leases assigned all revenues of both systems to the Authority for an initial term of 40 years and
substituted GLWA for the City as the obligor on all outstanding debt obligations of the City related to the systems.
The Authority’s water system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of water produced and
population served. The water system currently serves an area of 1,069 square miles located in eight Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 3.9 million or approximately 38% of Michigan’s population. Suburban
wholesale customers comprise approximately 82% of the population served by the Authority, and the retail water
customers comprise the remainder served by the Authority.
The Authority’s sewer system is one of the largest in the United States, both in terms of treatment capacity and
population served. The sewer system currently serves an area of 988 square miles located in three Michigan
counties and an estimated population of nearly 2.9 million or approximately 28% of Michigan’s population. Suburban
customers comprise approximately 75% of the population served by the Authority, and the retail sewer customers
comprise the remainder served by the Authority.
The Authority is authorized to establish rates, fees and charges for its water supply and sewage disposal services.
Under the Water and Sewer Services Agreement, the City is appointed as agent of the Authority for setting retail
rates and for billing, collecting and enforcing the collection of charges from retail water and sewer customers. As
an agent of the Authority, the City, through the Board of Water Commissioners and without further approval by the
City Council, is required to set retail rates to meet the revenue requirements for the City retail portion of the water
and sewer systems. Under certain conditions, the Authority may terminate the City’s appointment.
The financial statements of the Authority have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the
accepted standard setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The
more significant of the Authority’s accounting policies are described below.
Reporting Entity
The GLWA Board is composed of six voting members. Two members are residents of the City of Detroit and are
appointed by the Mayor of the City of Detroit. The counties of Macomb, Oakland and Wayne each appoint one
member who is a resident of the county from which appointed and the Governor of the State of Michigan appoints
one member who is a resident of an area served by the Authority outside of the counties. All members of the GLWA
Board must have at least seven years of experience in a regulated industry, such as a utility, engineering, finance,
accounting or law firm. After the initial term specified in its Articles of Incorporation, each GLWA Board member is
appointed for a four-year term and serves at the pleasure of the appointing government.
The GLWA Board has adopted a committee structure. Four committees have been established: Audit, Capital
Improvement Planning, Operations and Resources, and Legal.
The Authority has a water enterprise fund and a sewage disposal enterprise fund, both of which are presented as
major funds.

Basis of Accounting
The accounting policies of the Authority conform to GAAP as applicable to governmental entities. The accounts of
the Authority are used to account for its activities, which are financed and operated in a manner similar to a private
business enterprise. Accordingly, the Authority maintains its records on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues
from operations, investments and other sources are recorded when earned. Expenses (including depreciation) of
providing services to the public are accrued when incurred.
Nonexchange transactions, in which the Authority receives value without directly giving equal value in return,
include contributions and grants. On an accrual basis, revenue from contributions and grants is recognized in the
fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied, including timing and expense requirements.
Timing requirements specify the year when the resources are required to be used or the fiscal year when use is first
permitted. Expense requirements specify the year in which the resources are provided to the Authority on a
reimbursement basis.
Assets, Deferred Outflows of Resources, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Equity
Cash Deposits and Investments
The Authority’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Investments are stated at fair value. Short-term investments are reported at cost, which approximates fair value.
Securities traded on a national or international exchange are valued at the last reported sales price at current
exchange rates. Mortgages are valued on the basis of future principal and interest payments, and are discounted at
prevailing interest rates for similar instruments. Investments that do not have established market values are
reported at estimated fair value. Cash deposits are reported at carrying amounts, which reasonably approximates
fair value.
State statutes authorize the Authority to deposit in the accounts of federally insured banks, credit unions and
savings and loan associations and to invest in obligations of the U.S. Treasury, certain commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, bankers’ acceptances and mutual funds composed of otherwise legal investments. The Authority also
maintains and adheres to a formal investment policy in accordance with Michigan Public Act 20 of 1943 Investment
Surplus Funds of Political Subdivisions.
Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents
Restricted assets are those assets set aside as required by the Authority's Master Bond Ordinance ("MBO"). See Note 4
for further details.
Unbilled Revenue
The Authority records unbilled revenues for services provided prior to year‐end by accruing actual revenues billed in
the subsequent month.
Contractual Obligation Receivable
Pursuant to the Water and Sewer Services Agreement between the City and Authority, the City is responsible for
paying the portion of debt service on the bonds assumed by the Authority that were issued to finance the cost of
improvements to the Detroit local facilities. Hence, the "receivable" recorded by the Authority on the "contractual
obligation" of the City to the Authority. Any new debt issued on behalf of DWSD is also included in the contractual
obligation receivable.

Notes To Financial Statements
Prepaid Items and Other Assets
Inventories consist of operating, maintenance and repair parts for sewage assets and are valued at the lower of cost
or market, with cost being determined on an average cost method. Inventory is recorded as expense when consumed
rather than when purchased. The water fund does not report inventory because the amounts are insignificant and
for efficiency are recorded in the sewage disposal fund. Any inventory usage by the water fund is charged through
an interfund payable to the sewage disposal fund.
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items
in the financial statements.
Prepaid Lease
As described in Note 7, the Authority has recorded a prepaid lease for cash paid to DWSD on the date GLWA began
operations equivalent to six months of lease payments. As described in Note 12, based on a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet with DWSD, dated April 2018, this will be applied at the end of the 40 year term
and, hence it is classified as noncurrent.
Capital Assets
Capital assets are recorded at historical cost, together with interest capitalized during construction. All acquisitions
of land and land improvements are capitalized regardless of cost.
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend assets’
lives are not capitalized.
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. Interest incurred
during the construction phase of capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capitalized value
of the assets constructed.
Capital assets acquired after January 1, 2016 are depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the
assets as follows:
Useful Lives
(in years)
Site improvements
Buildings and structures
Infrastructure
Machinery and equipment
Vehicles

15
20-50
80
3-20
5-7

Capital assets acquired from the bifurcation at January 1, 2016 are depreciated over their estimated remaining
useful lives at that time as determined by a third-party valuation. These remaining lives differ from the years cited
above for newly acquired capital assets and, in most instances, are significantly shorter.

Notes To Financial Statements
Deferred Outflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of net position reports a separate section for deferred outflows of resources.
This separate financial statement element represents a consumption of net position that applies to future periods
and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (or expense) until then. The Authority reports deferred
outflows of resources for two items: deferred charges on refunding and pension amounts. Deferred charges on
refunding results from the difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price; these
amounts are deferred and amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. Deferred
outflows of resources from pension amounts relate to the net pension liability. A portion of these costs represent
contributions to the plan subsequent to the plan measurement date. More detailed information on pension amounts
can be found in Note 10.
Long-term Obligations
In the financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the
statement of net position. Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using
the effective interest method. Bonds payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium or discount.
Obligation Payable
Under the terms of the lease agreements with the City, the Authority is required to pay a portion of the City’s B and
C notes allocated to the regional water and sewer systems. See “Obligation Payable-City of Detroit 2014 Financial
Recovery Bonds” in Note 6.
Leases Payable
The effective date of the leases by the City to the Authority for the leased water and sewer facilities was January 1,
2016. See Note 8 for the detail of the leases.
Compensated Absences
The Authority has a paid time off (PTO) policy which has an annual accrual period ending September 30 each year.
Employees are allowed to carry over a maximum bank of 80 hours to the next accrual period. Balances greater than
80 hours up to a maximum of 160 hours shall be converted to the retiree health saving program at 50% of the value
of the PTO time. Hours in excess of 160 hours are forfeited if unused by September 30 of each accrual period. The
accrued compensated absences for PTO accrual are approximately $1,456,000 for the water fund and $679,000 for
the sewage disposal fund on June 30, 2017.
The Authority also has an accrued compensated absence liability assumed on January 1, 2016 relating to the
accumulated unpaid vacation and sick leave balances for those employees who retired from the City or resigned
from the City and accepted employment with the Authority on January 1, 2016. The June 30, 2017 balance of the
accrued compensated absences for the liability assumed on January 1, 2016 is approximately $2,990,000. This
liability is recorded in the water fund as the disbursements for payment will be processed from the water fund with
reimbursement from the sewer fund. The accrued compensated absences includes the employers’ share of Social
Security and Medicare taxes.
Bond Premiums, Discounts, and Deferred Amounts on Refunding
Bond premiums, discounts, and gains or losses on refunding are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds.
Bond premiums and discounts are amortized using the effective interest method, and deferred amounts on refunding
are amortized using the straight‐line method. Bonds payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium and
discounts. Deferred amounts on refunding are reported as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources.

39

Page 50

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Notes To Financial Statements
Deferred Inflows of Resources
In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred inflows of resources.
This separate financial statement element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to future periods
and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (or revenues) until that time. The Authority has included the
deferred amounts on swap terminations, deferred gain on refunding and pension inflows in this reporting category.
The deferred amounts on swap terminations were assumed as part of the lease agreements with the City. The
amounts will be fully amortized for both funds by fiscal 2036. Deferred gain on refunding results from the
difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price; these amounts are deferred and
amortized over the shorter of the life of the refunded or refunding debt. Deferred pension inflows result when
there is a change in total pension liability due to benefit changes, differences between expected and actual
experience, changes in actuarial assumptions, or differences between expected and actual investment returns. The
amount for the changes in actuarial assumptions is deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining service
life. The amount for the difference between actual and projected assumptions in investment earnings is deferred
and amortized over five years.
Net Position
Net position, which represents the difference between assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and
deferred inflows of resources, is reported in three components as follows:
Net Investment in Capital Assets - consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, and related debt.
Restricted – consists of amounts that are legally restricted by outside parties or by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation.
Unrestricted – is the residual balance of net position after net investment in capital assets and restricted.
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, generally it is the Authority’s policy to use
restricted resources first and then unrestricted resources when they are needed.
Classification of Revenues and Expenses
The Authority classifies its revenues and expenses as either operating or nonoperating.
Operating revenues are those revenues generated from providing services in connection with the Authority’s
principal ongoing operations. The principal operating revenues of the Authority are wholesale charges for providing
water and wastewater treatment. The local system charges are the wholesale charges to the City of Detroit under
the Water and Sewer Services Agreement. Wholesale customer charges are shown net of bad debt expense of
$1,252,465 for the water fund and $3,165,055 for the sewage disposal fund.
Operating expenses include the costs of operating the water and sewer utilities, administrative expenses and
depreciation on capital assets. Costs related to shared facilities and personnel are allocated to the water and sewer
funds on a basis that relates costs incurred to the system benefited. By agreement, the Authority provides shared
services to DWSD; accordingly, operating expenses for personnel and contractual services have been reported net of
the charges for shared services to DWSD.
All revenue and expenses not meeting these definitions are reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses.
Taxes
The Authority pays no direct federal, state or local taxes, except local taxes on excess property and federal Social
Security taxes.

Interest Income
Interest income is the interest earned on the contractual obligation receivable.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position includes amounts related
to the accretion of capital appreciation bonds. Interest expense is reported net of capitalized interest.
Capital Contributions
Contributed capital represents the acquisition value of sewer lines received from a wholesale customer.
Central Services and Administrative Services
Various common costs incurred by the Authority are allocated proratably between the water and sewer funds. The
allocations are based on management’s best estimate and may change from year to year depending on the activities
incurred by each fund and the information available. The following table shows the allocation of these common
costs for the year ended June 30, 2017:

Centralized services include security, systems operations control, field engineering and service operations,
information technology, planning, energy management, and system analytics service costs.
Administrative services includes executive, public affairs, general counsel, organizational development, risk
management, finance, procurement, and other service costs.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the basic financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2. BUDGETARY INFORMATION
The financial activity of the Authority is presented in two enterprise funds, which are not required under State
statutes to adopt appropriated budgets. Budget to actual schedules for revenues and expenses is presented in the
other information section of this report. This schedule is not required by GAAP or subject to audit procedures. It is
presented strictly for informational purposes.
Budget Process
GLWA is required to adopt a two-year budget for the regional water and sewer systems. The budgeted expenses
shall equal the sum of the revenue requirement, including the following for both the regional water and sewer
systems: a) operation and maintenance expenses; b) amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on all
bonds and to restore any reserves therefor established in the Master Bond Ordinance; c) the lease payment, which
shall be a common-to-all charge; d) GLWA portions of the net pension liability and the B&C obligation payable; e)
the amount necessary to be deposited to the Water Residential Assistance Program (WRAP) Fund, which shall be a
common-to-all charge equal to 0.5% of the base budgeted operating revenues for the regional water and sewer
systems for each fiscal year; f) the amounts needed to make the required deposits to the regional Extraordinary
Repair and Replacement Reserve Fund and the regional Improvement and Extension Fund as defined in the Master
Bond Ordinance; and g) the amount necessary to satisfy the coverage ratios required by the rate covenant in the
Master Bond Ordinance.
As provided in the leases, through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the water and sewer systems are assumed to
experience annual increases in the regional revenue requirement of not more than 4%. This limitation shall not be
applicable, however, if the regional revenue requirement must increase beyond the 4% assumption in order to
satisfy the rate covenant or to pay the cost of improvements to the leased water and/or sewer facilities that are
required to be made by applicable laws.
In the leases, the City acknowledges that all local water and sewer system revenues received from customers in the
City are the property of the GLWA and will be deposited as received in the Receiving Fund as defined in the Master
Bond Ordinance and applied as provided in the Bond Ordinance. As a result, the City agrees to provide the Authority
with a budget for the local water and sewer system as provided in the Water and Sewer Services Agreement.
Schedule of Charges Process
The GLWA Wholesale Customer Model Water Contract requires that the GLWA provide wholesale customers with
written notice of a proposed charge, meet to review the proposed charges, and the underlying data used to
calculate the charge not less than 30 calendar days prior to a public hearing. Further, the contract requires that a
public hearing be held no less than 120 days prior to the date that a proposed charge increase is to take effect.
The Water and Sewer Services agreement between GLWA and DWSD requires that GLWA provides the City with
written notice of the proposed charges and the underlying data used to calculate the charge not less than 120
calendar days prior to the effective date of any new charges.

Restricted cash of the Authority primarily consists of amounts held in reserve for construction retainage and for
future debt service payments.
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits and Money Market Accounts. Deposits and money market accounts are exposed to
custodial credit risk if they are not covered by depository insurance. At year-end, the carrying amount of the
Authority’s deposits and money market accounts was $505,464,278 for the water fund and $404,341,355 for the
sewage disposal fund. The bank balance of the water fund deposits and money markets was $535,773,864 of which
$518,863,338 was uninsured and uncollateralized. The bank balance of the sewage disposal fund deposits and
money markets was $379,931,554 of which $379,593,521 was uninsured and uncollateralized.
In accordance with the Authority’s investment policy and State law, all deposits are uncollateralized, held in the
Authority’s name, and evidenced by a safekeeping receipt. Also, due to the dollar amounts of cash deposits and the
limits of FDIC insurance, the Authority believes it is impractical to insure all bank deposits. As a result, the Authority
evaluates each financial institution and assesses the level of risk of each institution; only those institutions with an
acceptable estimated risk level are used as depositories.

Investments are exposed to custodial credit risk if the securities are uninsured, unregistered or held by a
counterparty or its agent but not in the government’s name. In accordance with the Authority’s investment policy,
all investments are held in the name of the Authority and are evidenced by a safekeeping receipt confirmation, and
thus not exposed to custodial credit risk.
Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its
obligations. The Authority’s investment policy and State law require that commercial paper be rated in the top two
ratings by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
As of June 30, 2017, all of the Authority’s investments in securities of U.S. agencies were rated AA+ by Standard &
Poor’s and Aaa by Moody's. U.S treasury securities are explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and not
considered to have credit risk. The Authority's money market accounts were not rated.
Concentration of Credit Risk. Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a
government’s investment in a single issuer. The Authority’s investment policy requires diversification by security
type and institution, but does not place a fixed percentage limit for any one issuer.
At June 30, 2017, the Authority had greater than 5% of its total investment portfolio concentrated as follows:

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair
value of investments. The Authority’s investment policy does not limit investment maturities as a means of
managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates.

Fair Value Measurements - The Authority categorizes investments measured at fair value within the fair value
hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs
used to measure the fair value of the assets. Level 1 inputs are quoted at prices in active markets for identical
assets; Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves observable at
commonly quoted intervals; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable in the market and are the least reliable. The
Authority had the following fair value measurements as of June 30, 2017:

Level 1
Water fund
Investments by fair value level:
U.S. treasury notes
U.S. government agencies

4. RESTRICTED ASSETS
Restricted assets, comprised of cash and investments, are available for debt service on revenue bonds and to
provide funds for improvements, enlargements, extensions and construction. In accordance with the provisions of
the Master Bond Ordinance and Board guidance, the Authority follows a detailed and sequential flow of funds
concept and set of procedures that establishes various physically segregated accounts through which monies flow
and are maintained at certain levels in satisfaction of all borrowing and other legal requirements.

Refunded Debt - Water Fund
In October 2016 the Authority issued $88,000,000 in Series 2016A senior lien revenue bonds, $163,830,000 in Series 2016B second
lien revenue bonds, $443,930,000 in Series 2016C senior lien revenue refunding bonds and $224,045,000 in Series 2016D second lien
revenue refunding bonds. The net proceeds of the Series 2016A and Series 2016B will be used to pay certain costs of improvements,
enlargements and extensions and repairs to the Regional Water System and Local Water System. The net proceeds of the Series
2016C and Series 2016D were used to purchase securities that were placed in an irrevocable trust with an escrow agent to refund
$116,645,000 of Series 2003D revenue bonds, $30,335,000 of Series 2004A revenue bonds, $15,725,000 of Series 2004B revenue

revenue bonds, $198,700,000 of Series 2006C revenue bonds and $59,815,000 of Series 2006D revenue bonds. As a result, the bonds
are considered to be defeased and the liability for these bonds has been removed from the financial statements. The refunding
bonds resulted in a savings of $185,424,383 over the next 20 years and an economic gain of $120,780,483.
Refunded Debt - Sewage Disposal Fund
In October 2016, the Authority issued $126,105,000 in Series 2016B senior lien revenue refunding bonds and $295,190,000 in Series

trust with an escrow agent to refund $134,745,000 of Series 2001E revenue bonds, $25,550,000 of Series 2003B revenue bonds,
$123,185,000 of Series 2006A revenue bonds, $174,565,000 of Series 2006B revenue bonds, $9,740,000 of Series 2006C revenue
bonds and $12,355,000 of Series 2012A revenue bonds. As a result, the bonds are considered to be defeased and the liability for
these bonds has been removed from the financial statements. The refunding bonds resulted in a savings of $123,710,549 over the
next 20 years and an economic gain of $71,155,202.
Issuance of State Revolving Loans
The Authority's water fund received loans from the State of Michigan Revolving Loan Fund totaling $2,436,781, of which $1,168,307
has been forgiven, and the sewage disposal fund received $22,216,294 during the year ended June 30, 2017. The proceeds of the
sewage disposal fund loans were used to pay costs of acquiring, constructing extensions, and making certain repairs and
improvements to the Systems. The water fund loans were for DWSD, the subrecipient of the loans. At June 30, 2017, $19,191,526
for the water fund and $114,539,687 for the sewage disposal fund was authorized and unissued.
Debt Ratings
As of September 30, 2016, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ratings on the senior and second lien debt was A-/BBB+; Moody's rating
was A3/Baa1 and Fitch's rating was A/A-.
Contractual Obligation Receivable - Debt Allocation for DWSD Retail Operations
As part of the lease transaction in which GLWA leased the regional water and sewer system from the City of Detroit, all DWSD
revenue bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2015, including those purchased by the Michigan Finance Authority under its state
revolving loan program, were assumed by GLWA with the consent of bondholders. Total bonds assumed by GLWA totaled
$2,313,683,761 for the water fund and $3,291,282,050 for the sewage disposal fund.
Per the Water and Sewer Services Agreement between the DWSD and GLWA dated June 12, 2015 and the Master Bond Ordinance
dated October 7, 2015, as amended, the Detroit retail class continues to pay its common-to-all share of debt service revenue
requirements and its allocated share of debt service revenue requirements associated with improvements to the local water and
sewer systems. Payments on the debt service incurred by GLWA on the outstanding revenue bonds assumed as of December 31, 2015
are to be allocated using an agreed-upon percentage of total debt service associated with bond-financed local improvements over
the life of such bonds, though the bonds themselves continue to be secured by the net revenue of GLWA, and the revenues of the
Detroit retail class. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet was entered into with DWSD dated April 2018 with an
agreed upon allocation and amortization schedule. The June 30, 2017 balance has been adjusted to the revised allocation. The
total obligation receivable at June 30, 2017, including the additional water fund debt issued during the year, is $495,681,322 for
the water fund and $358,090,600 for the sewage disposal fund.

of assets; errors or omissions; job related illnesses or injuries to employees; natural disasters; and
environmental occurrences. Also included are risk of loss associated with providing medical benefits to
employees.
The Authority purchases a variety of insurance policies including: public official's and employment practices

automobile. The Authority also has coverage under a pollution legal liability policy with limits of $50
million, a property insurance policy with limits of $750 million and a public officials policy with limits of $25
million.
Settled claims relating to commercial insurance have not exceeded the amount of insurance coverage in any
of the past two fiscal years.
A liability for claims is reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported.
Claim liabilities are calculated considering the effects of recent claim settlement trends including frequency
and amount of payouts and other economic and social factors. The claim liabilities also include estimated
costs for claim administration fees and outside legal and medical assistance costs. The liabilities for
workers’ compensation current year claims is based on estimates and payments are based on actuals.
Under most circumstances, the Authority’s maximum loss retention per occurrence was as follows:
Maximum Retention Per
Occurrence

Type of Risk
Workers' compensation

$1,250,000 per occurrence

General and automobile liability

$250,000 per occurrence

Motor vehicle physical damage

Authority assumes all risk

Property damage

$1,000,000 per occurrence

Public officials

$250,000 per occurrence

The Authority estimates the liability for medical and worker's compensation claims that have been incurred
through the end of the fiscal year, including claims that have been reported as well as those that have not
yet been reported, which includes estimates of both future payments of losses and related claim
adjustments expense. The liability is based on individual claims and management's evaluation of experience
with respect to the probable number and nature of claims. Any adjustments resulting from settlement of
losses will be reflected in earnings at the time the adjustments are determined.

Medical insurance. The Authority provides medical benefits to a significant number of employees through a
self-insured health plan that is administered by third party administrators. The Authority purchased stop loss
insurance for its self-insured health plan with terms of $300,000 per contract to reduce risk exposure for the
group. The self-insured program is administered by a third-party administrator who provides claims review
and processing services as well as illustrated premium rates, which are anticipated, over time, to
approximate the actual cost of benefits.

As part of the City of Detroit bankruptcy plan of adjustment (POA) and the Leases (Section 4.3), the City,
the City of Detroit General Employees’ Retirement system (GRS or the “System”) and the Authority entered
into an agreement on December 1, 2015 that set forth the terms for contributions and reporting of the DWSD
share of the GRS pension pool. GRS provides the information necessary for the Authority and DWSD to report
the proportionate share separately in their respective statements. On January 24, 2017, DWSD and the
Authority provided a supplement to the agreement whereby GRS is directed to allocate investments and
pension liabilities of the DWSD division on the basis of 70.3% to the Authority and 29.7% to DWSD effective
January 1, 2016. This information is available in a separate audit report for the “Legacy Pension Plan
(Component II) of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit Statement of Changes in Fiduciary
Net Position by Division with Supplemental Information as of June 30, 2017" and is available by contacting
the Authority’s management. This agreement constitutes a special funding situation pursuant to the
provisions of GASB 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions. As such, while no Authority
employees earn service credit in the legacy or hybrid plans, GLWA is legally responsible for making
substantial contributions to a legacy pension plan of another entity and, accordingly, must record a net
pension liability for its proportion and make the following disclosures regarding the plan as required by the
standard.
Plan Administration. The Authority contributes to (and DWSD participates in) the System. The System is a
single employer plan composed of a defined benefit plan component and a defined contribution annuity plan
component. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to plan members and
beneficiaries. The plan is administered by its own board of trustees. Plan members include active
employees, retirees and beneficiaries from various departments within the City. Benefit terms have been
established by contractual agreements between the City and the employees’ collective bargaining units;
amendments are subject to the same process.

supplementary information. The reports can be obtained from City of Detroit Retirement Systems, One
Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Avenue, Suite 3000, Detroit, MI 48226 or obtained from the Systems’ website
(www.rscd.org). Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the
separately issued financial reports.
Benefits Provided. Plan members may retire at age 55 or 60 with 5, 8, 10 or 25 years of credited service
depending on which group the employee is in. Members are vested after completing 5, 8 or 10 years of
credited service. Retirement options that provide for survivor benefits are available to members. The Plan
also provides death and disability benefits. If a member leaves employment or dies before vesting,
accumulated member contributions plus interest are refunded to the member or designated beneficiary.
Component II - Component II is the legacy plan, the original defined benefit plan, which includes a defined
benefit component and a defined contribution component. Component II generally applies to benefits
accrued by members prior to July 1, 2014. The plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to
plan members and beneficiaries. Except as specifically provided in the combined plan, benefits provided
under Component II are frozen effective June 30, 2014. Component II also includes the income stabilization
fund. The fund, a part of Component II and established as a provision of the POA, was established for the
sole purpose of paying the income stabilization benefits to eligible pensioners. Complete details regarding
the Component II benefits and changes in those benefits by virtue of the POA are presented in the System
financial statements.
Employer Contributions. Employer contributions, including the Authority's nonemployer contribution, for
the respective components are as follows:
Component II - Employer contributions to the GRS were determined by the provisions of the POA. Included
within contributions in Component II are amounts sourced from the one-time sale of City-owned artwork
with proceeds from the Foundation for Detroit's Future in the amount of $32,886,827 along with $4,005,830
from unlimited tax general obligation bonds and $67,900,000 of contributions from the City and related
entities, of which $45,400,000 of contributions were from GLWA and DWSD. Employer contributions were
also made into the income stabilization fund in the amount of $1,689,857 from the bond proceeds.
The POA obligates DWSD to pay $2,500,000 per year towards administrative costs and annual plan
contributions of $42,900,000 per year in total for both water and sewer employees, until 2023. Pursuant to
the leases, the Authority is obligated to pay its allocable share of such liability. The portion allocated to the
Authority is $31,916,200 for fiscal year 2017. Subsequent to 2023, DWSD and the Authority will be
responsible for paying their allocable share of any additional amounts that are actuarially determined to be
payable.
The information below represents the Authority’s share of pension liability activity. DWSD separately
reports its prorata share of activity in its separate financial statements.
DWSD Employee Contributions. Contribution requirements of plan members are established and may be
amended by the board of trustees in accordance with the City Charter, union contracts, and plan provisions.
For the year ended June 30, 2017, there were minimal employee contributions into Component II, only
related to military service credit, as the plan was frozen as of June 30, 2014; contributions into Component I
began thereafter.
Net Pension Liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2016, and the total pension
liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date.

Actuarial Assumptions. The total pension liability in the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation was determined
using the following actuarial assumptions.
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

NA
NA
7.23%, net of investment expense and
including inflation

The actuarial assumptions were based on an experience study from 2008-2013 issued in February 2015; the
mortality table assumption was based on RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table for males and females. The
tables are projected to be fully generational, based on two-dimensional sex distinct mortality scale MP2014.
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block
method in which best-estimates of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension
plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each asset class. These real ranges are combined
to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by
the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. For each asset class that is included
in the pension plan's target asset allocation as of June 30, 2016, these best estimates are summarized in the
following table:

Discount Rate. The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.23%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the
current contribution rate and that Authority contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference
between actuarially determined contribution rates and the member rate. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit
payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total
pension liability.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Improvement Program
The Authority is engaged in a variety of projects that are part of its five-year capital improvement program
(the "Program"). The total cost of this Program is anticipated to be approximately $800.6 million for the
water fund and $752.7 million for the sewage disposal fund through fiscal year 2022. The Program is being
financed primarily from revenue bond proceeds in addition to customer charges revenue. The latter is
accounted for in the Improvement & Extension Fund as defined in the MBO. As of June 30, 2017, the water
fund has unspent bond proceeds of $173.0 million in addition to the Improvement & Extension funds of
$177.3 million available for use in funding these commitments. Similarly, the sewage disposal fund has
unspent bond proceeds of $150.9 million in addition to Improvement & Extension funds of $61.8 million
available for use in funding these commitments.
The total amount of construction contract commitments outstanding at June 30, 2017 was approximately
$34.5 million for the water fund and $139.0 million for the sewage disposal fund.
Contingencies
The Authority is subject to various government environmental laws and regulations. GASB Statement No. 49,
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations, established accounting and
financial reporting standards for pollution (including contamination) remediation obligations, which are
obligations to address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in
pollution remedial activities such as site assessments and cleanups. The standard excludes pollution
prevention or control obligations with respect to current operations, and future pollution remediation
activities that are required upon retirement of an asset, such as landfill closure and post-closure care. The
Authority determined that there were no estimated pollution remediation obligations to be recorded at
June 30, 2017.
The sewage disposal fund’s operations are subject to regulation pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the Water Quality Act of 1987 (collectively, the
Clean Water Act). Included in the regulatory framework established by the Clean Water Act is the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, which requires operation of wastewater
system facilities according to discharge limitations and other requirements as set forth in permits issued to
each facility. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authorized the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to implement and enforce the federal NPDES permit program. The sewage
disposal fund operates pursuant to an NPDES permit that is in effect through October 1, 2017.
The Authority is a defendant in numerous alleged claims, lawsuits, billing disputes, and other stated and
pending demands. The Authority's Legal Department has estimated a reserve of $75,000 for the water fund
and $4,039,562 for the sewage disposal fund, which are included in the accompanying financial statements,
for the potential outcome of such claims or the amount of potential damages in the event of an unfavorable
outcome for each of the above contingencies. The Authority’s management believes that any differences in
reserved amounts and final settlement, after consideration of claims covered by insurance, resulting from
such litigation will not materially impact the Authority’s financial position or results of operations.
The Authority holds various commercial insurance policies to cover other potential loss exposures.

12. SPECIAL ITEM
On April 3, 2018, the Board of Directors for the Great Lakes Water Authority approved a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Term Sheet. On April 4, 2018, the Board of Water Commissioners for the DWSD
approved the same Term Sheet. The Term Sheet was not intended to impose any legal obligation on the
parties. A final MOU that will make the provisions of the Term Sheet binding on GLWA and DWSD is expected
to be completed and approved by both Boards by July 1, 2018. The Leases and the Water and Sewer Services
Agreement (“WSSA”) between the City and GLWA and the MBO, govern the relationship between DWSD and
GLWA, which began on January 1, 2016 (the “Effective Date”). The intent of the MOU is to (a) provide
clarification of specific sections of the Leases, WSSA and MBO; (b) make adjustments contemplated by the
Leases and the WSSA; and (c) address the liquidation of specific liabilities. The transactions associated with
this MOU Term Sheet resulted in a special item on the statement of activities for the year ended June 30,
2017, comprised of the following:

Water

Sewage Disposal

Consideration for assumption of pre-bifurcation liabilities
Reduction of claims and judgements for pre-bifurcation retail cases
Sewer lookback adjustment

13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Partnership between the Great Lakes Water Authority, City of Flint, Karegnondi Water Authority,
Genesee County Drain Commission and State of Michigan
Effective December 1, 2017, the Authority, the City of Flint (the City), Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA),
Genesee County Drain Commission (GCDC) and State of Michigan entered into a long-term partnership
agreement to satisfy a number of critical water service needs across the region. Key provisions of a master
agreement comprised of seven separate exhibits includes: 1) a 30-year water service contract with the City
that establishes GLWA as the long-term water source for the City and credits the City of its debt service
payment obligations on existing KWA bonds for the building of its water plant; 2) a long-term lease to GLWA
of the 72-inch line serving the City; and 3) a 30-year contract for reciprocal, emergency water services
between GLWA and GCDC.

[1] Reflects fiscal period in which actual payments are due.
[2] For bonds issued through the Michigan Finance Authority (MFA) in 2014 and 2015, the Authority is required to
make payment on these obligations to the MFA depository accounts five business days prior to the due date of
the bond principal and interest payments. Therefore, the payments for the principal and interest due on July
1, 2017, are not included in the debt service requirement amounts above as they were paid June 26, 2017.

those customers reflect, in part, estimated retail water sales during this period. GLWA is modifying this approach, which will
result in larger reported water sales figures in future years.

result in lower values in future years.

The Authority has pledged specific revenue streams to secure the repayment of the revenue bonds and State of Michigan revolving fund
loans. The bonds and loans are paid solely from the net revenues of the Water System and Sewer System including the Retail Revenues from
the Retail Customers who are serviced under the Water and Sewer Services Agreement with the City of Detroit. The pledged revenues for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 were reported by two entities due to the lease agreement between the City of Detroit and Great Lakes
Water Authority which became effective on January 1, 2016. The pledge revenue definition in the Great Lakes Water Authority Master Bond
Ordinance includes the retail revenues of the City of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department as this revenue is pledged for payment of the
bonded debt owed by Great Lakes Water Authority. A summary of the pledged revenue and the applicable debt as of June 30, 2017 is as

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS
REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE
May 10, 2018
To the Board of Directors of the
Great Lakes Water Authority
Detroit, Michigan
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and each major fund of the
Great Lakes Water Authority (the "Authority") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial
statements. We issued our report thereon dated May 10, 2018, which contained unmodified opinions on
those financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the
financial statements that collectively comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying
schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required
by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and is not a required part
of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare
the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects,
in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Notes to Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (the “Schedule”) includes the federal
grant activity of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the “Authority”) under programs of the federal
government for the year ended June 30, 2017. The information in this schedule is presented in
accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform
Guidance). Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of the Authority, it is
not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net position or cash flows of the
Authority.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Expenditures reported on the Schedule are reported on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is
described as follows:
· Basis of accounting. In general, expenditures are reported in the Schedule when the Authority remits
payment to a vendor or contractor, rather than when an expense is incurred by the Authority in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Additionally, any amounts paid to
subrecipients are included when paid or transferred instead of when incurred. The Authority reports
its expenditures using this method based on guidance it received from the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ), which serves as the pass-through entity for all of the Authority's
federally funded loan programs.
· Pre-award costs. In addition to the above, the MDEQ may approve reimbursement of costs related to
projects undertaken (and paid to vendors) in prior periods. In those cases, as the payments were not
previously reported as federal expenditures, they are reported on the Schedule in the period
reimbursement is approved by the MDEQ which is normally with the initial project cash draw.
The above referenced expenditures are recognized following the cost principles contained in the Uniform
Guidance, wherein certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement.
Negative amounts shown on the Schedule, if any, represent adjustments or credits made in the normal
course of business to amounts reported as expenditures in prior years. Pass-through entity identifying
numbers are presented where available.
For purposes of charging indirect costs to federal awards, the Authority has elected not to use the 10
percent de minimis cost rate as permitted by §200.414 of the Uniform Guidance.

May 10, 2018
To the Board of Directors of the
Great Lakes Water Authority
Detroit, Michigan
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the business-type
activities and each major fund of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the "Authority"), as of and for the
year ended June 30, 2017, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively
comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated May 10,
2018.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Authority’s
internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s
internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s
internal control.
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention
by those charged with governance.
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies and, therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies
may exist that have not been identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify
any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. We did identify a
certain deficiency in internal control over financial reporting, described in the accompanying schedule
of findings and questioned costs as item 2017-001, that we consider to be a significant deficiency.

 Compliance and Other Matters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Authority’s financial statements are free
from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and
material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on
compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that
are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.
Great Lakes Water Authority's Response to Finding
The Authority’s response to the finding identified in our audit is described in the accompanying
schedule of findings and questioned costs. The Authority’s response was not subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on
it.
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Authority’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR THE MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE
May 10, 2018
To the Board of Directors of the
Great Lakes Water Authority
Detroit, Michigan
Report on Compliance for the Major Federal Program
We have audited the compliance of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the "Authority") with the types
of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and
material effect on the Authority’s major federal program for the year ended June 30, 2017. The
Authority’s major federal program is identified in the summary of auditors’ results section of the
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.
Management’s Responsibility
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal program.
Independent Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for the Authority’s major federal program
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit
of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code
of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct
and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence about the Authority’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for the major
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Authority’s
compliance.

 Opinion on the Major Federal Program
In our opinion, the Authority complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal
program for the year ended June 30, 2017.
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance
Management of the Authority is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control
over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and
performing our audit of compliance, we considered the Authority’s internal control over compliance
with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on the major federal
program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for the major federal program and to test and report
on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control over compliance.
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important
enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However,
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.
Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of
the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs

For the Year Ended June 30, 2017

SECTION II – FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGS
2017-001 - Timely Year-end Closing and Completion (repeat comment)
Finding Type. Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Criteria. The timely preparation and issuance of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires a coordinated effort between management and the external auditors, and places
the burden on management to properly prepare for the audit, including timely closing of the accounting
records, preparation of workpapers to support the significant account balances and obtaining the necessary
documents needed by the auditors to perform their work.
Condition. While there has been improvement from the initial audit in 2016, several areas were not ready to be
audited when fieldwork began. Fieldwork started in mid-October 2017, and at that time, bank reconciliations
were still being completed and adjustments were being posted to the general ledger. Additionally, capital
assets and a reasonably adjusted trial balance was not provided until early January 2018.
Cause. The complex nature of the bifurcation of the balance sheet and separation from the City of Detroit in
the prior year caused delays when preparing for this year's audit due to the short timeframe between audits.
Effect. As a result of this condition, the Authority was exposed to the risk that misstatements (whether caused
by error or fraud) could exist and not be detected and corrected by not reconciling in a timely manner.
Recommendation. We recommend that going forward, the Authority develop a plan and strictly adhere to
agreed-upon timelines to ensure timely completion of the audit and issuance of the CAFR.
View of Responsible Officials. We have reviewed the findings and concur with the recommendations. This
timing was unique to the standup of GLWA for FY 2016 due to the delay in the financial close of the initial year,
implementation of new or previously non-existing systems, and recruitment of staff vacancies due to the
bifurcation.

Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings

For the Year Ended June 30, 2017

2016-001 – Timely Year-end Closing
Due to the complex nature of the bifurcation of the balance sheet, and separation from the City of Detroit,
there were delays in completion of the bank reconciliations and adjusting various accounts to the final
balances. Fieldwork started in April 2017, and at that time, bank reconciliations were still being completed
and adjustments were being posted to the general ledger. Additionally, a reasonably adjusted trial balance
was not provided until June 2017.
This finding was not adequately resolved. See finding 2017-001 in the current year Schedule of Findings and
Questioned Costs.
2016-002 - Segregation of Duties
The Authority had two individuals who were able to set up vendors, enter an invoice for payment and approve
the invoice for payment.
This finding was adequately resolved.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE
May 10, 2018
To the Board of Directors
Great Lakes Water Authority
Detroit, Michigan
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and each major fund of the
Great Lakes Water Authority (the “Authority”) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and have
issued our report thereon dated May 10, 2018. Professional standards require that we advise you of the
following matters relating to our audit.
Our Responsibility in Relation to the Financial Statement Audit
As communicated in our engagement letter dated August 17, 2017, our responsibility, as described by
professional standards, is to form and express opinions about whether the financial statements that
have been prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit
of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your respective responsibilities.
Our responsibility, as prescribed by professional standards, is to plan and perform our audit to obtain
reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, as part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the
Authority solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance
concerning such internal control.
We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are, in our
professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.
However, we are not required to design procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to
communicate to you.
We have provided our findings regarding internal control over financial reporting and compliance noted
during our audit in a separate letter to you dated May 10, 2018. In addition, we noted certain other
matters which are included in Attachment A to this letter.
Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit
We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timing previously communicated to you in
our engagement letter and in our meeting about planning matters on October 16, 2017.
Compliance with All Ethics Requirements Regarding Independence
The engagement team, others in our firm, as appropriate, and our firm has complied with all relevant
ethical requirements regarding independence.

Qualitative Aspects of the Authority’s Significant Accounting Practices
Significant Accounting Policies
Management has the responsibility to select and use appropriate accounting policies. A summary of the
significant accounting policies adopted by the Authority is included in Note 1 to the financial
statements.
There have been no initial selections of accounting policies and no changes in significant accounting
policies or their application during the year.
No matters have come to our attention that would require us, under professional standards, to inform
you about (1) the methods used to account for significant unusual transactions and (2) the effect of
significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is a lack of
authoritative guidance or consensus.
Significant Accounting Estimates
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are
based on management’s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and
experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting
estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and
because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management’s
current judgments.
The most sensitive accounting estimates affecting the financial statements were:


Management’s estimate of the useful lives of depreciable capital assets is based on the
length of time it is believed that those assets will provide some economic benefit in the
future.



Acquisition value of the assets and liabilities acquired by lease agreement from the City of
Detroit at the inception of the Authority's fiscal operations, which has a lasting impact.



Allocation of the debt service responsibilities between the Authority and the City of
Detroit.



Shared services between the Authority and the City of Detroit are not yet finalized and
amounts recorded are subject to negotiation.



Management’s estimate of the accrued compensated absences is based on current hourly
rates and policies regarding payment of sick and vacation banks.



Management’s estimate of the allowance for uncollectible receivable balances is based on
past experience and future expectation for collection of various account balances.



Management’s estimate of the insurance claims incurred but not reported is based on
information provided by the entity’s third party administrators and subsequent claims
activity.

Page 143

 Page 3
We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop these estimates and determined that
they are reasonable in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole and in relation to the
applicable opinion units. In addition, the financial statements include a net pension liability and other
pension-related amounts, which are dependent on estimates made by the City of Detroit General
Employees’ Retirement System. These estimates are based on historical trends and industry standards,
but are not within the control of management.
Financial Statement Disclosures
Certain financial statement disclosures involve significant judgment and are particularly sensitive
because of their significance to financial statement users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the
financial statements relate to the acquisition value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when the
Authority was created. Independent experts provided estimates regarding the acquisition value of
capital assets, useful lives of those assets and the related debt. See Note 8 for discussion of the lease
from the City of Detroit that is the basis for the acquisition transaction; see Note 12 for special item
regarding the memorandum of understanding with DWSD.
Significant Difficulties Encountered During the Audit
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management relating to the performance of
the audit.
Uncorrected and Corrected Misstatements
For purposes of this communication, professional standards require us to accumulate all known and
likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that we believe are trivial, and
communicate them to the appropriate level of management. Further, professional standards require us
to also communicate the effect of uncorrected misstatements related to prior periods on the relevant
classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures, and the financial statements as a whole and
each applicable opinion unit. In addition, professional standards require us to communicate to you all
material, corrected misstatements that were brought to the attention of management as a result of
our audit procedures. None of the misstatements detected as a result of audit procedures and
corrected by management were material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the financial
statements taken as a whole.
The schedule of adjustments passed is included with management’s written representations in
Attachment C to this letter, and summarizes uncorrected financial statement misstatements whose
effects in the current and prior periods, as determined by management, are immaterial, both
individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole and each applicable
opinion unit.
Disagreements with Management
For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a
matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, concerning a financial accounting, reporting, or
auditing matter, which could be significant to the Authority’s financial statements or the auditors’
report. No such disagreements arose during the course of the audit.
Representations Requested from Management
We have requested certain written representations from management, which are included in
Attachment C to this letter.

Page 144

 Page 4
Management’s Consultations with Other Accountants
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and
accounting matters. Management informed us that, and to our knowledge, there were no consultations
with other accountants regarding auditing and accounting matters.
Other Significant Matters, Findings, or Issues
In the normal course of our professional association with the Authority, we generally discuss a variety
of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, operating and
regulatory conditions affecting the entity, and operational plans and strategies that may affect the
risks of material misstatement. None of the matters discussed resulted in a condition to our retention
as the Authority’s auditors.
Other Information in Documents Containing Audited Financial Statements
Our responsibility for the supplementary information accompanying the financial statements, as
described by professional standards, is to evaluate the presentation of the supplementary information
in relation to the financial statements as a whole and to report on whether the supplementary
information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.
We made certain inquiries of management and evaluated the form, content, and methods of preparing
the information to determine that the information complies with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior
period, and the information is appropriate and complete in relation to our audit of the financial
statements. We compared and reconciled the supplementary information to the underlying accounting
records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves.
Upcoming Changes in Accounting Standards
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are continually changing in order to promote the
usability and enhance the applicability of information included in external financial reporting. While it
would not be practical to include an in-depth discussion of every upcoming change in professional
standards, Attachment B to this letter contains a brief overview of recent pronouncements of the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and their related effective dates. Management is
responsible for reviewing these standards, determining their applicability, and implementing them in
future accounting periods.
This information is intended solely for the use of the governing body and management of the Great
Lakes Water Authority and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these
specified parties.
Very truly yours,

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Attachment A - Comments and Recommendations
For the June 30, 2017 Audit
During our audit, we became aware of certain other matters that are opportunities for strengthening
internal control and/or improving operating efficiency. This memorandum summarizes our comments and
recommendations regarding those matters. Our consideration of the Authority's internal control over
financial reporting is described in our report, dated May 10, 2018, issued in accordance with Government
Auditing Standards. This memorandum does not affect that report or our report dated May 10, 2018, on the
financial statements of the Great Lakes Water Authority.
Information Technology (IT) Matters
Processes and policies related to information technology were reviewed, and through related procedures,
instances were identified that represent opportunities for management to improve upon the Authority's
internal control structure. We noted that prior year comments from the SAS 114 communication dated
July 31, 2017 were not addressed. We recommend the Authority consider these comments and make any
necessary changes based on that consideration. The following issues from the prior year were not
addressed:


Back-up Processes Review - Back-ups to the Storage Area Network (SAN) are currently retained on-site.
We recommend utilization of an off-site storage solution for backups to ensure quick recovery of
critical data.



Vendor Risk Assessment and Oversight - The risk assessment process and monitoring of vendor
performance is not formalized. Management should ensure that all vendor relationships are formally
reviewed on a periodic basis depending on the risk they pose to the Authority. Management should
ensure that a risk assessment is performed on all IT vendors that identifies and ranks the vendors based
on overall risk as it relates to critical need to operations and access to internal information.



Procedures over Network Access Rights - The Authority performs quarterly reviews for privileged
access, but does not perform a periodic review of all system users. Such a review should confirm
whether the rights to all user accounts are still appropriate, given shifting responsibilities.



Password Policies - The Authority has software level password controls in place to secure BS&A,
Domain, WAM, and Ceridian applications/systems; however, the password settings for each system vary
and do not align with recommended best practice settings. We recommend that management
implement best practice password settings to each system’s capability including:
Minimum Length: 8 characters
Maximum Age: 45-90 days
Password History: 12-24 previous passwords
Complexity: Required special character or upper/lowercase
Invalid Lockout: 3 invalid attempts

Attachment A - Comments and Recommendations
For the June 30, 2017 Audit
Salary Documentation
We noted one instance in which an employee's salary documentation was not available and another in which
the pay rate did not agree to the approved pay rate in the employee's personnel records. Pay rates should
be properly documented.
Interim Financial Reporting
Due to a variety of reasons, including start-up complexities following bifurcation, software issues and
personnel challenges, Authority management has been unable to provide its board with timely and accurate
interim financial information. As such information is integral to timely and meaningful decision making,
management needs to implement measures to fulfill this obligation.

Attachment B – Upcoming Changes in Accounting Standards / Regulations

For the June 30, 2017 Audit

The following pronouncements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) have been released
recently and may be applicable to the Authority in the near future. We encourage management to review
the following information and determine which standard(s) may be applicable to the Authority. For the
complete text of these and other GASB standards, visit www.gasb.org and click on the “Standards &
Guidance” tab. If you have questions regarding the applicability, timing, or implementation approach for
any of these standards, please contact your audit team.
GASB 75  Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions
Effective 06/15/2018 (your FY 2018)
 
This standard builds on the requirements of GASB 74 by requiring employers that provide other
postemployment benefits (OPEB) to recognize a net OPEB liability on their statements of net position. It
mirrors the new accounting and financial reporting requirements of GASB 68 for pension benefits. We do
not expect this standard to have any significant effect on the Authority.
GASB 81  Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements
Effective 12/15/2017 (your FY 2018)
This standard addresses the accounting for split-interest agreements for which the government serves as
the intermediary and/or the beneficiary. It requires governments to record assets, liabilities, and deferred
inflows of resources at the inception of the agreement when serving as intermediary, or when the
government controls the present service capacity of a beneficial interest. We do not expect this standard
to have any significant effect on the Authority.
GASB 83  Certain Asset Retirement Obligations
Effective 06/15/2019 (your FY 2019)
This standard addresses accounting and financial reporting for certain asset retirement obligations--legally
enforceable liabilities associated with the retirement of a tangible capital asset. We do not expect this
standard to have any significant effect on the Authority.
GASB 84  Fiduciary Activities
Effective 12/15/2019 (your FY 2020)
This standard establishes new criteria for determining how to report fiduciary activities in governmental
financial statements. The focus is on whether the government is controlling the assets, and who the
beneficiaries are. Under this revised standard, certain activities previously reported in agency funds may be
reclassified in future periods. Due to the number of specific factors to consider, we will continue to assess
the degree to which this standard may impact the Authority.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
Attachment B – Upcoming Changes in Accounting Standards / Regulations

For the June 30, 2017 Audit

GASB 85  Omnibus 2017
Effective 06/15/2018 (your FY 2018)
This standard includes a variety of small technical revisions to previously issued GASB statements. We do
not expect this standard to have any significant effect on the Authority.
GASB 86  Certain Debt Extinguishment Issues
Effective 06/15/2018 (your FY 2018)
This standard provides guidance for reporting the in-substance defeasance of outstanding debt obligations
using existing resources. Qualifying transactions will remove both the assets placed into trust and the
related debt obligation from the government's statement of net position. We do not expect this standard to
have any significant effect on the Authority.
GASB 87  Leases
Effective 12/15/2020 (your FY 2021)
This standard establishes a single model for reporting all leases (including those previously classified as
operating and capital). Lessees will now report offsetting intangible lease assets and lease liabilities equal
to the present value of future lease payments. Lessors will report offsetting lease receivables and deferred
inflows of resources.
GASB 88  Certain Disclosures Related to Debt
Effective 06/15/2019 (your FY 2019)
This standard provides guidance on note disclosures related to debt, including direct borrowings and direct
placements. It also clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information
related to debt. We do not expect this standard to have any significant effect on the Authority.

This representation letter is provided in connection with your audit of the financial statements of the
business-type activities and each major fund of the Great Lakes Water Authority (the “Authority”), as
of and for the year ended June 30, 2017, and the related notes to the financial statements, for the
purpose of expressing opinions on whether the basic financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Authority in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted for governments in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material. Items
are considered material, regardless of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting
information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes it probable that the judgment of a
reasonable person relying on the information would be changed or influenced by the omission or
misstatement.
We confirm that, having made such inquiries as we considered necessary for the purpose of appropriately
informing ourselves as of May 10, 2018:
Financial Statements
1. We have fulfilled our responsibilities, as set out in the terms of the audit engagement letter dated
August 17, 2017, for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements of the various
opinion units referred to above in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have reviewed, approved, and
taken responsibility for the financial statements and related notes.
2. We have reviewed and approved the various adjusting journal entries that were proposed by you for
recording in our books and records and reflected in the financial statements.
3. We acknowledge our responsibility for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
4. We acknowledge our responsibility for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal
control to prevent and detect fraud.
5. Significant assumptions used by us in making accounting estimates, including those measured at fair
value, are reasonable.
6. Related party relationships and transactions have been appropriately accounted for and disclosed in
accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP. For the purposes of this letter, related parties
mean members of the governing body; board members; administrative officials; immediate families
of administrative officials, board members, and members of the governing body; and any companies
affiliated with or owned by such individuals.

Responses to Director Daddow questions/comments

First, let me apologize for being physically unable to attend your Board meeting to address the matters below, in
person. As I mentioned to Nicolette on the phone yesterday, I had that “murphy’s law” feeling when I registered for the
GFOA Conference in St. Louis back in January that the GLWA report issuance will probably come to a head while I’m
away, and sure enough it did. Chalk up another instance for the “law of attraction.”
See my responses to the questions/issues posed by Director Daddow below.

Director Daddow: In addition, the following are comments on the auditor’s letter that will be discussed at the table.

Director Daddow: Auditor’s SAS 114 letter: Fourth paragraph, page 1 – giving rise to the auditor’s responsibility to cite
‘significant matters related to the audit’ involving ‘responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.’ I find
this assertion interesting in light of the failure to provide any discussion of the Michigan Warehouse and United House
of Prayer matters. I am going to be asking Kettner several questions on this matter involving his scope of work and how
it was expanded and why there is no mention of this matter in the SAS 114 report.
The first sentence states – “We are also responsible for communicating significant matters related to the audit that are,
in our opinion professional judgment, relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.”
Response: After concerns relative to the Michigan Warehouse and similar legal matters was communicated by Director
Daddow several months ago, we considered expanding the scope of our work through additional/expanded inquiries
with Authority management (including legal staff) and DWSD legal staff. That work was suspended when the MOU
negotiations commenced and then ceased when the Terms Sheet was made available (and the respective governing
bodies accepted those Terms) as it seemed that this matter was resolved. Now, we could still write a finding if the
Board and/or management felt strongly about it, which would cite the need for management to inform the Board of all
such matters, but we believe there was a compelling argument regarding this lack of communication (given the very
unique situation that the chief executive of the party to a potential legal action sits on the Authority Board and would
therefore potentially receive confidential information regarding legal strategy that could be unfavorable to the
Authority).
We are satisfied from our audit procedures, both this year and last, that the accruals for these items were appropriate
given the understanding and interpretation of the Lease(s) at that time and there was no indication that material
information was being withheld from us to suggest that additional accruals may be warranted. When this matter was
removed because of the MOU (both the specific accruals and the any future such cases/claims), it was removed from
our consideration.

We certainly encourage full and complete communication between management and the Board, and the Board has the
responsibility to determine when items should be limited for legal reasons. Our understanding was that a policy related
to this was considered (but not adopted) by the Board and this certainly played into our conclusion as to whether this
matter merited separate communication.

Director Daddow: Page 2 third paragraph – ‘significant unusual transactions’ – none of the MOU items were considered
to be significant or unusual?
1

Page 158

 Response: As this item is to inform you, the Board, about significant unusual transactions, we felt there was no need to
mention the MOU Term Sheet since you were already aware of it and, in fact, had taken specific action on it. In other
words, we were not compelled to tell you what you already know. Other users of the financial statements are informed
of the MOU items through the financial statement note disclosures on the Special Item.

Director Daddow: Shared services – is Rehmann satisfied that the accruals – both to and from DWSD-R – are properly
recorded even as certain services remain open going back into the six months ended June 30, 2016?
Response: We have performed audit procedures, both this year and last, on the shared services and are satisfied that
the amounts recorded are adequately supported. We are aware of the potential for further negotiations that may affect
these accruals, but such amounts are not reasonably determinable, would most likely be “gain” items to the Authority
rather than “loss” items, and there is not compelling evidence to indicate that a net loss (if and when further
negotiations actually occur) that the amount would be material to the Authority’s financial statements. For these
reasons, where were not compelled to require note disclosure in the financial statements or an emphasis of a matter
paragraph in our report. If the Authority would like to add a note regarding this, we would not disagree with it.

Director Daddow: Page 3 – uncorrected / corrected misstatements – while not directly on point and more of an
estimate than a misstatement, here might be a decent area where the $10.9 million in receivables previously identified
and in the MOU should be considered. What was recorded as a receivable from DWSD-R on this matter as a starting
point in the resolution of this issue? And, what actions to secure engineering services have transpired given that there is
a finite time frame identified in the MOU approved a few weeks ago.
Response: This question relates to Item # 14 from the MOU Term Sheet. It is our understanding from the GLWA
management that the “MOU Term Sheet” is now being finalized as an “MOU”. The timeline for resolution of that matter
is outlined in the MOU Term Sheet (excerpt below) and is based upon execution of the MOU. Given the nature of the
additional engineering review, analysis, and collaboration among the parties to resolve, the management team has been
conservatively not recorded a receivable as the outcome is dependent on resolution on future actions
.

Director Daddow: Page 3 – representations requested from management. Cited as being attached; it wasn’t.
Response: We had previously provided a draft of the management representation letter in a Word file. That letter is
now included in the latest draft of the SAS 114 report package.

Director Daddow: Page A1 – should the findings identified in the Information Technology bullet be restated given that
no actions have been taken to rectify them from the prior SAS 114 letter. It is hard to understand the issues in reading
this document if one does not have access to the prior SAS 114 letter.
Response: Good catch (as are all the other items here); we will modify this finding to put the level of detail from last
year into this year’s finding.
Director Daddow: Single Audit Act letter – A little surprised at the single issue of the timely year end closing with no
reference to interim financial information needed by the Board to perform their functions (see paragraph 4 of the SAS
114 letter). Not quite sure how the lack of timely, accurate and relevant financial information not submitted to the
board cannot be considered a ‘significant matter’ involving ‘the financial reporting process.
Response: It should be noted that we have observed publicly available financial information on a regular basis via the
Audit Committee binders in lieu of interim financial statements. We will be adding a finding to the management letter
(on page A1 as referenced in the prior bullet point). The finding in the single audit report is compliance-oriented and
therefore shown there. The text of that finding is shown below:
2

Page 159

 Interim Financial Reporting
Due to a variety of reasons, including start-up complexities following bifurcation, software issues and
personnel challenges, Authority management has been unable to provide its board with timely and
accurate interim financial information. As such information is integral to timely and meaningful decision
making, management needs to implement measures to fulfill this obligation.
We look forward to presentation of the final reports at the next Audit Committee meeting.

 AGENDA ITEM #6B

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Re:

Financial Sustainability Model – Forecast Modeling

Background: Last month, initial discussion began at the Audit Committee related to longterm financial planning and parameters to establish a Financial Sustainability model that
encompasses the following.

1. Risk Management: Ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity to seek opportunities as
well as address unforeseen and/or uncontrollable events.
2. Affordability: Appropriate level of fixed long-term commitments, controlled
variable annual costs, and balancing the two to achieve intergenerational equity.

3. Stability: Anticipating annual budget variances and ensuring that charges are stable
and predictable (i.e. prevents “rate shock”).

Analysis: Translating these objectives into measurable planning parameters is based on the
next step which is modeling various scenarios (referred to as the Revenue Requirement
Policy matrix in last month’s material and attached). The Foster Group has developed a
long-term forecasting model that can be used to test the proposed policy matrix under
various scenarios. Accordingly, see the attached memo and side-by-side forecasting
scenarios. Mr. Foster will be in attendance at the Audit Committee to demonstrate the impact
of a varying assumptions as well as discuss additional policy considerations.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

MEMORANDUM
GLWA Financial Forecast Model
To:

May 17, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
At your request, we have prepared modeling analyses to support evaluation of potential
GLWA financial policies. Our analyses calculate forecasted financial metrics that align with
those used by investment community analysts when evaluating the credit worthiness of utility
enterprises, including the GLWA Water and Sewer Systems. This material is intended to
establish financial benchmarks against which to measure future financial performance of the
Systems.
The accompanying exhibits provide summary information regarding our preliminary
analyses to establish long-term financial forecast results. We have established a “forecast
period” that extends through FY 2030. This longer term period facilitates complete review of
potential impacts of policy decisions on financial metrics. However, we note that forecasting
beyond five years requires development of assumptions that do not represent currently
published plans, particularly with respect to capital improvement program (“CIP”) needs, as
the current published CIPs only extend five years.
For purposes of our analyses, we have estimated annual CIP financing requirements beyond
FY 2023 at levels indicated by averages of the current five-year plans. This assumption is
just one of a myriad that impact the forecast presented herein, all of which could have
material impacts on the results if they were modified. We have identified what we consider
to be “key assumptions” that define the general scenarios introduced in this presentation.
The intent of this document is not to advocate for any specific policy, nor any specific
combination of assumptions, but rather to provide perspective for policy discussions amongst
stakeholders. Towards that goal, we are presenting two scenarios in this document for
purposes of illustration.
•

Scenario 1 reflects the “baseline” financial plan submitted as part of the FY 2019
budget request, which included annual BUDGET increases of a 2% for FY 2019 and
4% thereafter. We have assumed annual increases in the operating expense budget of
2% for this scenario.
Page 163

 GLWA Financial Forecast Model

•

May 17, 2018
Page 2

Scenario 2 assumes no BUDGET increase for FY 2019 and 3% thereafter. Scenario 2
assumes lower annual increases annual increases (1%) in the operating expense
budget.

All other assumptions are identical for the two scenarios being introduced in this document.
As noted above, this topic lends itself to most effective communication through a verbal
presentation, and we are prepared to provide such presentation at the GLWA Audit
Committee meeting on May 22. Herewith a brief introduction to the various exhibits.
The exhibits for each Scenario contain a key assumption page, and 5 pages of individual
forecast results, arranged to illustrate categories of metrics. There are separate metric exhibits
for the Water System and the Sewer System.
As noted in the introduction, we have attempted to incorporate specific financial metrics
used by ratings agency analysts (and others) often compute independently to compare
GLWA with peer utilities. The unique nature of the GLWA / DWSD relationship requires
analysts to modify their traditional calculation approaches in order to accurately interpret
GLWA audited financial statements, and to accurately reflect GLWA metrics when
comparing with peer utilities. The necessary adjustments are a topic that the GLWA
finance team has preliminary communicated with rating agency analysts, and will
continue to do so as review continues. Where appropriate, we briefly introduced such
modifications in this document.
•

Introductory Page: Identifies key assumptions and outlines basis for capital
financing strategies. Of particular note:
o Perhaps the key assumption is the forecasted change in overall BUDGET for
the Regional System(s), as noted in the Scenario introduction above.
o We have assumed an ongoing annual pension reimbursement requirement of
$9 million (combined for the Regional and Local Systems) starting in FY
2023. The current annual requirement is $45 million.
o We have reflected potential minimum balances for the I&E and Construction
Funds. These assumptions are intended to support policy discussions, and
illustrate:
o The capital financing strategies that are noted on the assumption page.
o Note that a key assumption in this forecast is that DWSD has indicated a
short term policy approach of financing all “post bifurcation” debt service
via use of the annual Lease Payment, and therefore reducing revenues
available to the consolidated Water and Sewer Systems by a like amount.
Each of the scenarios presented in this document assume that such an
approach remains intact for the duration of the forecast period.

Page 1: Capital Financing Forecast Summary: Illustrates comparative forecasted
funding sources for the Regional System CIP. The overall financial strategy
envisions less reliance on debt financing, with more of the CIP being financed with
revenue generated funds.
o The chart on the top of the page compares annual forecasted funding sources
for the CIP.
o The chart on the bottom of the page indicates a “rolling 5-year forecast” of
the portion of the CIP that is financed via debt, and compares it with the
Fitch “AA Median” metric.

•

Page 2: Forecasted Annual Revenue Requirement Summary: Illustrates the
forecasted elements of the annual Regional System revenue requirement. The overall
financial strategy envisions lessening the portion of the annual revenue dollar that is
dedicated to debt service, and increasing the portion that is available to transfer to the
I&E Fund(s) to cash finance the CIP.
o The chart on the top of the page shows the change in annual BUDGET. The
black line reflects the total annual BUDGET increase, and the bars reflect
the components. The reduction in the Master Bond Ordinance requirements
in FY 2024 reflects the assumed reduction in legacy pension obligation
requirements. All else being equal, the impact of this change would allow for
a larger deposit to the I&E Fund, as illustrated in the chart(s).
o The chart on the bottom of the page indicates the relative forecasted share
each element comprises of the overall annual BUDGET.

•

Page 3: Forecasted Debt Service Coverage: Illustrates calculations of this metric,
which is seen as perhaps the most critical indicator of financial performance by the
investment community. The overall financial strategy envisions increasing debt
service coverage ratios.
o The chart on the top of the page reflects calculated “rate covenant” debt
service coverage ratios by the various liens of debt.
§ Senior Lien (rate covenant minimum is 1.20);
§ 2nd Lien (rate covenant minimum is 1.10);
§ SRF Junior Lien (rate covenant minimum is 1.00). The SRF Junior
Lien debt service coverage is often referred to as the “all in” or “total”
coverage ratio.
o The top chart also reflects calculated “income statement proxy” coverage
ratios – a metric that ratings agency analysts (and others) often compute
independently. The only difference between this metric and the “all in”

coverage is that it generally does not include investment income as revenue,
whereas the rate covenant allows inclusion of investment income. However:
The initially calculated “income statement proxy” coverage (solid green line)
is misleading due to the unique nature of the GLWA / DWSD relationship,
and requires and adjustment. This is because the GLWA financial statement
of “Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position” (from which net
revenues available to pay debt service are derived by analysts) only includes
the net revenues from the regional system, while reported annual debt service
payments include both the Regional System and Local System portions.
Our “Adjusted Income Statement Proxy” coverage ratios (dotted green line)
reflect our suggested modification to accurately reflect true GLWA “all in”
debt service coverage.
The black line reflects the target metric for AA rated utilities based on an
interpretation of Fitch and Moody’s guidance. This metric is intended to
apply to the “all in” coverage ratios (equivalent to the SRF Jr. Lien).
The chart on the bottom of the page illustrates the elements that provide the
“coverage” over and above debt service. In essence, these are annual
revenue requirements that are subordinate to operating expense and debt
service in the Master Bond Ordinance Flow of Funds. The bars in the chart
indicate the amount
The Regional System components are illustrated in green and represent the
“coverage” that each element comprises of the forecasted Regional System
debt service share.
The Local System components are illustrated in red and represent the
“coverage” that each element comprises of the forecasted Local System debt
service share.
The assumed DWSD policy approach of utilizing a portion of the annual
Lease Payment for debt service essentially produces “negative”
contributions to Local System (and overall consolidated) debt service
coverage.
The black line illustrates total “all in” coverage providers for the
consolidated system, and aligns with the ratios in the top table. This metric
represents a weighted average of Regional and Local elements.

Page 4: Additional Forecasted Rating Agency Metrics: Illustrates calculations of
other comparative metrics. The overall financial strategy envisions meeting or
exceeding peer performance metrics to improve credit ratings.
o The first chart illustrates forecasted “Operating Margin.” Operating Margin
is defined as operating revenues minus operating expenses (including
Page 166

 GLWA Financial Forecast Model

May 17, 2018
Page 5

depreciation expense). The metric in the chart represents Operating Margin
divided by operating revenues.
o The second chart illustrates forecasted “Free Cash as a % of Depreciation”.
This metric deducts annual debt service from Operating Margin, adds in
annual depreciation expense, and then divides the result by annual
depreciation expense.
§ This metric requires an adjustment to accurately reflect GLWA
financial results. We have computed the “adjusted” metric by only
reflecting the debt service allocable to the Regional System in the
calculation.
o The final chart illustrates forecasted “Debt to Operating Revenues”. This
metric represents total long term debt divided by operating revenues.
§ This metric requires an adjustment to accurately reflect GLWA
financial results. We have computed the “adjusted” metric by only
reflecting the long term debt allocable to the Regional System in the
calculation.
•

Page 5: Forecasted Balance Sheet Metrics: Illustrates depictions of key relative
GLWA assets and liabilities since inception, and forecasted.
o The chart on the top of the page presents the Net Position, and the cash and
investment balances in the “revenue generated” funds established by the
Master Bond Ordinance. (excludes Construction Fund and
annual
forecasted funding sources for the CIP.
o The chart on the bottom of the page compares the GLWA net capital assets
(including the amounts owed by DWSD for Local System assets) and long
term debt. The ratio of the two metrics is reflected by the dotted line. The
overall financial strategy envisions reducing this metric to less than 100%, so
that the balance sheet depiction of net capital assets exceeds related debt.
o We note that the asset valuation that established the GLWA “starting net
position” with respect to capital assets, and established ongoing depreciation
schedules, has a significant impact on short term depictions of these metrics.
The depreciation schedules are undergoing diligent review, and assumptions
of projected future depreciation expense may change in subsequent forecasts.

We trust that this information provides an effective introduction to this topic, and we look
forward to presenting it to stakeholders in more detail.

AGENDA ITEM #6C

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Proposed Public Hearing: State Revolving Fund Project Plan Submittal for the Pump
Station No. 1 (PS-1) Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite Removal
Project

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) has identified one wastewater
system project in the proposed FY 2019 to FY 2023 Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) for
submittal to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for the State
Revolving Fund (SRF) financing program for funding in the state’s 2019 fiscal year. The
deadline for submitting all SRF project plans to MDEQ is July 1, 2018, but prior to
submitting the project plans, GLWA must hold a public hearing to present the project plan.

The FY 2019 SRF Project Plan and public hearing notice for the Pump Station No. 1 (PS-1)
Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite Removal Project have been posted on
the GLWA website and can be found at: http://www.glwater.org/category/news/hearingnotices. This project plan will be presented at the public hearing. After the public hearing
is closed, the included draft resolution will be scheduled for action by the GLWA Board of
Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting also on June 13, 2018. The resolution must be
approved and signed to ensure that the finalized Project Plan is assembled, printed, and
submitted to the MDEQ by the deadline of July 1, 2018.

The Project: Pump Station No. 1 (PS-1) Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite
Removal Project – (CIP# 211008): The primary purpose of the project is to provide
efficient and reliable operations at the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) by
implementing necessary improvements to the Pump Station No. 1 Ferric Chloride System
and Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) Transfer Pipeline.

Currently, WAS is thickened at the WRRF Complex B Gravity Thickeners. There is a single
line that transports WAS to Complex A where the thickened WAS is blended with thickened
Primary Sludge. The blended sludge is then pumped on for dewatering and then ultimate
disposal. Recent investigations have indicated significant buildup of struvite in the pipe
that transports thickened WAS to Complex A. Addressing the issues associated with the
Page 179

 struvite buildup in the WAS transport line will allow the WRRF to continue to thicken,
dewater and ultimately dispose of biosolids that are removed during the treatment
process.

Justification: GLWA is seeking low interest loan assistance through the SRF program for
this project. Although the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) interest
rate for FY 2019 will not be determined until October 2018, the current year’s interest rate
of 2.00% is less than the present conventional revenue bond interest rates. Based on the
project amount of $10.3 million, GLWA could save an estimated $1.2 million in interest
costs and avoided issuance costs, based on a similar open market revenue bond with a 30year term and 5.00% interest rate, over the life of the 30-year bond issue. This will afford
savings to both GLWA and its members.
Budget Impact: Debt service on this project is anticipated to begin in FY 2020 and will be
included as part of the FY 2020 financial plan.

Proposed Action: The Audit Committee recommends that the Great Lakes Water
Authority Board hold the public hearing on June 13, 2018 for the proposed SRF project and
approve the resolutions to accept and submit the SRF Project Plan for the Pump Station No.
1 (PS-1) Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite Removal Project as presented,
at its regular meeting on June 13, 2018.

 GREAT LAKES WATER AUTHORITY
PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE WATER RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITY
FY 2019 STATE REVOLVING FUND (SRF) PROJECTS
The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) announces a Public Hearing regarding its Project Plan for the proposed Pump
Station No. 1 (PS-1) Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite Removal Project. GLWA will be seeking low interest
State Revolving Fund (SRF) loan assistance for FY 2019. The primary purpose of the project is to provide efficient and
reliable operations at the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) by implementing necessary improvements to the Pump
Station No. 1 Ferric Chloride System and Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) Transfer Pipeline.
GLWA is required to remove phosphorus from wastewater flows to reach limits as specified by the NPDES permit.
Phosphorus has been shown to be a contributor to algae buildup in the Great Lakes. The primary method for removing
phosphorous at the GLWA WRRF is by adding iron salts (ferric or ferrous chloride) to the wastewater stream at each of the
two (2) pump stations (PS-1 and PS-2) and then precipitating it out in the primary clarifiers. The ferric chloride feed system
at PS-2 has been recently rehabilitated, but the system at PS-1 is in need of rehabilitation. Rehabilitating the ferric chloride
feed system at PS-1 will be critical for the WRRF to continue to remove phosphorus to the limits required in the NPDES
permit.
Currently, WAS is thickened at the WRRF Complex B Gravity Thickeners. There is a single line that transports WAS to
Complex A where the thickened WAS is blended with thickened Primary Sludge. The blended sludge is then pumped on for
dewatering and then ultimate disposal. Recent investigations have indicated significant buildup of struvite in the pipe that
transports thickened WAS to Complex A. Addressing the issues associated with the struvite buildup in the WAS transport
line will allow the WRRF to continue to thicken, dewater and ultimately dispose of biosolids that are removed during the
treatment process.
The total cost of this project is currently estimated at $10,297,181, which will be allocated to GLWA and suburban customers
similar to other wastewater system capital improvements. The PS-1 Ferric Chloride System Rehabilitation and Struvite
Removal Project is eligible for participation under the State of Michigan low interest SRF loan program. The Public Hearing
will present a description of the recommended project, its evaluation, estimated costs and cost per household impact for
customer communities. The purpose of the hearing is not only to inform, but to seek and gather input from people that will
be affected. Comments and viewpoints from the public are requested.

 AGENDA ITEM #6D

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Review of the FY 2017 Detroit General Retirement System Plan Actuarial Report

Background: When the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) assumed operations of the
regional water and sewer systems on January 1, 2016, it also assumed a pro-rata share of
the frozen legacy defined benefit pension (referenced as “Component II”) liabilities related
to service provided to the regional systems for the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
(DWSD) Division of the Detroit General retirement System Plan (DGRS) pension plan. The
allocation of those liabilities is 70.3% GLWA and 29.7% DWSD. As part of the City of
Detroit’s bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment (POA), the DWSD Division is required to be funded
at $45.4 million per year with representations that the Division would be nearly fully
funded by June 30, 2023 with any tail liability payment in FY 2024.
Analysis: The FY 2017 DGRS Actuarial Report was issued by the retirement system’s
actuaries, GRS Retirement Consulting, on May 1, 2018. That actuarial report is attached.

As this report was recently received, there are a number of questions that staff has
identified and will report the results of the follow-up at a subsequent Audit Committee
meeting.
Topic 1 – FY 2024 and Beyond Funding Requirements

From pages 2 and 11 of the report (excerpt below), the FY 2024 is projected to be either
$7.1 Million or $9.1 Million depending on the funding policy selected by DGRS.

Funding Policy 1 is based on amortizing the UAAL over the average remaining
service life of active members (7 years for DWSD) using level dollar amortization.
Funding Policy 2 is based on amortizing the UAAL with level principal payments
over a closed 30-year period plus interest. This method is also known as level
principal declining interest amortization.

Page 184

 While it is good news that the annual, combined DWSD Division payments by DWSD and
GLWA move from $42.9 million (net of plan administrative fees of $2.5 million) per year to
$7.1 Million or $9.1 Million, this is significantly more than what was outlined in the POA.

Topic 2 – Clarity Regarding Terminate Employees
It also appears that there is a legal question by the actuaries (except below) as noted
below. The third sentence below is consistent with prior years and GLWA’s expectations.
It is expected that this could be readily addressed with the appropriate parties.

Page 185

  

 

Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWM Members

The Retirement System does not currently identify GLWA employees. The DWSD division had a large
number of terminations in 2016. We have discussed with the Board's legal counsel whether or not GLWA
employees are considered active members for purposes of Component II and do not have a de?nitive
answer. We have treated these numbers as terminated members who are entitled to either a vested
deferred bene?t or a refund contributions. We recommend the Board's legal counsel research this
point. If it is determined that these members are still active and are continuing to earn vesting and
eligibility service under the plan, then we recommend the Retirement System work with GLWA to identify
these members.

For this valuation (6/30/201?) we received a separate ?le indicating the June 30, 2014 DWSD status of
members. Any members that were indicated as being DWSD division members on that file were valued
under the DWSD for this valuation, regardless of the division reported on the main valuation data (which
we understand to be the division as of June 30, 2017 in the Component I plan}.

 

 

Proposed Action: None.

Board of Trustees
The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit
Dear Board Members:
This report provides key results from the Annual Actuarial Valuation of the annuity and pension liabilities of
the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit – Component II benefits. The date of the valuation was
June 30, 2017.
The City of Detroit filed for bankruptcy on July 18, 2013. A final Plan of Adjustment (“POA”) was confirmed on
November 7, 2014 and the official exit from bankruptcy was on December 10, 2014. In connection with the
POA, very significant changes were made to the benefits that the General Retirement System provides and to
the contributions that it will receive. In particular, the benefits provided by the Retirement System were
divided into two separate plans, referred to as “Component I” and “Component II.” The benefits provided in
each component are effective July 1, 2014 and are described in detail in Emergency Manager Order No. 44,
dated December 8, 2014. In very general terms, Component I provides benefits for service rendered on and
after July 1, 2014 and Component II provides benefits for service rendered prior to July 1, 2014.
The results provided herein relate solely to the Component II benefits. Component I benefits will be the
subject of a separate report. The purposes of the valuation are to measure the funding progress of
Component II in accordance with the terms of the POA and to provide illustrative actuarially determined
contribution amounts, given POA conditions and assumptions for Fiscal Year 2019 for Component II, for
comparison with the contribution amounts provided in the POA. The results of the valuation are not
applicable for other purposes. In particular, the information provided in this report is not suitable for financial
reporting in connection with GASB Statement No. 67. Such information is provided in a separate report.
Information regarding potential benefit restoration as allowed for in the POA will also be provided in a
separate report, at the Board’s request.
The contribution amounts on page 3 include POA stipulated contributions plus two illustrative contribution
amounts from alternate funding policies. Users of this report should be aware that contributions made at
these amounts do not guarantee benefit security.
This report was prepared at the request of the Board and is intended for use by the Retirement System and
those designated or approved by the Board. This report may be provided to parties other than the System
only in its entirety and only with the permission of the Board. GRS is not responsible for unauthorized use of
this report.
Future actuarial measurements may differ significantly from the current measurements presented in this
report due to such factors as: plan experience differing from that anticipated by the economic and
demographic assumptions; changes in economic or demographic assumptions; increases or decreases
expected as part of the natural operation of the methodology used for these measurements (such as the end
of an amortization period or additional cost or contribution requirements based on the plan’s funded status);
and changes in plan provisions or applicable law. Due to the limited scope of the actuary’s assignment, the
actuary did not perform an analysis of the potential range of such future measurements.

The valuation was based upon records maintained and furnished by the Retirement System staff concerning
active members, retirees and beneficiaries, and financial accounts as of the valuation date. Data was checked
for year-to-year consistency, but was not audited by the actuary. We are not responsible for the completeness
or accuracy of the data. Certain necessary data was not available in time to be considered in this report and,
therefore, it was necessary for us to use approximations. Please see related discussion in the Comments
section as well as the Data section of this report.
The assumptions used in the valuations concerning future experience are summarized in Section D of this
report. Except for the assumed rate of investment return, the actuarial assumptions used for the valuation are
set by the Board based upon advice of the actuary and other parties. The assumed rate of investment return
was set to 6.75% in the POA and is, therefore, a “prescribed assumption set by another party” as discussed in
Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 4. In our judgement, all of the actuarial assumptions used for the valuation
are reasonable for purposes of the measurement being made.
This report has been prepared by individuals who have substantial experience valuing public sector retirement
systems. To the best of our knowledge, this report is complete and accurate and was made in accordance with
Actuarial Standards of Practice promulgated by the Actuarial Standards Board.
The signing individuals are independent of the plan sponsor.
David T. Kausch and Judith A. Kermans are Members of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA) and meet
the Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinions contained
herein.
This report does not evaluate the plan sponsor’s ability or willingness to make contributions to the Retirement
System. Given the funded level of Component II, plan sponsor contributions are critical if further benefit
reductions are to be avoided. Indeed, the employer contributions set forth in the POA are expected to lead to
a decrease in the funded status through June 30, 2023 (as contemplated by the POA), even if all assumptions
are met.
Respectfully submitted,

We have assumed the contributions outlined above as called for in the POA (with adjustments) will not
change. An estimate of the probability of those payments being made was outside the scope of this
project, not required by Actuarial Standards, and was not made.
In order to develop divisional valuation results in accordance with POA provisions, we were instructed to
allocate the above contributions to the various divisions. This was done by allocating DWSD transfer
amounts to the General City division and remaining DWSD contributions to the DWSD division; allocating
$2.5 million per year to the Library; and allocating remaining contributions to DOT and General in
proportion to their unfunded liabilities.

result in different results by group.

Included at System’s request.

The POA contributions result in a defunding of the plan between now and June 30, 2023, which was
contemplated by the POA. In fact, the anticipated POA contributions do not project benefit restoration
even if all assumptions are met (including the POA mandated assumed rate of return of 6.75%). Also,
the 2018 to 2023 contributions are less than the amount of nominal interest that accrues on the UAAL.
The Estimated Employer Contribution for FY 2024 is based on a projection of results assuming only the
POA contributions are made and all future experience between the valuation date and FY 2024 is as
assumed. Actual experience will result in changes to this estimate and the final result (from the June 30,
2022 actuarial valuation) could be materially different than shown above.
We understand that the City has set aside additional money to be contributed to the pension plans in the
future. This potential additional contribution has not been taken into account in this valuation.

 Valuation Results (Continued)
We have recommended that the Board establish a funding policy for the contribution determinations on
and after fiscal year 2024. The Board has accepted this recommendation and has begun the process. Once
that process has been completed we will incorporate the adopted policy in future valuation reports. Until
that process is completed, we will continue to show the following two possible policies.
In the chart below, the first policy funds the UAAL over the expected remaining active service life of this
group. The second policy is similar to the Board’s pre-bankruptcy policy, but with accelerated principle
payments of the UAAL to prevent insolvency prior to the end of the funding period. The illustrations are
intended to show that there are a broad range of possible funding policies, but are not intended to
provide a specific recommendation or a minimum or maximum level of contributions.
Funding Policy 1 is based on amortizing the UAAL over the average remaining service life of active
members (8 years for general; 6 years for DOT; 7 years for DWSD; and 7 years for Library) using level
dollar amortization.
Funding Policy 2 is based on amortizing the UAAL with level principal payments over a closed
30-year period plus interest. This method is also known as level principal declining interest amortization.

We understand the Employer has set aside money to contribute to the Pension Plans in the future.
Since the portion of the fund this Plan will receive has not been determined, we have not taken those
assets into account in our calculations. We commend the Employer for taking proactive steps to
manage the estimated increase in funding requirements beginning in FY 2024. In the meantime, we
recommend continued consideration of increasing contributions actually deposited into the trust.
In addition, as the Board works through the funding policy, we would suggest considering a funding
period less than 30 years. Given the fact that not all of the retiree liabilities are funded, a period of 15
years or less should be considered.

The POA Funded Ratio measurement above is an expected return-based measurement of the pension
obligation. It is based upon the mandated 6.75% interest rate assumption (assumption prescribed by
another party). It determines an amount that will be sufficient to provide benefits if the portfolio earns
the expected 6.75% return on assets and all other assumptions are met. This measure is appropriate for
assessing the need for or amount of future contributions (if all assumptions are met). This measure is not
appropriate for assessing the sufficiency of plan assets to cover the estimated cost of settling the plan’s
benefit obligation, in other words, of transferring the obligation to a third party in a market value type
transaction.

The Solvency Funded Ratio is a market-based measurement of the pension obligation. It estimates the
amount the plan would need to invest in low risk securities to provide the benefits with greater certainty.
For this purpose, the solvency liability is computed at 3.56% interest as of June 30, 2017, based on the
long-term municipal bond rate (“20-Year Municipal GO AA Index” rate from the Fidelity Index as of June
30, 2017). We are not able to assess the credit quality of the plan sponsor and, as such, no adjustment
has been made for the credit quality of the plan sponsor. This measure may not be appropriate for
assessing the need for or amount of future contributions. This measure may not be appropriate for
assessing the sufficiency of plan assets to cover the estimated cost of settling the plan’s benefit
obligation.
The difference between the two measures (POA and Solvency) is one illustration of the savings the
sponsor anticipates by taking on the risk in a diversified portfolio.

Modified Contributions
We understand that the UTGO scheduled contributions for FY 2018 were accelerated to FY 2017. See page
9 for additional comments on allocation.

ASF Claw-Back Data
For the June 30, 2015 valuation, the Systems auditors determined a receivable in accordance with GAAP
accounting that was included in the reported June 30, 2015 assets. The reported assets for the June 30,
2017 status valuation also included a receivable for the remaining claw-back payments. While we did not
audit any of the assets, we reviewed the change in this receivable for reasonableness.

Annuity Reserve Fund (ARF)
In general, assets were reviewed for reasonableness. During that review, we discovered that the ARF was
not credited any interest. As a result, we recommend that all the reserve amounts be reviewed.

 Comments (Continued)
Plan Provisions
Section B-1 (b) of the plan provides that members who terminate employment and are subsequently
rehired before incurring a six-year break in service are eligible to earn additional vesting and eligibility
service under the plan. For purposes of this valuation, we have assumed no terminated members are
rehired.

Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Members
The Retirement System does not currently identify GLWA employees. The DWSD division had a large
number of terminations in 2016. We have discussed with the Board’s legal counsel whether or not GLWA
employees are considered active members for purposes of Component II and do not have a definitive
answer. We have treated these numbers as terminated members who are entitled to either a vested
deferred benefit or a refund of ASF contributions. We recommend the Board’s legal counsel research this
point. If it is determined that these members are still active and are continuing to earn vesting and
eligibility service under the plan, then we recommend the Retirement System work with GLWA to identify
these members.
For this valuation (6/30/2017) we received a separate file indicating the June 30, 2014 DWSD status of
members. Any members that were indicated as being DWSD division members on that file were valued
under the DWSD for this valuation, regardless of the division reported on the main valuation data (which
we understand to be the division as of June 30, 2017 in the Component I plan).

Allocation of Contributions between General and DOT
Our understanding of the allocation of contributions between General and DOT is discussed on page 1 of
this report. Based on the reported assets, a different allocation method appears to have been used in
FY2017. If the System supplies us with this asset method actually used, we can incorporate that method in
future valuations.

Magnitude of Administrative Expenses
Combined Component I (Hybrid) and Component II (Legacy) administrative expenses for the 2017 fiscal
year are approximately 30% higher when compared to the 2016 fiscal year. We have been informed that
this increase is temporary.

Data Changes
System staff has undertaken several data improvement projects (some specifically discussed in other
comments herein). As these data improvements are provided to us in the valuation data, we have
removed earlier adjustments and approximations. These improvements are the primary source of the
liability losses shown on page 7. In particular, the data review process seems to indicate that new AFC
amounts for DOT were larger then reported annual compensation due to overtime included in AFC that
was not included in reported compensation. As data continues to improve, additional liability gains and
losses may result in future valuations.

 Comments (Continued)
Annuity Savings Fund (ASF) Interest Credits
The ASF fund is credited with the lesser of 5.25% interest and the total fund earnings. We understand
that any earning in excess of 5.25% (that otherwise would have been credited to the ASF fund if not for
the 5.25% cap) will be transferred to Component I assets, to the extent needed, for funding of transition
liability. Since ASF liabilities are equal to ASF balances, we did not model any such future excess earnings
as part of this valuation. However, since the fund earned approximately 11% during FY 2017, we expect
that there will be a transfer of excess ASF interest in FY 2019 related to this year’s performance.
Approximately $5.9 million was added to the liabilities in this report to account for anticipated excess
earnings expected to occur as a result of return on assets in the 2017 fiscal year. We have discussed this
additional liability with the Plan’s accountants and have been instructed that the excess earnings should
not be included as a liability in the GASB 67 and 68 reports.

Census Data and Approximations
We understand that data provided this year contained new estimates of the 2014 frozen AFC for active
members. Benefit calculations we collected for members who retired on or after 7/1/2017 support the
2017 reported AFC as being more accurate. We have therefore removed the AFC load that was used in
prior valuations. However, the AFC provided for this valuation appeared to be unreasonably small for a
portion of the population. Therefore, in cases where the AFC reported for this valuation was less than
75% of the AFC reported in the 2014 valuation, the AFC as reported in the 2014 valuation was used.
Data was reported separately for Component I and Component II. Additional time was needed to
reconcile these two data sets as they came from different source data. Processing time for the valuation
could be shortened if data for future valuations is reconciled before being provided to GRS. We would be
happy to work with the Retirement System staff to help them provide the information that is needed for
the valuation.
System staff has been working on several data clean-up projects. We understand that the reported
service and reported 2014 frozen AFC amounts for this year’s valuation include the results of this data
clean-up, to date. As a result, we saw liability losses related to the improved data that partially offset the
gains from investment returns.

Actuarial Assumptions
The Retirement System routinely has five-year experience studies in accordance with the City ordinance.
The last experience study for the period from July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2012 was started but not
completed due to the bankruptcy. We conducted a review of the mortality experience in 2013. We
recommend that the System consider the experience study schedule. The next experience study would be
scheduled for the period from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2017. However, in order to avoid distortions
from the bankruptcy, the next experience study could be scheduled to begin just after the City emerged
from bankruptcy. This, however, would suggest a study based on the period July 1, 2015 through June 30,
2020. We understand the Board has chosen to follow this suggestion and has scheduled the next
experience study to begin subsequent to the June 30, 2020 valuation.

 Comments (Concluded)
Restoration
This valuation assumes no future restoration of Component II benefits (consistent with the expectation of
the POA). Any future restoration will be reflected beginning in the next valuation after being granted.

DWSD (Water/Sewer) Projections
Based on this valuation, the DWSD (Water/Sewer) division is not expected to be fully funded by 2024. As
a result, their contributions will continue to be needed in FY 2024 (see page 2 for estimated FY 2024
contributions) to fund DWSD liabilities.

Future Results
While FY 2018 investment performance has not yet been provided to us, the S&P 500 and the DOW have
so far both returned more than 6.75%. If the Retirement System’s experience is similar, this will result in
upward pressure on the funded status and downward pressure on the FY 2024 contribution requirements
(below what is shown in this report), all other assumptions being met.
The POA mandated contributions for FY 2018 and beyond are expected to defund the Retirement System,
when all assumptions are realized. In FY 2018, the POA mandated contributions are less than the interest
on the projected UAAL. This defunding was contemplated in the POA.

Recommendation
We recommend that every potential action be taken to generate contributions to the Retirement
System above those provided in the POA. Benefit payments to retirees in the Plan were almost $250
million compared to FY 2018 contribution of $68.3 million. See benefit projections on page 21.

Prior Recommendation
We understand the Retirement System is working on a project to compute the frozen accrued benefits for
active and deferred members. We are currently working with staff to determine if the data audit projects
they have completed are sufficient for purposes of the prior recommendation.

Prior Recommendation
The Board is currently working on the development of a funding policy for FY 2024 and beyond.

Conclusion
The funded status of the plan improved this year from 63.8% to 65.6% as a result of investment
performance.

 Active

Data Approximations and Assumptions

For active members, frozen AFC amounts and frozen service as of June 30, 2014 was reported. For
purposes of this valuation, we matched the June 30, 2017 actives to the active data reported for the June
30, 2014 valuation to check against AFC as of June 30, 2014. In cases where the frozen AFC as reported in
the 2017 data file was less than 75% of the AFC as reported on the 2014 data file, the AFC as reported on
the 2014 data file was used.

Deferred
Data provided for deferred vested members was incomplete. As part of the processing of deferred
member data, we attempted to fill in missing data with data from; 1) the previous year’s deferred file; 2)
the current year’s active file and/or; 3) the previous year’s active files. In cases where AFC was still
incomplete after comparing to other files, we used $30,000 to estimate the AFC. Since vesting service is
not directly provided on the file, we estimated vesting service based on reported benefit service increased
by the elapsed time between date of termination and June 30, 2014. Members with estimated vesting
service of less than 8 years were assumed to be non-vested and were not valued. We estimated the
commencement date with the following rules:
•
•
•

Age 55 if 30 or more years of service and hired before July 1986;
Age 60 if less than 30 years of service, but more than 10 years of service and hired before 1986;
and
Age 62 for all others.

Entire amount of deferred benefits was assumed to commence at the same time regarding the date of
hire.

Retired and Beneficiary
It is our understanding that the current pension amount provided in the retiree data includes the 4.5%
reduction as mandated in the POA. However, for members that retired prior to July 2015, the other
pension amounts provided in the data (original pension amount, equated pension amount, and prior
year’s pension amount) did not reflect the 4.5% reduction and, as such, were reduced by 4.5% when
valuing any related liability. Other adjustment assumptions include:
•
•
•
•

In cases where the benefit is identified to be a joint and survivor benefit and a beneficiary is not
listed in the data, it was assumed that male spouses were 3 years older than females;
For non-equated members that elected a pop-up benefit, the pop-up amount is estimated based
on the chosen option and benefit amounts provided in the data;
Benefits for dependent children are assumed to cease at age 21; and
For non-converted disabled members, converted benefits are:
o assumed to commence at age 60; and
o estimated, based on reported service and projected service from the date of disability to
age 60.

Please see our correspondence dated April 3, 2017 for additional information regarding data
reconciliation, processing instructions, and assumptions regarding unresolved issues. Note, this letter
disclosed our data procedures and assumptions and we received confirmation from staff.

The chart shows the expected future development of the present population in simplified terms. The
Retirement System presently covers 3,025 active members. Eventually, 131 people are expected to
terminate covered employment prior to retirement and forfeit eligibility for an employer provided
benefit. 2,674 people are expected to receive monthly retirement benefits either by retiring directly from
active service, or by retiring from vested deferred status. 220 people are expected to become eligible for
benefits as a result of death-in-service or disability.

METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS

Page 217

Summary of Assumptions and Methods Used for
Actuarial Valuations
Adopted by Board of Trustees
All assumptions are estimates of future experience except as noted. The rationale for the assumptions
is based on experience studies where noted.

Economic Assumptions
The investment return rate used in making the valuation was 6.75% per year, compounded annually (net
after investment and administrative expenses). This assumption is prescribed by the Eighth Amended
Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit (POA).
Price inflation is not directly used in the valuation. For purposes of assessing the reasonability of the
investment return assumptions, we assumed price inflation of 2.50% per year.

Non-Economic Assumptions
The mortality table used to measure retired life mortality was 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant
Table for set-forward 1 year for males and 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table set-forward 1
year for females. Tables were extended below age 50 with a cubic spline to the published Juvenile rates.
Pre-retirement mortality is based on the corresponding Employee tables with corresponding set forward.
The tables are projected to be fully generational, based on the 2-dimensional, sex distinct mortality
improvement scale MP-2014 (which was published and intended to be used with RP-2014). 75% of all
deaths-in-service are assumed to be non-duty related. This table was first used as of June 30, 2014. For
disabled members, the same tables are used. The rationale for the mortality assumption is based on the
2008-2013 Mortality Experience Study issued February 4, 2015.
The probabilities of retirement for members eligible to retire are shown on pages 27 and 28. These
probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale is based on the 2002-2007
Experience Study.
The probabilities of separation from service (including death-in-service and disability) are shown for
sample ages on page 29. These probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale
is based on the 2002-2007 Experience Study.

 Summary of Assumptions and Methods Used for
Actuarial Valuations
Adopted by Board of Trustees (Concluded)
Funding Methods
The unit credit cost method was used in determining age & service pension liabilities, vesting liabilities,
and casualty pension liabilities. Under this method, there is no normal cost since benefits are frozen and
there are no future accruals and actuarial accrued liability is the present value of each individual’s accrued
benefit.
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liabilities. Actual employer contributions through June 30, 2023 are set by
the POA. The amortization period and method after 2023 has not yet been established by the Board.
Employer contribution dollars were assumed to be paid at the end of the employer fiscal year.
Present assets are set equal to the Market Value.

The data about persons now covered and about present assets were furnished by the System’s
administrative staff. Although examined for general reasonableness, the data was not audited by the
Actuary.

 Miscellaneous and Technical Assumptions
Benefit Service

Exact Fractional service is used to determine the amount of benefit
payable.

Decrement Operation

Disability and mortality decrements do not operate during the first 5
years of service. Disability and withdrawal do not operate during
retirement eligibility.

Decrement Timing

Decrements of all types are assumed to occur mid-year.

Eligibility Testing

Eligibility for benefits is determined based upon the age nearest birthday
and rounded service on the date the decrement is assumed to occur.

Forfeitures

None.

Incidence of Contributions

Contributions are assumed to be received at the end of the year.

Marriage Assumption

100% of males and 100% of females are assumed to be married for
purposes of death-in-service benefits. Male spouses are assumed to be
three years older than female spouses for active member valuation
purposes.

Normal Form of Benefit

Straight life is the normal form of benefit. Straight life is generally the
most valuable under valuation assumptions. Actuarial equivalent factors
are based on 7.5% interest and 1984 Group Annuity Mortality table.

Service Credit Accruals

Service accruals stop as of June 30, 2014 for measurement of Component
II liabilities. However, future service in Component I may be used to
satisfy benefit eligibility requirement in Component II. Members who
became duty disabled prior to June 30, 2014 are assumed to get
projected service from date of disability to conversion date. Member
who become disabled after June 30, 2014 are assumed to get their frozen
accrued benefit as of June 30, 2014 at date of conversion.

Administrative Expenses

The investment return assumption is mandated to be net of investment
and administrative expense in the plan document. No other provision for
administrative expenses is included in this valuation.

Sick Leave

Sick leave banks as of June 30, 2014 were included in the 2014 data file
provided by the System.

Member Contributions

Member contributions to this Component II plan are assumed to have
ceased with the bankruptcy.

Rationale for assumption is 2002 to 2007 Experience Study, modified as necessary for changes in data or
administration.

PLAN PROVISIONS

Page 225

Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
Component II Frozen Benefits
All Component II benefits are frozen as of June 30, 2014 based on service and average final compensation
accrued as of that date and the provisions of the Detroit General Retirement System as it existed on June 30,
2014. Frozen benefits are further reduced by 4.5% and all future cost-of-living adjustments (“COLA’s”) were
eliminated. Benefits resulting from the Annuity Savings Fund and benefits paid from the Annuity Reserve
Fund were subject to a separate reduction described as a “Claw-back.” Details of the claw-back provision are
complicated and can be found in the Eighth Amended Plan of Adjustment. The benefits evaluated in this
report are the frozen reduced benefits after adjusting the assets for the claw-back. Component II benefits are
payable after separation from service, upon meeting the eligibility conditions of the plan as it existed on June
30, 2014, regardless of whether the individual is eligible to receive a Component I benefit at that time.
Our understanding of the June 30, 2014 plan provisions is provided below for completeness. The material
below does not have legal standing and is not intended to cover all potential situations that could occur. If
there are discrepancies between the description below and appropriate legal documents, the latter
necessarily govern.

Age and Service Pension
Eligibility - Any age (minimum age 55 for non-EMS members hired after 1995) with 30 years of service (25
for EMS members), or age 60 with 10 years of service, or age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount - EMS Members: Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of service,
plus b) a pension equal to 2.0% of AFC multiplied by years of service. Maximum benefit is 90% of AFC.
Other Members: Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of service, plus b) a
pension equal to the first 10 years of service multiplied by 1.6% of AFC, plus 1.8% of AFC for each year of
service greater than 10 years up to 20 years, plus 2.0% of AFC for each year of service greater than 20
years up to 25 years, plus 2.2% of AFC for each year of service greater than 25 years. Future benefit
accruals for certain active members (depending on bargaining unit) were reduced to 1.5% of final average
compensation per year of service.
Type of Average Final Compensation (AFC) - Highest 3 consecutive years out of the last 10. Pension
benefits will not be diminished if compensation is reduced because of a fiscal emergency. Effective July 1,
1999, in computing the AFC, a member shall have the option of adding the value of 25% of unused
accrued sick leave to the earnings used in computing the AFC. Longevity is added to AFC in accordance
with the following schedule: $150 after 5 years, $300 after 10 years, $450 after 15 years, $600 after 20
years, and $750 after 25 years.

Early Retirement
Eligibility - Any age with 25 or more years of service (min. age 55 for members hired after 1995).
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but actuarially reduced.

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Continued)
Deferred Retirement (Vested Benefit)
Eligibility - Hired prior to 7-1-80: Age 40 with 8 years of service. Hired on or after 7-1-80: Any age with
10 years of service.
Benefit Commencement - APTE hired prior to July 1, 1988: Benefit begins at the age the member would
have become eligible for regular retirement if service had continued. SAAA, Non-Union and lawyers
hired prior to June 30, 1986: Benefit begins at the age the member would have become eligible for
regular retirement. Others: Benefits based on service rendered by June 30, 1986 begin at the age the
member would have become eligible for regular retirement. Benefits based on service rendered after July
1, 1986 begin at age 62.
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but based on average final compensation and service at the
time of termination.

Duty Disability Retirement

Eligibility - Service related disability before eligibility for service retirement prior to and July 1, 2014. No
service requirement.
Annual Amount - An annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated contributions at date of
disability plus a pension of two-thirds of average final compensation at time of disability. The maximum
annual pension is $5,700 ($9,000 for EMS). At the earliest of when the member would have accrued 30
years of service credit (25 for EMS) or age 60, the annuity is recomputed assuming contributions would
have continued at a salary level equal to final compensation. The pension is recomputed with additional
service credit granted from the date of disability to age 60 (or 30 years of service credit) or June 30, 2014,
whichever is earlier.

Non-Duty Disability Retirement
Eligibility - Disability from any cause before age 60 with 10 or more years of service prior to July 1, 2014.
Annual Amount - Computed in the same manner as a regular retirement benefit. Maximum annual
pension to age 60 is $6,000. Benefit is recomputed at age 60 with no maximum.

Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death from service related causes. No age or service requirements.
Annual Amount - One-third of final compensation as of June 30, 2014 to the surviving spouse for life or
until remarriage, plus an equal share of 1/4 of final compensation to each unmarried child under age 18.
If there is no eligible spouse, eligible children each receive 1/4 of final compensation; if there are more
than 2 such children, each child shares an equal part of 1/2 of final compensation. Maximum total
amount for spouse and children is $9,000 annually. If there is no eligible spouse or children, dependent
parents each receive 1/6 of deceased’s final compensation, to a total maximum of $600 annually.
The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Concluded)
Non-Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death-in-service at any age with 15 years of service; or after age 60 with 10 years of service; or
after age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount - To Surviving Spouse: Computed as a regular retirement benefit but reduced in
accordance with a 100% joint and survivor election for members with 20 or more years of service. For
members with 15 years of service but less than 20, benefit is reduced in accordance with a 50% joint and
survivor election. To Dependent Children if no Surviving Spouse: $9,000 payable to age 19 of the
youngest child or for life if child is physically or mentally impaired for members with 20 or more years of
service ($6,000 if less than 20 years of service).

Post-Retirement Cost-of-Living Adjustments
Benefit is increased annually by 2.25% of the original pension amount at retirement. Post-retirement
cost-of-living increases were eliminated on future accruals for certain active members (depending on
bargaining unit).

Member Contributions
Members have the option of choosing one of four contribution amounts: (1) 0%; (2) 3.0% of
compensation up to the Social Security wage base, plus 5.0% of compensation in excess of the Social
Security wage base; (3) 5.0% of total compensation; or (4) 7.0% of total compensation. Member
contributions can be paid as a lump sum or annuitized at retirement to provide an annuity in addition to
the pension (which is not affected by the level of member contributions).

valuation.
Actuarial Assumptions. Estimates of future plan experience with respect to rates of mortality, disability,
turnover, retirement, rate or rates of investment income and salary increases. Decrement assumptions
(rates of mortality, disability, turnover and retirement) are generally based on past experience, often
modified for projected changes in conditions. Economic assumptions (salary increases and investment
income) consist of an underlying rate in an inflation-free environment plus a provision for a long-term
average rate of inflation.
Actuarial Cost Method. A mathematical budgeting procedure for allocating the dollar amount of the
“actuarial present value of future plan benefits” between the actuarial present value of future normal
cost and the actuarial accrued liability. Sometimes referred to as the “actuarial funding method.”
Actuarial Equivalent. A single amount or series of amounts of equal value to another single amount or
series of amounts, computed on the basis of the rate(s) of interest and mortality tables used by the plan.
Actuarial Present Value. The amount of funds presently required to provide a payment or series of
payments in the future. It is determined by discounting the future payments at a predetermined rate of
interest, taking into account the probability of payment.
AFC. Average Final Compensation.
Amortization. Paying off an interest-bearing liability by means of periodic payments of interest and
principal, as opposed to paying it off with a lump sum payment.

 AGENDA ITEM #6E

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Detroit General Retirement System Plan Reporting Request

Background: When the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) assumed operations of the
regional water and sewer systems on January 1, 2016, it also assumed a pro-rata share of
the frozen legacy defined benefit pension (referenced as “Component II”) liabilities related
to service provided to the regional systems for the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
(DWSD) Division of the Detroit General retirement System Plan (DGRS) pension plan.
Pursuant to the “Agreement Re GRS Defined Benefit Plan Among City of Detroit and General
Retirement System of City of Detroit and Great Lakes Water Authority” dated December 1,
2015, certain reporting requirements are in place. Section 2.2 (a)(4) is provided below.

Analysis: Representatives from GRS have reached out to GLWA to modify the above audit
requirement under the pension reporting agreement to "an in relation to opinion". This
would reduce the administrative expenses for the cost of the annual audit. The GRS
auditors have suggested a further refinement the GRS request. This includes the divisional
allocation schedule within the regular GRS financial statements, as supplementary
information. There would still be an in relation to opinion, which is the minimum allowed
under the pension reporting agreement. This would be less costly, however, than
preparing and issuing separate financial statements.
Page 232

 Recommendation: It is recommended that the Audit Committee authorize staff to work
with the General Retirement System and its auditors to provide an “in relation to” opinion
for the divisional allocation schedule within the regular GRS financial statements, as
supplementary information.

 AGENDA ITEM #7B

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager
Re:

Update: Pre-approved Underwriter Pool Proposal Selection for the 2018 Financing
Program

Background: At its meeting on June 27, 2016, as part of the underwriter selection process
related to its inaugural 2016 bond transaction, the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA)
Board of Directors (Board) approved the following list of ten (10) firms that were deemed
qualified to act as senior managing underwriters for subsequent GLWA bond issuances.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Barclays Capital, Inc.
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co.
JP Morgan Securities LLC
Morgan Stanley & Co.
Piper Jaffray & Co.
PNC Capital Markets
Ramirez & Co.
Siebert Brandford Shank
Wells Fargo Securities

Furthermore, the GLWA Board directed that in the event of a subsequent bond issuance,
the Chief Procurement Officer shall:

1) Convene an evaluation panel to interview and review the qualifications of each of
the ten (10) firms listed below to serve as Bookrunning Senior Managing Underwriter
or Co-Senior Managing Underwriter for that issuance; or

2) Issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to select a Senior Managing Underwriter(s) for
that transaction.
Justification: Pursuant to Option 1 above, GLWA will seek updates to the proposals
submitted by the underwriter pool pre-selected by the GLWA Board of Directors on June
27, 2016. This proposal update shall provide financing recommendations and information
for the potential refunding of certain GLWA water and sewer system series of outstanding
1

Page 234

 bonds and new money for the sewer system of the Detroit Water and Sewer Department
(DWSD). The refunding component generally contemplates the current refunding of
selected GLWA series bonds that have call dates of July 1, 2018 but may also consider
current taxable advance refunding of other savings candidates with 2019 (or later) call
dates.

Proposed Transactions: The outstanding GLWA bonds for the water and sewer
systems that are the focus of the refunding plan total approximately $178 million for the
water system approximately and approximately $190 million for the sewer system.
These include the current refunding of Series 2001C second lien bonds of the Water
System, the current refunding of the senior lien 1998A, 1998B, and 2001 C2 Sewer
System Bonds, as well as the potential taxable advance refunding of the senior lien
Series 2001 C1 Sewer System Bonds. Additionally, GLWA has been notified by DWSD
that it will need GLWA to issue approximately $75 million of new money sewer bonds on
its behalf.
Proposed Process: GLWA, through its Procurement Department, will send out the
underwriter solicitations in the form of proposal update questionnaires to the list of 10
qualified underwriting firms. The firms will have almost 2 weeks to submit their
responses to GLWA Procurement. After the responses are received, PFM (GLWA’s
financial advisor) will provide its analysis on the responses received. The written
responses will also be scored by the evaluation panel. Oral interviews will be conducted
with all underwriting firms that submit responses to the solicitation update
questionnaire, in accordance with the Board’s directive. Once the oral interviews are
held and the final scoring is tabulated, GLWA management, along with its registered
municipal advisor, Public Financial Management (PFM), will present the
recommendation of the evaluation panel to the GLWA Audit Committee for further
recommendation to the GLWA Board.
Proposed Time Schedule: Below is the proposed time schedule for the underwriter
solicitation process.

 DWSD Retail Billings: Due to DWSD’s reporting software transition, the updated DWSD
billed usage and billed revenue information for March 2018 were not available. The March
2018 numbers will be included in next report provided at the June 2018 Audit Committee
meeting.
GLWA Wholesale Customer Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 sewer billed revenue.
As a result of the sewer rate simplification which provides a more stable revenue stream,
the wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee. The results of this effort can
be seen as the billed revenue is at 100.00% of budget through March 2018.

Total System Billings: Table 1 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
sewer billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined billings available at the time
of this report, the GLWA Sewer System had billed revenues of 100.0% of budget without
the March 2018 DWSD billings.

2. FY 2018 Retail and Wholesale Water Revenue Report

Table 2 summarizes the unaudited FY 2018 wholesale customer water revenues billed by
GLWA and the retail water revenues billed by DWSD. Please note these are billed revenues
and do not reflect collections of those revenues. It should also be noted that the revenues
are shown in the month that the billed flow was accrued and not the following month when
the bills are usually sent out.

charge. As of March 31, 2018, the billed usage was at 103.17% of budget and billed revenue
at 104.22% of budget. As noted in Table 2, revenues and usage from the City of Flint are
included as they were assumed in the FY 2018 Budget.

Total System Billings: Table 2 shows the FY 2018 combined DWSD and GLWA Wholesale
water billed usage and billed revenue. Based on the combined Retail and Wholesale Water

Detroit, MI 48226

Re: Response to Foster Group Memorandum, April 19, 2018
Cost of Service FY 2018-19

Dear Chairperson Baker:

On April 20, 2018, appearing before the GLWA Audit Committee, the Oakland-Macomb
Interceptor Drain Drainage District provided commentary on the Foster Group
response dated April 19, 2018 (?Foster Group Memorandum?) to previously raised questions and
concerns on the proposed FY 2018?19 Cost of Service charges to the OMID. The Audit
Committee requested that the OMID prepare its response to the Foster Group Memorandum.
Below are our comments and concerns regarding the FY 2019 Sewer Charges to the OMID:

1. Foster Group Memorandum:

?Capital Revenue Requirement Allocations

Since the establishment of the FY 2011 Sewage Disposal Charges, GLWA allocations of
capital revenue requirements (including debt service) have been allocated to cost pools
and Customers based on a ?Utility Basis? approach. Under this approach statistics from
the ?xed asset records of the Sewer Utility are used to allocate capital costs. For instance,
if 1% of the representative capital asset value for the Sewer System is related to OMID
speci?c assets, then 1% of the capital revenue requirements (including debt service) are
allocated to 

OMID Response:

In 2009, the City of Detroit (?City?) transferred to the OMID certain sanitary sewer
interceptors, pump stations, meters and appurtenant facilities originally constructed and owned
by the City. As part of this transaction, the City also entered in a ?Settlement and
Release of Certain Rate Disputes? agreement dated October 22, 2009 (?Release Agreement?).
According to the Release Agreement, the only debt service that was to be assigned to the OMID
was the debt service associated with capital improvements at the Northeast Pump Station
The pertinent portion of the Release Agreement is restated below:

Page 2

 Summary of Post?Closing Debt

a. The parties agree that after the Oakland?Macomb Interceptors have been
transferred to the District and the Macomb Interceptors to Macomb County, the
only debt service included in the sewer rates for the District, other that debt
service allocated "common-to?all? or ?suburban common?to?all," will be debt
service associated with capital improvements at the Northeast pump station
(excluding meters at the Northeast Pump Station). Further, no debt service in the
rates for the or the in and associated with the
meters listed in Section l(d) will be included in the District's rates as a suburban
common?to?all charge in the FY 2009/2010 rate year or subsequent rate years.?

Regardless of whether GLWA (as the successor entity to the City) utilizes Cash Basis,
Utility Basis or any other basis, any debt service assigned to specific? other than for the
Northeast Pump Station would be inconsistent with the Release Agreement.
Accordingly, in addition to the NEPS, the City (and now GLWA) should not have assigned any

debt service for the North Interceptor East Arm since 2009.

2.

Foster Group Memorandum:

?Operating Revenue Requirement Allocations

For purposes of assigning operating costs to the OMID cost pool, the same
approach (relative inch miles) is used to assign NIEA related interceptor costs. In
the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study this resulted in approximately $0.43 million of
direct operating revenue requirements allocated to the OMID cost pool.

With regard to the NEPS operating costs, GLWA allocations of all budget
operating expenses related to sewer pumping stations (including maintenance,
SCADA, etc.) have been assigned to individual sewer pumping stations based on
relative electric usage or costs. This approach was established several years ago,
as detailed speci?c pumping station maintenance costs, etc. were dif?cult to
isolate. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we obtained budgeted
electric utility costs for several years. The relative budgeted electric utility costs
for the NEPS, as a proportion of budgeted electric utility costs for all GLWA
sewer pumping stations, ranged from 24% to 40%. In our FY 2019 Cost of
Service Study we allocated 25% of all sewer pumping station operating expenses
to the NEPS, which resulted in direct operating costs totaling $5.88 million being
assigned to the OMID cost pool. So our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study included
$6.05 million of direct operating revenue requirements assigned to the OMID cost
pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID Customer.

The combined total revenue requirement allocated to the OMID cost pool in the
FY 2019 Cost of Service Study was $10.50 million.?

OMID Response:

Page 2 of 4

Page 3

As indicated above, the NEPS is assigned costs based on electrical usage which was
established several years ago by the City, and continued under GLWA. However, the OMB)
Wastewater Disposal Services Contract dated October 22, 2009 (?Service Contract?), indicates
that such allocations requires justi?cation, as well customer OMID) consent (which ?shall
not be unreasonably withheld?). To assist us in understanding costs allocations, we
request GLWA provide justi?cation that establishes a reasonable relationship between electrical
usage and the allocations of other costs associated with the operations of the NEPS.

In addition, although we understand that the transition from DWSD to GLWA is still a
workuin-progress, the Service Contract provides that separate accounts should have been
established for the NEPS to account for all costs associated with this facility. To our knowledge,
this process was never implemented by the City prior to, or by GLWA, after the transfer of the
regional system. It would be helpful to understand whether GLWA intends to establish separate
accounts to which all costs will be charged by employees for in?house labor, parts, equipment
and contractual services, or whether GLWA intends to continue to allocate these costs. If the
latter, we will need justification as to why it is more cost effective to allocate these costs rather
than directly account and bill for them. For purposes of this letter, we have restated the relevant
portions of the Service Contract below concerning this particular issue:

?22.02 Northeast Pump Station Costs and Accounting. Customer shall be
responsible for the payment of all costs arising out of or related to the operation,
maintenance, improvement and repair the Northeast Pump Station. City will
establish separate accounts for the Northeast Pump Station to which all costs will
be charged by employees for in?house labor, parts and equipment and for
contractual services. In the event the City determine that it is more cost effective
to allocate certain labor functions or establish a flat charge rather than
directly account for them, it may do so with Customer's prior consent which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld so long as City has provided a
acceptable cost allocation justification for the proposed allocation or flat charge.
An allocation or flat charge will be subject to periodic review and adjustment at
intervals no greater than five years. City will maintain supporting records for all
Northeast Pump Station charges for 12 months after the Look Back for the
relevant financial year has been completed and the associated detailed rate
notebook has been made available to Customer. Supporting records will be
available for Customer review upon written request. City will invoice Customer
directly for the cost of operating, maintaining improving and repairing the
Northeast Pump Station on a quarterly basis. These cost will not be recovered
through the rates.?

During the April 20 Audit Committee meeting, we also indicated that there are two
customers which receive customer specific charges associated with sewage pump stations: the
City and the At that time, we inquired as to how the City was assessed by GLWA for its
customer specific sewage pumping stations, and were informed that Shared Services Agreement
establishes the charges for the operations and maintenance of the City?s sewage pump station.

Page 3 of 4

Page 4

We have reviewed the Shared Services Agreement between the City and GLWA, and in
particular, Schedule which identi?es the charges for GLWA services. Attached is a
copy of Schedule Under the Shared Services Agreement Schedule 
GLWA provides 24/7 operations, maintenance, engineering and management services for the
following City facilities: (1) Belle Isle Main Pump Station and Combined Sewer Over?ow
Facility; (2) Bluehill Pump Station; (3) Fischer Pump Station; and (4) Woodmere Pump Station.
According to Schedule (for FY 2016 Budget), the City?s share of the total annual
estimated cost to operate and maintain these facilities, is $1,393,598 (see attachment for specific
services provided). Moreover, the City is directly responsible for all utilities. Any emergency or
extraordinary repairs are separately billed with supporting documentation. Using this
information, it appears that the OMID is being charged signi?cantly more for a similar level of
service for operations and maintenance associated with NEPS than the City is for its pump
stations. GLWA needs to justify this disparate treatment for similar levels of service. Further,
based on the Shared Services Agreement, GLWA is currently capable of directly billing for
services provided.

Remaining Foster Group Memo Item:

During the April 20 Audit Committee meeting, the Committee did not address the
treatment of return on rate base and depreciation expense. We are willing to discuss this matter
as well as the responses above, at the convenience of the Audit Committee.

On behalf of the Oakland-Macomb Interceptor Drain, thank you for taking the time to
review our responses to the issues raised in the Foster Group Memorandum. If you have any
questions regarding this matter please feel free to contact me.

Si ?ely,

MEMORANDUM
FY 2019 Sewer Charges to OMID
To:

April 19, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for commentary and observations regarding a potential response to public
comments made by representatives of the Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drain District
(OMID) at the GLWA Audit Committee meeting on February 23. We have reviewed the
comments, which appear to request modifications to proposed FY 2019 Sewer Charges to
reflect four specific areas of inquiry. Herein we present background information, set forth
our understanding of OMID’s request, and provide a summary of our analyses and
perspective regarding the request.
Background:
The GLWA cost allocation methodology1 for purposes of establishing Sewer service charges
includes a “customer specific” cost pool designed to capture the costs related to GLWA
facilities that serve only the OMID. These facilities include the Northeast Sewer Pumping
Station (“NEPS”), and the portion of the North Interceptor East Arm (“NIEA”) downstream
of the NEPS that conveys flow only from OMID. The cost of service allocation methodology
has traditionally employed slightly different approaches for assigning capital and operating
revenue requirements to this cost pool.
Capital Revenue Requirement Allocations
Since the establishment of the FY 2011 Sewage Disposal Charges, GLWA allocations of
capital revenue requirements (including debt service) have been allocated to cost pools and
Customers based on a “Utility Basis” approach. Under this approach statistics from the fixed
asset records of the Sewer Utility are used to allocate capital costs. For instance, if 1% of the
representative capital asset value for the Sewer System is related to OMID specific assets,
then 1% of the capital revenue requirements (including debt service) are allocated to OMID.
GLWA’s review of the interceptor inventory indicates that the NIEA segment in question
represents approximately 3.5% of all GLWA interceptors, based on an “inch mile” analysis.
For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we assigned 3.5% of all interceptor
capital revenue requirements to the OMID cost pool. This created a direct capital revenue
requirement of approximately $0.78 million.
1

The GLWA methodology is consistent with the methodology of the predecessor entity, DWSD.

Page 15

 FY 2019 Sewer Charges to OMID

April 19, 2018
Page 2

Our cost of service study included a review of the GLWA asset records, which indicated that
the net book value of $19.6 million assigned to the NEPS. This NEPS asset value (and the
representative annual depreciation expense) amounted to approximately 1.2% of the overall
capital asset structure, and we used this ratio to subsequently allocate approximately $2.81
million of direct capital revenue requirements. So our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study
included $3.59 million of direct capital revenue requirements assigned to the OMID cost
pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID Customer2.
Operating Revenue Requirement Allocations
For purposes of assigning operating costs to the OMID cost pool, the same approach (relative
inch miles) is used to assign NIEA related interceptor costs. In the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study this resulted in approximately $0.43 million of direct operating revenue requirements
allocated to the OMID cost pool.
With regard to the NEPS operating costs, GLWA allocations of all budget operating
expenses related to sewer pumping stations (including maintenance, SCADA, etc.) have been
assigned to individual sewer pumping stations based on relative electric usage or costs. This
approach was established several years ago, as detailed specific pumping station maintenance
costs, etc. were difficult to isolate. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we
obtained budgeted electric utility costs for several years. The relative budgeted electric
utility costs for the NEPS, as a proportion of budgeted electric utility costs for all GLWA
sewer pumping stations, ranged from 24% to 40%. In our FY 2019 Cost of Service Study we
allocated 25% of all sewer pumping station operating expenses to the NEPS, which resulted
in direct operating costs totaling $5.88 million being assigned to the OMID cost pool. So our
FY 2019 Cost of Service Study included $6.05 million of direct operating revenue
requirements assigned to the OMID cost pool, which was then directly assigned to the OMID
Customer3.
The combined total revenue requirement allocated to the OMID cost pool in the FY 2019
Cost of Service Study was $10.50 million.
Pending Potential Operating Agreement
We have participated in several meetings between GLWA and OMID representatives as they
have sought to establish an “operating agreement regarding the OMID specific facilities
addressed in this memorandum. Elements of that potential operating agreement would impact
the cost allocation approaches and results discussed above.
2

Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement line item
that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” non-operating items, such as the Lease Payment,
etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Capital” Revenue Requirement totaling $3.99 million in
the Cost of Service Study Report.
3
Table 3 in the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study Report contains a “Net Operating Expenses” Revenue
Requirement line item that includes proportional allocation of certain other “indirect” operating items, such as
the operating portion of the pension obligation, etc. These indirect elements result in the OMID “Net Operating
Expenses” Revenue Requirement totaling $6.52 million in the Cost of Service Study Report.

OMID Request, Analyses, and Perspective:
1. Reflect the treatment of debt service for the OMID only rate category consistent with the
October 22, 2009 Settlement and Release of Certain Rate Disputes as stated in
paragraph 3.a of that document.
• We believe that the reference in the OMID correspondence is taking a position that
the district should not be allocated any capital revenue requirements associated with
the portion of the NIEA that conveys only OMID flow. We do not agree with that
conclusion. We believe that the agreement that is cited in the referenced document
predates the agreements established as part of the Rate Simplification Initiative. In
any event, we encourage this issue to be further explored and discussed as part of the
negotiations towards the Operating Agreement. For purposes of our hypothetical
analysis summarized in the table that follows, we have reflected the calculated effect
of removing such capital revenue requirements from the OMID cost pool, which
would reduce the direct OMID cost pool allocated revenue requirements by
approximately $0.78 million. However the OMID share of the reallocated commonto-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase by $0.13 million, resulting in a
net decrease of $0.65 million.
2. Adjust the assets of the Northeast Pump Station based on the results of the Northeast
Pump Station asset inventory review performed on February 2, 2018 with representatives
from OMID and GLWA.
• As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the capital asset data reported for the NEPS has been
conducted. It is our understanding that the parties are in basic agreement that the
asset records should be adjusted to reflect the results of that review, and that the
adjustments will result in a $5.2 million reduction in the 6/30/17 net book value
allocated to the NEPS – which would result in a revised total of approximately $14.4
million. For purposes of our hypothetical analysis summarized herein, we have
reflected the calculated effect of adjusting the capital revenue requirement allocations
accordingly. Based on our analysis, this would reduce the direct OMID cost pool
allocated revenue requirements by approximately $0.82 million. However the OMID
share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would increase
by $0.12 million, resulting in a net decrease of $0.70 million.
3. Adjust the OMID only cost category revenue requirements to reflect any changes which
may occur pending the review of electrical costs.

As noted in the request, subsequent to the establishment of the proposed FY 2019
charges, additional review of the sewer pumping station electric use and costs has
been conducted. While the analysis continues4, the initial findings indicate that the
NEPS accounts for approximately 36% of recent pumping station electric bills, and
approximately 44% of recent total pumping station electric usage. Had we the benefit
of this additional analysis at the time we conducted the FY 2019 Cost of Service
Study, we likely would have allocated at a minimum 35% (rather than the 25%
original figure) of total sewer pumping station operating revenue requirements to the
NEPS. This hypothetical adjustment would have resulted in a $2.74 million increase
to the operating revenue requirements allocated to the OMID cost pool. However the
OMID share of the reallocated common-to-all (“CTA”) revenue requirement would
decrease by $0.45 million, resulting in a net increase of $2.49 million.
As shown in the table, the net impact of incorporating all of the hypothetical
adjustments noted above would result in a net increase of approximately $0.94
million. Given that the parties are negotiating an Operating Agreement, and that
GLWA is exploring a “Charges Stability Adjustment” to reflect potential adjustments
of actual costs, we do not believe it is prudent to modify the originally proposed FY
2019 Sewer Charges.

4. At the January 31, 2018 GLWA/OMID meeting, GLWA stated depreciation expenses for
the 2018-19 sewer rates will be utilized at 60% of the book value. For the formation of
GLWA, Duff and Phelps analyzed the GLWA assets, stated their values for the beginning
4

The additional review includes an analysis of the amount of wastewater volume handled by each sewer
pumping station. The initial estimate indicates that the NEPS handles approximately one-third of all flows that
utilize GLWA sewer pumping stations.

balances, and revised the remaining lives of the assets. Why use 60% instead of the full
amount of the depreciation expenses, does GLWA dispute the accuracy of their book
values? Further, if GLWA goes forward with the 60% for 2018-19 sewer rates, is there a
plan to move towards utilizing the full amounts of depreciation expense in the future?
• As noted in the request, the GLWA capital assets were subjected to a valuation
analysis conducted by Duff and Phelps, which was required to complete the creation
of GLWA. The leased regional assets were booked at an acquisition value based on
the Duff and Phelps analysis, which resulted in an increase in the net book value of
the “acquired” assets. However it also resulted in a significant increase in the annual
depreciation expense. In our opinion, GLWA does not dispute the accuracy of the
book values not the depreciation expense, but also recognizes (as do we) that the
changes produced by the asset valuation changed the dynamic of the overall asset
structure. For purposes of the FY 2019 Cost of Service Study, we sought to strike a
balance between the portion of the capital revenue requirements that were allocated
(under the Utility Basis approach) based on net book value, and the portion that were
allocated based on annual deprecation expense. The approach we applied
successfully accomplished this balance, and adhered to the overarching stability
objectives of the GLWA charge methodology initiatives. We recommend that future
cost of service studies continue to embrace these objectives with respect to this
specific issue.
We trust that this discussion is responsive to the request, and we are prepared to discuss this
matter at your convenience.

 AGENDA ITEM #7A

Date: May 22, 2018
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Lisa Mancini, Interim Financial Planning & Analysis Manager
Re:

FY 2018 Budget Update and Amendments through March 31, 2018

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) is in the process of closing its most
recent fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. A pre-close quarter ended report has been
prepared to present the current budget progress. This report is a status report as we work
through data points related to FY 2019 budget discussions and does not represent the final
March 2018 quarterly report.
Analysis: This report contains the following for review and discussion.

 Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Category Analysis (including shared services)
 Staffing – Budget vs. Actual

It should be noted that these interim reports are being prepared on an accrual basis which
is currently under final review as the Financial Reporting & Accounting team is rolling out
new monthly closing procedures.
Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Page 20

 Great Lakes Water Authority
Fiscal Year 2018 Pre-Close
Operations & Maintenance Budget to Actual Report
Through March 31, 2018
While the month of March 2018 has not been closed, the Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A)
team wanted to get a head start to see where the budget stands with budget amendments, both
recorded through the end of the third quarter and pending for the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year
2018. The purpose of this report is to show the Audit Committee where the Operations &
Maintenance (O&M) budget is at as of March 31, 2018 and the impact of the estimated pending
fourth quarter budget amendments and reallocations before the Board is asked to approve the
FY 2019 & FY 2020 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Financial Plan.
The following are categories of the estimated pending fourth quarter budget amendments and
reallocations and references the table immediately following this narrative.
 Personnel – A comparison of the actual Salaries & Wages as well as the Employee
Benefits to the amounts budgeted is showing that an increase to the budget of these
areas will be needed. This increase is due to the following.
•

Increases in the Salaries & Wages of existing GLWA staff during FY 2018 for
various reasons (market adjustment, merit raises, promotions, etc.).

•

Increase in Employee Benefits due to the increase in premiums charged for
Calendar Year 2018. The amount of this increase was not known at the time the
FY 2018 budget was prepared.

•

The timing of the filling of vacant staffing positions has varied from that which
was originally budgeted.

 Chemicals – The FY 2018 budget was prepared using history which consisted of certain
years containing high chemical usage. Now that we have FY 2017 behind us, nine
months of data for FY 2018, and new processes in place, we are able to get a better
look at what our chemical costs will be for FY 2018 and beyond.
 Contractual Services – Certain contracts were not known about at the time the FY 2018
budget was prepared. This has resulted in several budget amendments, both recorded
and pending, to the category of Contractual Services. In addition, it is important to note
that there are several contracts that are being initiated during the fourth quarter which
will result in a higher spend rate than during the previous three quarters. Having noted
that, Contractual Services is an area that is being closely reviewed for potential
reallocation opportunities.
 Capital Program Allocation – This is a category that is under review. The FY 2018
budget was prepared based a prior methodology for recording time allocated to capital
projects. A more conservative approach is now being taken to focus on those
individuals who are working directly on the capital projects rather than those who are

Page 21

 working indirectly. In addition, there are processes being implemented to improve the
tracking and reporting of the GLWA staff members’ direct hours. Both scenarios have
resulted in a decrease to the budget for the Capital Program Allocation contra accounts.
 Shared Services – The shared services budget was prepared based on the agreements
as they were interpreted, before actual invoices were issued and the true-ups (actual
costs incurred as compared to the estimates billed) analyzed. The FP&A and Shared
Services teams are working together to review the billing trends for FY 2016 & FY 2017
to get a better projection for FY 2018 and beyond (a copy of the working Shared
Services document follows the Budget to Actual table).
 Unallocated Reserves –
•

There is a correction that needs to be recorded to a previously posted budget
amendment which will reclass $7,201,100 from the O&M Unallocated Reserves
to the Improvement & Extension fund. This reclass will bring the O&M budget
back in line with the Original Board Adopted Budget of $329,512,800.

•

The posting of the pending budget amendments will result in a shortfall in
the O&M Unallocated Reserves of approximately $23,800,000 (shown as
$23,827,800 in the table on the following page) of which $15,943,900 is
primarily due to the capital program adjustment, $4,517,800 for shared
services, and $3,276,600 for personnel adjustments. For purposes of this
report, the entire shortfall is being reallocated to the Contractual Services
category. The FP&A team is working with the GLWA Budget Managers to
identify the correct categories for the reallocation of this shortfall.

Despite the need for the additional budget amendments and the reallocation of the O&M
Unallocated Reserves’ shortfall, GLWA continues to operate within the Operations &
Maintenance FY 2018 Board Adopted Budget. A word of caution: the fourth quarter expenses
may be higher in certain categories such as chemicals, utilities, and personnel. The variances
we are seeing in the various categories, however, causes us to re-visit the Five-Year Financial
Plan as vacancies are being filled, new staffing needs arise, and new initiatives are being
undertaken. Given that GLWA is now at the beginning of its third year of operations, we
anticipated that there would be these types of budget revisions as the historical information was
limited.
