Page 1 of 7

 BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 54, Article XII of the Cook
County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE XII. REPLICA FIREARMS AND PAINT PELLET GUNS
Sec. 54-420. Replica guns.
(a) Title. This division shall be known and may be cited as the “Replica Firearms and Paint Pellet Gun Ordinance”
of Cook County, Illinois.
(b) Purpose and Policy. Like other major cities across America, the Cook County Government faces the ongoing
challenge of combating the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Many imitation and replica firearms are
manufactured in a manner that makes them nearly indistinguishable from working firearms; and imitation and
replica firearms pose the greatest threat to mistakes in the use of force by police. Several foreign manufactured
mobile phone cases which have the appearance of 9mm handguns have recently appeared for sale on several online
retail outlets, and the one "Gun Grip Case" features the grip of an actual gun and trigger guard attached to the
housing of a phone cover. When placed in a pocket, this product is indistinguishable from a working handgun. Law
enforcement officials from New York, New Jersey and Michigan among others have advised people not to purchase
or use this product. Numerous incidents have been reported by law enforcement officers across the country who
have mistakenly identified imitation or replica firearms to be working handguns.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, possess, conceal, use, sell, give away or otherwise transfer, or
to engage in the business of selling or to exhibit for sale, a replica firearm, paint pellet or paint pellet gun in Cook
County, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
(d) Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
Paint pellet means a pellet or projectile of paint which explodes upon impact.
Paint pellet gun means any firearm, toy firearm or toy in the nature of a firearm which is powered by compressed
gas and which fires paint pellets.
Replica firearm means any device, object or facsimile made of plastic, wood, metal or any other material, that a
person could reasonably perceive as an actual firearm but that is incapable of being fired or discharged, including,
but not limited to mobile phone cases, lighters, and cameras, except that the term shall not include any replica of an
antique firearm. Each such replica firearm shall have as an integral part, permanently affixed, a blaze orange plug
inserted in the barrel of such replica firearm. Such plug shall be recessed no more than six millimeters from the
muzzle end of the barrel of such firearm.
(e) Exceptions. The manufacture, marketing, distribution, sale and possession of replica firearms are permitted if
the devices are manufactured, marketed, distributed, sold or held solely for subsequent transportation in intrastate,
interstate or foreign commerce. Such devices shall not be displayed to the general public or sold for other use in the
city. The use or possession of a paint pellet or paint pellet gun is permitted if the use or possession is solely within
premises licensed as a public place of amusement; or if the use or possession is solely for the purpose of transporting
the paint pellet or paint pellet gun to or from those premises by the licensee or agent or employee of the licensee,
or by a common carrier, for purposes of initial delivery, repair or disposal of the paint pellet or paint pellet gun.
(f) Violation. Any person who violates the provisions of this section, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less
than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense. Any such violation may also be punishable as a misdemeanor
by incarceration in a penal institution other than a penitentiary for up to six months under the procedures set forth
in Section 1-2-1.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code as amended, and in the Illinois Code of Criminal Procedure,
Illinois Revised Statutes, Chapter 38, Sections 100-1 et seq. (1985), as amended, in a separate proceeding. All
actions seeking the imposition of fines only shall be filed as quasi-criminal actions subject to the provisions of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, Illinois Revised Statutes, Chapter 110, Section 1-101, et seq. (1985), as amended.

 Each purchase, use, sale, gift or transfer of any such replica firearm, paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed
a separate and distinct offense, and each day a person unlawfully engages in the business of selling or exhibits for
sale any such replica firearm, paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
A motion was made by Commissioner Boykin, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, that this Ordinance
be amended. The motion carried by the following vote:
Aye: Chairman García, Vice Chairman Moore, Commissioners Arroyo, Boykin, Butler, Daley, Fritchey,
Goslin, Morrison, Murphy, Schneider, Silvestri, Sims, Steele and Suffredin (15)
Absent: Commissioners Gainer and Tobolski (2)
