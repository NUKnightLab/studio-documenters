SCOPE: DEMOLISH EXISTING GARAGE, ERECT NEW GARAGE/ENTERTAINMENT COMPLEX
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 2224 Seminole Street is a 2 ½-story single-family residence constructed in 1912. The structure
is clad in painted lapped wood siding and variegated red brick. The house features wood and cast stone detailing. The
side-gabled roof is covered in dark gray asphalt shingles and includes two large chimneys, one at each end of the
facade. The rear elevation of the roof contains two small dormers. A small portico makes up the front entrance of the
building and is centered within the symmetrical front façade.
A detached two-car garage exists behind the house at the northeast corner of the lot and is clad in red brick. The
garage features a gambrel roof which is covered in dark gray asphalt shingles. Additionally, a chimney as well as a
small shed wing is located at the north (side) elevation of the garage. Two original window openings, now infilled
with glass block, exist at the south (side) elevation facing the rear yard. Each opening features a brick arch at the top
of the opening. The garage is accessed via a concrete driveway located directly to the north of the house.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• Sanborn maps show a garage (of the same footprint of what is currently existing) in the 1915-1951 map
• Building permit records show a permit for a “dwelling” in 1912 and a permit for a “dwelling & garage” in
1919
• The existing garage is visible from the right-of-way, however, the majority of the rear yard area is not visible
from the right-of-way.
• Per the architect’s structure assessment (pp. 4-5), the “poor” condition of the southwest corner of the garage
may be due either to water infiltration or foundation failure.
• The damage to the southwest corner of the garage appears salvageable through repairs to localized
conditions without resorting to wholesale demolition.
• The tree located at the southwest corner is likely responsible for some portion of damage to the garage.
However, damage caused by the tree was reasonably foreseeable and should have been addressed prior to
becoming a problem. Neglect of maintenance should not become a rationale for demolition of an entire
building.
• Per the proposed floor plan of the new building, an addition to the existing garage (providing the additional
desired uses) could be made at the same time as the structural repairs to the southwest corner.
• Staff concurs that repairs to the shed area at the north (side) elevation may be extensive enough to require
significant demolition and reconstruction of that specific element.
• In May, 2018, HDC staff approved the replacement of a chain link fence with a 6’ tall two-tone gray vinyl
privacy fence.
ISSUES
• The proposed new two-tone gray vinyl fencing does not meet the Commission’s Fence & Hedge
Guidelines as an appropriate fencing material.
• Although it is unknown as to whether the garage was constructed with the house, it is of historic age.
• The existing garage is a contributing character-defining feature of the property and maintains high
material integrity despite the structural assessment identifying a lack of structural integrity.
• Partial demolition of the shed portion of the existing garage may be appropriate.
RECOMMENDATION
1. Recommendation for the following scope items:
• Demolition of the existing garage in its entirety
• Erection of new garage structure
• Install new 6’ two-tone gray vinyl fence along the alley
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, destroys historic materials that characterize the historic property. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission deny a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as proposed as it does

 not meet the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
2. Recommendation for all scope items other than what is listed in recommendation #1 above and #3 below:
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, does not destroy historic materials that characterize the historic
property. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission approve a Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as
proposed as it meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:

2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its
environment.
3. Regarding the following scope items:
• Removal of (2) trees at rear yard
o (1) located at the southeast corner of the lot
o (1) located approximately mid-yard on the south edge of the lot

Staff is choosing to withhold a recommendation as more information is needed in order to understand the current
condition of the trees and the reason they need to be removed.

ARCHITECTURAL SIGNIFICANCE
THE NEIGHBORHOOD:
Indian Village is a historic, affluent neighborhood located on Detroit's east side, bound to the north and south
by Mack Avenue and East Jefferson Avenue, respectively, along the streets of Burns, Iroquois, and Seminole.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
The district has a number of architecturally-significant homes built in the early 20th century. A number of the
houses have been substantially restored, and many others well kept up. Bordering Indian Village to the west is
West Village, with additional historic homes, townhouses and apartments.
Many of the homes were built by prominent architects, such as Albert Kahn, Louis Kamper and William
Stratton, for some of the area's most prominent citizens, such as Edsel Ford. A lot of homes are very large, with
some over 12,000 square feet. Many have a carriage house, with some of those being larger than an average
suburban home. Some of the houses also have large amounts of Pewabic Pottery tiles.
Indian Village has very active community organizations, including the Indian Village Association, Men's
Garden Club & Women's Garden Club. The neighborhood contains many historic homes including that of
automotive entrepreneur Henry Leland, founder of Lincoln and Cadillac, who resided at 1052 Seminole St.
THE HOME:
The Alfed Bell Moran House as built in 1912, based on City of Detroit records.
Herman & Simons were the architect for 2224 Seminole. Aloys Frank Herman & Howard Thomas Simons
designed seven other homes in Indian Village Historic District, according to historicdetroit.org.
Alfred Bell Moran, a direct descendant of the French Moran family, some of the earliest settlers and landowners
in Detroit, was the Secretary of the Peninsula Stove Company. Prior to becoming the Motor City, Detroit was
known as the Stove Capital of the world.
Other notable residents include Frederick Sweet Stearns (1923-1924) who was the Vice President and Treasurer
of the Frederick Stearns Pharmaceuticals Company, which was started by his grandfather in 1856. The original
manufacturing building is now “The Lofts at Rivertown” on East Jefferson.
Robert Cabel Graham and his wife, the former Bertha E. Hack, lived here 1925-1929. Robert Graham was one
of the three Graham brothers of the Graham-Paige Motors Corporation.
ARCHITECTURAL STYLE:
The home and detached garage were both designed in the Colonial Revival style. The garage is a one-story
brick structure symmetrical in appearance, with its two garage door openings facing the rear of the home. There
is a chimney on the north side with a shed wing. The shed may or may not be original to the structure. The shed
and garage have separate person entry doors. The main garage roof is a gamble roof and the shed has a three
sided mansard roof. There are window openings on the south side of the garage that have been filled in with
glass block. The shed has one window.

2. EVLAUATION OF RESOURCE CONDITIONS:
Structural Assessment
Collapsed or off foundation:
• Poor Condition. The shed show signs of the exterior wall shifting and is in need of reconstruction
(Picture #8, #15-#19).
• Poor Condition. The CMU alley screen wall leaning towards the alley and is in danger of collapsing.
(Pictures #20 and #21).
Leaning / other structural damage:
• Poor Condition. The shed foundation and walls showing signs of imminent failure (Pictures #4, #5, #15#19).
• Poor Condition. The southwest corner of the garage exterior brick wall is cracking. The cracking is
telegraphing the entire width of the wall. Evidence of this is shown on the interior plaster wall which has
the same wall cracking location and pattern (Pictures #9 and #10). It is unclear if this damage was
caused by water infiltration or the foundation failing at the southeast corner of the garage.
• Poor Condition. The CMU screen wall is also showing signs of imminent failure (Pictures #20 and #21)
Damage to window / door
• Poor Condition. The shed shifting wall and foundations have damaged the window and door openings
making them inoperable. (Pictures #4, #5, #15-#19).
4

 REPORT
Chimney, parapet, or other falling hazards
• Good Condition. The Chimney is intact
• Poor condition. The CMU screen wall is leaning out and showing signs of imminent failure (Pictures
#20 and #21)
Roof damage
• Good Condition. There are newer asphalt roof, metal flashing, gutters and downspouts (Pictures #1, #2)
Foundation damage:
• Poor Condition. The shed show signs of failure with walls cracking and door and window shifting
(Pictures #8, #15-#19).
• Poor Condition. The southwest corner of the garage foundation is failing with signs of brick cracking
(Pictures #9 and #10).
• Poor Condition. Existing tree is causing damage to the south garage foundation (Pictures #5 and #6)
• Poor Condition. Existing tree is causing damage to the CMU screen wall and is leaning out over the
alley right of way (Pictures #20 and #21)
Damaged cladding, brick:
• Fair Condition. The brick masonry has been tuck-pointed in places. Additional tuck-pointing is needed
including reconstruction of the shed walls and openings (Pictures #1-#4,#8, #9, #15-#18)
Damaged electrical / mechanical systems
• Good Condition. The electrical has been upgraded with a new panel. There is no existing mechanical or
plumbing systems in the garage.
Landscape damage
• Poor Condition. There are three maple trees in the rear yard causing damage. The first tree is
approximately 20” in diameter and is located next to the south wall of the garage. The tree is causing
damage to the garage wall and foundation, cracking the alley CMU screen wall and foundation and
possible damage to the sanitary line beneath the tree. (Pictures #5, #6). The second tree is
approximately 12” in diameter and is located next to the alley CMU wall. The tree and its root system
has pushed out the wall and will collapse in the alley right of way (Pictures #20, #21). The third tree is
approximately 30” in diameter and is the largest and most mature tree on the property. The tree and its
long branches are a threat to the house to the garage and the neighbor’s property.
Estimate Building Damage: 60% of the structure
3. LIMITATION OF VISUAL INSPECTIONS:
There were not limitations in surveying and making assessments for this report.

 REPORT
4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
The investigation, documentation and this report find the following elements as Critically Deficient. There are
advanced deterioration and imminent structural failure present:
•
•
•
•
•

Shed wing structure on the north side of garage is in structural failure.
Brick masonry load bearing walls needs replacement and or tuck-pointing.
Southwest corner of garage is in advanced deterioration with signs of foundation failure.
Alley screen CMU wall and foundation is in imminent structural failure.
Large mature trees in the rear yard are undermining foundations, putting masonry walls into structural
failure and causing problems with the existing sanitary line.

The professional recommendation is to replace the detached garage, alley wall, trees and repair or replace the
sanitary line. The estimated cost to replace as-built is $230,000.

HELPFUL INFORMATION
1.

Plan Types
Endura Series Columns are as unique as the different types of installations that are available. We offer our Endura Series Columns in a wide variety of "Plan Types". These "Plan Types" are the style and type
of shaft, capital, and base you will receive. If you are using them as half columns against a wall, you would want to select a "D" plan type for round or "F" plan type for square. This would give you a column
that could be installed against a wall. These are the most common plan types, however, we can do custom plan types if your project requires it.

2.

Trimming from Bottom of Shaft
i. w/o Interfering w/Taper:
This is the amount that can be trimmed, from the bottom of the column, before it will cut into the taper of the column.
w/base: The base of the column "wraps" around the column shaft. If you are using a base, we recommend this dimension as the maximum amount to trim off the column shaft.
ii. w/o Interfering w/Flutes or Panels:
This is the amount that can be trimmed, from the bottom of the column, before it will cut into the fluting or panels of the column.
w/base: The base of the column "wraps" around the column shaft. If you are using a base, we recommend this dimension as the maximum amount to trim off the column shaft.

We have taken our years of experience and knowledge of the gate industry and applied it towards the design and
construction of our residential / light industrial line of gates. Manufactured exclusively for Gate Depot, using our exacting
speci cations, these ready-to-ship steel gates are classical designs which offer security at a great price.
The driveway gate is paired with the Platinum Access Systems ACTP715, a high-end automatic, linear arm gate opener.
This operator has a wide range of features comparable with top brand names such as a 24VDC instant reversing,

 REPORT
continuous duty motor. The Platinum Access Systems ACTP715 is well engineered and fabricated out of high-grade
material.
The control cabinet is constructed of durable, powder coated aluminum and the control board accommodates all
standard gate accessories such as photo eyes, loop detectors, keypads, magnetic and electric locks, warning lights,
landscape lights, and timers. It includes a receiver and 2 key chain style remotes.
The Platinum Access Systems ACTP715 uses standard 120/220VAC power input and includes a step-down transformer
to 24VDC for a solar ready installation. The 24VDC operating voltage enables the unit to operate during primary power
failure using two 12V batteries (included).
IMPORTANT NOTICE / DISCLAIMER:
- Bi-parting gate individual leaf size may vary up to 1/4”.
- We do not recommend purchasing two single gates to be installed as one bi-parting gate; height may vary up to 1".
- There may be minor imperfections in the powder-coat nish. These will not affect the durability of the gate and if
present, are not signi cantly noticeable.
- Before installing posts in concrete, MEASURE the gate to ensure it is square. Measure from corner to corner, then each
end from top to bottom. Measurements should not vary more than 1/4” - 1/2”.
- Gate width needs to be measured, then add 3-1/2” between posts for a single gate or 4” between posts for double gates.
- Measure All Gates Prior to Installation! Due to manufacturing variables, gates MAY vary in width by 1” - 2”. Measure &
con rm gate width PRIOR to setting posts.
- Shipping includes transporting the gate from our warehouse to the delivery address. It does NOT include lift gate service
or unloading. Be prepared to unload the gate using a forklift with a boom or 3-4 people.
- Gates, as shipped, are designed for use as a swing gate. All gates can be converted for use as slide gates by adding
wheels, track and other hardware. Call us for more information on requirements.

 Sec. 21-2-103. - Indian Village Historic District.
(a)

An historic district, known as the Indian Village Historic District, was established in accordance with the
Resolution of the City Council adopted on June 15, 1971, remained in effect on the date of the enactment of
this article, which was November 5, 1976, and shall be administered in accordance with the provisions of this
article.

(b)

The boundaries of the Indian Village Historic District are:

The area including Burns, Seminole, and Iroquois (both sides) from the center line of Mack Avenue to the center line
of East Jefferson Avenue. (More particularly described the Park Subdivision Lots 1-195, the addition to the Park
Subdivision Lots 196-221, the Assessors Plat of PCs 27 and 180 Lots 1-142, A.M. Henry's Subdivision Lots 1-18, Meredith's
Iroquois Park Subdivision Lots 1-28, Curry Cook Farm Subdivision Lots 9-29, and Assessor Plat of PCs 27 Lots 3-112.)
(c)

The elements of design, as defined in Section 21-2-2 of this Code, shall be as follows:
(1)

Height. Virtually all of the houses in the district have two full stories plus attic or finished third floor
within the roof. These are generally called 2½-story houses. Additions to existing buildings shall be
related to the existing structure. New buildings shall meet the following standards:
a.

The eight adjoining houses on the same face, excluding any houses built since 1930, churches,
schools and commercial structures, shall be used to determine an average height. If eight houses
are not available on the same block face, then one or more houses as close as possible to being
directly across the street from the proposed structure may be used. On East Jefferson Avenue, the
five existing houses shall be used. The height of the two adjoining houses shall be added into the
total twice, with a divisor of ten (seven on East Jefferson Avenue) used to determine the average.
Any new building must have a height of the main roof of at least 80 percent of the resulting
average. In no case shall a new building be taller than the tallest roof height included in the
computation. In determining the height of existing structures and proposed structures, the highest
point of the main roof shall be used, even where towers, cupolas, or other minor elements may be
higher.

b.

The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for
compatibility as the room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the
same process provided for in Subsection (c)(1)a of this section. The proposed new structure shall
have a height at the eaves or cornice, of not less than 90 percent of the average determined from
existing structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be lower
than the lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, or higher than the highest.

(2)

Proportion of buildings' front façades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age, style, and
location in a specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards in Subsection (c)(1) of this
section; proportion will be established by permitting no proposed building or addition to create a front
façade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the façade. Window openings are virtually always taller than wide; several
windows are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window openings are always
subdivided, the most common window type being guillotine sash, whose area are generally further
subdivided by muntins. Façades have approximately 15 percent to 35 percent of their area glazed.
Sunporches with a very high proportion of glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front façades. In buildings derived from classical precedents, voids are
usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly spaced manner within the façade. In examples of other

 styles, especially those of Neo-Tudor and Victorian substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but
usually is a balanced composition.
(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally determined by the
setback from the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot width may vary. Because of
the existence of several subdivisions and their related subdivision and deed restrictions, the placement
of buildings on lots varies from area to area in the district. In the case of very wide properties, two
conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard
space; this occurs only with extremely large houses by district standards. A more typical placement of
houses of average size for the district is at the side of the wide site, placed normally in relation to one of
the adjoining houses. The rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house, and the
entrance is often oriented toward that side yard.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration, entrances and
porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front façade. Other examples display more freedom with
entrance and porch placement, with some having the main entrance at the side. Porches, often
permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at the side of the building.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many are partially or
totally stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost never the sole material.
Wood shingle is occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the second floor level, and never as the
sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile, and wooden and asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood
is almost universally used for window frames and other functional trim, and is used in many examples
for all trim. Because of the existence of several subdivisions and their related deed restrictions, the
exterior textures and materials may vary from block to block in the district.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of the low-relief
pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. The use of
stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces is not unusual. Tile,
slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally,
have little textural interest, even in those types which purport to imitate some other variety.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall surfaces.
Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its natural state, or
painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, wood colors) and asphalt
shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The
classically inspired buildings, particularly Neo-Georgian, generally have woodwork painted white, cream
or in the range of those colors, including putty. Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black.
Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type in the 18th Century or early 19th Century on
similar buildings may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably Neo-Tudor)
generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Half-timbering is
almost always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or Late Victorian examples may have several paint colors
on a single façade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the earth tone family. The original
colors of any house, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that house, and
may provide suggestions for similar houses.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display
classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Areas commonly, but not always, treated are
porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows. Details on Mediterranean style or
vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco. They include arched

 windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of Medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form
of carved wood or carved stone ornament on window frames, door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne or
Late Victorian style buildings tend to have details in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly
embellishing cornices, window frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in
architectural details.
(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A few examples of
the gambrel-type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip types, with subsidiary roofs,
are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist primarily on porches and sunrooms, and other
minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes have relatively small flat sections in the center.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings with their uniform setbacks
within the blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity. Where gaslights are
sufficiently numerous, and where trees in rows have survived in sufficient numbers, minor walls of
continuity are created. Fences across side lots contribute to the major wall of continuity where placed at
the front yard setback line.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment of individual
properties is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk leading to the front entrance,
and sometimes with a walk at the side leading to the rear. Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or
stone, or combinations of those materials. Some front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces
upon which the house stands. These unpaved terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone
retaining walls at the change of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character,
characteristic of the period 1895 to 1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges between
properties, and ornamental front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is
virtually extinct in the district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be
characteristic of the area and period, though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical
choice. Plantings of new trees should be directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows
of large trees on the front yards and tree lawns. Straight side driveways leading from the street to rear
garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the southern portion of the district.
Where alley-facing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a unity to the succession of front
lawns. Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel. Side lots are not uncommon in the district,
and a number of these form a part of the original site plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually
landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a
tennis court. The street right-of-way of 80 feet combined with a pavement width of between 24 and 29
feet creates wide tree lawns or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of the urban
landscape of the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist in portions of the
district. Alleys are frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley-facing garages are common.
Fencing ranges widely in type; fencing in public view was generally designed to compliment the style,
design material, and date of the residence.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of vacant land, a
City park, school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots. Where an original or early
arrangement of a house and grounds included and still includes landscaped lots which form part of the
landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots are significant landscape features.

(15)

Scale of façades and façade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and style to style;
most houses have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of façade elements and
details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the façades. Façade elements have been determined by

 what is appropriate for the style. Large wings at the front are atypical, while small wings at the side,
usually in the form of sunrooms and sunporches, are common. Window sashes are usually subdivided by
muntins, which affect the apparent scale of the windows within the façades.
(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their related
subdivision and deed restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district, though they are
consistent within each block or area. The varying designs of the houses, occasionally with slight setbacks
in the façades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback line in different ways; this creates a slight
variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within each block or area, a wall of continuity is created.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from 50 percent to 12 percent or less in the case of
homes with large yards. Most homes are in the 20 percent to 30 percent range of lot coverage.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the façade. The degree of complexity has been determined by what is typical
and appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have simple, rectangular
façades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as Queen Anne and those of
Medieval inspiration, frequently have façades complicated by gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and
occasionally, turrets.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street, it is not
unusual for an entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot or corner house.
The street façade in these cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street façades. Garages are
frequently oriented either toward an alley or a side street; almost all garages are detached and at the
rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they are at the rear and
are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are generally not visible from the
street.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are
generally symmetrical. Other styles, including the Neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetrical, but balanced
compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. The Indian Village Historic District, with its long, straight streets, its
hierarchy of walls of continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has an urban,
substantial, low density residential character.

 REPORT

Fence and Hedge Guidelines
The uniform pattern and relationships of front lawns, building setbacks
and open spaces, street trees, fencing and sidewalks contribute to a
collective impression of a historic district. When historic landscape
features are removed or relocated, or elements that are not compatible
with the site are introduced, site vistas are destroyed and the historic
character of a district is diminished. One need only recall the great
American elm trees that formed natural green canopies over the
streets of so many Detroit neighborhoods up until the 1950s and how
the disappearance of those trees had impacted the character of those
neighborhoods to understand this concept.

Archival photographs depict the historic character of many Detroit
neighborhoods as they once were. Victorian workmen’s clapboard
cottages and tiny front yards enclosed by wooden picket fences
typified in neighborhoods like Corktown. Solid board fence walls
spanned the narrow spaces between these closely packed houses.
On streets such as Vinewood and Lafayette, deep open yards
surrounded elegant turn of-the-century brick mansions and were
embraced by decorative cast iron fencing, erected close to the
facade around flower gardens, or in great expanse, and at great
expense, around the perimeter of the property, characteristically on
brick foundation
walls running between brick piers. There was never, however, a strong fencing precedent in Detroit
neighborhoods and after the turn of the century, much of the iron went the way of the war effort. What
fencing remained went out of fashion as the Industrial Age introduced newer and more affordable
materials. Attitudes changed and fencing became virtually non-existent after the 1920s, replaced by a
move toward broad green, fenceless expanses. Yet, what little historic fencing remains or the lack of
fencing that exists in our historic districts makes the same contribution as the elm trees did and has the
same impact when removed, relocated or erected without historic precedence.

Today's homeowners in historic districts face challenges that require remedies that often differ from
the historic dictates, i.e. what fencing may or may not have existed. The Design Guidelines for
Fences and Hedges are proposed to offer the homeowner guidance in the introduction of new
construction or replacement with new materials while protecting those elements of a historic district
that have been identified as significant in defining the overall historic character of the neighborhood.
For the purpose of these guidelines, fencing shall mean any living natural planting or man-made
structure, not integral to any building, used as a barrier to define boundaries, screen off, or enclose a
portion of the land surrounding a building.
The recommendations of The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines
for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings must be followed prior to the removal or the replacement or
construction of any fencing element in the landscape of the historic district. Information about The
Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines can be obtained from the Historic District Commission office,
however the key points follow.

 Where Historic Fencing Exists
•

Do not remove historic fencing, walls, or other fence elements.

•

Retain historic fencing materials including metal, brick, stone and
wood and the masonry of walls. Maintain and preserve all historic
features, including rails, posts and newels, finials, railings, columns
and piers, coping and walls. Care for and appropriately maintaining
historic hedging and living fencing. Each of these elements conveys
architectural and historical character through texture, ornamentation
and design

•

Repair is preferred over replacement. Repair deteriorated sections
of historic fencing and walls with materials of a matching design,
texture, and color whenever possible. Replant areas of historic
hedging with a matching species.

.

•

Replace only portions of fencing exhibiting significant deterioration, leaving all sound portions
intact. Substitute materials, such as aluminum for wrought iron, should be visually and
physically compatible with the remaining historic fencing or wall material and should be
installed only when in-kind replacement is unaffordable.

•

Use materials that match existing sections of historic fencing or walls in material, detail, color,
texture and height when carrying out limited replacement or repair projects. If an exact color or
texture match cannot be made, a simplified design is appropriate.
•

•

For masonry walls, do not replace sections of
historic brick with brick that is substantially stronger.
Repoint with an appropriate mortar mixture that is
no harder than the original historic mixture. Repoint
only those joints that are no longer sound; largescale removal of mortar joints often result in
damage to historic masonry. Match historic joints in
color, texture, joint size and tooling when repointing.

Use historic, pictorial or physical evidence to reconstruct severely deteriorated or missing
fencing, walls, or fencing elements.
• Fencing, walks or other landscape features that use new or salvaged material to create a
conjectural or falsely historical appearance are inappropriate and should not be undertaken.

•

The removal of existing historical fencing should only be undertaken as a last resort. Natural or
architectural fence elements that are slated for reconstruction or replacement should be
photographically documented prior to removal of any historic fabric.

 Historic Hedges or “Living Fences”
Hedges shall abide by the same rules governing other fencing types in historic district for heights and locations.
Furthermore, the selected hedging plants shall be capable of growing at least one foot per year for the first three years,
and shall be cared for so as to maintain a dense screen year-round. The following list of plant types shall be taken as
only a guide for selecting appropriate hedging.

New Fencing - Approval by the Historic Commission
Permits for fence construction must be obtained from the Building and Safety Engineering Department and are subject
to review by the Historic District Commission. The Elements of Design for the historic district of the application
(available from the Historic District Commission Office) will be considered and each application will continue to be
reviewed on a case by case basis.
The Historic District Commission may allow exceptions to the stated guidelines if the Commission views such
exceptions to be beneficial to the overall appropriateness of a fence application proposal.
Consideration will be given to recommendations adopted by certain districts that are not in conflict with established
guidelines and municipal code.
•

Fencing must be properly installed according to City of Detroit codes and regulations.
•

New construction of fences or walls should be designed to minimize impact to
the historic fabric and should be compatible with the site in setback, size and
scale to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

•

New fences or walls should be differentiated from the old and should be
designed to compliment the style, design, color and material of the
historic building(s) and its features.

•

New fencing or walls should be removable without impairing the essential
form and integrity of the historic property.

 Fencing other than lot line fences (e.g. dog runs, etc ... ) shall be located in such a way as to be
concealed from public view from streets and alleys.

•
•

No slats or other material may be inserted or attached to chain link or other open fencing.

Any proposal for the installation of new or replacement fencing shall meet the following application
considerations:

Allowable Types:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Wood –flat board, picket post & rail, etc…. see page 7 for types. Stockade fencing is not allowed. Unpainted/
unfinished wood is not historically appropriate and must be painted or stained a color that complements the
house
Cyclone or chain-link fencing
Twisted wire with wood posts (wire mesh)
Wrought iron, cast iron and aluminum replicating wrought iron
Brick and stone –masonry foundations, piers and fence walls. The material of any masonry wall should be
compatible with that of the building it abuts.
Hedges – size, location, and height must conform to fence size, location, and height. See section entitled
“historic hedges or living fences” on page 3

* A single lot shall contain no more than two types of fencing material.

Allowable Locations:
Side yard and across side lots, at the front face of
the house (set back line)
The side yard alone at the front face of the
house, the back face or at a point between
Rear yard, from the back face of the house to the
rear property line (can be considered with the side
yard as well)
Rear property line or alley line
Front yard fencing is not allowed except on a corner lot and then only from the front face of
the house on the side of the public right of way to the front walk.
Established property line patterns and street and alley widths must be retained.
Front yard and full perimeter fencing will be allowed only in districts where such fencing has been shown to be
contextual in that district’s Element of Design. Front yard fencing is allowed on corner lots along the walk adjacent to
the side lot line from the front face of the house to the front corner (see below)

 Allowable Heights:
6' side lot lines, at the front face of the house
8' rear property line
3’ front yard -- applies only to corner lots on the side of the public right of way, otherwise front yard
fencing is not allowed

Allowable Colors:
The most common colors for historic fencing are: black, white, green, brown
Optionally, the color of the fence could be a color complimenting the colors of the house and comparable to the
colors found in the Detroit Historic Districts Style and Color Guide systems A through F (as available from the
Historic District Commission Staff).

Variances
The Detroit Historic District Commission may allow variance to the previously stated guidelines if the Commission
views such variance as beneficial to the overall appropriateness of a fencing proposal.
The Historic District Commission reserves all rights to amend or update this guideline or to deny the use of
certain fencing if they are deemed inappropriate in any specific location.
Any questions pertaining to this guideline can be directed to the Historic District Commission Staff.
