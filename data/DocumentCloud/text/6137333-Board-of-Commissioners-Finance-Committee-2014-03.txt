keep a record of all Persons who request Bid Documents. The CPO will notify all Persons recorded as having
requested Bid Documents of any changes with respect to such conference or inspection no later than at least 24
hours prior to the original scheduled date and no less than two business days prior to any newly scheduled date
for such conference or inspection.
(d) Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process. From the time the Bid Notice is
issued until the successful Bidder has been recommended to the Board by the CPO, all communications to the
County relating to the Bid must be directed in writing (which may be electronic) only to the CPO, or as
otherwise specified in the Bid Documents. Upon receipt of such a request, the CPO will determine if a response
Page 64 of 193

 will be provided. Any such response shall be provided in an addendum to all Persons requesting the Bid
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, communications may be made to the Office of Contract
Compliance in writing for the purpose of complying with Division 8, Minority and Women-Owned Business
Enterprise Program.
(e) No changes to Bids. No Bid may be changed, amended or supplemented in any way after the date and time for
submission of Bids.
(f) Bid opening. All Bids shall be opened and a record of such Bids shall be made on the date, and at the time and
location as stated in the Bid Notice or as prescribed in an addendum issued by the CPO. All Bids shall be
opened, and the name of the Bidder and the Bid Price shall be read publicly. If it is determined that an error was
made in the public reading of the Bids, the CPO shall notify all Bidders of such error and reconvene the Bid
opening to correct the record as soon as reasonably possible. If the Bids are submitted electronically, no public
reading shall be required so long as a record of the Bids opened is publicly available immediately after the Bids
are opened.
(g) If only one Bid is received. If only one Bid has been submitted, the CPO will determine whether to open the Bid
or return the Bid to the Bidder via certified mail and reissue the Bid Notice or use a different method to make
the Procurement. If the Bid was submitted electronically, and is not opened, it shall be deleted from the
electronic procurement system.
(h) Evaluation of Bids. The CPO shall review, evaluate and tabulate Responsive Bids. In determining the apparent
low Bid, the CPO shall consider the Responsibility of the Bidder and all applicable preferences and incentives
provided in this Procurement Code. The CPO shall then direct the Bids along with the tabulation to the Using
Agency for review. Upon full review of the Bids and Bid tabulations, the Using Agency shall notify the CPO in
writing of its Procurement recommendation, with justification supporting such recommendation. The CPO
shall review the recommendation of the Using Agency, and shall post on the County's website the CPO's
recommended Bid for award.

Bid protest. Any Bidder who reasonably believes that the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive
and Responsible Bidder, or has a complaint about the bid process, may submit a bid protest, in writing, and
directed to the CPO. For all Contracts requiring Board approval, any bid protest must be submitted no later
than three business days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for award. For all
Contracts which can be executed by the CPO, any bid protest must be submitted no later than three business
days after the date upon which the CPO posts the recommended Bid for execution. The bid protest must specify
why the protester believes the recommended Bidder is not the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder, or
why the protestor believes the bid procedure was unfair, including a statement of how the alleged unfairness
prejudiced the protesting Bidder and the action requested of the CPO. A bid protest based on an issue which
could have been clarified through a request for clarification or information pursuant to Section 34-136(d),
Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process, will not be considered if the
protesting Bidder failed to make such request. When a bid protest has been submitted, no further action shall be
taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a decision concerning the bid protest, unless the Using Agency
responds in writing and sufficiently demonstrates that (i) the item to be procured is urgently required and (ii)
failure to make the award promptly will unduly delay delivery or performance or cause other undue harm.
The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any other Bidder
affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based on a lack of
fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the procurement. If the CPO determines that the
recommended Bidder was not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and the CPO may
either recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or re-bid.

Page 65 of 193

website information regarding the Procurement.

(k) Right to reject Bids. The County shall have the right to reject any and all Bids. The CPO is authorized to
exercise this right on behalf of the Board. The CPO shall include a provision in the Bid Documents reserving
the right to reject any and all Bids.

promulgate policies and procedures to implement such Procurements. The CPO is not required to read or
announce such Bids publicly. The CPO shall select the lowest Responsive Bid made by a Responsible Person,
and shall post on the CPO's website information regarding the Procurement.

is appropriate include, but are not limited to: Procurements involving services requiring a high degree of
professional skill where the ability or fitness of the Person plays an important part; Procurements where the
requirements are not clearly known; Procurements where quality rather than quantity is a primary factor; and
Procurements where it is not in the best interest of the County to make price a primary determinative factor. An
RFP process is a competitive process under this Procurement Code, and a Person selected through an RFP
process is not considered a "sole source."

products to meet their demands.
(b) Using Agencies and the CPO shall, whenever practicable, specify in the Contract Documents the use of

women's businesses are provided full and equal opportunity to participate in Contracts.
(b) The Supreme Court of the United States in City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989), has enunciated
certain standards which are necessary to maintain effective affirmative action programs in compliance with
constitutional requirements.
(c) The County is committed to implementing its affirmative action program in conformance with the United
States Supreme Court's decision in City of Richmond v. Croson.
(d) In furtherance of this commitment, and at the direction of the Board, County staff and consultants conducted an
investigation into the scope of any discrimination in County Procurements, and in the award of and
participation in contracts in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which such discrimination or the
effects thereof has denied and continues to deny minority and women's business enterprises equal opportunity
to participate in Procurements and to recommend the appropriate affirmative action steps to be taken to
eliminate any such discrimination and its continuing effects.
(e) Minority and women's businesses continue to be awarded prime contracts and subcontracts in dollar amounts
that are disproportionately lower than the availability of such businesses willing and able to perform Contracts.
Page 88 of 193

 (f) The County's procurement practices in the past have contributed to the above identified underutilization of
minority and women's businesses on Contracts.
(g) Minority and women's businesses continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices in the local
construction industry and economy when competing for Contracts and in seeking subcontracting opportunities
on such Contracts.
(h) The County was a passive participant in the discriminatory practices of businesses which discriminate against
minority and women's businesses by entering into contracts with such businesses.
(i)

Despite its good faith efforts and implementation of previous affirmative action programs, minority and
women's businesses remain at a competitive disadvantage in competing for Contracts and subcontracts.

(j)

Race and gender neutral measures or affirmative action programs without numerical goals have not and are not
likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's businesses in participating in
Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.

(k) The numerical goals for the participation of minority and women's businesses in Contracts are commensurate
with the availability of minority and women's businesses willing and able to perform County work.

success, specific to the type of work the Person performs and documented in the Person's records.
(c) The Person must be managed and cControlled by one or more Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
individual.

and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate charter
provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the Person, including
the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make day-to-day as well as long-term

Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must actually exercise control over the Person's operations,
work, management and policy.

does not depend on its relationship with another Person, and who has the capacity or ability to successfully

purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a Person is independent. In determining whether an
applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with
non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons with normal
industry practice.
(e) The Person The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be Ccertified
only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or for types of work in which the Socially and

operations and work.

Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CCD
as provided by rule may result in decertification.

the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CCD shall be the final arbiter of
all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall remain in effect until the CCD renders

or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal.
(1) The Utilization Plan shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD, and may
include such components as direct PCE participation, indirect PCE participation, and a mentoring

including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD,
CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.

Page 96 of 193

 (b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a Commercially
Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 34-269(b). "Commercially Useful Function" means
the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with the requisite skill and
Expertise.
(1) In the case of a Procurement of goods or equipment, ordering from a manufacturer or distributor for
delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful Function; provided, however, that to
the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices, a PCE subcontractor may enter into
second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or subcontractor subcontracts a significantly
greater portion of the work of the Contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry
practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function.
(2) In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to perform the
services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such Person also performs
significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a Commercially Useful
Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially
Useful Function.
(c 3) A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE
participation.
(d4) When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified PCE and
the Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.
(e) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD, CPO
and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as both a MBE and a
WBE on the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the achievement of
the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by another method
described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE's participation may count toward either the MBE or
WBE Goal but not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or more PCEs,
the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set forth in Subsection
34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the following in determining
whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon such written Joint Venture
agreement and the Utilization Plan.
a.
b.
c.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
The extent to which the PCE's proposed participation in the performance of the Contract constitutes a
Commercially Useful Function;
Whether the PCE's share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to their

 d.

Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with respect to the
Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting with, or
purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has made
good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted. In
determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1) Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and agencies to
identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;
(2) Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where appropriate,
breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the availability of
PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these
work items with its own forces;
(3) Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist PCEs in
obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by PCEs;
(4) Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or services
required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to obtain and
review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the Procurement;
(6) Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the Procurement.
Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of PCEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work
selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject
PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as long
as such costs are reasonable;
(7) Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related
assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be inconsistent
with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such items;
(8) Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of the
Procurement permit;
(9) Use the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of
Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;
(10) Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations identified as
assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271
Page 98 of 193

 (b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation by
PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be considered.
For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those professionals
whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1) The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total professional
services and consulting services utilized by the County.
(2) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith" efforts
shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall not be
required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type
of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not subcontracting in a waiver
request.
(32) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services for
such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.
(43) If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals shall be
submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the Person's actual
affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County in future
Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to improve
or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such agreement as a
factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may provide for the Contractor to assist
the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial management, or
providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protege agreement shall satisfy the
following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;
(2) The agreement shall be included in the Utilization Plan; and
(3) The agreement clearly defines the respective responsibilities of the Contractor and the PCE and includes
specific, measurable goals to be attained by both parties through the performance of the agreement. In
order to be a factor in establishing best efforts, the mentor/protege agreement must be for a reasonable
period of time.
(e) The CCD may grant a total or partial waiver based upon the following criteria:
(1) There are not sufficient PCEs capable of providing the supplies, equipment, goods or services required for
the Procurement;
(2) The Procurement cannot reasonably be divided;
(3) The price required by potential PCEs is more than ten percent above competitive levels; and
(4) Any other factor relating to good faith efforts as set forth in the Person's Utilization Plan.
Page 99 of 193

 Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE's participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE's performance of a
Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs' own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the
Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor
or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide service, such as
professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services, shall be counted,
provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar
services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined work
performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d) Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer,
or Distributor, or Regular Dealer shall be counted.
(f) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of supplies, equipment, materials
or goods shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and such fees
are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(g) If a PCE ceases to be Certified during its performance on a Procurement, the dollar value of work
performed under a Contract with that Person after it has ceased to be Certified shall not be counted.
(h) Only the dollar amount actually paid to the PCE shall be counted toward the participation of a PCE.
Sec. 34-273. Review of contract performance.
(a) Compliance with Utilization Plan. The CCD shall review the Contractor's compliance with its Utilization Plan
as necessary during the performance of the Contract. The CCD may establish such requirements for periodic
Contractor reporting on compliance with its Utilization Plan as the CCD determines appropriate and necessary.
A Contractor shall be required to provide any additional requested compliance documentation within 14 days
of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the
Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is
provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this section, providing a
plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if
compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.
(2) If a Contractor fails to provide any documentation required by the CCD, the CCD shall notify the CPO of
such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall have
such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is provided, the Contractor
shall have ten days to cure such default.
Page 100 of 193

 (b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE participation as prime
Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the following special PCE
bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has bid and
where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid on a
Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on
the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as defined
by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual Bids, direct
the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only once to become the
successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally competitive in terms of price
to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing various goods and
services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding, Requests for
Qualifications, and Requests for Proposals among PCE Persons certain commodity, goods or
services areas with sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a competitive price.
The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the Contract
Compliance Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any particular commodity,
goods or services procurement, the Contract Compliance Director will institute the following
procedures:

c.

1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of those commodity,
goods, services, or North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes
appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract Compliance Director, shall
divide procurement in the designated commodity, goods or services areas into economically
feasible sizes to facilitate Bids, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for Proposals or offers
from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts, or submit responses or
proposals, in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County procurement rules for bidding, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for
Proposals, will then become effective and, provided that at least three PCEs Bid or submit
responses or proposals make an offer on the contract, the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, Proposer, or Respondent among the PCEs will receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or submit responses or proposals pursuant to a Request for
Qualifications or Request for Proposalsmake an offer on the Contract, or in the event that if
there is no Responsive Bid or best and final Response or Proposal offer received from a
Responsible PCE, the CPO shall rebid the Contract or reissue the Request for Qualifications or
Request for Proposals not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business Enterprises,
Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting exclusively of Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both. The PCE Contractor on a target market Contract
Page 101 of 193

 may subcontract up to 49 percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to subcontractors
who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.
Sec. 34-274. Prompt payment of PCEs.
If an invoice from a Contractor includes payment for supplies, equipment, goods or services furnished by a
PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services within 3015 days after receipt
of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment, and
shall report the results of such investigations to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller.
Failure of Contractor to comply with this section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of the Contract.

(2) The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by category;
(3) An evaluation of the effectiveness of this division in ensuring equitable participation by PCEs in
Procurements;
(4) An assessment of the continuing need for the Program;
(5) Identification of any enforcement problems; and
(6) Any recommendations with respect to modifying or improving the Program, including discontinuing or
modifying Program Goals in those cases where Minority Business Enterprises and Women's Business

WBE.

Page 109 of 193

 (1) The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real, substantial, and
continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership documents. The
owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and profits
commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) to
acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial and in accord with generally accepted industry
standards. If Expertise is relied upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's
contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a
specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose
Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in the firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as an MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate
charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm, including the
making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the management
or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and Economically Disadvantaged. Such
delegations of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s)
must retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding of, and
managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise directly related to, the firm's operations
and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to intelligently
and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and to make
independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a particular license
or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or
other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, that the
owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other
business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day-to-day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as an MBE or WBE. An independent firmPerson is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another firmPerson, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax
Page 110 of 193

 or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and non-Affiliated.
In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with normal
industry practice.
(e) The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be certified only for
specific types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and control the firmperson's operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge
and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have
an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between the partners and their
relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal certifications by other
entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract
Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CC
Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)

It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its circumstances
affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another agency. Failure to do so
may result in the firm's decertification.

(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.
(kl)

Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.

(lm) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest the denial or
decertification as provided by rule.by submitting a petition for review in a proceeding made pursuant to Part I,
Chapter 2, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, and the Administrative Rules promulgated thereunder.
Page 111 of 193

 (mn)A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six monthsone year after the effective date of
the final decision.
(no) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Firm as provided by
rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for
certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to
eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The
presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until the CC Director renders a final
decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works contracts and
subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the anticipated
subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work on the
contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the
MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide service, such
as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically
required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as
compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When an MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar value of
the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is
performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be counted.
To determine whether an MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be
paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To
perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to materials and
supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material,
installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBE does not perform a
Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which
funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If an MBE or WBE
subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry
practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBE is presumed
not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.

Page 112 of 193

 (e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from an MBE or WBE Manufacturer or
Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of
materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary
industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer shall
be counted.
(fg) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or Regular
Dealer shall be counted.
(fh)If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that
firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(gi) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from which
the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement
of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is
due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the MBE or
WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine whether the
Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the Director will
consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and
written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work
items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability [of] MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and
why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and
WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself
sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
Page 113 of 193

 reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own
organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials,
or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other Contractors in
meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor
fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with
additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project Specific Goals.
Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds
the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent
successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or services
to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the time of
bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in writing of items listed in
the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have been
achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director and User
Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific Goals
become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract, and
detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County or as
otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and books of account,
to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status
of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a
Page 114 of 193

 substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of
the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other
sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the Utilization
Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute an MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the CC Director, Purchasing Agent in consultation with the User Department, approves
such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until
the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by
either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must
negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or
disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement
cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
Failure of performance.
Financial incapacity.
Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where agreement
upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall
be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the County, the
Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific
Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of an MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the Utilization Plan, the
Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the
Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the Utilization Plan and
Page 115 of 193

 must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope
of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they arise to establish
the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted goals,
taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the
County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not made, or that
fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or violation of this
subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-299. Sanctions and penalties.
(a) The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:
(1) Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of a bid, responses
to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts documentation, post-award compliance, or
other Program operations.
(2) Committing any other violations of this subdivision.
(b) A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract, termination of the
contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed nonresponsive in future County solicitations
and contracts as determined by the County's Purchasing Agent, if it is found to have:
(1) Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for certification or
recertification or colluded with others to do so;
(2) Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a bid or proposal or
documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance, or other Program operations or colluded
with others to do so;
(3) Failed in bad faith to fulfill Project Specific Goals, thereby materially breaching the contract; or
(4) Failed to comply in good faith with substantive provisions of this subdivision.
Sec. 34-300. Program review and sunset.
(a) The President and the Board of Commissioners shall receive quarterly and annual reports from the CC Director
detailing the County's performance under the Program.
(b) The President and the Board of Commissioners will review these reports, including the Annual Participation
Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating discrimination in its contracting
activities and marketplace.
(c) Within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, the County will review the operation of the Program
and the evidentiary basis for the Program in order to determine whether the County has a continuing
compelling interest in remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its construction marketplace, and
the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so
that the County will not function as a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace.
(d) This subdivision shall sunset on or before June 30, 2016.

County relating to the Bid must be directed in writing (which may be electronic) only to the CPO, or as
otherwise specified in the Bid Documents. Upon receipt of such a request, the CPO will determine if a response

could have been clarified through a request for clarification or information pursuant to Section 34-136(d),
Communications with the County regarding competitive bidding process, will not be considered if the
protesting Bidder failed to make such request. When a bid protest has been submitted, no further action shall be
taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a decision concerning the bid protest, unless the Using Agency
responds in writing and sufficiently demonstrates that (i) the item to be procured is urgently required and (ii)
failure to make the award promptly will unduly delay delivery or performance or cause other undue harm.
The CPO shall issue a written decision on the bid protest to the protesting Bidder and to any other Bidder
affected by such decision as soon as reasonably practicable. If the bid protest is upheld based on a lack of
fairness in the bid procedure, the CPO shall re-bid the procurement. If the CPO determines that the
recommended Bidder was not Responsive and Responsible, that Bidder shall be disqualified and the CPO may
either recommend the lowest Responsive and Responsible Bidder or re-bid.
Any CPO decision concerning bid protest(s) shall be final. If Board approval and authorization is necessary for
the CPO to execute the Contract, then the CPO shall provide a copy of any bid protest and written decision

or Proposers during the evaluation process or any discussions.

Contract is negotiated, the CPO shall either Execute the Contract, if within the CPO's authority, or forward the
Contract to the Board for approval and authorization for the CPO to execute the Contract. Such request shall

considered if the protestor failed to make such request. When a protest has been submitted, no further action
shall be taken on the Procurement until the CPO makes a decision.

participation in contracts in the metropolitan Chicago economy, the extent to which such discrimination or the

on such Contracts.

likely to eliminate the competitive disadvantage of minority and women's businesses in participating in
Contracts due to discrimination in the local economy.

(a) The Person must be either an MBE or a WBE, or must establish that such Person has individually suffered bias
such that his or her opportunities to form and operate a successful business have been substantially diminished

or WBE may participate in the Program. The applicant has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the
evidence.

continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the Person as reflected in Ownership documents.
(2) The contributions to acquire the Ownership interest must be real and substantial, and in accord with
generally accepted industry standards. If eExpertise is part of the contribution, the Expertise must be of
the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, necessary to the Person's potential
success, specific to the type of work the Person performs and documented in the Person's records.
(c) The Person must be managed and cControlled by one or more Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
individual.
(1) There must not be any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary discretion of the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s). There can be no restrictions through corporate charter
provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially
and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individuals, from making any business decision of the Person, including
the making of obligations or the dispersing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must possess the power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of the Person and to make day-to-day as well as long-term
decisions on management, policy, operations and work.

Disadvantaged individual(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any such Person. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must actually exercise control over the Person's operations,
work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have an overall understanding of, and
managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the Person's
operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged individual(s) must have the ability

Page 157 of 193

 and to make independent decisions concerning the Person's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.

or control a certain type of Person, then the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
possess the license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does

does not depend on its relationship with another Person, and who has the capacity or ability to successfully
undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax or corporate
purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a Person is independent. In determining whether an
applicant is an independent business, the CCD will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Persons in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Persons associated with
non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Persons to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Persons compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Persons with normal
industry practice.
(e) The Person The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be Ccertified
only for specific supplies, equipment, goods or services, or for types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and Ccontrol the Person's
operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge
and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have

Page 158 of 193

 (gh) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract
Compliance. Failure of the Person to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CCD
as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(hi) It is the responsibility of the Certified PCE to notify the CCD of any change in its circumstances affecting its
continued eligibility for the Program. Failure to do so may result in the PCE's decertification.
(ij) The CCD shall decertify a PCE that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.
(jl) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.

the final decision.
(mo) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE pursuant to
procedures established by the CCD. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging
the eligibility of an applicant for Certification or a Certified PCE. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CCD shall be the final arbiter of
all challenges. The presumption that the challenged PCE is eligible shall remain in effect until the CCD renders
a final decision.
Sec. 34-269. Utilization plan; commercially useful function.
(a) Utilization Plan required. The CPO shall include in Contract Documents for Contracts covered by this
Division, a requirement that a Utilization Plan be submitted which either: (i) commits to PCE participation
equal to or greater than the applicable Program Goals or Contract Specific Goals, or (ii) requests a waiver of all
or a portion of a Program Goal or Contract Specific Goal.
(1) The Utilization Plan shall be in such form and contain such information as is required by the CCD, and may
include such components as direct PCE participation, indirect PCE participation, and a mentoring
relationship with one or more PCEs.
(2) The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. Failure to include a Utilization Plan
will render the submission not Responsive.
(3) The CCD shall review and either approve or reject the Utilization Plan. For purposes of evaluation a
Utilization Plan, only PCEs which perform a Commercially Useful Function relative to the supplies,
equipment, goods, services, or types of work for which the PCE has been certified shall be considered.
(4) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD,
CPO and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.

Page 159 of 193

 (b) Commercially Useful Function. To be considered in meeting Goals, a PCE must perform a Commercially
Useful Function, as determined pursuant to this Subsection 34-269(b). "Commercially Useful Function" means
the performance of a distinct element of work required for the Procurement, with the requisite skill and
Expertise.
(1) In the case of a Procurement of supplies, equipment, or goods or equipment, placing an ordering from a
manufacturer or distributor for delivery directly to the Using Agency is not a Commercially Useful
Function; provided, however, that to the extent such practice is consistent with normal industry practices,
a PCE subcontractor may enter into second tier subcontracts. However, if a PCE Contractor or
subcontractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the Contract than would be
expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the PCE shall be presumed not to be performing a
Commercially Useful Function.
(2) In the case of a Procurement of services, a Person which subcontracts with another Person to perform the
services required does not perform a Commercially Useful Function unless such Person also performs
significant supervisory or management responsibilities. A Broker does not fulfill a Commercially Useful
Function. In the case of a Joint Venture partner, each Joint Venture partner must perform a Commercially
Useful Function.
(c3)A PCE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant
in the Contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of PCE participation.
(d4)When a PCE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified PCE and the
Person seeking to include that PCE in its Utilization Plan, may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.
(e) Once a Utilization Plan has been approved, the Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan,
including substituting PCEs named in the Utilization Plan, without the prior written approval of the CCD, CPO
and the Using Agency. The CCD shall promulgate procedures for changes to the Utilization Plan.
Sec. 34-270. Methods to achieve goals and compliance.
A Person may achieve the applicable Contract Specific Goals in any one or more of the methods set forth
below. The same PCE, whether as a contractor, subcontractor or supplier, cannot be utilized as both a MBE and a
WBE on the same Contract.
(1) PCE as prime Contractor. An MBE or WBE may count its own participation toward the achievement of
the applicable MBE or WBE goal. Such PCE will be required to meet the other goals by another method
described herein. If a WBE is also a MBE, such WBE's participation may count toward either the MBE or
WBE Goal but not both.
(2) Joint Venture with one or more PCE. Where a Person engages in a Joint Venture with one or more PCEs,
the Utilization Plan shall include a written agreement at least the information set forth in Subsection
34-384(ii)1 through 4 [(2)a. through d.] below. The CCD shall consider the following in determining
whether the proposed Utilization Plan satisfies the Program Goals based upon such written Joint Venture
agreement and the Utilization Plan.
a.
b.
c.

Each Joint Venture partner's initial capital investment;
The extent to which the PCE's proposed participation in the performance of the Contract constitutes a
Commercially Useful Function;
Whether the PCE's share in the risks and profits of the Joint Venture is proportional to their
ownership interest;
Page 160 of 193

 d.

Whether the PCE will have duties, responsibilities, management Control and risk with respect to the
Joint Venture in proportion to its ownership interest;

(3) Subcontracting. A Person may achieve the Contract Specific Goals by means of subcontracting with, or
purchasing from one or more PCEs.
Sec. 34-271. Request for a total or partial waiver; good faith efforts.
(a) In reviewing a partial or total request for waiver of a Goal, the CCD shall determine whether a Person has made
good faith efforts to meet the applicable Goals and to what extent the waiver request should be granted. In
determining whether a Person has made Good faith efforts, the CCD will consider whether the Person has
taken the following actions:
(1) Review lists of PCEs maintained by the County and other State and local governments and agencies to
identify qualified PCEs for solicitation for Bids;
(2) Divide Procurement requirements into small tasks or quantities. This shall include, where appropriate,
breaking out Contract work items into economically feasible units, consistent with the availability of
PCEs, to facilitate PCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these
work items with its own forces;
(3) Adjust any insurance requirements imposed by the Person seeking PCEs, or otherwise assist PCEs in
obtaining any required insurance, where economically feasible, to encourage participation by PCEs;
(4) Make timely attempts to contact PCEs providing the type of supplies, equipment, goods or services
required for the Procurement; and provide them with a convenient and timely opportunity to obtain and
review all information concerning the Procurement necessary to enable such PCE to respond;
(5) Follow up initial contacts of PCEs to determine if they are interested participating in the Procurement;
(6) Negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis with PCEs to enable them to participate in the Procurement.
Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of PCEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work
selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached. The Contractor may not reject
PCEs as being unqualified without sound reasons. That there may be some additional costs involved in
finding and using PCEs is not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Goals, as long
as such costs are reasonable;
(7) Make efforts to assist interested PCEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related
assistance or services, where appropriate; provided, however, that such efforts shall not be inconsistent
with the requirement that the PCE be responsible for actually obtaining and paying for such items;
(8) Establish delivery schedules which will encourage participation by PCEs, where the requirements of the
Procurement permit;
(9) Use the services and assistance of the CCD's staff, the Small Business Administration, the Office of
Minority Business Enterprises of the U.S. Department of Commerce;
(10) Timely notify appropriate community and minority and women's business organizations identified as
assist agencies of the opportunity for participation in the Procurement;
(11) Demonstrate to the CCD that no PCE exists with which a mentor/protege relationship could be
established, as described in Section 34-271
Page 161 of 193

 (b) In determining whether a Bidder or Respondent has made Good Faith Efforts, the levels of participation by
PCEs set forth in Utilization Plans submitted by other Persons for the same Procurement may be considered.
For example, if the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent fails to meet the Contract Specific Goals, but
meets or exceeds the average PCE participation obtained by other Bidders or Respondents, this may be
evidence that the apparent successful Bidder or Respondent made Good Faith Efforts.
(c) Where the County requires professional services, the County must be able to call upon those professionals
whose particular training and experience are most beneficial to the County.
(1) The County sets an annual "best efforts" goal of 35 percent PCE participation for the total professional
services and consulting services utilized by the County.
(2) A Utilization Plan shall be required, and if a waiver or partial waiver is requested, "good faith" efforts
shall be demonstrated as set forth in Section 34-271; provided, however, that such Persons shall not be
required to attempt to subcontract with PCEs if subcontractors would not typically be utilized for the type
of Procurement. In such cases, the Person shall document the reasons for not subcontracting in a waiver
request.
(32) The Contractor will endeavor to maximize use of PCEs for supplies, equipment, goods or services for
such Contractor's business operations not specifically for the Procurement.
(43) If such Person is required to have or has an affirmative action plan and goals, such plan and goals shall be
submitted with their Utilization Plan. The CCD shall compare such plan and goals with the Person's actual
affirmative action achievements and such achievements may be considered by the County in future
Procurements.
(d) Mentor/protege agreements. Where a Contractor enters into mentor/protege agreement with a PCE to improve
or develop certain aspects of the business of the PCE, the CCD shall evaluate the effect of such agreement as a
factor in determining good faith efforts. The mentor/protege agreement may provide for the Contractor to assist
the PCE in such areas as technical aspects of the PCE's business, improving financial management, or
providing on-the-job training. To constitute good faith efforts, the mentor/protege agreement shall satisfy the
following requirements.
(1) The PCE performs a Commercially Useful Function;

 Sec. 34-272. Calculating PCE participation.
In calculating a PCE's participation, only dollar amounts commensurate with a PCE's performance of a
Commercially Useful Function may be counted.
(a) The dollar value of that portion of a Procurement that is performed by the PCEs' own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies, materials and equipment furnished by the PCE for the
Procurement, whether purchased or leased (except to the extent purchased or leased from the Contractor
or the Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The dollar amount of fees or commissions charged by a PCE for providing a bona fide service, such as
professional, technical, consultant, managerial, insurance brokerage or surety services, shall be counted,
provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar
services.
(c) When a PCE is a Joint Venture partner, only the dollar value of the distinct, clearly defined work
performed by the PCE with its own forces, shall be counted.
(d) Only the dollar value must be commensurate with the work the PCE actually performs.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer,
or Distributor, or Regular Dealer shall be counted.

of request by the CCD.
(1) If the CCD determines that the Contractor has failed to comply with its Utilization Plan, the CCD shall
notify the CPO of such failure. The CPO shall then send notice of default to the Contractor, and the
Contractor shall have such time to cure the default as is provided in the Contract. If no such period is
provided, the Contractor shall have ten days to cure such default. For purposes of this section, providing a
plan for bringing the Contract into compliance with the Utilization Plan may constitute a cure, if
compliance cannot reasonably be achieved within the applicable cure period, and if compliance is
achieved in accordance with such plan.

 (b) Bid and target market programs. To address more specifically the barriers to PCE participation as prime
Contractors in County work, the CCD may recommend to the CPO to institute the following special PCE
bidding provisions, following determination of the appropriateness of such provisions.
(1) In connection with the award of a Contract subject to competitive bidding on which a PCE has bid and
where the PCE is bidding on the item in question for the first time; and has never successfully bid on a
Cook County purchasing contract, the Contract Compliance Director may, at the opening of the bids on
the item, compare the PCE Bid with the lowest Bid, and, if the PCE's Bid is closely competitive as defined
by guidelines to be established by the Contract Compliance Director with that of lowest actual Bids, direct
the CPO to declare the PCE the successful Bidder. A PCE may use this procedure only once to become the
successful Bidder on any particular item. Thereafter, the PCE must be totally competitive in terms of price
to be the successful Bidder.
(2) The Contract Compliance Director shall develop and coordinate a target market program as follows:
a.

The Contract Compliance Director shall review the availability of PCEs providing various goods and
services and shall identify for inclusion in a potential program for bidding among PCE Persons
certain commodity areas with sufficient PCE availability to ensure that the County receives a
competitive price. The Contract Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and
recommendations to the Contract Compliance Committee;
To ensure that the County receives a competitive price, the Contract Compliance Director shall
review the availability of PCEs providing various supplies, equipment, goods and services, and shall
identify areas with sufficient PCE availability for inclusion in a potential program for bidding,
Requests for Qualifications, and Requests for Proposals among PCE Persons. The Contract
Compliance Director shall report his/her findings and recommendations to the Contract Compliance
Committee;

b.

Upon a determination by the CCD that such a program is advisable for any particular
commoditysupplies, equipment, goods or services procurement, the Contract Compliance Director
will institute the following procedures:
1.

The Contract Compliance Director will notify the CPO of identification of those
commoditysupplies, equipment, goods, services, or North American Industry Classification
Standard (NAICS) codes appropriate for a target market program;

2.

To the extent practicable, the CPO, with the aid of the Contract Compliance Director, shall
divide procurement in the designated commoditysupplies, equipment, goods or services areas
into economically feasible sizes to facilitate Bids, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for
Proposals or offers from PCEs and shall designate contracts to be offered under the target
market program;

3.

The CPO shall offer PCEs the opportunity to bid on such contracts, or submit responses or
proposals, in a limited competition;

4.

All standard County procurement rules for bidding, Requests for Qualifications, or Requests for
Proposals, will then become effective and, provided that at least three PCEs Bid or submit
responses or proposals make an offer on the contract, the lowest Responsive and Responsible
Bidder, Proposer, or Respondent among the PCEs will receive the contract;

5.

In the event less than three PCEs Bid or submit responses or proposals pursuant to a Request for
Qualifications or Request for Proposalsmake an offer on the Contract, or in the event that if
there is no Responsive Bid or best and final Response or Proposal offer received from a
Page 164 of 193

 Responsible PCE, the CPO shall rebid the Contract or reissue the Request for Qualifications or
Request for Proposals not subject to the target market program.

Participation in the target market program shall be limited to Minority Business Enterprises,
Women's Business Enterprises and Joint Ventures consisting exclusively of Minority Business
Enterprises, Women's Business Enterprises or both. The PCE Contractor on a target market Contract
may subcontract up to 49 percent of the dollar value of the target market Contract to subcontractors
who are not Minority Business Enterprises or Women's Business Enterprises.

PCE, Contractor shall pay such PCE for such supplies, equipment, goods or services within 3015 days after receipt
of payment from the County. The CCD shall investigate any complaint or charge of excessive delay in payment, and
shall report the results of such investigations to the Contract Compliance Committee and to the County Comptroller.
Failure of Contractor to comply with this section 34-388 shall constitute a material breach of the Contract.
Sec. 34-275. Reporting and review.
The CCD shall report to the Board on an annual basis with respect to the following:
(1) The percentage of the total dollar amount of Procurements for such year actually received by PCEs;
(2) The number of MBEs and WBEs available for participation in Procurements, by category;

Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law, County ordinance or
other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or credential, that the
owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or other
business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day-to-day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as an MBE or WBE. An independent firmPerson is one whose
viability does not depend on its relationship with another firmPerson, and who has the capacity or ability to
successfully undertake and complete the relevant work. Recognition of an applicant as a separate entity for tax
Page 173 of 193

 or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is independent and non-Affiliated.
In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with normal
industry practice.
(e) The CCD shall certify only Persons that meet all the above criteria. An applicant shall be certified only for
specific types of work in which the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and
Expertise to manage and control the firmperson's operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and non-Certified Firms,
provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE. To be considered an
eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified Firm, with a share in the
capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture which is equal to its
ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital, efforts, skill and knowledge
and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract. Joint Ventures must have
an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the relationships between the partners and their
relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal certifications by other
entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines that the certification
standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of Contract
Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation with the CC
Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i)

It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its circumstances
affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another agency. Failure to do so
may result in the firm's decertification.

(j)

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.

(k) Disqualification pursuant to Division 4 of the Procurement Code shall create a prima facie case for
decertification by the County. The challenged PCE shall have the burden of proving that its County
certification should be maintained.
(l)

Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the County. The
challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be maintained.

(lm) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest the denial or
decertification as provided by rule.by submitting a petition for review in a proceeding made pursuant to Part I,
Chapter 2, Article IX, Administrative Hearings, and the Administrative Rules promulgated thereunder.
Page 174 of 193

 (mn)A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six monthsone year after the effective date of
the final decision.
(no) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Firm as provided by
rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the eligibility of an applicant for
certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the complainant. Such challenges to
eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the final arbiter of all challenges. The
presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect until the CC Director renders a final
decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works contracts and
subcontracts shall be 24 percent for MBEs and ten10 percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the anticipated
subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to date.
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE's own forces shall be
counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the work on the
contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies and equipment the
MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide service, such
as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or insurance specifically
required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is reasonable and not excessive as
compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When an MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total dollar value of
the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's contract that is
performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be counted.
To determine whether an MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the County will
evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE or WBE is to be
paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and other relevant factors. To
perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be responsible, with respect to materials and
supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material,
installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBE does not perform a
Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which
funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBE participation. If an MBE or WBE
subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry
practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBE is presumed
not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this
presumption.

Page 175 of 193

 (e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from an MBE or WBE Manufacturer or
Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of
materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary
industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Manufacturer shall
be counted.
(fg) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or Regular
Dealer shall be counted.
(fh)If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE Construction
Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a contract with that
firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(gi) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBE shall not be
counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all subcontractors from which
the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have been established, its achievement
of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is
due.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that the MBE or
WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine whether the
Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination, the Director will
consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and
written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract. The
Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the plans,
specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation.
The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the likelihood that
the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work
items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when the
Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's
responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of
the work or material needs consistent with the availability [of] MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of the
information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting; and
why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and
WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities.
That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself
sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
Page 176 of 193

 reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own
organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or insurance as
required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials,
or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government-sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other Contractors in
meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent successful Contractor
fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably questioned whether, with
additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met the Project Specific Goals.
Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds
the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent
successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials, equipment or services
to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value shall be due at the time of
bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and the
letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in writing of items listed in
the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment listed
participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(g) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals have been
achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the CC Director and User
Department shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC Director shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be rejected. A
Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific Goals
become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the contract, and
detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to the County or as
otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall monitor subcontractor
participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely access to the Contractor's
books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns and records and books of account,
to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status
of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a
Page 177 of 193

 substitute for, any other provision allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of
the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named in the
Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User
Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a breach of
contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of the executed
contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract penalties or other
sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the Utilization
Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute an MBE or WBE
subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces
unless and until the CC Director, Purchasing Agent in consultation with the User Department, approves
such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until
the Director, Purchasing Agent and the User Department have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by
either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The Contractor must
negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or
disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement
cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
Failure of performance.
Financial incapacity.
Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where agreement
upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any denial, shall
be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the County, the
Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific
Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of an MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the Utilization Plan, the
Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may seek the
assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the
Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a
non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the Utilization Plan and
Page 178 of 193

 must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBEs and WBEs have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope
of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they arise to establish
the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the contracted goals,
taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's scope of work. If the
County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments were not made, or that
fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract or violation of this
subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-299. Sanctions and penalties.
(a) The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:
(1) Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of a bid, responses
to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts documentation, post-award compliance, or
other Program operations.
(2) Committing any other violations of this subdivision.
(b) A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract, termination of the
contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed nonresponsive in future County solicitations
and contracts as determined by the County's Purchasing Agent, if it is found to have:
(1) Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for certification or
recertification or colluded with others to do so;
(2) Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a bid or proposal or
documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance, or other Program operations or colluded
with others to do so;
(3) Failed in bad faith to fulfill Project Specific Goals, thereby materially breaching the contract; or
(4) Failed to comply in good faith with substantive provisions of this subdivision.
Sec. 34-300. Program review and sunset.
(a) The President and the Board of Commissioners shall receive quarterly and annual reports from the CC Director
detailing the County's performance under the Program.
(b) The President and the Board of Commissioners will review these reports, including the Annual Participation
Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating discrimination in its contracting
activities and marketplace.
(c) Within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, the County will review the operation of the Program
and the evidentiary basis for the Program in order to determine whether the County has a continuing
compelling interest in remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its construction marketplace, and
the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so
that the County will not function as a passive participant in a discriminatory marketplace.
(d) This subdivision shall sunset on or before June 30, 2016.
