maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters in suburban Cook County, as well as programs for
homeless prevention.
The amount of HOME Investment Partnership funds granted by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Development (HUD) is $5,761 ,4 86.00. Additionally, the County will receive $ 111 ,0 12.00 for the
American Dream Downpayment Initiative recently announced by HUD. Applications for eligible HOME
projects are accepted throughout the year. The proposed use of all funds must be incorporated into the
County 's Annual Action Plan for submittal to HUD.
Prior to submitting required documents to HUD, Cook County is required, by Executive Order 12372,

HOME funds, and that I, or the Chief Administrative Officer of County of Cook, or his designee, be

LETTER FROM THE STATE'S ATTORNEY 'S OFFICE TO COMMISSIONER QUIGLEY
REGARDING THE 2007 ANNUAL APPROPRIATION ORDINANCE

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 14, 2007 from
PATRJCK T. DRISCOLL, JR., Deputy State 's Attorney Chief, Civil Actions Bureau
Re: 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance
Dear Commissioner Quigley:
By letter dated May 7, 2007, you have asked for the opinion of this Office in response to three questions,
which relate to the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance as passed by the County Board on February 23,
2007, and as more recently complied in final form by the Budget Director.
In the time available we have looked specifically at the issue of the failure to adopt a balanced County
budget and the authority to correct such imbalance after it is discovered. Our research on this point has
provided no meaningful Appellate Court guidance, as litigation in this area is concentrated on the issue of
excess appropriations resulting in revenue surpluses or positive budgetary imbalances.

Issues Presented
As delineated in your questions the issues presented are as follows:
l) If the Board of Commissioners passes a budget that is not balanced, whose respons ibility is it to
make that budget balanced after it as passed?
2) If the budget department needs to deviate from the passed budget in order to make it balanced, do
they need to bring the amendments before the Board of Commissioners or are they able to make
the decisions on their own?
3) If positions are added or deleted by the Board of Commissioners through the amendment process
is the Budget Department legally obligated to implement those changes?

1978

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

Conclusion
Each of these questions stem from the fact that the Budget Department has been asked to reconcile the
2007 County budget, as amended, and thereafter, to render a final written document to the County Board.
In carrying out this function, the Budget Department acts on behalf of the County Board, as it is the legal
duty of the Board to adopt an annual appropriation bill. If, upon the Budget Department' s review, the 2007
County budget, as adopted, cannot be brought into balance, whether due to a lack of revenues as against
expenditures or because certain amendments of the same budgetary matter are so inconsistent so as to be
irreconcilable, it is incumbent upon the County Board to make the necessary corrections.
The Counties Code provides the amendment process by which the County Board may initiate necessary
corrections to an annual appropriation ordinance after it is initially adopted. The timeframe for amending
the budget is extremely truncated, and in this instance the window for amending the 2007 budget ended on
March l , 2007, only six days after the annual appropriation ordinance was adopted.
Ultimately, Commissioner Quigley's inquiry seeks to determine which branch of County government has
the legal authority to develop and adopt the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance, as amended. We
conclude that the County Board has the singular statutory authority to adopt a budget and that the will of
the Board as evidenced by the annual appropriation ordinance must be carried out.
Given the limited anecdotal evidence we have at our disposal, we cannot judge whether the 2007 County
budget is in fact out of balance. In any event, if the 2007 County budget is out of balance, it cannot be
changed now as the legal timeframe for amendment of the annual appropriation ordinance has lapsed. Nor
should the Budget Department, under the guise of reconciling of the budget adoption and amendment
process, make substantive changes to the 2007 County budget contrary to the express intention of the
County Board, even for the purpose of balancing.

Analysis
At the outset, it is necessary to briefly summarize the statutory provisions relating to annual appropriations
process undertaken by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The pertinent provisions are found at
sections 5/6-24001 through 5/6-24009 of the Counties Code. 55 ILCS 5/6-24001 et seq.
Section 5/6-24001 provides that the County Board shall adopt an annual appropriation bill within the first
quarter of the fiscal year. Sections 5/6-24004 and 5/6-24005 provide the procedural steps to be utilized by
the County Board for preparation of the annual appropriation bill, including public notice and hearings.
The requirement of a balanced budget is found at Section 5/6-24005. Section 5/6-24007 allows for
amendments to the annual appropriation bill, but only within a very limited timeframe after the annual
appropriation bill is first adopted. Sections 5/6-24001 and 5/6-24008 provide that after the annual
appropriation bill is adopted and after the limited period for amendment has passed, no further
amendments or changes are permitted until the next annual appropriation period (allowing for
appropriations for certain casualty losses or expenditures required by law). Sanctions for violations of
these provisions are provided at Section 5/6-24009.
Finally, not as part of the budget making process, but rather as part of managing the County's resources,
Section 5/6-24007, authorizes the control of expenditures by permitting the President of the County Board
to delay, restrict or terminate expenditures against any appropriation delineated in a monthly schedule and
report of revenues and budget status. Further, the County Board of Commissioners is authorized to make
transfers within any fund, department or other office or other agency of the County to manage assets and
liabilities that arise during the fiscal year.

1979

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007
Section 5/6-24007 provides a critical tool for the balanced management of the County's budget after the
annual appropriation bill has been adopted.

1) If the Board of Commissioners passes a budget that is not balanced, whose responsibility is it to
make that budget balanced after it has passed?
The legal authority and duty to adopt an annual appropriation bill is solely that of the County Board. The
County Board must adopt an annual appropriation bill within the first quarter of each fiscal year. 55 ILCS
6/5-24001. Cook County as a home rule unit has no authority to extend the period for adopting its annual
budget. In re Application of Anderson, 194 App. 3d 414 (2nd Dist. 1990). The County's budget, as
contained within the annual appropriation bill, must be balanced, meaning that corporate assets in hand
and estimated revenues for the fiscal year must be sufficient to meet the cost or expense appropriated for
that year. 55 ILCS 6/5-24005.
Once adopted, and subject to strict time limits, only the County Board has the power to amend the budget.
Thus, any corrections or modifications to the annual appropriation ordinance, including correcting for any
budgetary imbalance, are the responsibility of the County Board.

2) If the budget Department needs to deviate from the passed budget in order to make it balanced,
do they need to bring the amendments before the Board of Commissioners or are they able to make
the decisions on their own?
As noted above, under the statutory scheme provided for the creation and adoption of the County 's annual
appropriation ordinance, only the County Board is authorized to "amend" the appropriation ordinance for
any reason, including the correction of an imbalance in the ordinance as adopted. The County Board, in
prior years has allowed for a reconciliation or "clean-up" provision in the Annual Resolution and
Appropriation Bill which authorized the Budget Director and the Comptroller to "correct any factual errors
in the Annual Appropriation Bill and to implement the adopted Amendments with any required
modification. " (2006 Annual Resolution and Appropriation Bill - Section 33)
The 2007 Resolution at issue, through apparent inadvertence, lacks the corrective provision included by
the County Board in earlier years. However, it should be noted that although the corrective provision is
helpful for the clarification of language and the correction of arithmetic errors, it can not be read to
authorize independent, substantive amendment of the budget by administrative officers.

3) If positions are added or deleted by the Board of Commissioners thr ough the amendment
process is the budget department legally obligated to implement those changes?
The annual appropriation process begins with the submission of the President' s recommended budget. The
County Board next develops a tentative budget, which during the budget making process is subject to
amendments that often change expenditures or revenue estimates from those originally included in the
President's recommendation. As a County Ordinance derived through the legislative process, the annual
appropriation bill, including its amendments is a substantive law. Thus, no one has the legal authority to
disregard an amendment (including the adding or deletion of employee positions) that has been approved
and adopted in the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance.

The Role of the County Board and the Budget Director in Balancing the Budget
Part of the subtext of the three questions presented by Commissioner Quigley is the need to define the
respective roles of the County Board and the Budget Director in finalizing the 2007 Annual Appropriation
Ordinance.

1980

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

It is clear that the statutory authority and duty to create the County budget is vested in the County Board.
Concomitant with the County Board's authority to create the budget is the requirement that the budget be
balanced. It is the responsibility of the County Board to ensure that the annual appropriation ordinance as
adopted is in balance. Save for the minor correction up of scrivener or arithmetic errors, it is not the role of
Budget Director to in effect, change the will of the County Board by unilaterally adjusting the budget's
revenues and expenditures in order to balance.
The statutory budget making process presumes that the annual appropriation ordinance will be in balance
when it is adopted. If the budget is not balanced at the time of its passage, the County Board may correct it
during the statutory amendment period. Failing such a timely amendment, corrective action to assure the
effect of a balanced budget must be a shared responsibility of both the County Board and county
administrative officers under the direction of the President.
In this instance where imbalances have apparently occurred in certain line items of the amended 2007
County budget, the President is authorized to control and restrict the expenditures associated with the
budget shortfall. It is incumbent upon the President to advise the County Board of such action. In response
to the President's budgetary action, the County Board, in its discretion, could authorize the intra-fund
transfer of monies sufficient to reinstate or adequately fund the particular items limited or terminated by
the earlier action.
The legal implications of having failed to pass a balanced budget are somewhat limited. In those instances
where revenues far exceed the amounts necessary to fund government a valid tax rate objection may lie. In
those instances where the adopted budget is on its face imbalanced, a taxpayer action may lie to enjoin the
expenditure of funds for appropriated items beyond available revenues identified in budget estimates.
A final legal liability caveat is necessary regarding the unilateral budget cutting of the offices of the
several elected officials in Cook County. While the controlling of expenditures to assure budgetary control
is a proper exercise of the Executive's authority, care must be taken not to limit or tem1inate the funding of
elected officials to the point where the constitutional and statutory function of the offices are imperiled. An
elected official certainly, and perhaps taxpayers as well, could initiate suit to compel the County to provide
or reinstate adequate funding to prevent the imperiling of the mandatory functions of elected officials.

Co11clusio11
At this juncture no statutory remedy is available to amend the 2007 Cook County Annual Appropriation
Ordinance, as amended and adopted on February 23 , 2007. Therefore, any budgetary imbalance existing at
the time of the 2007 budget's adoption must be addressed through the combined action of the County
Board and the Office of the President, making those statutory adjustments to expenditures specifically
authorized at Section 5/6-24007 of the Counties Code.
Note: This item also appears under the Office of the State's Attorney in this Journal of Proceedings, page
2042.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)( 1), Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by
Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the communication be referred
to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 287227). The motion carried unanimously.

DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES
LETTER FROM THE INTERIM BUDGET DIRECTOR REGARDING
FISCAL YEAR 2007 AMENDMENT PROCESS
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 4, 2007 from
T AKASHI REINBOLD, Interim Budget Director
I am asking that this item be added to the Board agenda for the meeting of June 5, 2007 in response to
Agenda Item #8 1, a Resolution sponsored by Commissioners Claypool, Quigley and Suffredin.
The amendment format has always shown the impact of the amendment on the account. The display of the
"From" and "To" columns was developed to display the impact of the amendment to be voted upon, not
the amount an account would be after adoption. It is a representation of the impact of the amendment
being voted upon. This was developed in the late l 980's, because Commissioners wanted to know what an
amendment would do to an account. Prior to the addition of this information, amendments would just
show the amount that an account would be increased or decreased. The account would then reflect an
accumulated amount. During times of limited resources, this could cause problems; an account could be
reduced below zero ($0.00). Without an offset, the budget would not be balanced because an account
reduced to zero would not be further reduced while the offset to increase another account would increase
the account by the amount of the decrease approved. We did not show cumulative affect of the
amendments, because we do not speculate what an amendment's disposition will be or in what order they
are taken.
In consideration of operations of departments under the President, adjustments were made in order to
evenly spread the impact of ten furlough days on departments.
Also, reflected in Commissioner Quigley's spreadsheet were referenced changes to pos1t10ns in the
Sheriff's Office and the Office of the Public Defender. These position changes were due to the union
contracts regarding layoffs. The Sheriff's Office provided a list of positions to be deleted based on
seniority (Last In, First Out), The Public Defender reinstatements were also based on seniority, and L2's
were to be reinstated before LI ' s.
Amendment #130 restores funding for Assistant Public Defenders in the amount of $305,043, with no
source of funding. Therefore, funding for this item had to come from an available source of funding for
salaries ( 499-814), determined by the Budget Department.
There were two errors in processing amendments for Department 002, Account 295 as well as Department
200, Account 120.
In the proposed resolution by Commissioners Claypool, Quigley and Suffredin, the 6th paragraph
mentions overtime being reduced for the Sheriff's Police Department and Court Services Division. The
Quigley spreadsheet did not address Amendment #D 14 which approved further reductions in the overtime
accounts departments.

1994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

Also on Quigley's spreadsheet of comparison, the last item states that the 499 -8 14 Account should have
been $20,346,704 when in fact the last amendment to amend 499-814 was Amendment # 132 reducing the
account to $15,209,869 thereby reducing the amount available to pay COLA's by $8 million from what is
in the Final Budget Book of $23 million.
In regards to the amendments adjusting the registry accounts at the Bureau of Health Services, the original
intent was to reduced them to an amount in which the bureau was balanced, and to accommodate programs
reinstated throughout Amendment #D23-A through #D23-T, to available revenue. Amendment #65
addressed a reduction to the account which was already reduced to an amount below the previously
adjusted amount from Amendment #D23-Q. The adjustment made was based on the fact that the Board
previously approved an amount lower than the amount in Amendment #65 .
The 110 amount is reflective of action taken on the positions identified by detail in the amendment
throughout 023. The 110 account's starting point is the amount shown in the executive book, and then the
account is finally determined after all adjustments from the amendments are done, including salary
projection adjustments, including vacancies, hires, and promotions.
I respectfully request that this item be referred to the Finance Committee.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(l ), Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by
Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved that the communication be referred to
the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 287225). The motion carried unanimously.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication from
DAYID ORR, County Clerk
by
CLEM BALANOFF, Director of Elections
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County to transfer funds within the 524
Special Elections Fund.

2008

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

Reason:

This request is in anticipation of HB426, which moves the General Primary Election date from
the third Tuesday in March to the first Tuesday February in even numbered years (from March
18 to February 5 in 2008). This amendment of the Election Code has passed both the House and
the Senate and the governor's signature is expected.
Because the 2008 primary election will be six weeks earlier, there are costs that will be incurred
in 2007 that would otherwise be charged to FY 2008. Furthermore, due to limited training
opportunities during the winter holidays, election preparation activities must begin at least eight
weeks earlier. The County Clerk's Office will begin training equipment managers in October
and will conduct needed preparations for election judges training in November. This also
accelerates the election equipment preparation schedule at the Hawthorne Warehouse.

In order to meet this unforeseen demand a transfer of funds from and to the following accounts is
requested:

Transfer of Funds from Account:
$ 594,000.00
$1,120,000.00
$1 ,714,000.00

524-225 Postage
524-267 Juror or Election Judge Fees

Transfer of Funds to Account:
524-120 Overtime Compensation
524-129 Seasonal Work Employees
524-133 Per Diem Personnel
524-260 Professional and Managerial Services
524-430 Moving Expenses and Minor Remodeling of County Facilities
524-530 Office Furnishings and Equipment
524-579 Computer Equipment
524-634 Rental of Automotive Equipment

$100,000.00
$400' 000. 00

$50,000.00
$3 7 5 '000. 00
$50,000.00
$1 ,714,000.00

Approval of this item will allow for a reduction in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget Request.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved that the transfer of funds be
approved, as amended. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE STATE'S ATTORNEY
GRANT A WARD ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 14, 2007 from
DENNIS MANZKE, Chief of the Administrative Services Bureau, State 's Attorney's Office
requesting authorization to accept a no-cost grant extension from June 30, 2007 through December 31,
2007 from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICllA). This extension will enable the
office to expend the remaining grant funds that were awarded. This grant will provide continued funding
for the Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Prosecution Coordination Program. This Program is, in
essence, the combination of five grants that were once separate. The five separate programs were: Sex
Offender Prosecution Program, Chicago Response, Domestic Violence Resource Center, Domestic
Violence Suburban Coordinator, and Total Response. By combining these programs into one Violence
Against Women program, the State's Attorney's Office is able to better utilize staff and resources to
effectively address the combined issues of sexual assault and domestic violence. In addition, the
combined program allows for more efficient administration and oversight of the various components of the
program. The program dedicates seven (7) assistant state's attorneys, four (4) investigators, two (2) victim
specialists, one (I) resource specialist and one (1) administrative support staff.
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on March 1, 2006 by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners in the amount of $832,345.00 with a cash match of $277,448.00 and an over-match of
$2 12,426.00.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding period extension: June 30, 2007 through December 31, 2007.

LETTER FROM THE STATE'S ATTORNEY 'S OFFICE TO COMMISSIONER QUIGLEY
REGARDING THE 2007 ANNUAL APPROPRIATION ORDINANCE

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 14, 2007 from
PATRICK T. DRISCOLL, JR., Deputy State's Attorney Chief, Civil Actions Bureau
Re: 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance
Dear Commissioner Quigley:
By letter dated May 7, 2007, you have asked for the opinion of this Office in response to three questions,
which relate to the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance as passed by the County Board on February 23,
2007, and as more recently complied in final form by the Budget Director.
In the time available we have looked specifically at the issue of the failure to adopt a balanced County
budget and the authority to correct such imbalance after it is discovered. Our research on this point has
provided no meaningful Appellate Court guidance, as litigation in this area is concentrated on the issue of
excess appropriations resulting in revenue surpluses or positive budgetary imbalances.

2042

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

Issues Presented
As delineated in your questions the issues presented are as follows:
I) If the Board of Commissioners passes a budget that is not balanced, whose responsibility is it to
make that budget balanced after it as passed?
2) If the budget department needs to deviate from the passed budget in order to make it balanced, do
they need to bring the amendments before the Board of Commissioners or are they able to make
the decisions on their own?
3) If positions are added or deleted by the Board of Commissioners through the amendment process
is the Budget Department legally obligated to implement those changes?

Conclusion
Each of these questions stem from the fact that the Budget Department has been asked to reconcile the
2007 County budget, as amended, and thereafter, to render a final written document to the County Board.
In carrying out this function, the Budget Department acts on behalf of the County Board, as it is the legal
duty of the Board to adopt an annual appropriation bill. If, upon the Budget Department's review, the 2007
County budget, as adopted, cannot be brought into balance, whether due to a lack of revenues as against
expenditures or because certain amendments of the same budgetary matter are so inconsistent so as to be
irreconcilable, it is incumbent upon the County Board to make the necessary corrections.
The Counties Code provides the amendment process by which the County Board may initiate necessary
corrections to an annual appropriation ordinance after it is initially adopted. The timeframe for amending
the budget is extremely truncated, and in this instance the window for amending the 2007 budget ended on
March 1, 2007, only six days after the annual appropriation ordinance was adopted.
Ultimately, Commissioner Quigley ' s inquiry seeks to determine which branch of County government has
the legal authority to develop and adopt the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance, as amended. We
conclude that the County Board has the singular statutory authority to adopt a budget and that the will of
the Board as evidenced by the annual appropriation ordinance must be carried out.
Given the limited anecdotal evidence we have at our disposal, we cannot judge whether the 2007 County
budget is in fact out of balance. In any event, if the 2007 County budget is out of balance, it cannot be
changed now as the legal timeframe for amendment of the annual appropriation ordinance has lapsed. Nor
should the Budget Department, under the guise of reconciling of the budget adoption and amendment
process, make substantive changes to the 2007 County budget contrary to the express intention of the
County Board, even for the purpose of balancing.

Analysis
At the outset, it is necessary to briefly summarize the statutory provisions relating to annual appropriations
process undertaken by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The pertinent provisions are found at
sections 5/6-24001 through 5/6-24009 of the Counties Code. 55 ILCS 5/6-24001 et seq.

2043

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007
Section 5/6-24001 provides that the County Board shall adopt an annual appropriation bill within the first
quarter of the fiscal year. Sections 5/6-24004 and 5/6-24005 provide the procedural steps to be utilized by
the County Board for preparation of the annual appropriation bill, including public notice and hearings.
The requirement of a balanced budget is found at Section 5/6-24005. Section 5/6-24007 allows for
amendments to the annual appropriation bill, but only within a very limited timeframe after the annual
appropriation bill is first adopted. Sections 5/6-24001 and 5/6-24008 provide that after the annual
appropriation bill is adopted and after the limited period for amendment has passed, no further
amendments or changes are permitted until the next annual appropriation period (allowing for
appropriations for certain casualty losses or expenditures required by law). Sanctions for violations of
these provisions are provided at Section 5/6-24009.
Finally, not as part of the budget making process, but rather as part of managing the County's resources,
Section 5/6-24007, authorizes the control of expenditures by permitting the President of the County Board
to delay, restrict or terminate expenditures against any appropriation delineated in a monthly schedule and
report of revenues and budget status. Further, the County Board of Commissioners is authorized to make
transfers within any fund, department or other office or other agency of the County to manage assets and
liabilities that arise during the fiscal year.
Section 5/6-24007 provides a critical tool for the balanced management of the County 's budget after the
annual appropriation bill has been adopted.
1) If the Board of Commissioners passes a budget that is not balanced, whose responsibility is it to
make that budget balanced after it has passed?
The legal authority and duty to adopt an annual appropriation bill is solely that of the County Board. The
County Board must adopt an annual appropriation bill within the first quarter of each fiscal year. 55 ILCS
6/5-24001. Cook County as a home rule unit has no authority to extend the period for adopting its annual
budget. In re Application of Anderson, 194 App. 3d 414 (2nd Dist. 1990). The County's budget, as
contained within the annual appropriation bill, must be balanced, meaning that corporate assets in hand
and estimated revenues for the fiscal year must be sufficient to meet the cost or expense appropriated for
that year. 55 ILCS 6/5-24005.
Once adopted, and subject to strict time limits, only the County Board has the power to amend the budget.
Thus, any corrections or modifications to the annual appropriation ordinance, including correcting for any
budgetary imbalance, are the responsibility of the County Board.
2) If the budget Department needs to deviate from the passed budget in order to make it balanced,
do they need to bring the amendments before the Board of Commissioners or are they able to make
the decisions on their own?
As noted above, under the statutory scheme provided for the creation and adoption of the County's annual
appropriation ordinance, only the County Board is authorized to "amend" the appropriation ordinance for
any reason, including the correction of an imbalance in the ordinance as adopted. The County Board, in
prior years has allowed for a reconciliation or "clean-up" provision in the Annual Resolution and
Appropriation Bill which authorized the Budget Director and the Comptroller to "correct any factual errors
in the Annual Appropriation Bill and to implement the adopted Amendments with any required
modification. " (2006 Annual Resolution and Appropriation Bill - Section 33)

2044

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

The 2007 Resolution at issue, through apparent inadvertence, lacks the corrective provision included by
the County Board in earlier years. However, it should be noted that although the corrective provision is
helpful for the clarification of language and the correction of arithmetic errors, it can not be read to
authorize independent, substantive amendment of the budget by administrative officers.

3) If positions are added or deleted by the Board of Commissioners through the amendment
process is the budget department legally obligated to implement those changes?
The annual appropriation process begins with the submission of the President's recommended budget. The
County Board next develops a tentative budget, which during the budget making process is subject to
amendments that often change expenditures or revenue estimates from those originally included in the
President's recommendation. As a County Ordinance derived through the legislative process, the annual
appropriation bill, including its amendments is a substantive law. Thus, no one has the legal authority to
disregard an amendment (including the adding or deletion of employee positions) that has been approved
and adopted in the 2007 Annual Appropriation Ordinance.

The Role of the County Board and the Budget Director in Balancing the Budget
Part of the subtext of the three questions presented by Commissioner Quigley is the need to define the
respective roles of the County Board and the Budget Director in finalizing the 2007 Annual Appropriation
Ordinance.
It is clear that the statutory authority and duty to create the County budget is vested in the County Board.
Concomitant with the County Board's authority to create the budget is the requirement that the budget be
balanced. It is the responsibility of the County Board to ensure that the annual appropriation ordinance as
adopted is in balance. Save for the minor correction up of scrivener or arithmetic errors, it is not the role of
Budget Director to in effect, change the will of the County Board by unilaterally adjusting the budget's
revenues and expenditures in order to balance.

The statutory budget making process presumes that the annual appropriation ordinance will be in balance
when it is adopted. If the budget is not balanced at the time of its passage, the County Board may correct it
during the statutory amendment period. Failing such a timely amendment, corrective action to assure the
effect of a balanced budget must be a shared responsibility of both the County Board and county
administrative officers under the direction of the President.
In thi s instance where imbalances have apparently occurred in certain line items of the amended 2007
County budget, the President is authorized to control and restrict the expenditures associated with the
budget shortfall. It is incumbent upon the President to advise the County Board of such action. In response
to the President's budgetary action, the County Board, in its discretion, could authorize the intra-fund
transfer of monies sufficient to reinstate or adequately fund the particular items limited or terminated by
the earlier action.
The legal implications of having failed to pass a balanced budget are somewhat limited. In those instances
where revenues far exceed the amounts necessary to fund government a valid tax rate objection may lie. In
those instances where the adopted budget is on its face imbalanced, a taxpayer action may lie to enjoin the
expenditure of funds for appropriated items beyond available revenues identified in budget estimates.

2045

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

A final legal liability caveat is necessary regarding the unilateral budget cutting of the offices of the
several elected officials in Cook County. While the controlling of expenditures to assure budgetary control
is a proper exercise of the Executive's authority, care must be taken not to limit or terminate the funding of
elected officials to the point where the constitutional and statutory function of the offices are imperiled. An
elected official certainly, and perhaps taxpayers as well, could initiate suit to compel the County to provide
or reinstate adequate funding to prevent the imperiling of the mandatory functions of elected officials.
Conclusion

At this juncture no statutory remedy is available to amend the 2007 Cook County Annual Appropriation
Ordinance, as amended and adopted on February 23 , 2007. Therefore, any budgetary imbalance existing at
the time of the 2007 budget's adoption must be addressed through the combined action of the County
Board and the Office of the President, making those statutory adjustments to expenditures specifically
authorized at Section 5/6-24007 of the Counties Code.
Note: This item also appears under Commissioners in this Journal of Proceedings, page 1978.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(l), Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by
Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the communication be referred
to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 287227). The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT
WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for governments
and firms to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to reduce their emissions of
six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year from 2006 to 201 O; and
WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard "cap-and-trade" system: each emitter is
allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is lowered each successive
year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions below their requirements to sell credits
and those that do not meet their requirements to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, many governments including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico as well as many Fortune 500 companies including
Ford, IBM, and DuPont have joined the CCX and committed themselves to reductions;
and
WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly nine percent
from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and 2003, a reduction of over
30,000 tons of global warming pollution; and
WHEREAS, the City's steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led to the
auditing and retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings, allowing the City
and sister agencies to save $6 million annually.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Chapter 30, Article III, Division 1, Section 30-326 be enacted as
follows:
Sec. 30-326
(a)

Short title.
This Ordinance shall be known as "The Cook County Climate Change
Mitigation Act."

(b)

Joining the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).
Cook County shall enter into Phase II of the CCX, comm1ttmg to a
reduction of 1.2 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions each year
between 2006 and 2010.
The County will deliver energy consumption and other relevant data to
the CCX which will assist the County in creating an emissions baseline
from future reductions will be measured.

2117

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007
The County will develop a strategic plan within three months of the
passage of this ordinance that outlines where the County will cut
greenhouse gas emissions by the amounts required- or exceeding the
amounts required-in Phase II of CCX. This plan will be made publicly
available through the President's Web site.
As the emissions reduction plan is implemented, the County will sell any
extra emissions credits that it has on the CCX's online trading platform.

* Referred to the Committee on Environmental Control on 12/19/06.
Leave was granted to change the listing of sponsors and co-sponsors to include Chairman Quigley as

operating permit shall also obtain a filing permit from the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control within 30 days of receipt of its state permit and every three years
thereafter. The owner also must pay annual emissions fees based upon the tonnage of

This requirement does not apply to sites permitted by the Illinois Environmental Agency
solely as (1) retail liquid dispensing facilities that have air pollution control equipment or
(2) agrichemical facilities with an endorsed permit pursuant to Section 39.4 of the Illinois
Environmental Protection Act. The owner or operator of a portable emission unit, as

change the site of any unit previously permitted without paying an additional fee under
this Section for each site change, provided that no further change to the permit is
otherwise necessary or requested.
Notwithstanding any rules to the contrary, the owner of a permitted site shall remit to the
Cook County Department of Environmenta l Control the following filing permit fees,
payable every three years upon obtaining or renewing a permit, and annual emissions fees:
( 1) A site permitted to emit less than 25 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year Annual Illinois Air Emission
Report (AER), shall pay a filing permit fee of $ 1,000 plus an annual emissions fee of $5
per ton of the total tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(2) A site permitted to emit at least 25 tons per year but Jess than 50 tons per year
of any combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall
pay a filing permit fee of $1,500 plus an annual emissions fee of $10 per ton of the total
tonnage of any combination of regulated air pollutants.
(3) A site permitted to emit at least 50 tons but less than 100 tons per year of any
combination of regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a
fil ing permit fee of $2,000 plus an annua l em issions fee of $15 per ton of the total tonnage
of any combination of regulated ai r pollutants.
(4) A site permitted to emit at least 100 tons per year of any combination of
regulated air pollutants as reported by its previous year AER, shall pay a filing permit fee

212 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

(b) The Cook County Department of Environmental Control ("Department") may deny an
application for the issuance, transfer, or renewal of an air pollution operating permit if any
air pollution site fee owed by the applicant has not been paid within 60 days of the due
date, unless the applicant, at the time of application, pays to the Department in advance
the air pollution site fee for the site that is the subject of the operating permit, plus any
other air pollution site fees then owed by the applicant. The denial of an air pollution
operating permit for failure to pay an air pollution site fee shall be subject to review by the
County Environmental Control Board of Appeals pursuant to the provisions of Chapter
30, Article II, Division 4. Section 30-123 of the Counties Code.
(c) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit, and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, the Department may collect the
avoided permit fees with or without pursuing enforcement. The avoided permit fees shall
be calculated as double the amount that would have been owed had a permit been timely
obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the Cook
County Environmental Management Fund
(d) If the Cook County Department of Environmental Control determines that an owner
or operator of a site was required, but failed, to timely obtain an air pollution operating
permit and as a result avoided the payment of permit fees, an enforcement action may be
brought. In addition to any other relief that may be obtained as part of this action, the
Cook County Department of Environmental Control may seek to recover the avoided
permit fees. The avoided permit fees shall be calculated as double the amount that would
have been owed had a permit been timely obtained. Fees collected pursuant to this
subsection (d) shall be deposited into the Cook County General Fund.
(e) If a Permittee subject to a fee under this Section fails to pay the fee within 90 days of
its due date, or makes the fee payment from an account with insufficient funds to cover
the amount of the fee payment, the Department shall notify the Permittee of the failure to
pay the fee. If the Permittee fails to pay the fee within 60 days after such notification, the
Department may, by written notice, immediately revoke the air pollution operating permit.
Failure of the Cook County Department of Environmental Control to notify the Permittee
of failure to pay a fee due under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an account
with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee payment, does not excuse or alter
the duty of the Permittee to comply with the provisions of this Section.
Section 30-397. Emission Levels Reduction.
Permit Holders for sites where the levels of pollution emissions exceed 100 tons per year
of cumulative regulated air pollutants shall be required to submit an annual "Regulated
Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plan" to the Cook County Department of
Environmental Control for the Department's approval. Said plan shall detail efforts that
will be made to decrease the Site's cumulative regulated pollutant emissions by 10%
within the term of the air pollution operating permit.
(a) Annual Regulated Air Pollutant Emission Reduction Plans submitted to the Cook
County Department of Environmental Control will be verified by reviewing the
Site/Permitee's Illinois Annual Air Emission Report (AER).

2122

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

(b) Established Regulated Air Pollutant emission reductions exceeding 10% on an annual
basis will allow a I 0% credit reduction of the following year annual air permit fee.
(c) Failure to reduce Regulated Air Pollutant emissions as indicated in the County
approved Reduction Plan may result in penalty fees or loss of permit.
Section 30-398. Required Submission of Illinois Annual Air Emission Report.
(a) Each Site/Permittee shall be required to submit its Illinois AER to the Cook County
Department of Environmental Control within I month of the submittal of the AER to the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
(b) Additionally, each Site/Permittee shall be required to submit quarterly reports
detailing the individual pollution emission levels for its fuel burning devices and
cumulative values of pollution emissions within the quarterly period.
Section 30-399. Effective Date. This Ordinance shall take effect within ninety (90) days
of passage.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to accept the Substitute
Ordinance for Communication No. 285200. The motion to accept the Substitute Ordinance carried.
After discussion, Mr. Givens stated that over the next several weeks his department would formulate a
concrete and definitive course of action to address the State's Attorney 's opinion regarding overlap
between the municipal, county and state governments in enforcing environmental violations.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESTORATION OF THE COOK COUNTY SPECIALTY REFERRAL SYSTEM
WHEREAS, on April 16, 2007, the Interim Bureau Chief of the Cook County Bureau of
Health Services ("Bureau") shut down the Bureau' s computerized specialty referral
system, known as "IRIS", for an indefinite period of time, abandoning thousands of
uninsured patients in need of specialty care for serious illnesses such as cancer and
diabetes; and
WHEREAS, for years, dozens of private community health centers partnered with the
Bureau utilizing IRIS to screen and prioritize primary care patients in need of specialty
services from the Bureau 's specialty clinics; and

2 127

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

WHEREAS, this cooperative partnership has saved the Bureau the cost of providing
primary care to more than 5,000 uninsured and underinsured patients in Cook County
annually; and
WHEREAS, since the IRIS system shutdown, only patients in need of urgent care will be
sent to Stroger Hospital of Cook County 's main outpatient screening center a facility
notorious for Jong wait times; and
WHEREAS, the Interim Bureau Chief has effectively cut off thousands of patients'
access to the Bureau's specialty clinics, forcing them to delay their care until their
condition worsens and they seek emergency care at Stroger Hospital of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, shutting down the IRIS system will not only incur additional costs to our
already deficit-ridden public health system, but it will cause irreparable harm to Cook
County residents who have a right to basic health care.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners directs the Cook County Bureau of Health Services to restore the IRIS
specialty referral system so that our public health system can continue to deliver necessary

RESOLUTION DECLARING COOK COUNTY A
"FAIR AND EQUAL COUNTY FOR IMMIGRANTS"
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power, the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform
any function relating to its government and affairs including the power to regulate for the protection of the
public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, to this end, the County of Cook is dedicated to providing all of its residents with fair and
equal access to the services, opportunities, and protection county government has been established to
administer; and
WHEREAS, there are now approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States,
including half a million in Illinois and more than 300,000 who live in communities throughout Cook
County, working full-time jobs, paying taxes, and contributing to Social Security and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, conditioning the provis ion of benefits, opportunities, and services on citizenship or
immigrant status or inquiring about such status in the course of such provision directly contravenes the
County's commitment to ensuring fair and equal access for all of its residents; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of civil immigration laws has historically been a federal government
responsibility, a power vested first in the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then in the
Department of Homeland Security; and
WHEREAS, initiatives such as the proposed Federal Clear Law Enforcement for Criminal Alien Removal
Act, which would require local governments to give their local law enforcement agencies express authority
to enforce immigration laws, also signals pressure to expend limited local resources on traditionally
federal functions; and
WHEREAS, encouraging local governments that are not specifically equipped or trained to implement
immigration measures is likely to result in inconsistencies and decentralization that undermine instead of
strengthen these measures; and
WHEREAS, as a matter of public safety, the protection of an individual's citizenship and immigrant
status will engender trust and cooperation between law enforcement officials and immigrant communities
to aid in crime prevention and solving, including human and drug trafficking, prostitution, domestic
violence, and even terrorism, and will discourage the threat of immigrant and racial profiling and
harassment; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Immigration Law Center, nearly 50 cities and counties throughout
the U.S. have enacted "Sanctuary Laws", prohibiting their agencies from inquiring about immigration
status and unilaterally enforcing immigration law provisions including Cambridge, Chicago, Los Angeles,
and Seattle and several states, including Alaska, Maine and Oregon; and
WHEREAS, by means of this Resolution, Cook County joins states, cities, and counties across the nation
by declaring itself a "Fair and Equal County for Immigrants'', which means that Cook County ensures fair
and equal access to essential benefits, opportunities, and services by prohibiting Cook County bureaus,
offices, departments, or employees or other Cook County agencies or agents from inquiring or disclosing
information about immigration status.

2133

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that except as provided below or when otherwise required
by law, no Cook County bureau, office, department, employee, or other Cook County agency or agent
shall condition the provision of Cook County benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to
citizenship or immigrant status; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it shall be the policy of the Cook County Sheriff's Office not to
assist in the investigation of the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless such inquiry or
investigation is (a) integrally related to an investigation by the Cook County Sheriff's Office regarding a
matter other than the individual 's citizenship or immigrant status, such as crimina l smuggling and
harboring of immigrants, or other crimes that have as an element of the crime the illegality of a person's
presence, or (b) as otherwise required by law. The Cook County Sheriff's Office shall not make inquiries
into immigration status for the sole purpose of determining whether an individual has violated the civil
immigration laws; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, no Cook County bureau,
office, department, or employee or other Cook County agency or agent shall disclose information
regarding the citizenship or immigrant status of any person unless required to do so by law or such
disclosure has been authorized in writing by the individual to whom such information pertains, or if such
individual is a minor or is otherwise not legally competent, by such individual's parent or guardian; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Bureau of Health Services ("CCBH") shall not
condition the provision of health benefits, opportunities, or services on matters related to citizenship or
immigrant status, but may, in the course of determining eligibility for benefits or seeking reimbursement
from state, federal, or other third party payers, inquire about immigrant status for the sole purpose of such
a determination or receipt of reimbursement from said sources and, to such extent as the disclosure of such
information is related to such a detennination or receipt of reimbursement, the provisions of this
Resolution and any subsequent ordinance do not apply to the CCBH; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that except when otherwise required by law, where presentation of an
1llinois driver's license or identification card is accepted as adequate evidence of identity, presentation of a
photo identity document issued by the person's nation of origin, such as a driver's license, passport, or
matricula consular (consulate-issued document) shall be accepted and shall not subject the person to a
higher level of scrutiny or different treatment than if the person had provided an Illinois driver' s license or
identification card except that this provision does not apply to the completion of the federally mandated 19 forms provided, however, that a request for translation of such document to English shall not be deemed
a violation of any provision of this Resolution and any subsequent ordinance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution does not create or form the basis for liabi lity on the
part of the County, its agents, or agencies. The exclusive remedy for violation of this Resolution shall be
through the County's disciplinary procedures for officers and employees under regulations including, but
not limited to, County personnel rules, union contracts, civil service commission rules, or any other agency
rules and/or regulations. Any person alleging a violation of this Resolution shall forward a complaint to
the Cook County Office of the Inspector General ("Inspector General") who shall process it in accordance
with the complaint-processing procedures established in the Cook County Code (Vol. I, Ch. 2, Art. IV,
Div. 5, Sec. 2-285); and

2134

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that any applications, questionnaires and interview forms used in
relation to Cook County benefits, opportunities or services shall be promptly reviewed by the pertinent
agencies, and any questions requiring disclosure of infonnation related to citizenship or immigrant status,
other than those (a) permitted by this Resolution to require the disclosure of such information or (b)
otherwise required by law, shall be, in the best judgment of the pertinent agency, either deleted in its
entirety or revised such that the disclosure is no longer required. Such review and revision shall be
completed within ninety (90) days of the passage of this Resolution.

WHEREAS, Almighty God in His Infinite Wisdom has called Yolanda Denise King from our midst; and

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2007

WHEREAS, Ms. King, the first-born child of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott
King, was raised and came of age in the crucible of the United States Civil Rights Movement - from the
bombing of her parents' home when she was just two months old to the time she was barred from an
amusement park as a young child because of her color to the times she walked in Civil Rights marches;
and
WHEREAS, Ms. King never put down the torch; she embraced her legacy; after graduating from Smith
College and New York University, she found a varied path as an actress, producer, author, lecturer and
advocate for peace and nonviolence, seeking to infuse all of her work with the deeper purpose of her
family; and
WHEREAS, Ms. King wrote, produced and acted in the theater and in numerous films, helping to bring
the reality of the Civil Rights Movement to the screen for ensuing generations; her refined dignity shines
through in film portrayals which include the legendary Rosa Parks and Betty Shabazz, the wife of
Malcolm X; and
WHEREAS, Ms. King spoke of memories of being "tremendously loved" by her father whom she lost
when she was twelve; she doubtless drew on this pure love in the founding of Higher Ground Productions,
which she envisioned as a "gateway to peace, unity and global transformation; and
