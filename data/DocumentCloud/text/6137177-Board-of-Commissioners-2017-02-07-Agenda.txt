BOARD AGENDA

February 7, 2017

WHEREAS, the leadership and commitment of Chairman and Owner Tom Ricketts to invest in the
Cubs’ long-term growth, starting with President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein, who brought a
proven winning track record and attention to detail, set the stage to turn the Cubs from the lovable losers
that caused yearly heartbreak to its devoted fans into a world-class, championship organization; and
WHEREAS, in his second season as manager, Joe Maddon guided the Cubs to 103 victories; the best
record in the major leagues, finishing a dominant 17½ games ahead of the Central Division runner-up
and long-time rivals the St. Louis Cardinals; making it the first 100+ win season the Cubs have had since
1935 and marking the most victories the team has had since 1910; and
WHEREAS, the 2016 Chicago Cubs featured a star-studded roster led by a dominating pitching staff
including 2015 Cy Young winner Jake Arietta, 2016 Cy Young candidates Kyle Hendricks and Jon

Jr., Miguel Montero, David Ross, Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber, Chris Coghlan, Munenori
Kawasaki, Tommy La Stella, Matt Szczur, Jorge Soler, Joe Smith, Rob Zastryzny and World Series MVP
Ben Zobrist; and
WHEREAS, the historic 2016 season saw the Cubs win their first National League Pennant in 7l years
and marked the Cubs' first appearance in the World Series since 1945 and their first World Series victory
since 1908; and
WHEREAS, the World Series win was especially poignant for the countless long-time Cubs fans who
were overcome with emotion, remembering family members, fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers who
were no longer here to witness the triumph, and for the generations of fans, many of whom came to
Chicago from around the country and around the world, even without tickets to any of the games, solely
to experience what they knew in their hearts was history in the making; and
WHEREAS, in the playoffs, the Cubs faced and defeated two historic and highly regarded California
franchises, the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series and the Los Angeles
Dodgers in the National League Championship Series; and
WHEREAS, the World Series pitted our Chicago Cubs against the Cleveland Indians, who themselves
had a historic run through the playoffs, in one of the most exciting and heart-wrenching match-ups in
baseball history; and
WHEREAS, the World Series saw the Cubs down 3 games to 1, a deficit only 5 teams have previously
overcome in World Series history, but the resilient and unshakeable Cubs never lost their confidence and
roared back to win the next 3 games; and
WHEREAS, as was fitting of a World Series of such epic proportions, the championship came down to

a Game 7 pitting Cubs' pitching ace Kyle Hendricks, owner of the lowest ERA (2.13) in Major League
Baseball in 2016, against Cleveland ace pitcher Corey Kluber, who had already won Games 2 and 4 of
the World Series. The Cubs started the scoring quickly with a Dexter Fowler lead-off home run. After six
innings, the Cubs held on to a 6-3 lead, but in the bottom of the eighth, the Indians tied the game with a
rally that featured a two-run home run. At the end of nine innings, the score was still tied 6 to 6 sending
the final game of the baseball season into extra innings. After a seventeen-minute rain delay, the 10th
inning started and the Cubs scored two runs on a double by Ben Zobrist and a single by Miguel Montero.
The club’s place in history was etched in the bottom of the tenth inning, when following a Cleveland run,
the Cubs got the final out, winning the game 8 to 7, and sending shockwaves and tears around the globe.
Baseball experts agree that Game 7 will go down in history as one of the most dramatic and thrilling in
the annals of the World Series and in sports itself; and
WHEREAS, all of Chicago and Cook County are proud of the great accomplishments of the 2016
Chicago Cubs and wish them continuing success and championships in future seasons;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby congratulate Owner Tom Ricketts, President of Baseball Operations, Theo
Epstein, President of Business Operations, Crane Kenney, the Chicago Cubs players and staff on an
exceptional 2016 season that will deservedly be forever glorified in Major League Baseball; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this resolution be presented to the Chicago
Cubs organization as a token of our heartfelt congratulations.
