So on October 1st of 2017, CPS published
draft guidelines for school actions.

3

December 1st, 2017, CPS proposed school

4

actions and sent notice letters and draft transition

5

plans.

6

In January 2018 CPS holds two community

7

meetings and one public hearing prior to any

8

recommendations to the Board.

February 2018 or later CPS makes

10

recommendations to Board after community meeting or

19

Before the start of the 2017-18 school

20

year, the LSC at Castellanos voted to request that

21

the Principal of Cardenas serve over both schools.

22
23
24

On August 22nd, 2017, the Principal of
Cardenas began serving over Castellanos.
And on November 2nd, 2017, both LSCs

TOOMEY REPORTING

requested a full consolidation of both schools.

2

Cardenas currently serves 555 students.

3

Castellanos currently serves 601

students.
And Cardenas and Castellanos attendance

areas will be unaffected since both schools serve

22

I

It's

So during this process of the

23

consolidation of the proposal, I have asked myself

24

several questions about what it means to have this

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 15
1

consolidation beyond the participants that are

2

supporting it and who are present in the meeting in

3

the LSC, who are present today and who were here

4

last week.

5

So I also started to compare in the City

6

of Chicago with other communities, and I have

7

learned that in other communities where they have

8

Jenner & Ogden, they proposed a consolidation two

9

years ago, and that proposal was presented, and then

10

there was a long term.

11

had a committee with parents, teachers, members of

12

the community, members of community organizations,

13

members of organizations who have met each week to

14

create a transition plan that represents the needs

15

of the students, the needs of the parents, and that

16

they should consider the budget that is going to be

17

lost as a result of this consolidation.

18

The last two years they have

So they are asking, through the community

19

proposal, $1.8 million for the consolidation.

have asked myself why here.

kind of money.

negatively affect the kids, but sometimes you hear

people say, oh, they're coming from Cardenas, and

sometimes they're going to disconnect from where the

main concern is, number one, we've been doing a

really great job under Dr. Feiwell.

that there's been a simultaneous shift.

easy going.

19

which is 2018-2019.

20

there won't be a shift in money.

like two years or three years down the road, because

that is going to affect us in terms of case manager,

from now how the funding is going, where that money

3

is going to come from.

4

Just a final comment, I think it's really

great that teachers, community members, parents are

all here showing that they're obviously concerned

7

about the education here in the community.

informed.

16

MS. MARTINEZ:

17

I'm sorry, your name?
Martinez.

I heard right now there's going to be one

18

19

without a principal, I want to know why did you not

20

you had the money there that was used to pay the

previous principal.

from this side, and my kids would have to come to

2

3

That's why I want to know a little more,

4

what's the motive, what's the reason why, when you

5

were left without a principal, why you wouldn't get

6

another one.

7

encountered, what were the different options that

8

you looked into?

What were the diversities you

You can talk with them in here or

MS. GARCIA:

So I am Rocio Garcia from ENLACE

7

Chicago.

8

just a little bit about the plan of transition the

9

community has created.

I'm with you again.

So as I was saying,

This transition plan

10

includes a lot of considerations and questions and

11

worries that parents have.

12

been more opportunity for these questions, these

13

uncertainties, these doubts and questions.

14

continue to exist, and maybe we could develop them

better.

It's been presented and voted on in the

It's not elected by us.

It's

So right now we

We saw that Forrest

of CPS, Janice Jackson, and she also shouldn't be

2

there.

3

We also see that CPS is under

4

investigation at a state level because of a policy.

5

There's a policy they have around special education.

6

So how can we have so much faith in CPS and the

7

school board when it comes to the future of our kids

8

and the students in the CPS schools, especially

9

Castellanos and Cardenas, which represent more than

10
11

1,200 students.
I'm asking you all to consider what are

12

the other things that we want and what are the other

13

things that you want.

14

parents, students, teachers from Castellanos and

15

Cardenas schools, you are prepared and ready to ask

16

questions and to demand of CPS what else do you want

17

because that consolidation in the future of CPS,

18

they're going to end up saving money off of the

19

backs of your kids and your students.

MS. MURTAUGH:

Good evening.

My name is Maura

2

Murtaugh.

3

like to do is I'd like to comment on two different

4

points.

5

when we're talking about consolidation is that we

6

want our kids to receive the best education

7

possible.

8

record over the last 10 to 12 years, you would see

9

the amount of gains and improvements that the kids

10
11

I'm a teacher of Castellanos.

What I'd

One is that I think our primary purpose

I think, if you look at Cardenas's track

have made.
I think you've heard from the assistant

12

principal here about how well Dr. Feiwell has worked

13

with the administration and the teachers here to

14

make sure that the same things that are going on to

15

improve education at Cardenas are also being

16

extended to here.

17

The second thing I'd like to comment on

18

is that people have said that consolidations usually

19

take more time and are we rushing into this.

20

difference with this consolidation is that we are

21

talking about families and community members that

22

are from the same attendance boundaries.

23

consolidations that doesn't happen.

24

two different attendance boundaries being

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

The

In other

It's usually

 January 16, 2018
Page 24
1

consolidated, and we don't have to overcome that

2

barrier.

3

And in terms of budgeting, I think it's a

4

very fair question to raise because obviously we

5

want our kids to have all the resources that they

6

have, and we want to make sure that the money

7

deserved comes to us.

8

we consolidate, our attendance is larger, right?

9

the school base budgeting is based on how many kids

But I will also say that if

10

we have at both schools just like other large

11

schools in the district.

12

So

So I think it's very important to pay

13

close attention to the parents who have had children

14

at Cardenas and at Castellanos as well.

15

really the voices of what they think is best for

16

their kids in the community.

17

of weight in my opinion.

18

They are

That voice holds a lot

TOOMEY REPORTING

Thank you for

that we are proposing.

2

here, I've heard that everybody is looking at it on

3

the side of money and the side of things not

4

working.

5

and I have 10 years that I've been working in

6

Cardenas school together with the principal and with

7

the teachers here.

8

Castellanos with the teachers and the community.

9

I think that the message

I have 12 years in Chicago Public Schools,

And I've also worked here at

The only thing I can tell you is both of

10

the two councils, they always prioritize the kids,

11

which is the same priority that the principal has.

12

When the parents unite, when the committees work

13

together, I think that's what we can achieve.

14

can achieve what's best for our students.

15

We

We don't want them to go to other

16

communities because our future is here in our

17

neighborhood where they have to have our kids, where

18

they have to have our money, where we're going to be

working so the kids leave here with the same

very united, and it's a very nice community or

3

The only thing that I have noticed is

4

that if you look at CPS, their Web site, and you

5

look at the percentage of kids who are in the math

6

club, well, Cardenas consistently has done well in

7

the math club for kids.

8

Castellanos, the kids have had a math club, and that

9

is reflected when they go to Castellanos.

10

But when you look at

As a mother at Castellanos and Cardenas,

11

actually, that has been a concern for me.

12

consolidation means that our kids are going to be

13

the same kind of education and curriculum that has

14

helped them to learn to read and do math at a higher

15

level.

So the

16

I am concerned about the budget, what

17

they have said about it, but what worries me the

18

most is when kids go from 3rd grade to this school,

19

the curriculum changes, and that gets reflected in

20

terms of percentages for math.

21

important that this consolidation is possible so the

22

kids continue to have the same kind of curriculum

23

and education that has been shown that they have in

reading and mathematics in the same level.
