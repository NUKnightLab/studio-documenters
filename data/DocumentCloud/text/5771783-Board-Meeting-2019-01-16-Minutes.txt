Public Comment

Garland is concerned for paratransit taxi riders. When he and his wife take paratransit
taxi rides, a larger vehicle is needed because of his wife?s oversize wheelchair. Sometimes the
wrong size taxi vehicle arrives and his wife?s oversize wheelchair is dif?cult to or has to be

folded and squeezed into the vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. have been appointed to the CMAP
Citizen?s Advisory Committee that will be meeting in March 2019. Mrs. had a
birthday on New Year?s day, and on January 29th they are celebrating their 15th anniversary.

Steve Figva commented about the TAP program. The vehicles for the TAP program and
open taxis are getting older. Scott needs an as he has trouble squeezing into one of the
small minivans. He recently had a driver that was very rude and very temperamental to him, and
Scott had to tell him to leave. Scott could not ?t into the vehicle. The driver wanted him to spin
and face forward, but Scott cannot turn around in a small minivan. Please see about getting larger
vans for larger chairs, or a more open vehicle. Also, drivers need to be trained better in how to
handle people.

Chairman Kwasneski apologized for the driver incident and stated someone will look into that.
He asked Melinda Metzger if Pace is addressing the issue of getting larger vehicles. Melinda said
the City of Chicago handles that for the Taxi program. Pace handles the mechanism to ride the
taxis. Under ADA legislation, there are certain dimensions that are required under the ADA that
must be met for vehicle size, and weight of riders and their equipment. Pace vehicles meet those,
but on the taxi side, the City dictates the type of equipment. Pace will pass along the information
to the City.

Report of Chairman

Chairman Kwasneski reported that he went with Rocky Donahue to attend the swearing in of the
new legislature last week and met with a lot of the new legislators and some of the existing ones,
especially some of the transportation chairs and so forth. The Chairman believes there will be a
capital bill, details are sketchy, but it probably won?t happen until May. Transit is something, he
believes, that all of the legislators are interested in funding. Pace will hopefully fare well in the
process depending on what is negotiated.

Pace needs to do some outreach, which he and Rocky have started, but will need everyone?s help
as well. There are 50 new legislators, not all from our area, but a number are new. They may
know nothing about Pace, or they may know a lot. Pace?s objective is to try to meet with a lot of
those legislators, make sure they understand Pace?s needs, and what type of services Pace
provides, etc. Rocky will reach out some of you have existing relationships
with some legislators, or if you want to participate in any of the meetings.

Directors? Reports

was in Spring?eld the last two weeks. The ?rst week was spent advocating for a Capital Bill. It
appears the Governor wants to make sure he has a budget in place ?rst. Director Hastings was
also in Spring?eld and spent time with Rocky meeting with Senator Mike Hastings about capital.

Rocky continued Pace?s external outreach regarding capital. A number of articles were printed in
the Tribune, Sun Times, the Daily Herald. Pace appeared on WBBM Radio, CBS, ABC, and
WGN TV. Staff is updating you on the clips.

Pace expects to end 2018 with approximately a $5 million positive budget variance for suburban
service. Much credit is given to the Board insuring Pace?s ?scal responsibility to the tax payers.
Pace also expects million positive budget variance for the ADA budget. End of the year
expenses are still coming in and outside auditors are still working on this.

Pace is holding public hearings on February 11 in Bolingbrook, and February 12 at Toyota Park
on a proposed restructuring of the 1-55 Bus on Shoulder service. Pace has seen incredible growth
on 1-55 and is at capacity and experiencing overcrowding. Staff has put together a plan to
reallocate resources to try to help some overcrowding and shift some service out of Bolingbrook
to Romeoville to free up some parking issues. A report on the public hearings will be brought to
the board. No cuts to the services are expected, but rather this is an enhancement.

Rocky introduced Renaldo Dixon, Department Manager of Budget Planning who celebrated his
40th anniversary with Pace on January 12, 2019. Renaldo is truly an asset to this agency.
