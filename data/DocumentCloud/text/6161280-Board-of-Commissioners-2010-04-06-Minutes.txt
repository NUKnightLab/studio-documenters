SECOND INSTALLMENT TAX BILLS
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 31, 2010 from
JOHN P. DALEY, Chairman, Committee on Finance
I am requesting that the following letters from the Chief of Staff for President Stroger, Board of Review,
Assessor, County Clerk and Treasurer be placed on the Agenda for the April 6, 2010 Board meeting for
discussion purposes. The members of the Board of Review, County Assessor, County Clerk and County
Treasurer are requested to attend the April 6, 2010 Board Meeting.
LETTER FROM THE CHIEF OF STAFF
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2010 from
JOSEPH M. FRATTO, Chief of Staff
Pursuant to Cook County Board Resolution, representatives of the Office of the President, Assessor,
Board of Review, Treasurer and County Clerk have met to discuss the Second Installment Property Tax
Billing process. Please accept this correspondence as a report of the matters addressed and status of the
parties involved as it relates to issues surrounding property tax assessment, appeals and billing.

6

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
First and foremost, it is important to note that President Todd H. Stroger and the Office of the President
has extended the County’s OPTIMA program as well as the services provided by EKI to assist the above
listed offices in better understanding its workflow processes as it relates to the property tax process,
including but not limited to, assessment, appeals and billing. Taking advantage of these services should
assist the above listed offices in streamlining their processes and understanding and increasing
productivity which could result in a streamlined, cost effective and timely process. It is anticipated that
the above listed offices will take advantage of this opportunity to improve its operations.
In addition to efforts to streamline, reduce costs and improve the assessment, review/appeal process and
timeliness of Second Installment Property Tax Bill issuance, the parties have discussed increasing the
number of property tax installments, engaging the services of outside professionals to conduct hearings
and serve as hearing examiners, developing a training program for hearing examiners in order to engage
qualified outside hearing examiners to conduct hearings when dealing with a high volume of appeals,
conducting additional hearings to reduce the time period that is necessary to address the appeals and
engaging in statutory review to determine whether legislative amendments can assist in the streamlining
of the property tax assessment, appeal and/or billing process.
In addition to the above, the Office of the President has requested information regarding the anticipated
completion dates of processes required by the Assessor and Board of Review in order to complete the
second installment property tax bills and has requested that that the Board of Review and Assessor
provide any requests/justification for additional revenue that may be needed in order to complete the
second installment data/property tax bills in a timely fashion.
The parties have met and are in the process of addressing the above listed issues and strategizing as to
ways to provide for the timely issuance of the 2009 Second Installment Property Tax Bills; however it is
important to note that the Board of Review has sent “Notice” to the Board of Commissioners that the
Board of Review anticipates a delay in the 2009 Second Installment Tax Bills and that it anticipates a due
date later than December 1st. This March 25, 2010 correspondence from the Board of Review alleges
various causes for the anticipated delay including, but not limited to timeliness of the Assessor’s Office
completing the 2009 assessments. In response to the Board of Review’s letter, the Assessor
communicated with the Board of Commissioners on March 29, 2010 to address its assessment process
and valid implementation of the 10/25 Ordinance.
While it is anticipated that the parties will continue to work together to timely issue the 2009 and future
second installment property tax bills and take advantage of the data that can be compiled and understood
from engaging the services of EKI to improve the overall workflow and assessment, appeal and billing
processes, it is imperative that the Board of Commissioners hear from both the Board of Review and
Assessor and have the opportunity to discuss the respective positions of the Board of Review, Assessor
and Board of Commissioners.
Submitted herewith, please find copies of the Board of Review’s March 25, 2010 correspondence and
Assessor’s March 29, 2010 correspondence for Board of Commissioner review and discussion. The
Office of the President will request the attendance of the Assessor, Commissioners of the Board of
Review, the County Clerk and the County Treasurer at the April 6, 2010 Board Meeting in order to
provide the Board of Commissioners an opportunity to discuss the timeliness of the 2009 Second
Installment Property Tax Bills and the issues raised by the respective parties.
LETTER FROM THE BOARD OF REVIEW
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 25, 2010 from

BRENDAN F. HOULIHAN, Commissioner, Board of Review
JOSEPH BERRIOS, Commissioner, Board of Review
Re:

Notice - The Assessor’s Delay in Processing the 2009 Assessments and the Assessor’s Erroneous
Implementation of the 10/25 Ordinance will Cause Second Installment 2009 Tax Bills to be Late.

Please let this correspondence serve as formal notice from the Commissioners of the Cook
County Board of Review that we have every indication that the 2009 Second Installment Tax Bills will
have a due date later than last year’s due date of December 1st. The cause of the delay is attributable to
(1) the Assessor’s significant delay in finishing the 2009 assessment and sending completed townships on
a timely basis to the Board of Review; and (2) the dramatic increase in appeals caused by the Assessor’s
erroneous implementation of the 10/25 Ordinance.
Attached for your reference are several documents that may help to shed light on this matter.
[See back-up material previously distributed for footnote information]. The attachments include:
a. November 3, 2009 BOR correspondence responding to Hon. John Daley, Chairman of the
Finance Committee;
b. January 12, 2010 BOR correspondence to the Assessor requesting information regarding
increases in Non-triennial market values;
c. February 26, 2010 Assessor’s response to the BOR’s January 12, 2010 correspondence;
d. Legal motion tendered by taxpayers to void non-triennial market value increases as a matter of
law; and
e. Summons issued to Assessor and senior personnel to appear at a hearing before the Board of
Review relative to the motion to void non-triennial market value increases as a matter of law.
I.

The Assessor’s delayed processing and turnover of townships to the Board of Review will cause
tax bills to be late.

As of March 24, 2010, the Assessor has not turned over the following seventeen (17) townships
to the Cook County Board of Review (*indicates reassessment township):
Wheeling
Palatine
Proviso
Lyons
New Trier
Orland

Worth
Hanover
Bloom
Lemont
Thornton
Schaumburg

Northfield
West Chicago*
South Chicago*
North Chicago*
Lake*

Representatives of the Assessor have stated that the Assessor will not conclude his 2009 assessment
process by May 2010. The Assessor has also made representations that his process will not conclude
before July 2010. For context, the Assessor completed his process of sending all 38 townships to the
Board of Review for the 2008 reassessment by April 15, 2009. The Board of Review’s entire process
including its filing period, hearings, review, and balancing takes approximately 2 ½ to 3 months from the
date a township is opened for filing. If the Assessor closes by July 1st this year, the earliest the Board of
Review could conclude its review would be the middle of September or beginning of October. From the
date the Board of Review certifies completion of its appeals, it takes approximately 3 additional months
until the tax bill due date. In 2008, however, the Board of Review certified completion of its appeals on
July 30, 2009 and the tax bill due date was December 1, 2009. Clearly, when the Assessor adds several
months to complete his process the impact on a late Second Installment bill is undeniable.

8

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

II. The Assessor’s failure to equitably implement the 10/25 Ordinance will (a) cause tax bills to be
late; and (b) will cause a tax shift from non-residential property owners to residential property
owners.
As the enclosed attachment of the Board of Review’s January 12, 2010 correspondence to the
Assessor details, the 10/25 Ordinance has been misapplied as it artificially increases the market values of
non-triennial properties. Consequently, this erroneous implementation of an otherwise lawful Ordinance
has created the basis for tens-of-thousands otherwise baseless appeals to the Board of Review. The
Assessor has failed to support his increased market values in disregard of the Board of Review’s formal
request to provide that specific data. No reports, methodology, market data, property sales, property
income, nor other meaningful data has been provided in response to the Board of Review’s formal
request. Moreover, no representative of the Assessor has appeared to defend a single assessment at
hearing despite the Board of Review’s formal request that the Assessor participate and defend increases in
non-triennial market values.
Unfortunately, there are also significant legal contentions before our agency regarding the
constitutionality and legality of the notice provided by the Assessor to taxpayers in conjunction with the
10/25 Ordinance. Nearly all triennial reassessment notices indicate that the assessment has been lowered
from the previous year or has stayed the same with no increase. None of the notices of assessment
disclose what the prior level of assessment was compared to the new 2009 level of assessment. None of
the notices of assessment identify that the market value has increased in 2009. All of the assessment
notices to homeowners include a press release indicating, “Due to this first-ever downward market
adjustment, residential properties in each suburban township will receive adjustments of their assessed
values.” The press release goes on to state, “These market reductions come as the Assessor’s Office is
implementing the 10/25 Ordinance.” In sum, the legal challenges before us boil down to whether a
reasonable person reading their notice of assessment in conjunction with the enclosed press release would
have notice that their market values increased substantially. We are concerned because the terms
“downward market adjustment” and “market reductions” used by the Assessor certainly would appear to
lead a homeowner to the conclusion that their property’s market value has decreased in the absence of
anything to the contrary on the face of the notice or the accompanying press release. The Assessor states
in his correspondence responding to the Board of Review’s request for support of increased market
values, “While there may be some initial challenges, the Ordinance will offer the transparency that
taxpayers need to make well informed decisions related to their property tax assessments.” We disagree.
There is a valid argument that most taxpayers will not realize that market values have increased until after
there is a shift in tax burden and it is too late for them to exercise their right to appeal. Lawyers
representing taxpayers however face malpractice suits if they do not appeal an artificial increase in market
value. Based upon our review of appeals this session, we anticipate that virtually every commercial
property of significant value will appeal the increase in market value caused by the Assessor’s application
of the 10/25 Ordinance. The 10/25 Ordinance as implemented is misleading, it is not revenue neutral, and
it does make the Assessor’s value transparent.
As you are aware, the Board of Review is a quasi-judicial body. We have made every effort to
respect the Assessor’s role and authority, the lawfully enacted “10/25 Ordinance”, and to avoid any
influence in the Assessor’s implementation of the “10/25 Ordinance”. Subsequently, we have reviewed
thousands of matters, conducted hundreds if not thousands of oral hearings, which create the
overwhelming presumption that the Assessor’s implementation and applications of an otherwise lawful
Ordinance is materially flawed and will cause far reaching undesirable consequences.
We are available to discuss these very important matters in greater detail at your convenience.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY ASSESSOR
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 29, 2010 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor
On Friday March 26, Joe Fratto convened a meeting of representatives of the Cook County Board
President’s Office, the Commissioners of the Board of Review, and the Assessor’s Office to review issues
regarding the timing of tax bills. Later that day, the Board of Review sent you a letter highly critical of
the Assessor’s Office, having said nothing at the Fratto meeting pertaining to the concerns expressed in
the letter.
First, the letter accused our office of being wholly responsible for what the BOR predicted will be a delay
in 2010 second-installment tax bills.
Remember, this is the same Board that testified at their budget hearing that the Assessor’s Office was
responsible for the delay in 2009 tax bills. As you will also recall, the Board of Review admitted at that
same budget hearing in October that they had received completed townships from the Assessor’s Office
which they had not even opened for processing. The Board opened those townships the following day.
To date, the Board of Review has not closed and returned any of the 21 completed townships received
from the Assessor’s Office. Six of the more recent townships we have sent them have not even been
opened at the Board of Review.
Second, the Board accused the Assessor of improperly implementing the 10/25 Ordinance, which the
Board of Commissioners passed in 2008. After ignoring prior opportunities to present information to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners regarding the ordinance, the Board of Review now, at the 11th
hour, raises objections to its implementation.
Passing the 10/25 Ordinance was the correct thing to do. As Civic Federation President Laurence Msall
said when speaking in support of it at the Board’s September 2008 Finance Committee Meeting, the
ordinance “will be a positive step in providing transparency.”
It is difficult to understand the Board of Review’s thinking in presenting these irresponsible, reckless
accusations. With regard to their assertions and their seriousness, I suggest that the Board of
Commissioners put this matter on the agenda for the April 6 meeting so that the Commissioners can
evaluate these purported concerns in detail. We, for our part, will have the chance to refute these claims.
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY CLERK
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 31, 2010 from
DAVID ORR, Cook County Clerk
In light of the correspondence from the other tax offices, let me add a brief comment regarding the timing
of second installment tax bills. The clerk’s office plays a small but critical role in the process—analyzing
taxing district levies and deriving tax rates from the levies and the total district equalized assessed value.
Our work focuses on processing local government ordinances, levies and bonds until the moment when it
culminates in the rate calculations. This happens only when assessments are finalized, all exemptions

applied and final taxable values for each district are set. Once the district values are set, we begin
calculating tax rates.
Since tax caps were enacted for Cook County, this calculation process has taken about three weeks each
year. This is three weeks out of an overall process that takes many months.
I am keenly aware of the importance of getting the tax bills out on time to minimize trouble for the taxing
bodies. This is especially important given the incredible state deficit, which means many of these taxing
bodies’ state money will be delayed and/or reduced.
LETTER FROM THE COOK COUNTY TREASURER
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 15, 2010 from
MARIA PAPPAS, Cook County Treasurer
We cannot get bills out unless we have figures. When we get figures we will advise you.
Please consult elected officials who are part of the avalanche of appeals.

RESOLUTION REGARDING TRANSPARENCY
IN THE COUNTY BIDDING PROCESS
WHEREAS, in recent years, due to questionable ethical practices in all levels of government, there has
been a movement towards creating greater government transparency and accountability; and
WHEREAS, Cook County should continue to make as much of its government as transparent and
accountable as possible; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s current bidding process is outdated and mysterious to most people; and
WHEREAS, the current bidding process, with its handwritten bids, makes for messy and sometimes
indecipherable bids; and
WHEREAS, in this day and age, Cook County should be responsible and ethical enough, to have an open
and fair bidding process; and
WHEREAS, an online submission of the bids and what they contain is the best way to make the process
transparent to the public and to demonstrate that no favoritism or collusion took place in the process; and

15

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
WHEREAS, an online bidding process will provide clean and easy to read bids, allowing the public to
see and understand what the County contracts bid out for and how the County is spending their tax
dollars; and
WHEREAS, an online bidding process will help bidders to understand why their bid did, or did not, win
and to see if any changes are made to any of the bids prior to the bid being awarded; and
WHEREAS, a transparent and open bidding process is an excellent way to show the public that Cook
County is ethical and fair in the awarding of contracts.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners requests the
Office of the Purchasing Agent, with assistance from the Bureau of Technology and the Bureau of
Finance, create a report to be presented to the Board of Commissioners, no later than April 30, 2010,
regarding the feasibility and cost of moving to an online bidding process; and

WHEREAS, this year the Jewish Holy Day and Festival of Pesach (Passover) is honored beginning at
sunset on Monday, March 29, 2010 and continuing through Tuesday, April 6, 2010 at sundown; and
WHEREAS, Passover commemorates God’s sparing of the Israelites, their liberation from slavery, and
their exodus from Egypt; and
WHEREAS, in the Biblical story of Exodus, God inflicted ten plagues upon the Egyptians before the
Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth plague was the killing of firstborn sons; the Israelites,
however, were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a Spring lamb and, upon
seeing this, God passed over these homes, hence the origin of the name, “Passover;” and
WHEREAS, Passover is also called “The Festival of Unleavened Bread,” for when the Pharaoh freed the
Israelites, it has been said that the Israelites left so quickly that they had no time to let their bread rise;
therefore, the unleavened matzoh became one of a number of symbolic foods eaten during Passover and,
as the primary symbol of the holiday, is eaten instead of bread throughout the eight days of Passover; and
WHEREAS, during Passover Jewish families gather in their homes at a ceremonial feast called the
Seder; at the Seder, Jews read aloud the story of the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land from the
traditional book known as the Haggadah.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, along with the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize the Jewish Holy Day and Festival of
Passover, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of this Holy Day and Festival, which are deeply
cherished and almost universally observed by members of the Jewish faith.

WHEREAS, Christianity’s most important holiday, Easter, falls this year on Sunday, April 4th;
sometimes referred to as a “moveable feast,” Easter does not fall on a set date each year; rather, Christian
churches in the West celebrate Easter on the first Sunday following the full moon after the vernal equinox
on March 21; and
WHEREAS, on Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ; according to
Christian scripture, Jesus Christ came back to life three days after his death on the cross; the Biblical
account of this can be found in the following passages: Matthew 27:27-28:8; Mark 15:16-16:19; Luke
23:26-24:35 and John 19:16-20:30; and
WHEREAS, the Friday just prior to Easter is called Good Friday; on this Holy Day the crucifixion of
Jesus Christ is commemorated; and
WHEREAS, in Western Christianity, Easter marks the ending of Lent; Lent, which begins on Ash
Wednesday 40 days prior to Easter, is a period of fasting, repentance, and spiritual discipline during
which one prepares for Easter; and
WHEREAS, Christian scripture teaches that through his death, burial and resurrection, Jesus paid the
penalty for human sin, thus providing eternal life for all who would believe in him.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, along with the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more
than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby recognize April 4, 2010 as the Christian Holy Day
of Easter, and do urge all residents to be cognizant of this Holy Day, which is deeply cherished and

including health care, community development, housing, education, transportation, social services and
employment matters, and much more; and

and
WHEREAS, a united, trusted voice from business, government, community-based and faith-based
organizations, educators, media and others will allow the 2010 Census message to reach a broader

been fully engaged in high-intensity outreach and will continue to disseminate 2010 Census information
to encourage people in our community to participate; and

CONSOLIDATION OF COOK COUNTY’S TECHNOLOGY
WHEREAS, Cook County has struggled for years to seek out the best approach to address the
technology requirements of all entities under the auspices of the County; and
WHEREAS, there has been resistance among some elected officials to consolidate into the County’s
main technology system due to concerns with privacy; and

26

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

WHEREAS, it has become evident that the County cannot continue financially to fund separate or
proprietary technology plans for different agencies and departments under the umbrella of the County;
and
WHEREAS, technology funding outside of the Bureau of Technology is significant: automation funding
is $30 million with 240 FTE’s; document storage costs are $26 million with 192 FTE’s; and technology
related to the 260 and 579 accounts is over $50 million annually; and
WHEREAS, it is clear that consolidation across all areas of technology will improve efficiencies and
save the County money, in 2010 the Bureau of Technology will save $700,000 by consolidating the
iSeries system into the mainframe and $450,000 by transitioning phone system maintenance to existing
staff; and
WHEREAS, of paramount importance in the consolidation process are privacy issues for independent
elected officials, and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of important information. The Bureau of
Technology has already proven this can be accomplished as has been done in Maricopa, Los Angeles and
Miami Dade Counties in their IT consolidation programs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board previously approved the consolidated approach to hardware,
software and technology related services, the County must now take the next step to consolidate all
technology investments, systems and applications.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Bureau of Technology will prepare to centralize
technology throughout the County by: preparing an Enterprise Architectural Plan for all County IT
operations; consolidate all IT spending including oversight of special purpose funds; continue to build a
disaster recovery site; convert historical paper records to electronic format; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all departments, bureaus and agencies under the President, and all
office of County Elected Officials, are hereby directed to provide the Chief Information Officer, on or
before April 20, 2010, with detailed information identifying all county staff who are employed in
automation or technology related jobs, by job titles and position codes from the 2010 Executive Budget
and including the sources of funding for their salary (general funds, grant funds or special purpose funds)
and a description of their duties and responsibilities as they pertain to information technology; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Information Officer will prepare a report containing an
analysis of the information collected under this directive, said report to be submitted to the President and
Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Thursday, March 25, 2010 at the hour of 1:00 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
305673

INNOVATIVE INTERFACES, INC. (PROPOSED CONTRACT). Transmitting a
Communication from Bennie E. Martin, Executive Law Librarian, Cook County Law
Library:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with
INNOVATIVE INTERFACES, INC., Emeryville, California, to lease its Millennium
system, an automated integrated library management system, and for services from the
company associated with installation of the system, including project management,
software configuration, training, implementation, consulting, data loading and maintenance
services.

36

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
Reason:

The Millennium system will replace the existing system, which was installed
in 1992, and is no longer supported by its vendor, and is inadequate for the
Library's needs. The new system will integrate the library's processes for
acquisition, check-in, cataloging, and payment of library materials, not all of
which are currently automated. It will also produce a web-based, online public
access catalog of the library's holdings.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. was selected through a Request for Proposal (RFP)
process per County requirements. This vendor can fulfill the specialized
automation requirements of a large county law library, migrate the
bibliographic data for this large collection from the current system to theirs,
and grow with the changes in the legal publishing and legal research worlds to
continue to meet the needs of the Cook County Law Library and its patrons.
Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has worked with other county law libraries.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $335,904.00 (FY 2010 - $112,730.00; FY 2011 - $70,476.00; FY
2012 - $70,476.00; FY 2013 - $70,476.00; and FY 2014 - $11,746.00). Contract period:
May 1, 2010 through April 30, 2015. (530-579 Account). Requisition No. 05300001.
Sufficient funds are available through the Cook County Law Library Fund.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with the technical aspect
of this recommendation.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 03/16/10.
Commissioner Suffredin asked for an explanation of the contract that is being requested by the Law
Library and how it will provide services to the citizens of Cook County.
Bennie Martin, Executive Law Librarian, responded: The contract with Innovative Interfaces is to replace
the online management system that is currently in place. The new system will allow us to provide greater
support for the librarian, the cardholders, the card catalogue, and for the citizens to be able to access the
materials online and eventually for individuals to be able to dial up to access the library materials.
Furthermore, it will assist the Law Library in managing the system in the sense that the Law Library takes
in from 90,000 to 100,000 pieces of material per year which need to be recorded, documented, and
processed. Additionally, it will allow the Law Library to report on utilization of the library’s resources.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved the approval of
Communication No. 305673. The motion carried.
305674

WHEREAS, thirteen dollars has been inadequate in defraying the costs of operating and

includes both print and electronic legal information and research assistance they would not
be able to access anywhere else; and

citizens with access to over a quarter of a million print titles and several online legal
databases and with seven branch libraries, it is the only law library in the area that is freely
available to all people without restriction; and

Commissioner Gorman asked about the revenue projections.
Mr. Martin replied that with each $1 increase, the Law Library projected that there would be a net gain in
revenue of $300,000. Given the shortfall that the Law Library has of approximately $1.2 million, the
additional $5.00 would give the Law Library the monies needed in order to balance their budget without
any additional support from the County’s corporate fund.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved that the Ordinance
Amendment (Communication No. 305674) be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

SECTION 3.

PRIOR INCONSISTENT PROCEEDINGS.

All ordinances, resolutions, motions or orders, or parts thereof, in conflict with the

SECTION 4. PASSAGE AND APPROVAL.
PRESENTED, PASSED, APPROVED AND RECORDED by The County of Cook, Illinois,
a home rule unit of government, this _____ day of ________, 2010.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 03/16/10.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the Proposed Ordinance
Amendment (Communication No. 305686) be approved.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that there will be amendments introduced, but at this time he
would like to have Jaye Morgan Williams, Chief Financial Officer, address the Committee.
Chairman Daley stated that during the budget hearings there were opportunities to present questions
regarding the capital budget. Chairman Daley stated further that the Administration has asked for letters
of support from elected officials and these are still being compiled. One letter of support was received
from Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit Court, expressing support for the issuance of the bonds.
Ms. Williams informed the Commissioners that she would briefly recap what she has discussed in
individual meetings with the Commissioners during the last several weeks as it relates to bonding
authority. The Administration is requesting bonding authority for projects that were approved as part of
the capital budget for Fiscal Year 2010.
In November 2009, the County approved $309 million for capital improvement and $162 million for
capital equipment. Today bonding authority is sought for a lower portion than that which was requested
for capital during the budgeting cycle. In addition, the request includes approval of the transaction teams.
Included in the bond issue will be capital improvement, capital equipment and the short-term notes for the
pension fund repayment that was approved in February.
Ms. Williams said that supplemental information was distributed to the Committee at today’s meeting.
Funding for capital improvements is reduced to $223 million, an $85 million reduction from the
previously approved sum of $309 million. Capital equipment is also reduced from the previously
approved sum of $162 million. The current request for capital equipment is $108 million.
The $108 million figure for capital equipment is a net figure. It includes a reduction of $60 million in
project cuts and cashflow adjustments, $10 million in savings due to cancellation of the mainframe
project, and a $15 million increase to pay for a new Enterprise Resource Planning system.
Ms. Williams stated that the financing team for the refunding proposal may also work on the short term
notes for the pension payment. A private placement option is also possible for the pension payment
notes, in which case the financing team would not be needed.

47

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
Commissioner Silvestri inquired about ten projects that were previously deferred, but are now back on the
list for funding.
Chairman Daley clarified that Ms. William stated that there are twelve projects, not ten.
Commissioner Silvestri asked specifically why the project for the Daley Center Security Camera upgrade
is back on the list after it had been deferred, and if there is an emergency as to why it needs to be done at
this time.
Bruce Washington, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, responded that the Daley Center
building management has repeatedly asked the Office of Capital Panning and Policy for updated security
camera equipment and monitors.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired as to whether the Daley Center had a security camera system already in
place.
Mr. Washington responded that the current security system is outdated and does not adequately protect
the facility, particularly in light of recent threats against judges.
Chairman Daley informed the Committee that a letter has been received from Assessor Houlihan in
support of the bond issue.
Commissioner Collins asked whether or not the County receives federal money from the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security.
Mr. Washington stated that the County has received homeland security money, but it has been allocated
for other projects, not for Daley Center security.
Commissioner Collins asked if Mr. Washington can check to see if any federal grant funds can be
obtained through the Department of Homeland Security.
Ms. Williams responded that she will check on it.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the capital improvements at the health facilities are consistent with the
long-term plan that the Health & Hospitals System Board has been developing, and what are the longterm plans for the former Tuberculosis District Administration Building in Forest Park.
Mr. Washington stated that the projects at the TB building consist of minor repairs, which are necessary
to prepare the building for eventual sale. All capital projects are consistent with the System Board’s draft
of a new strategic plan.
Commissioner Gorman inquired about the current interest rate environment the bonds are likely to meet
in the marketplace.
Ms. Williams informed Commissioner Gorman that this is the lowest interest rate environment that the
County has experienced in years. It is an ideal time to go to the market with new bonds, and to refinance
existing bonds.
Commissioner Gorman asked if the bonding team has any speculation of where interest rates are going.
Ms. Williams asked for leave to have a representative from Loop Capital Markets speak.

48

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

Clarence Bourne, Senior Vice President, Investment Banking Division, Loop Capital Markets, stated that
the rates are relatively low and as the economy starts to rebound eventually rates will rise. He feels this is
a good time to lock in long-term rates.
Commissioner Schneider reminded the Committee that the original draft of the master bond agreement
earmarked about $375 million for capital projects, $260 million for self-insurance and $104 for pensions.
Instead, the Board found other ways to fund the self-insurance program and pension debt. Furthermore,
Commissioner Schneider stated that the Administration has changed the list of capital projects in line for
funding. For example, Commissioner Schneider pointed to a $300,000 parking lot resurfacing project at
the County’s Hawthorne Warehouse which was originally awarded to Infrastructure Engineering, even
though it was the highest of three bids.
In response to Commissioner Schneider’s remarks, Ms. Williams stated that the request before the
Committee today is bonding authority to support capital projects that were approved for inclusion in the
2010 budget appropriation. During the 2010 budget process, $461 million was approved for capital
projects. Ms. Williams stated that she met with each department head, elected official, and bureau chief
to discuss their capital spending needs over the next twelve to fifteen months. As a result of those
discussions, adjustments have been made to update the time schedule and they are now ready to proceed
with bond funding for projects that were already approved by this Board.
Commissioner Suffredin informed the Committee that a Substitute Ordinance Amendment had been

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to amend Section 11 (A) of the
Substitute Ordinance Amendment, indicated above with underlined and stricken text. The motion
to amend carried.
Commissioner Suffredin thanked the President’s staff and Ms. Williams for the work over the last week
in going through in detail this Master Bond Agreement, and also thanked Chairman Daley for the time he
has spent on The Master Bond Agreement.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that a more improved ordinance is now before the Commissioners which
does a number of things that the Commissioners have asked to be done in the past: 1) it specifies the
specific amounts in Section 11 (A) so that there is no question as to what monies are being spent and what
the purpose is for their spending; and 2) as the County Board, the corporate authority, has always done, is
approve the teams and all of the bonds, and it has now been amended that the teams are in the Substitute
Bond Ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin gave the Commissioners three reasons to approve the Master Bond Agreement
today:
1) $8 million was spent a year ago to help the Sheriff make some improvements and because of
that investment the County is on the verge of being relieved from responsibility for Duran and for
Harrington which are two cases that have lingered on the County Board for over twenty-five years and
have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to the people of Cook County. Commissioner Suffredin stated
that the Sheriff says it best in his letter that these bond improvements are essential for him to continue to
make progress and to end the oversight of a federal judge over the County Board and the jail system;
2) regarding the letter that was received from Warren Batts, Chairman of the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System Board, Commissioner Suffredin stated that he acknowledges the Healthcare System
which in the last year and a half has made major strides to right its financial ship to be able to collect its
bills on time; it has indicated to the County Board the essential equipment it needs to provide care to the

57

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
growing number of people of Cook County who are going to the County’s healthcare system. Two years
ago the healthcare system was at about 750,000 patient visits per year, and now the healthcare system is
near a million; it reflects the economy, it reflects the state of healthcare; and
3) regarding the letter from Assessor Houlihan, Commissioner Suffredin stated that there is a lot
of discussion as to when tax bills will be issued and how local units of government will be affected who
are depending upon the County’s collection of property taxes to run their schools, park district, cities and
libraries. Commissioner Suffredin stated that there are series of problems because of the large number of
appeals reflective of the economy; what this does in these capital requests for the various offices is give
them the technology and assistance they need to make sure that the citizens of Cook County receive their
tax bills fairly, correctly and on time so that the governments that are below Cook County who need that
money do not have to borrow the money to make sure they make payroll.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Substitute
Ordinance Amendment (Communication No. 305686) be approved and adopted, as amended.
Commissioner Suffredin called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

Daley, Bridget Gainer, Elizabeth “Liz” Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Anthony J. Peraica,
Edwin Reyes, Timothy O. Schneider, Peter N. Silvestri, Robert B. Steele and Larry
Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ASSESSMENT CLASS 8B DESIGNATION
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter 74
Taxation, Section 74-70 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a)
Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or commercial
purposes, which real estate would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections
74-62 through 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying use of the property prior to
application for the incentive does not comply with the definition of abandoned property
provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a Class 8a property so long
as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements necessary to
receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the
definition of abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when the Cook
County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such
designation absent abandonment.

(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from
the municipality in which the real estate is located or the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local
government's sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial
enterprise located on such real estate and such abatement of sales
tax must cover the period of time for which the applicant would
qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners that due to national and regional
economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net
operating income of at least 40 percent in the year it makes

104

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
application for this incentive as compared to the average net
operating income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the
prior three years; and

(2)

(3)

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise is not economically
viable and as such it will cease operations within 60 days of the
submission of an eligibility application for Class 8a designation to
the Cook County Assessor, and thereafter the property will
become vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at
least 24 months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but
not limited to, an economic impact study that demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners that
designation as a class 8a property will allow the industrial or
commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby
continue its operations so that the industrial or commercial
enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real estate
for an extended period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone
a significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40
percent in the year it makes application for the incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the industrial or
commercial enterprise in the prior three years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that Class 8a designation of the property is necessary
for the ongoing industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its
operations and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable causing
the property to become vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a Class
8a property absent an abandonment requirement; and

d.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the application made to the Cook County
Assessor requesting designation as a Class 8a property absent an
abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8a property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to

105

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:

(4)

a.

A finding by the municipality that it has determined that class 8a
designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing industrial
or commercial enterprise to continue its operations and that
without such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise
would not be economically viable causing the property to become
vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to
the action by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to support
designation of the property as a Class 8a property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to
the class 8a application to the Cook County Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value
provided for in Section 74-64(11), however the term of the incentive will
be limited to five years only and such Class 8a designation shall not be
renewed:
a.

After the initial application has been approved and granted, if the
subject real estate receiving the Class 8a designation pursuant to
the provisions of this section is sold or the applicant transfers
ownership of any portion of the property at any time prior to the
five-year term of the 8a classification, then the property's Class 8a
classification shall be subject to an eligibility review by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, the municipality, and the
Assessor under the procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the
remainder of the five-year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an eligibility
application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the following
has occurred: application is made to the Cook County Assessor; all
required municipal and county ordinances and resolutions are provided to
the Cook County Assessor; and the Cook County Assessor determines that
the real estate which is the subject of the application for a Class 8a
designation would qualify for designation as a Class 8 property but for the
inability to comply with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section
74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this section to
determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class 8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation, the
Cook County Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting
documentation provided with such application to the Cook County Board

8a designation absent abandonment.

this section shall not be eligible for a Class 8a designation for any year
prior to the assessment year for which an application for the designation is

The Cook County Board of Commissioners or its designee may adopt rules
consistent with this section that may be needed to ensure proper review of
information, data and documents submitted in support of a request to the
County Board for a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8a
designation as provided for in this section.

(11)

Applicants for a Class 8a designation of property can only make such an
application for the following assessment years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011,
2012, 2013 and the Cook County Assessor shall not designate any real
estate as Class 8a property for assessment year 2018 or thereafter.

(12)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment,
if the industrial or commercial enterprise located on the property ceases
operations and the subject real estate becomes vacant and unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive property will
lose such designation and the corresponding reduced level of assessment
upon termination of the required partial sales tax abatement by local
government.
This Section 74-70 of the Real Estate Classification Ordinance will
become effective upon passage.

(b)
Class 8b. Real estate and improvements that house inpatient and
outpatient hospital based services, where the property has been acquired for hospital use by
a for-profit acquirer unrelated to the not-for-profit disposer, thereby avoiding Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall be considered
for a class 8b designation if it meets the requirements of this section and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing
Act, or an entity that owns the real property on which a hospital is
located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the abandonment
of the hospital would require the applicant, or the hospital on
behalf of which the applicant owns the real property on which the
hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State
of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to
the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing

107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
hospital operations and to obtain a second permit or exemption
prior to re-opening or otherwise re-establishing the hospital after
abandonment;

(2)

(3)

b.

the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County
Assessor that approval of the class 8b designation will materially
increase the likelihood that the property will be retained for
hospital use with the associated employment benefits relative to
industrial or commercial use of the property;

c.

the subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a 10 percent
or greater incidence of families and/or individuals below the
poverty level, as identified by the U.S. Census Bureau's most
recent census; and

d.

the subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents
(full-time equivalent jobs being defined as total hours worked by
all non full-time employees divided by average annual hours
worked by the full-time employees).

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the Cook County Assessor that approval of the class 8b
designation will materially increase the likelihood that the
property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it
supports and consents to the designation of the property as a class
8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and
designation as a class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this
section, the municipality in which the real estate is located must provide to
the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that contains the
following:
a.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the
proposed redevelopment contemplated for the subject hospital or
the property on which the hospital sits is necessary and appropriate
and that, without a classification having the impact of this section,
the special circumstances that exist on the property on which the
subject hospital sits including but not limited to the unique
requirement that mandates that the subject hospital's operations are
continually maintained without interruption in order for the State
of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board to issue a
certificate of need and licensure approval for the continued
operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the
continued operation of the subject hospital within the applicable
region, will not be addressed and the property on which the subject

108

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
hospital sits will become vacant and underutilized and cause the
continued exasperation of blighted factors within the municipality
and region;
b.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a
classification having the impact of this section is necessary for the
redevelopment to occur on the property on which the subject
hospital sits; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality
supporting and consenting to the filing of an application for a
classification having the impact of this section for the property on
which the subject hospital sits.

(4)

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and
for the term provided for in Section 74-64 (11).

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class 8 or
class 8b application must be made or have been made to the Cook County
Assessor. Any application for class 8 submitted with required municipal
approval after July 1, 2008 for hospital property where the property was
acquired for hospital use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer, avoiding the
Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval,
shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon
supplement of such class 8 application with the additional information
required in this section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook
County Assessor shall forward such application and any supporting
documentation provided with the application to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County Board
will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation.
Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of
this section shall be eligible for such designation beginning in the
assessment year during which an application for the classification having
the impact of this section is made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following
has occurred: application is made or has been made to the Cook County
Assessor, and all required municipal and county ordinances and
resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor.

section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of
such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a resolution or
ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital Licensing Act, or an entity
that owns the real property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed
by the state, and the abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant, or
the hospital on behalf of which the applicant owns the real property on which the
hospital is located, to obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois
Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois Health
Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and to obtain a
second permit or exemption prior to re-opening or otherwise re-establishing the
hospital after abandonment;

b.

the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that
approval of the class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that

113

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010
the property will be retained for hospital use with the associated employment
benefits relative to industrial or commercial use of the property;

(2)

(3)

(4)

c.

the subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a 10 percent or greater
incidence of families and/or individuals below the poverty level, as identified by
the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent census; and

d.

the subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time equivalents (full-time
equivalent jobs being defined as total hours worked by all non full-time
employees divided by average annual hours worked by the full-time employees).

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the
applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that
approval of the class 8b designation will materially increase the likelihood that
the property will be retained for hospital use; and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and
consents to the designation of the property as a class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the county, and designation as a
class 8b property is sought using the provisions of this section, the municipality in which
the real estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed
redevelopment contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the
hospital sits is necessary and appropriate and that, without a classification having
the impact of this section, the special circumstances that exist on the property on
which the subject hospital sits including but not limited to the unique requirement
that mandates that the subject hospital's operations are continually maintained
without interruption in order for the State of Illinois Health Facilities and
Services Review Board to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for
the continued operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary need for the
continued operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will not
be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become
vacant and underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors
within the municipality and region;

b.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification
having the impact of this section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on
the property on which the subject hospital sits; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and
consenting to the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of
this section for the property on which the subject hospital sits.

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall
be assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in
Section 74-64 (11).

114

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class 8 or class 8b
application must be made or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any
application for class 8 submitted with required municipal approval after July 1, 2008 for
hospital property where the property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated forprofit acquirer, avoiding the Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation
approval, shall be reconsidered as an application pursuant to this section upon
supplement of such class 8 application with the additional information required in this
section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor shall forward
such application and any supporting documentation provided with the application to the
Cook County Board of Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County
Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8b designation. Real
estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be
eligible for such designation beginning in the assessment year during which an
application for the classification having the impact of this section is made to the Cook
County Assessor.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

The Department of Budget and Management Services is submitting a copy of the 4th Quarter
Performance Reporting. This report highlights performance data associated with services, activities and
programs within Cook County departments and is a starting point used in budgeting, long-term planning
and goal setting.
Performance measures are essential in assisting County officials and citizens to identify effective and
efficient decisions that pertain to future resources, allocations and service delivery. The Performance
Reporting is an ongoing development that enables the County to share data on a range of programs,
benchmark its performance to comparable jurisdictions and improve service delivery through the
application of best management practices and efficient use of resources.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 19, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for a design-build contract for the
new air cooled chiller at the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center.
The existing chiller at the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center is reaching the end of its useful life. The chiller
has been in place since the building was constructed. It is the opinion of the Cook County Health &
Hospitals System Board that this work is of an urgent nature.
While the chiller is still in operation, it is not operating as efficiently and effectively to meet the designed
cooling loads of the building. With the Ruth M. Rothstein Core Center primarily handling infectious
diseases, the unit needs to be replaced in order to ensure that the Core Center can maintain a safe
temperature controlled environment.
This is categorized as an HVAC upgrade project.
Bond Issue (28000 Account).
This project was included in the 2010 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Board of
Commissioners on November 19, 2009.
The Cook County Health & Hospitals System Chief Operating Officer will submit this item to the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System Board for their approval.

with Divane Brothers Electric Company, Franklin Park, Illinois, for the Countywide Fire and Life Safety
System Upgrades - Package 7. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

The newly installed fire alarm panel, located in the vestibule of the Sheriff's Building at the
Maywood Campus, has experienced failures due to cold weather exposure. Relocating the
panel from the vestibule to the corridor will permanently resolve this problem. This change
order is due to a potential error and omission.

($2,785.00) to the contract with Broadway Electric, Inc., Elk Grove, Illinois, for the Countywide Fire and

Reason:

This change order includes an increase to the contract to allow the Contractor to work during
second shift (3:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M.) at the Skokie Courthouse, so as not to disrupt court
operation. It also includes a number of credits such as, a conductor type change from firepower limited (FPL) cable to thermoplastic high heat resistant nylon (THHN) wire, the
deletion of smoke and heat detectors in the elevators which are not required by applicable
codes. This is due to the fact that the elevator shafts are made of non-combustible
construction, therefore detectors are not required.

211-260

Total

$90,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent on March 29, 2010 that the receiving account (211-260) would require an
infusion of funds in order to meet obligations. On this date the balance of the account is $3,731 and
thirty days prior the balance was $21,181.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account (211-449) used for transfer of funds was identified because of a surplus in the
account. This account was expected to be used to fund a maintenance contract for the new
Cashiering System upgrade. However due to minor setbacks in the "go live" of the system funds
for maintenance will less than anticipated for FY 2010. Additionally, the Sheriff's Office received a
reimbursement for 2009 radio maintenance costs from the Forest Preserve District that was credited
to the FY 2010 account.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
There is nothing that will be deferred, delayed, or cancelled as a result of the reduction in account
(211-449).

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account (211-449) has a surplus because the maintenance cost of the cashiering system will be less
than anticipated for FY 2010 and unanticipated credit applied to this account from the Forest
Preserve District.

The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

Mediation Program in the Chancery Division, based upon best-practices around the country.
The program focuses on owner-occupied properties (one to six units) and is intended to assist
foreclosure litigants reach mutually equitable arrangements thereby minimizing the loss of
the borrower properties. The basic framework of the program includes three major
components to assist borrowers in foreclosure: (1) legal aid and mediation to provide pro
bono legal advice and mediation services; (2) housing counseling services by HUD-certified
agencies to provide pro bono housing counseling sessions to borrowers to assess financial and
housing situations; and (3) community outreach to inform fully and fairly borrowers from all
communities in Cook County concerning options available through the program. IHDA has
been selected to be the administering agent for the housing counseling component of the
program based on its active involvement in addressing the Chicago-area housing crisis, its
commitment to housing counseling organizations that advance the interests of homeowners,
and its current role as the administering agent for funds from the National Foreclosure
Mitigation Counseling Program.

Processing Equipment and Software for the coverage of a contract for ground imagery maintenance which
includes acquisition of parcel images, ground control, data collection and Federal Geographic Data
Committee compliance metadata Board approved on December 15, 2009.

From Account:
545-260

Professional and Managerial Services

Total

$425,000.00

Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing
Equipment and Software

Total

$425,000.00

To Account:
545-441

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On February 22, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair of Data Processing
Equipment and Software Account 545-441 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet
outstanding maintenance obligations. At this time, the balance of the account had $422,812.00, not
including the outstanding contract expenditures of $475,650.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 545-260 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of the reduction of some
of the geospatial projects which was realized via the Request for Proposal process and cooperative
acquisitions on a regional level.

139

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 6, 2010

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 545-260 Professional Services.
Savings in the account will occur in two ways:
1) Since the County Board authorized us to participate in a regional aerial orthoimagery project with
the seven neighboring counties, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the United
States Geological Survey, we realized a projected savings of over $300,000.00.
2) The department will postpone the upgrade of an existing application, Mapviewer that County
agencies use internally to quickly produce map displays.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

The funding for the contract was originally planned to be incurred as part of fiscal year 2009.
However due to the lengthy process of contract review and negotiations and the end of the year
account closeout, the contract funding was carried into the 2010 fiscal year budget. The timing of
the contract processing was too late to add the contract into the 2010 fiscal budget and not finalized
enough to have the funds encumbered from 2009.
