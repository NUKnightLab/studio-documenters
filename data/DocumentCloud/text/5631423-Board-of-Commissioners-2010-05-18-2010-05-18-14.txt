 ORIGINAL SCOPE OF SERVICES
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) entered
into a contract with Tropic Construction Corporation (Tropic) to perform exterior envelope
repairs, interior renovation work and ADA and site improvements at Hoyne Community Center
(IL2-035). This work covers, but is not limited to, replacing exterior doors, windows, tuck
pointing, roof repair, new and upgraded toilet rooms, a new elevator, new stairs, new lighting
and ceilings, new flooring, painting, new kitchen equipment and cabinets, a new fire alarm
system, upgraded electrical power and distribution, new plumbing, new fencing and landscaping,
and a new mechanical ventilation system. This work is being performed at Hoyne Community
Center and Day Care Center, 123 – 125 No. Hoyne. The completion date for all work is October
14, 2010.
MODIFIED SCOPE OF SERVICES
Contract Modification No. G-04 to Contract No. 9081, in an amount not to exceed $350,000.00,
covers roof replacement work at Hoyne Community Center (Hoyne). The roof replacement work
includes, but is not limited to, the removal and replacement of the entire existing metal deck,
roof membranes, wood blockings and roof insulation for the two-story brick building (which
houses office space, a gym and a one-story brick extension on its East side).
The original construction drawings anticipated that only limited portions of the roof, including
the insulation, roof membrane and other protective roofing materials, would need repairs. Once
the Contractor had access to the Center and weather allowed, additional forensic testing of the
roof was performed. Interior demolition of acoustical tiles in the rooms directly below the metal
decks has been performed, and portions of the roofing materials covering the metal roof deck
have been removed. The expanded views of the metal deck provided by these steps have
revealed that the majority of the metal deck is badly rusted. In fact, the entire roof has
deteriorated to the point where the structural integrity of the building’s roofing structure has
been compromised.
Given the findings discovered in the removal of the ceiling tiles and the roof tear off, the
architect has strongly recommended that all of the roof metal decks for Hoyne be completely
replaced, along with the insulation and other cover materials. With completion of this work,
Hoyne will have a completely new, structurally sound roof system with a full 20 year warranty
for the entire building.
Based on the architect’s most recent inspections of the roof and the possibility that further
structural deficiencies may be discovered as the work proceeds, CCD requests that an amount
not to exceed $350,000.00 be approved for this work. Any funds not expended by the Contractor
will be credited to the CHA in the form of a deductive change order modification after
completion of the work and determination of the final cost.

 CONCLUSION
Based on the review and recommendation of the Project Manager and the staff of the Capital
Construction Department, it is in the best interest of the CHA for the Board of Commissioners to
authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute Contract Modification No. G-04
to Contract No. 9081 with Tropic Construction Corporation in an amount not to exceed
$350,000.00 for additional work related to the exterior envelope repairs, interior renovation work
and ADA and site improvements at Hoyne Community Center (IL2-035). The new total contract
amount of Contract No. 9081 is $2,717,071.00. The Contract completion date is unchanged.
This Contract Modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
