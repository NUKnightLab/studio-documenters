The Board started the meeting by confirming attendance at 9:30a.m.

The Board held this meeting to satisfy the requirements of the Procurement Code to hold a public
hearing on the behalf of the Capital Development Board and its project request for the Lincoln
Hall Renovation, at University of Illinois, Champaign CDB#830-010-327.
The project was presented the Procurement Policy Board by Construction Administrator Ron Wright,
Deputy Director of Construction Jim Underwood and Senior Project Manager Kirk Fernandes all of the
Capital Development Board. Ron Wright explained that this was the second project presented to the
PPB and there was hope that Federal construction dollars would be available in the near future to have
this project underway. Approval would allow the design phase to proceed knowing that single prime
with protected subcontractors would be the project delivery method.
There were no witnesses requesting to testify on the proposed project. Member Morales moved
to approve the request to proceed under single prime with protected subcontractors as the
delivery method for this project. Member Bass seconded the motion. Member Bass recused
himself from the vote due to his affiliation with the University of Illinois. The motion passed
unanimously.
With no further business Member Morales moved to adjourn, seconded by member Bass. The
motion was unanimously approved.
