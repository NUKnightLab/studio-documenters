The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, and Chicago
Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due diligence to support the submission of
this initiative.
Funding
Capital Construction Department Budget
Background
The TOCC Program is modeled on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts provisions of the
Federal Acquisition Regulations, Section 16.504. This type of contract allows for an indefinite quantity of services
to be supplied as needed over a fixed period of time. General Contractors, initially chosen by the Chicago Housing
Authority through a Request for Proposal, are issued master agreements, and pursuant thereto are awarded task
orders through competitive bidding amongst themselves as projects occur.
Since 2007, the Capital Construction Department (“CCD”) has successfully utilized IDIQ programs for projects
valued up to $3,000,000 throughout the Rehabilitation, Scattered Sites and Capital Maintenance programs. The
current action increases the cap from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 per awarded task order and will allow us to
maintain efficient execution of desired capital projects through this program. The reason for the increase in the
cap is due to the size of the forecasted projects in our five-year capital plan.
2

 Also, the TOCC Program allows the ability to work with a pre-approved group of general contractors which
significantly reduces the time needed to move from project design to construction, while still retaining the cost
control advantages of competitive bidding. Projects will be awarded based on responses (i.e., sealed bids) to
specific, individual Requests for Services (RFS). The award will be made to the lowest responsive, responsible
bidder.
The CHA will assign General Contractors to one or more of the following groups based on their proposal selection
and requisite qualifications. The CHA will offer task order bidding opportunities to each group in a manner to
provide fair opportunities for GCs to bid on construction projects. There is no limitation to the number of groups
to which a vendor may be assigned, subject to the GCs ability to secure bonding within the task order value the
group represents. The breakdown/summary as follows:
•
•
•

Group A: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and secure bonding for
projects valued from $100,000.00 to $500,000.00; and
Group B: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and secure bonding for
projects valued over $500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00;
Group C: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and secure bonding for
projects valued over $3,000,00.00 to $5,000,000.00.
