Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided information on
the items presented.

The Committee discussed the status of a request made at the April 9, 2009 Board Meeting. Dr. Robert Cohen,
Chairman of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, had
requested'assistance with obtaining a waiver from the County's Office of Contract Compliance for a unique piece
of pulmonary equipment from a sole-source vendor. This waiver would allow the purchase to be made without
minority participation. The funding source that is expected to be used for this purchase is federal grant funds,
which are set to expire in June.

Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Office of the State?s Attorney, stated that at the
April 9th Board Meeting, it was determined that the next course of action would be to follow-up in writing to the
Of?ce of Contract Compliance. She stated that she will work with Ms. Duffy on the issue.

Director O?Donnell, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of the Contracts and Procurement
Approval Items, as amended. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 

Update on Contracting Issues

Ms. Duffy provided information relating to a recommendation to cancel and rebid a laundry linen contract. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information. They concluded that Ms. Duffy presented sufficient
information to substantiate the Board?s prior action approving the request to cancel and rebid the transaction,
despite the County Purchasing Agent's recommendation otherwise.

Therefore, the Finance Committee recommends that the prior action of the System Board, in which they approved
the request to cancel and rebid the transaction, remains unchanged. The transaction should proceed to be cancelled
and rebid, as authorized by the System Board.

The Committee discussed other issues. Mr. Calkin stated that he expected to have the ?nal decision on the group
purchasing organization (GPO), and information on the Medr?Surg distribution, by the May Finance Committee
meeting.

 

Discussion, award and execution of agreement with Public Consulting Group .
for Medicare Graduate Medical Education Review

 

Mr. Calkin presented the proposed agreement with Public Consulting Group for Medicare Graduate Medical
Education Review.

The Committee reviewed and discussed the proposed agreement. During the discussion, it was stated that the
transmittal included as backup for the agreement should be amended by striking the words ?sole source.?

Director O?Donnell, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of the request, as amended, to award
and execute an agreement with Public Consulting Group for Medicare Graduate Medical Education Review.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

approved 2009 appropriations, is still inaccessible.

ESI has had a contractual relationship with the Cook County Bureau of Health Services since 1992. During the past 18
years, ESI has continuously provided a variety of services to the Bureau, including those highlighted below.

it 1992 Ongoing. ESI began providing Medicaid Eligibility Services for Sn-oger Hospital (then Cook County
Hospital). Provident Hospital and Oak Forest Hospital were added to the Medicaid Eligibility Services contracts in
1996 and 1998 respectively. ESI has, as a result of its continued success in obtaining Medicaid eligibility and
retroactive coverage for services, generated total revenue for the Bureau of more than $16.1 for the 2008 FY. Since
1992, E81 has generated more than $540,745,340 in revenue, PLUS more than $63,000,000 in revenue for which ESI
received no fees.

5* 1997 - ESI was awarded the contract to serve as MSOITPA for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services Medicaid
Managed Care Plan, ?County-Care?. The HMO operations were success?illy transitioned ?'em an indemnity carrier to
a fully operational health plan, including complete con?guration and deployment of Amysis managed care Operating
systems. The HMO operated through 1999, at which time the Bureau opted to terminate its managed care relationship
with Illinois Public Aid.

2001 - Ambulatory Encounter Coding and Billing to third party payers; special project to provide clean-up coding and
billing of backlog of ambulatory encounter forms. ESI coded and submitted over 70,000 claims in 120 days, resulting
in revenue of more than $7,000,000. This special project resulted in the ongoing SafeGuard service program.

2003 Ongoing. SafeGuard Ambulatory Encounter Coding and Billing to third party payers; special contract
addendum for services to provide scanning, coding and billing of ambulatory encounters for all self-pay and some third
party payers. ESI developed and deployed proprietary technology for scanning of multiple, unique clinic and ED
encounter forms, data extraction, data scrubbing, medical coding utilizing proprietary coding applications and
coordinated VPN access to EMR, preparation and submission of electronic claims to multiple payers including
Medicaid, Medicare and commercial payers. This contract addendum continues current and E31 generated $11.5 in
revenue for FY 2008 and a total of $82,470,440 since implementation, which would otherwise have been lost.

2003 Ongoing. ESI provides the only services for billing of ambulatory pharmacy claims for the six (6) ambulatory
pharmacy locations including Streger Hospital, Fantus Health Clinic, The Core Center, Provident Hospital, Oak Forest
l-IosPital and Mail Order Re?lls. Prior to the E81 implementation of proprietary programming allowing the ?ling of
pharmacy claims with the State of Illinois, has not ?led claims, nor received any reimbursement for
prescriptions. Since July, 2003, E81 HAS generated pharmacy claims revenue for the Bureau in excess of
$200,553,173.

2006 Ongoing. ESI takes through the Medicare Part Prescription Drug Plan contracting to allow for
submission and reimbursement of Medicare Part prescriptions. ESI developed and deployed propriety applications
to allow claims to be processed through the Medicare Part (OMS) Switch and through the payers. To date, ESI has
generated $6,221,457 in Medicare Part reimbursement for 

ESI continues to provide the following services under three?year contracts awarded July 1, 2006:

it Medicaid Eligibility Services
P- Sai?eGuard EnceunteriClinic Claims Processing
Pharmacy Claims Processing Illinois Medicaid and Medicare Part

1992. That commitment and success have resulted in more than

$829,990,396 in revenue

Requesting approval to increase contract 08-45-27Afor
John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital (Section 1, Purchase Order
16538?) for the purchase of meat products.

 

The Board originally approved an extension of 90
days(3l30109 thru 61'291'09) and an increase of $30,000 on
3f13/09. An additional increase in the amount is needed
due to the increase of the extension from 30 days to 90
days, and to allow the continuous flow of supplies

during the extension period. It will also allow time for

the rebid, evaluation, award, execution, and

Stroger Hospital is requesting to extend and increase Contract No.
05-41-59. A requisition for bid was submitted for the new contract.
However, at the same time the requisition for PET Scanning was
sent to downtown purchasing, there was also a uisition for 16
slice CT scanners. Downtown purchasing somehow confused the
speci?cations between the two requisitions and sent them back to
Stroger to be revised. After discovering the specs had been
inadvertently switched, HoSpital Purchasing then explained to
Cook County Purchasing the confusion. However, Cook County
Purchasing once again returned the requisition for updated
speci?cations. We ask that the contract be extended through
September, due to the bid process.
