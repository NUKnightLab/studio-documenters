CITY OF DETROIT
MEMORANDUM

To: Mary Shef?eld, Council President Pro Tempore
Detroit City Council

From: Lawrence T. Garcia 
Corporation Counsel

Date: January 9, 2019

Re: 50% Parking Fine Discount For Detroit Residents.

 

City Council President Pro Tempore, Mary Shef?eld, requested an opinion on the legality
of an ordinance that would give individuals who can demonstrate that they are domiciled in the
City of Detroit, a 50% parking ?ne reduction for overstaying at a metered space.

SHORT ANSWER

 

The City of Detroit is authorized by state law to regulate parking within City limits. Equal
protection challenges to an ordinance that provides a 50% ?ne reduction to residents would be
decided by use of the ?rational basis? test, and the ordinance?s purposes of assisting Detroiters of
limited means and providing better access to City services on metered streets (like City of?ces
located downtown) may be adequate to provide a rational basis for disparate treatment. However,
the ordinance may have a dif?cult time with a challenge under the Privileges and Immunities
analysis. There, a 50% discount may seem too great, as demonstrated in case law, and a lesser
amount may be easier to defend. In order to avoid being such an outlier, Detroit?s interests in this
may be better served with a 25% discount; this could be closer to the 20% discount offered in the
City of Miami.

 

DISCUSSION

I. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE

A. Residency Is Not A Protected Class

An ordinance reducing parking citation ?nes only for Detroit residents may be subject to a
constitutional challenge on a variety of fronts. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States
Constitution and Article I of the Michigan Constitution, guarantees equal protection of the law to
citizens.1 The courts have interpreted the state constitution?s equal protection to be coextensive
with its federal counterpart.2 When a claim regarding equal protection is made, the court presumes
a statute is constitutional; but, when challenged, it must withstand the Operative test administered
by the reviewing court.3

The standard of review to be applied depends on the classi?cation scheme of the challenged
legislation. Here, the classi?cation scheme involves Detroit residents v. non-residents. Residency
as a classi?cation does not require a heightened level of scrutiny and the strict scrutiny test should
apply, as residency is not deemed a suspect classi?cation. Michigan State Employees Ass?n Civil
Serv Comm, 91 Mich App 135, 141 (1979). Classi?cations such as gender, race, immigration
status, sexual orientation, and national origin are considered protected classes, in which a higher
level of scrutiny attaches. ?[S]trict scrutiny of a legislative classi?cation is required only when the
classi?cation impermissibly interferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the
peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class.?4

In Harvey v. State, Dep 't of Mgmt. Budget, Bureau of Ret. Servs., the Michigan Supreme
Court explained that classi?cations not involving a protected class or a protected right are subject
to a rational basis test.5 Legislation permitting residents to receive a parking ?ne reduction, does
not bring into question a fundamental right, nor is residency considered a protected class.
Therefore, the legislative scheme need only bear a rational relationship to legitimate governmental
goals to avoid violating Equal Protection laws.

B. Standard Of Review Rational Basis

In an Equal Protection challenge, the City of Detroit would bear the burden of
demonstrating what legitimate government interest is re?ected in providing a 50% parking citation

 

1 US. Const, Am. XIV and Michigan Constitution, Const. 1963, art. 1, 2.

2 Harvey v. State, Dep?t Budget, Bureau ofRet. Servs., 469 Mich. l, 6, 664 767, 770 (2003).

3 7710mm v. Lansing, 315 Mich. 566, 576,24 213 (1946).

Citizensfor Umf. Taxation v. Northport Pub. Sch. Dist, 239 Mich. App. 284, 289, 608 480, 483 (2000).
5 Harvey v. State, Dep't Budget, Bureau ofRet. Servs., 469 Mich. 1, 12, 664 767, 773 (2003).

 

?ne reduction and what rational goal the reduction seeks to achieve that could not be achieved by
affording non-residents the same treatment.

In 1977 the Supreme Court ruled in Arlington County Board v. Richards, a residential
parking ordinance enacted by Arlington County, Virginia, did not on its face violate the Equal
Protection guarantee of the federal Constitution, because it bore a reasonable relationship to its
objective, which was to reduce air pollution, noise, traf?c and litter resulting from non-residents
and commuter traf?c. Although the ordinance only stood to bene?t residents and discriminated
against non-residents, the court found that ?the Constitution does not outlaw these social and
environmental objectives, nor does it presume distinctions between residents and nonresidents of
a local neighborhood to be invidious. The Equal Protection Clause requires only that the distinction
drawn by an ordinance like Arlington's rationally promote the regulation?s obj ectives,?6

In order for a discounted parking ?ne rate to be upheld under a rational basis standard of
review, the ordinance would have to further a legitimate governmental interest.7 Council President
Pro Tem seeks to address at least three concerns: (1) alleviate economic hardship felt by Detroiters
who are disproportionately affected by poverty; (2) make it easier for residents to access buildings
and governmental facilities where parking is enforced g. at City Hall); and (3) combat the effects
of red?lining and inequality in auto insurance faced by Detroiters. A court will look to see if a
reasonable relationship exists between these concerns and the City?s interests. Should a court
determine that there is no rational nexus between a parking ?ne reduction and achieving the
objectives President Pro Tem pursues, the ordinance would fail.

II. PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES CLAUSE

The Privileges and Immunities Clause of the US. Constitution provides that, ?[T]he
Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the Privileges and Immunities of citizens of the United
States.?8 The objective of the Privileges and Immunities clause is ?plac[ing] the citizens of each
State upon the same footing with the citizens of other States, so far as the advantages resulting
from citizenship in those States are concerned.?9 Applying the principle established under the
Privileges and Immunities Clause to the matter at hand, the court will look to see whether a parking
?ne discount for City residents is closely related to substantial reasons to grant such a discount.

The seminal Supreme Court case of Toomer v. Whitsell, sets forth the standard that is
followed in modern case law.10 In Toomer, plaintiff challenged South Carolina?s excessive fees
for out of state shrimpers. South Carolina attempted to justify its licensing fee scheme, in which

 

6 Cty. Bd. ofArlington Cty., Va. v. Richards(1977).

7 Phillips v. Mirac, Inc, 470 Mich. 415, 433, 685 174, 184 (2004).

a US Constitution, Art IV, 2.

9 Citizensfor Unif Taxation v. Northport Pub. Sch. Dist, 239 Mich. App. 284, 289, 608 480, 483 (2000).
1? Toomer v. Whilsell, 334, US 385, 68 S. Ct. 1156, 92 1460 (1948).

 

South Carolina residents were charged $25.00 per boat and out of state residents were charged
$2,500.00 per boat, under the basis that the fee differential was necessary for shrimp preservation
and to avoid the threat of excessive trawling. oomer resulted in a test for reviewing Privileges
and Immunities challenges when presented and states:

Like many other constitutional provisions, the privileges and immunities
clause is not an absolute. It does bar discrimination against citizens of
other States where there is no substantial reason for the discrimination
beyond the mere fact that they are citizens of other States. But it does not
preclude diSparity of treatment in the many situations where there are
perfectly valid independent reasons for it. Thus the inquiry in each case
must be concerned with whether such reasons do exist and whether the
degree of discrimination bears a close relation to them. The inquiry must
also, of course, be conducted with due regard for the principal that the
States should have considerable leeway in analyzing local evils and in
prescribing appropriate cures. 1 l(Emphasis Added)

The Supreme Court in Toomer found, that statute South Carolina plainly and frankly
discriminates against non?residents, and the record leaves little doubt but what the discrimination
is so great that its practical effect is virtually exclusionary.?12 The Court concluded there existed
no record indicating non-residents use larger boats or different ?shing methods than residents, [or]
that the cost of enforcing the laws against them is appreciably greater, or that any substantial
amount of the State's general funds is devoted to shrimp conservation. As such, no substantial
reason existed for the drastic fee differential, let alone a ?reasonable reason? to achieve the state?s
objective of shrimp conservation. If however, there was a substantial reason for the differential
treatment between residents and non-residents, the Supreme Court indicated that the state must
demonstrate, ?there is something to indicate that non-citizens constitute a peculiar source of the
evil at which the statute is aimed.?13 South Carolina could not justify its treatment of non?resident
shrimpers and the Supreme Court barred continued enforcement of the fee.

Applying the test set forth in Toomer here, the City may be able to defeat a Privileges and
Immunities challenge by demonstrating that there is ?a perfectly valid independent reason for it.?14
However, unless a substantial reason can be provided to validate a parking ?ne differential for
residents, the amount of parking fines assessed against non-residents may be deemed
unconstitutional. As demonstrated in Toomer, the greater the differential, the more disparate the
impact, and the greater the risk of an adverse decision.

Accommodating the less fortunate in a City with disproportionate poverty rates and helping to
provide access to City of?ces to City residents are substantial reasons for the discount. The City
of Detroit provides various means of parking for residents and non-residents in Detroit, including:
parking meters, parking garages and parking lots. Generally, most citations are received by
individuals parking in the metered areas, many of those areas surround governmental buildings
where residents need to conduct business.

Research reveals that there are no communities in Michigan which offer a residency
preference for a reduction for parking citation ?nes. However, there are many communities that
provide a discount for all individuals who pay the parking ticket within a speci?c time frame.
Some of those communities include: Ferndale, Grosse Pointe Park, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.
Additionally, research has identi?ed there are national cities that have implemented a residency
preference for parking citations received. Those cities include: Lexington, City of Miami and
Washington however, none of the communities researched have anything as large as a 50%
reduction for residents. If the City of Detroit were to impose a 50% reduction for parking citations
for its residents, it would be an outlier, and that may increase the likelihood of potential lawsuits.
Given the size of the discount, it may be dif?cult for the City to demonstrate a substantial reason
for the law when the impact of the ordinance so heavily burdens non-residents.

STATE LAW

State law, MCL 25 7.606, speci?cally allows the local governing body to regulate parking.
The language in MCL 257.606 states:

Sec. 606 (I) This chapter does not prevent a local authority with respect
to streets or highways under the jurisdiction of the local authority and
within the reasonable exercise of the police power from doing any of the
following:

Regulating the standing or parking of vehicles. (Emphasis Added)

In interpreting the statute, the pertinent language is ?this chapter does not prevent? that
sentence explicitly gives local governing bodies broad authority to regulate parking of vehicles so
long as the vehicles are located on roads and streets that fall under the City?s jurisdiction. The
statute is silent in regards to the manner in which the local governing body may regulate a discount
to residents, or provide a discount if a parking citation is paid within a certain amount of time. The
seminal case of Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc, sets forth the
standard for statutes that are silent on a question. ?Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with
respect to the speci?c issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on

 

a permissible construction of the statute.?15 Applying the standard set forth in Chevron to the lack
of speci?city in the statute regarding parking regulations, courts will likely look to see whether the
City interpreted state law reasonably when constructing the ordinance to allow for the parking
citation discount.

Notably, MCL 257.606, authorizes local units of government to regulate standing and
parking of vehicles on streets within the City?s jurisdiction. Therefore, City Council, as the local
governing body has the authority to allow parking ?ne reductions if they so choose. This is similar
to the practice implemented by the City in 1998, when Council enacted an ordinance reducing
parking citations for everyone if the individual receiving the citation paid within a speci?ed shorter
time. This practice was replaced in 2014, when the Emergency City Manager authorized an
amendment to the City?s parking ?ne schedule, speci?cally ?ne increases. 16

owe?mm

In sum, pursuant to state law, the City has the authority to regulate parking on streets within
its jurisdiction and may enact ordinances implementing parking regulations. However, state law is
silent about. parking ?ne rates. An analysis under constitutional principles indicates the City would
likely be required to show (1) that a legitimate governmental interest exists for distinguishing
between residents and non-residents, and (2) that the differential ?ne system reasonably relates to
carrying out that purpose. Given all of these considerations, a 20% or 25% discount for Detroiters
would be legally defensible and consistent with other municipalities, City of Miami 20%
discount).
