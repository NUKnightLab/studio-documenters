The Petitioner filed a lawsuit against the property owner. The County has a
lien in that matter to recover its Workers' Compensation expenditures.
Cook County paid Workers' Compensation benefits of $9,643.59 in temporary
total disability, $27,409.58 in medical expenses and $36,423.75 in permanent
partial disability for a total of $73,476.92. Pursuant to the Illinois Workers'
Compensation Act, the County is entitled to recover 75% of its lien, totaling
$55, 107.69, less a proportionate share of costs.
The Defendants offered to settle the third party case for $150,000.00. The
County has agreed to accept $50,000.00 of the settlement proceeds. This
means the County would reduce its lien by $5,107.69.
The Finance Subcommittee on Industrial Claims approved the reduction of the
County's lien on June 11, 2002. Therefore, we request Board approval of the
lien reduction reflecting a net recovery of $50,000.00.
