Legal Update
1. The Auditor General issued an audit finding for Lottery regarding cash transfers to the
Common School Fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. Lottery is working with
the governor’s office and inquiring to ask for support of its interpretation of its statues
and rules. Lottery will keep board members posted.
2. The Dept. of Justice gave an opinion on its interpretation of the Wire Act. This threatens
iLottery and all online gaming activities, which may affect the Gaming and Racing
Boards. Lottery is closely monitoring this with Camelot and the other states involved,
making sure all parties involved are notified. Lottery is taking appropriate action to
make sure we are in compliance with all the laws.

continued. Another hearing was held and settled.

DOJ Opinion Reversal in context:
In 2011, Illinois sought and received an opinion from the Dept of Justice on the Wire Act
and whether it was applicable to in state online selling of Lottery. The opinion issued
affirmed that the Wire Act only restricted interstate sports betting online. In December
2018 , the DOJ reversed that opinion and expanded the restriction to all forms of
interstate betting online, including Lottery.
Questions and comments by Board Members:
o

Board member Lori Yokoyama asked the acting director if there is a discussion amongst
state lotteries getting together and possibly filing a lawsuit regarding the DOJ opinion
reversal. The acting director stated the we deal with two organizations, 1). NASPL-North
American Association of State & Provincial Lotteries and 2). MUSL-Multi State Lottery
Association, which are being very proactive in working with the states. We have
numerous communications from them on defining a specific industry position to start to
build a defense against the opinion. They have taken steps to work with each state and
give them all the information that is available.

o

Board member Yokoyama asked if this recent decision is retroactive since most states in
the last 7-8 years have invested quite a bit of money to get online. Cornell Wilson said
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has issued a 90-day stay for any potential
enforcement and that any state should not rely on the old opinion letter going forward.
Attorney Generals for New Jersey and Pennsylvania issued a joint letter to DOJ to
withdraw the opinion.

ADJOURNMENT
Cornell Wilson gave the motion to adjourn meeting with business concluded. Board member Jani
seconded the motion and it was unanimously approved. Meeting was adjourned at 2:15pm.
Respectfully submitted,
Nora Iniguez
Lottery Control Board Secretary
