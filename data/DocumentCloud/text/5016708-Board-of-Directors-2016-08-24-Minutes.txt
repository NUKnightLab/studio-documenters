CODE DBRA 16-08-01-169
AMENDMENT TO THE FUNDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF DETROIT
BROWNFIELD REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF DETROIT BUILDING,
SAFETY ENGINEERING & ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT
WHEREAS, the DBRA was created pursuant to Act 381 of the Public Acts of Michigan of
1996 (“Act 381”) for the purpose of facilitating the implementation of brownfield plans and promoting
the revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain property, including, but not limited to, tax
reverted, blighted or functionally obsolete property within the City of Detroit; and
WHEREAS, the City of Detroit, by and through its Building, Safety Engineering &
Environmental Department (“BSEED”), established a Brownfield Clean Up Revolving Loan Fund
Program (“BCRLF”) and used U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) Funds to
administer grants and loans to eligible developers in accordance with the Assistance Agreement;
and
WHEREAS, the City of Detroit BSEED subsequently received repayments on the BCRLF
loans, as well as fees and earned interest, totaling Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($245,000.00) (the “Program Income”); and
WHEREAS, the City of Detroit BSEED desired to transfer the Program Income to the
DBRA so that DBRA could develop a revolving loan program to make the Program Income
available as loans to eligible developers for qualified clean-up costs on eligible property (the
“Program”); and
WHEREAS, the EPA approved the transfer of the Program Income with a six (6) month
obligation condition; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Funding Agreement between the City of Detroit
BSEED and DBRA dated May 10, 2016, the City of Detroit BSEED transferred the Program
Income to DBRA on July 27, 2016; and
WHEREAS, on August 4, 2016, the EPA informed BSEED and the DBRA that the EPA
was imposing a revised condition which would require the DBRA to obligate the Program Income
by October 15, 2016 and expend the funds by June 1, 2017 (the “New Deadlines”); and
WHEREAS, the EPA informed BSEED and the DBRA that any unobligated Program
Income would be subject to recapture by the EPA after October 15, 2016, and that any obligated,
but not disbursed, Program Income would be subject to recapture by the EPA after July 1, 2017;
and

 WHEREAS, to expedite the obligation and expenditure of the Program Income by the New
Deadlines, in addition to making loan, the EPA will also permit the DBRA to utilize the Program
Income as grant funds for Environmental Site Assessments (“ESA”); and
WHEREAS, the BSEED and DBRA staff feel that there is a large need for ESA grant
funding in the City of Detroit and that a pipeline of projects could be quickly identified to meet the
October 15, 2016 obligation deadline; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has determined that an Amendment to Funding
Agreement is required in order to spend the Program Income as grant funding for ESA.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that Board of Directors of the City of Detroit
Brownfield Redevelopment Authority does hereby authorize the negotiation and execution of an
Amendment to that certain Funding Agreement between the DBRA and the City of Detroit, by and
through its Building, Safety Engineering & Environmental Department to permit the DBRA to
utilize the Program Income as grant funds for Environmental Site Assessments.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that any two Officers, or any one of the Officers and any
one of the Authorized Agents or any two of the DBRA’s Authorized Agents, shall hereafter have
the authority to negotiate and execute any and all documents, contracts or other papers
necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions and intent of this resolution on behalf of the
DBRA.
BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that all of the acts and transactions of any officer or
authorized agent of the DBRA, in the name and on behalf of the DBRA, relating to matters
contemplated by the foregoing resolutions, which acts would have been approved by the
