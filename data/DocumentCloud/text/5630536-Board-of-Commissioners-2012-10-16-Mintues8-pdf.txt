recommended for Board approval by the Operations and Facilities Committee.
(Item C1)
A Request for Proposal was advertised in March 2012 in area newspapers for performance of audit
and professional consulting services approved by the CHA’s Audit Committee. It is essential that
CHA has the capability to review, assess and monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of
operations and practices. Performing validation and advisory services, CHA internal audit function
adds value to the organization by updating staff and commissioners on the latest significant
governance, risk, and compliance issues. Of the five proposals received, the evaluation committee
recommended the award of contract to KPMG, LLP. KPMG will be responsible for updating an
annual risk assessment and audit plan, updating and verifying that CHA is addressing the
identified risks, testing and evaluating audit areas, and validating compliance with applicable
regulations, policies and procedures. Annually, the CHA Audit Committee approves an audit plan
of projects based upon the risk assessment. CHA’s Director, Audit Management and Compliance,
working with the internal audit service provider, issues engagement scoping memos to
stakeholders involved in the audit projects. Accordingly, the resolution for Item C1 approves
award of contract to KPMG, LLC to provide internal auditing services to CHA.
RESOLUTION NO. 2012-CHA-84
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated October 10,
2012 entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO enter into a contract with KPMG, LLP to

(Item C2)
The resolution for Item C2 approves an amendment extending Contract No. 11007 with Ernst &
Young, LLP (E&Y) for the period November 11, 2012 to November 10, 2013, to provide
independent professional auditing services for a firm-fixed fee of $749,300. The CHA is
required to undergo an annual audit in conformity with Generally Accepted Auditing Principles,
Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States and
provisions provided in the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133. The audit is used
to determine whether the CHA’s financial data can be relied upon and the requirement promotes
sound financial management, including effective internal control, with respect to federal awards
administered by HUD, the state and local governments and not-profit-organizations. E&Y has
the proven track record of completing assignments timely and the resource flexibility to meet
CHA’s critical reporting requirements. E&Y utilized expertise from its various audit practices to
deliver key solutions to critical financial accounting and reporting issues. E&Y has assisted CHA
in implementing new Governmental Accounting Standard Board pronouncements and HUD
regulations. E&Y continues to be one of the top four national auditing firms, and a leading firm
in the Real Estate practice area, and has extensive experience in auditing governmental agencies
and non-profit entities. E&Y’s continued participation in the evolving Real Estate Assessment
Center and MTW reporting requirements is crucial for the Authority to meet its reporting
obligations to HUD.
