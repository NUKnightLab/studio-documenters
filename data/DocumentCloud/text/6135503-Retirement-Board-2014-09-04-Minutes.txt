2. Administrative Report
a. Organization Update
Nickol Hackett, Executive Director and CIO presented the administrative report. She stated
that the Fund was continuing its verification audit of the annuitants as had been approved by
the Board’s at their meeting on June 5, 2014. Michael Maratea, Director of Finance, reported
that the audit’s purpose was to verify that only those annuitants eligible for benefits were
receiving them and that if the annuitant could not be verified, then the benefit would be
suspended. To date, the process has confirmed the deaths of three members and all benefits
paid to those deceased members have been recovered. Mr. Maratea further reported that
benefits for two members had been suspended effective July 1, 2014, but were reinstated
once the Fund received verification about each of those members. Two more suspensions are
scheduled to be initiated with the annuity payments due on October 1, 2014. The Board then
discussed the need to continue the verification audit to ensure that benefits were paid
properly and the need to report any suspected fraud as is required under Section 1-135 of the
Illinois Pension Code.
3. Other Benefit Matters
a. Military Service – John D. Faron
Paul Rzeszutko, Director of Retirement Benefits presented a request made by John D. Faron
that the time in which he may pay the contributions due for his periods of military service
without interest be extended for an additional four years. Mr. Rzeszutko identified for the
Board the contributions and interest that were due from Mr. Faron for each of his periods of
military service. Mr. Rzeszutko stated that Mr. Faron was requesting more time to pay the
contributions due for his military service without interest than was permitted under the
Fund’s policy and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act
(“USERRA”).
The Board discussed the requirements of USERRA and the Illinois Pension Code noting the
Fund’s compliance with both. It was further discussed that if the Fund is to allow more time
to purchase military service credit without interest than required by USERRA, then the
Pension Code should be amended to grant this provision.
