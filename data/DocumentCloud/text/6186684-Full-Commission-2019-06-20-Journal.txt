REPORT FROM THE CHAIR
“154 years ago on June 19, 1865, 2½ years after the Emancipation
Proclamation, American slavery finally came to an end when the Union troops made it
to Galveston, Texas to inform the slaves that they were finally free. I am happy to say
that our very own Martha G. Scott sponsored Senate Bill 384 signifying June 19th as
National Freedom Day here in the State of Michigan [Applause]. I bring this up because
on yesterday, we celebrated June 19th, better known as Juneteenth, around the country
and I will say that unfortunately, I was not very much aware of that significance of that
until about 23/24 years ago when I was out in the West Coast in Las Vegas and many
of the people in Las Vegas come from Texas and the people from Texas told me about
Juneteenth and about June 19th and they celebrated highly on the West Coast, and
obviously in Texas and now as they years has gone by, we are celebrating it more and
216

 more across the country. So thank you, Commissioner Scott, thank you for all the
celebrations that we had on yesterday acknowledging Juneteenth and the freedom of
our slaves from the 1800s.”
Commissioner Scott provided remarks
Chair Bell Continued:
June is actually a very historic month because as we will hear later on, we have
the suffrage movement which is why we are all here in white today. So I am excited
that in a few moments we will hear from Commissioner Melissa Daub and our guest
speaker, Dr. Nancy Kursman as we discuss and commemorate the 100th anniversary of
the Women’s Suffrage Movement here in Michigan.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
The Acting Clerk advised that there was no Unfinished Business.
