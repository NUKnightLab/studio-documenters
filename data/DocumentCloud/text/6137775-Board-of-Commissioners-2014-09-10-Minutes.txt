COMMEMORATING THE EXCEPTIONAL COURAGE
AND LEGACY OF JOURNALIST JAMES FOLEY
WHEREAS, James Foley, a man whose inspirational life story of faith, courage and commitment to
journalism ended far too soon, when, at age 40 his life was taken at the hands of Islamist extremists. He
has left behind a devoted family, countless friends and a community profoundly enriched for having known
him; and
WHEREAS, James Foley’s exceptional generosity and kindness revealed itself early in life when he
indicated to friends and family his strong desire to be an agent for change to make the world a better place.
Shortly after he graduated from Marquette University in 1996, he took on the challenge to eliminate
educational inequality when he joined Teach for America. Over the years Foley taught in low-income
schools in Phoenix, Arizona, Amherst, Massachusetts, and Chicago, Illinois; and
WHEREAS, James Foley moved to Evanston, Illinois in his 30’s to attend Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism where he pursued his Master's Degree in journalism. While attending
Northwestern, James Foley continued his work to eliminate educational inequality; this time his pupils
were participants in the Cook County Sheriff’s Vocational Rehabilitation Impact Center, a project that is
an alternative to prison and is also known as Boot Camp. In Boot Camp, Foley, who was fluent in Spanish,
worked as a language arts teacher; and
WHEREAS, after earning his Master’s Degree in 2008 from Medill, he set off on his mission to tell the
stories of people suffering in war-ravaged countries; he would eventually cover conflicts in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. His selfless bravery and devotion to his craft compelled him to
continuously return to the troubled areas of the world even when doing so put his life and personal freedom
in jeopardy; he was held captive in Libya for 44 days in 2011. After his release from Libya, he returned
to Medill and spoke to students about how his religious faith and his relationships with the other captives
sustained him through the ordeal; and
WHEREAS, despite having first-hand knowledge of the dangers of the region, James Foley was drawn
back to tell the story of the suffering of the Syrian people. Foley was abducted in November, 2012, while
covering the Syrian conflict, and was later tragically killed; and
WHEREAS, James Foley’s absence will be felt most acutely by his family; he was the oldest of the five
children of John and Diane Foley a devout Roman Catholic family from Rochester, New Hampshire.
Despite the fact that his travels took him far from home, he maintained intensely close family ties
throughout his life; and
WHEREAS, hundreds gathered to mourn James Foley at a solemn service at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary
Church in the New Hampshire community where he was raised. "There is no sense to be made of

during his homily.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County who he served dutifully, commemorates the extraordinary life
of James Foley, and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable and innumerable
contributions he has made to the Citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of James

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE, TALENTS
AND LEGACY OF ROSAMOND CAMPBELL
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell, a woman of exceptional talent who tirelessly promoted the arts, died
August 15, leaving behind family, countless friends and a community enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell spent her early years in New York; a native of Brooklyn, she graduated
from Sarah Lawrence University, was a graduate student at Bank Street College of Education and studied
piano at the Julliard School; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell came to Illinois in 1952, where she met her husband Richard, a native
Chicagoan, at their first teaching jobs in the Village and Farm School of Northbrook. Together they were
strong advocates for education and became teachers whom their students treasured and admired.
Rosamond took time to raise the couple’s three (3) children and then later returned to teaching at the
Winnetka Community Nursery School. Richard was a respected and much venerated teacher for decades
at New Trier high school, and Rosamond taught music in the New Trier Extension program; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell, a passionate enthusiast of the dulcimer, published an instruction and
repertoire book for beginning to advanced students of the mountain dulcimer and founded the Dulcimer
Society of Northern Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell generously shared her love of music. She regularly performed at music
festivals, worked with music therapy projects at local hospitals and was a private instructor at Hogeye

Music in Evanston. As a teacher, she considered her greatest accomplishment to be that she helped
students at all levels find a beauty in the music they had created; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell was a longtime member of Unity Church on the North Shore, where
she shared her talents with the church choir; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell was a great admirer of the Victorian era who regularly collected antique
furniture. It was her deep love of the Victorian era that led her to become a published author. She was
concerned that, unlike the antique furniture of the era, the ephemeral nature of music would cause it to be
lost to history. So she published two (2) books of historical Victorian parlor music and one (1) book of
technique. It was her hope that her books would permanently preserve Victorian parlor music; and
WHEREAS, Rosamond Campbell was the cherished wife of Richard for over sixty (60) years and was a
devoted mother to Jennifer, Rick and Andrew. Rosamond was the doting grandmother of Cody and Jesse
Campbell Pruitt, Emma Campbell, and Ethan, Alexander, Anna and Lucy Chen Campbell.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Rosamond Campbell,
and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable contributions she has made to the citizens of
Cook County, Illinois; and

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County Justice Advisory Council
Grantee: Cook County Justice Advisory Council
Grantor: Illinois Department of Human Services
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: The purpose of the grant is to fund an exploratory analysis of youth from Chicago committed
to IDJJ by the Cook County Juvenile Court.
Grant Amount: $24,500.00
Grant Period: 9/15/2014 - 6/30/2015
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts:

N/A

Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: The JAC proposes to conduct an in-depth analysis of youth from Chicago committed to DJJ
by the Cook County Juvenile Court. The analysis will merge data sets from DJJ, the Department of
Children and Family Services, and the Chicago Police Department. Combined these data sets will give a
more complete picture of youths’ progression through the system, recidivism, history of separation from
family and initial insight into dispositional data. This initial data analysis may lead to combining other
data sets from relevant stakeholders providing a complete picture of opportunities to avoid commitments
to DJJ and better serve youths in a community based setting.

WHEREAS, Cook County is in the midst of preparing its first Long Range Transportation Plan in more
than 70 years a multimodal blueprint that will highlight the critical importance of improved and expanded
public transportation services to maintaining Cook County’s economic vitality and accommodating
increases in population, businesses and jobs; and
WHEREAS, improved and expanded passenger train service is essential to maintain Cook County’s
economic vitality and allow for increased growth and prosperity; and
WHEREAS, a new initiative for first-class passenger rail service called CrossRail Chicago has emerged
which would, for the first time, connect Metra route lines together, knitting together the Chicagoland region;
and
WHEREAS, Metra and Amtrak services bring in millions of people to Cook County and serve hundreds
of thousands of Cook County residents, but suffer from one fundamental flaw: all trains terminate in
downtown Chicago and do not travel through downtown Chicago, making regional travel on a train less
efficient and less attractive; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

WHEREAS, most of the Metra stations are stub stations where all tracks end and therefore do not allow
for crosstown service; there are two existing tracks at Union Station along the river that travel through the
station, connecting northbound and southbound service which also could be used for crosstown service;
and
WHEREAS, a 16th Street connector track exists which could allow for Metra Electric and Rock Island
trains to connect to Union Station then travel west, northwest and north, directly connecting the Southland
with the rest of Northeast Illinois; and
WHEREAS, Cook County residents of high unemployment areas do not have easy transportation access
to areas with job surplus, such as between the area of O'Hare/northwest suburbs and the high
unemployment areas of the south side and the south suburbs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County's largest transportation asset O'Hare Airport is not currently served well by
Metra and not served at all by Amtrak, leaving a major gap in Cook County's transportation network; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Department of Aviation’s new consolidated rental car facility built directly
adjacent to a Rosemont Metra station known as the O'Hare Transfer Station will provide a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to connect Metra and Amtrak service directly to O'Hare, opening up job
opportunities for the entire region; and
WHEREAS, both the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Michigan Department of
Transportation are currently working on plans for faster Amtrak service into Cook County, however, these
projects need to be coordinated to ensure these investments work together to provide the best possible
service for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, much like Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program
(CREATE) did for freight railroads, CrossRail Chicago, if implemented, would combine multiple
commuter and intercity rail projects already in various stages of planning into a coordinated program where
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Long Range Transportation Plan will seek to ensure that transportation
investments are part of a plan for prosperity, and that vision also includes agencies from outside of Cook
County, especially Amtrak and Metra to build and provide first-class passenger train service; and
WHEREAS, there is a gap in coordination for passenger rail projects throughout the region to ensure
that Cook County is part of a Midwest-wide process of building crosstown rail service.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners supports
CrossRail Chicago and its inclusion in the region's capital plans including those of the Chicago Metropolitan
Agency for Planning, the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Regional Transportation Authority and
Metra.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ISSUING A MORATORIUM ON FELONY PROSTITUTION CHARGES IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Illinois, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri and Texas are the only eight
(8) states in the Country to have a felony sentencing option for prostitution offenses; and
WHEREAS, of these eight (8) states, Illinois has the harshest sentencing option in the Country requiring
only one (1) prior prostitution conviction before a felony charge option is available for subsequent offenses;
and
WHEREAS, as noted by End Demand Illinois, the Department of Corrections reported 127 felony
prostitution admissions for 2012, costing the state $2,011,680.00. Pretrial detention for those facing

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

felony prostitution charges costs Cook County Department of Corrections between $5.3 to $9.5 million
annually; and
WHEREAS, felony convictions make the transition out of the sex trade to the legitimate economy more
difficult because those with felony convictions can be rejected from jobs, denied work authorization, denied
housing and can even be evicted from their homes for having a felony conviction; and
WHEREAS, rather than continuing to treat prostitution as a crime, we must shift our resources and focus
to the pimps and johns who exploit them.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and the members of
theCook County Board of Commissioners urge the General Assembly to pass legislation that will
permanently remove the felony prostitution charge option from Illinois State Statute; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State’s Attorney, the President and members of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners issue a moratorium on felony prostitution charges in Cook County.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

Department: Department of Budget and Management Services
Request: To allow for a transfer of funds within fixed charges Dept. 490 within our operating budget.
Reason: DBMS is looking to transfer appropriations from Electricity, Postage, and Professional
Services to Natural Gas Account, due to the harsh and extremely cold winter.
From Account(s): 499-410 / $465,000.00, 499260-225 / $100,000.00, 499-260 / $25,000.00
To Account(s): 499-422 / $590,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $590,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 7/15/2014, it became apparent that account 422 / Natural Gas, with a balance of $7,715.00 would
need additional funds to complete the rest of FY2014. On 6/16/2014, the balance in the account was
$217,316.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 410 / Electricity was recalculated for the remainder of FY2014 and due to current conditions,
reduction in the electricity expense is permissible. Account 260 / Professional Services, the management
cost at JTDC parking was less than expected. Account 260 / Postage is less than expected.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Utility costs are dynamic and subject to weather fluctuations. At the time of budget, we based
projections on the best information at the time.

A motion was made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, that this Transfer of
Funds be approved as amended. The motion carried.

PROPOSED MISCELLANEOUS ITEM OF BUSINESS
Department:

Department of Risk Management

Other Part(ies): Insurance Liquidations Investors, L.L.C., San Francisco, CA
Request: Authorization for the County of Cook County (“County”) to enter into an agreement to assign
and transfer the County’s claims against Reliance Insurance Company in Liquidation to Insurance
Liquidations Investors, L.L.C., for the amount of $976,834.07.
Summary: Reliance Insurance Company (“Reliance”) provided general liability and workers’
compensation coverage during the construction of the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital. As a result of
Reliance’s liquidation, the County became responsible for funding existing and new general liability and
workers’ compensation claims. The County had submitted documentation to the Reliance Liquidator for
reimbursement based on the assets available from Reliance’s Estate. The County has recovered
approximately 40% of the County’s General Liability claims; the last payment to the County occurred in
2011. The Department of Risk Management, in consultation with the Office of the Chief Financial
Officer and the State’s Attorney’s Office, determined that pursuing the assignment of these claims in
return for payment was a prudent and an expeditious method for resolving the uncertainty and
speculative nature surrounding the timing and amount of any future payments. As a result of this
agreement, the County will receive $976,834.07 or approximately 55.8% of the outstanding claims
yielding a total recovery of almost 74%. If approved, this item will authorize the County Comptroller
and Director of Risk Management to assign and transfer the County’s claims against Reliance Insurance
Company in Liquidation to Insurance Liquidations Investors, LLC for the amount of $976,834.07.
This agreement to assign and transfer the County’s claims has been reviewed and approved by the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office.

1. The purpose of this Intergovernmental Agreement (“Agreement”) is to authorize the collaboration and
cooperation between the County and Worth to enforce Cook County’s Vacant Building Code provisions
within the borders of Worth and to document and set forth the obligations of each party to the
Agreement. Per the agreement, the Cook County Department of Building and Zoning and its employees

Concurrences:
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This contract is for a major replacement of the fire suppression systems at the locations
listed below. The existing Halon Suppression Systems at these facilities are outdated and obsolete. The
systems require upgrading as the obsolete components require replacement parts that are no longer being
manufactured. New codes and standards have been created since these systems were installed. The Halon
Suppression Systems were employed over 17 years ago to provide a means of fire suppression, primarily
in rooms with high-value electronic equipment. Since their installation, Halon Suppression Systems have
been identified as an ozone depletion chemical and are no longer available for recharging the existing
systems. Reconfiguration of spaces in the facilities also means adjustments and/or correction of systems
so that all fire alarm and supervisory alarm signals are accurately indicated on the control panels.
The system shall be completely functional. It shall include mechanical and electrical installation, all
detection and control equipment, agent and storage containers, discharge nozzles, pipe and fittings,
manual release and abort stations, audible and visual alarm devices, auxiliary devices and controls,
shutdowns, alarm interface, and advisory signs, and testing of a functional UL listed SAPPHIRE Clean
Agent Suppression System. Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with
Cook County Procurement Code. Rolf Jensen & Associates, Inc. is recommended for the Countywide
Fire and Life Safety Systems Upgrades Package Number 10 contract.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: A Professional Services Agreement for Job Order Contracting (JOC) Consultant Services
between Cook County Government Countywide and The Gordian Group, Inc., Contract No. 11-28-043
was approved by the Board of Cook County Commissioners on 5/14/2012.
The objective of the JOC program is to provide an alternate procurement method to enable the County to
rapidly engage construction project simultaneously.
The request to increase in the amount of $2,500,000.00 is based on the available capacity of the JOC
contractors. The Gordian Group’s fee for the services provided is assessed as a percentage of the value of
construction procured by the County through the JOC program. The increase requested through this
amendment was calculated by the applying The Gordian Group’s percent fee against the total value of
construction that is available to be purchased by the County through its JOC contracts. The County is
under no obligation to expend the amount requested, and is only obligated to pay The Gordian Group’s fee
when the construction work is procured through the JOC program. This amendment will allow the County
to utilize the remaining capacity on the JOC contracts during the contract term.

PROPOSED RECONSIDERATION OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ITEM AND REQUEST TO
APPROVE AS AMENDED
Department: The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the
Department of Transportation and Highways and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer.
Request: Amend the authorization amount for various contracts awarded for the Countywide Job Order
Contract (JOC) Program. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that allows facility owners to
complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction project with a single, competitively bid
contract. The JOC process involved first selecting a vendor pool of potential contractors through a
competitive procurement process, and identifying projects for such selected vendors. The contractors
were found to be the lowest, responsive and responsible bidder through a competitive bid process in
accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
On 3/20/2013, The Board of Commissioners approved contracts with the selected contractors listed
below for the Countywide Job Order Contracting (JOC) Program. The contractors selected under this
contract replaced those contractors providing services under the prior City of Chicago contract, which
was a comparable government procurement in accordance with the Cook County Procurement Code.
The contracts are a two (2) year base term with two (2) one-year renewal options from the date of
execution; 3/20/2013 to 3/19/2015.
The Office of Capital Planning and Policy, the Department of Facilities Management, the Department of
Transportation and Highways, and the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer request authorization to
increase the previously approved contract of $24,000,000.00, by $24,000,000.00 to accommodate two (2)
year base contract period. The increase will allow the JOC program to facilitate all departments’
upcoming projects through the base contract period.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD AMENDMENT
Department: Department of Planning and Development within the Bureau of Economic Development
Grantee: Cook County
Grantor: United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

Request: Authorization to increase the CDBG Disaster Grant that was originally awarded on
12/23/2013 and accepted by the Board
Purpose: Disaster Relief from flooding in April/May, 2013
Supplemental Grant Amount: $54,900,000.00
Grant Period: 12/23/2013 - 9/30/2019
Extension Period: 12/23/2013 - 9/30/2019
Fiscal Impact: N/A
Accounts: N/A
Date of Previous Board Authorization for Grant: 3/12/2014
Previous Grant Amount: $13,900,000.00
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.
Summary: Transmitted herewith is a request for the approval to accept a U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) grant of Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery
(CDBG-DR) funds in response to disasters occurring in 2013, authorized under the Disaster Relief
Appropriations Act, 2013. The purpose of the CDBG-DR program is to assist targeted areas that have
been affected by a natural disaster (in this case, severe storms and flooding during the period of
4/16/2013 to 5/5/2013). The program will provide necessary expenses related to disaster relief, long-term
recovery, restoration of infrastructure and housing, and economic revitalization in the most impacted
and distressed areas resulting from a major disaster declared pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (Stafford Act). Cook County was initially allocated $13.9
million, which was accepted by the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 3/12/2014. Subsequent to
the initial allocation, Cook County was awarded an additional $54.9 million, bringing the total grant

Page 295 of 370

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

amount to $68.8 million. The Cook County Department of Planning and Development met with or
consulted studies done by the Cook County Departments of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management, Environmental Control, and Transportation and Highways, the Cook County Forest
Preserve District, the Illinois and Federal Emergency Management Agencies (IEMA and FEMA,
respectively), the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as well
as municipal and township leaders to discuss areas that were most affected by the 2013 disaster and
important projects that need to be done.
The Department of Planning and Development desires to fund projects that strategically assist with the
recovery efforts and support other investments which are occurring in the area. Cook County plans to
enter into CDBG-DR agreements with municipalities, townships, for-profit and non-profit entities to
implement CDBG-DR activities or to directly implement activities.
Approval of the additional grant is being respectfully requested and that the Chief of the Bureau of
Economic Development or his designee be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook, any
and all documents necessary to facilitate administration of the program approved here in, including but
not limited to the CDBG-DR grant agreement and any modifications thereto. The approval of this of the
Program by this Honorable Body will permit the CDBG-DR program to continue its forward progress.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
ADDITIONS TO THE COOK COUNTY HOME CONSORTIUM
WHEREAS, the County of Cook (the County) is an entitlement community pursuant to the regulations of
the HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) at 24 CFR Part 92 and the Community Development
Block Grant Program (CDBG) at 24 CFR Part 570, which entitles the County to receive an annual allocation
of Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships Program
(HOME) grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); and
WHEREAS, the amount of HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funds that the County
receives pursuant to entitlement status is determined by a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) formula that takes into consideration the populations of the municipalities withinits
jurisdiction; and
WHEREAS, the Villages of Hoffman Estates and Palatine (the Electing Municipalities) within the County
that receive Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds directly from U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) can elect to join the County’s HOME Investment Partnerships
Program (HOME) Consortium (the Consortium), which would allow U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) to take into account the populations of these municipalities when calculating
the County’s annual HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funds entitlement grant, thus

Page 306 of 370

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

increasing the County’s annual allocation; and
WHEREAS, the Electing Municipalities are choosing to join the Consortium, as signified by Resolution
of their municipal boards; and
WHEREAS, each Electing Municipality must conform to the Consortium Program Year, which runs
October 1 through September 30 in accordance with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) rules; and
WHEREAS, as the Electing Municipalities move to the Consortium Program Year they may experience a
gap in their administrative funding for the few months after their old program year expires and before the
Consortium Program Year begins. (i.e., if their current program year ends on June 30 there is a three month
gap before the new program year starts on October 1); and
WHEREAS, the County wants to maximize its federal allocation of HOME Investment Partnerships
Program (HOME) Funds by including the Electing Municipalities in the Consortium. The County’s
HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) Investment Partnerships Program could see up to a
$534,000 increase over three (3) years by adding the populations of the Electing Municipalities into the
formula for calculating the grant amount; and
WHEREAS, to facilitate the addition of the Electing Municipalities to the Consortium, the County will
provide the financing for the loss in administrative funding and program funding that is needed to align the
program years in each Electing Municipality; and
WHEREAS, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires that the Cook County
Board of Commissioners act by Resolution to add the new entitlement communities into the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) Consortium.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the President and the Board of Commissioners of the County
of Cook, Illinois:
Section 1: That the County will set aside a fund of no more than $10,000 in non-federal dollars to be used
to fund the administrative costs incurred by the Electing Municipalities for periods not funded, within a
three (3) year period, due to the alignment of the program years of the Electing Municipalities with the
Consortium Program Year in accordance with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
requirements.
Section 2: That the County be and is hereby authorized to enter into an Addendum to the HOME
Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement for
Federal Fiscal Years 2015, 2016, and 2017 to add the Electing Municipalities and that the President, Bureau
Chief of Economic Development or the County Clerk are hereby authorized to execute said HOME
Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) Investment Partnerships Program Consortium Agreement
Addendums, Memorandums of Understanding, and any additional documents necessary to further the
aforementioned initiative, and any modifications thereto.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution shall be in full force and effect from and after its

delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
These accounts were chosen because of the unobligated amounts in the smaller accounts, account 401
was used because of the amount of fuel that has not been expended this year and account 260 because of
the amount of unencumbered funds.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Public Administrator Office (PAO)

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

Request: To allow for a transfer of funds within our operating budget.
Reason: The PAO needs an independent outside attorney to handle labor issues, personnel disputes and
hearings, collective union bargaining and certain litigation which arises periodically. Special outside
counsel is required for cases in which the PAO has issues outside its probate role as administrator of
estates as to collateral litigation involving the office.
From Account(s): 390-110, $24,000.
To Account(s): 390-261, $24,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $24,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 7/14/2014 it became apparent that account 390-261 would need additional funds to include outside
counsel for labor/personnel, collective union bargaining and collateral litigation involving the office. The
balance in the account on 7/14/2014 was $0.00, and the balance was the same 30 days prior.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account used for the source of funds is a position (Assistant to the Public Administrator) that became
vacant in December, 2013. Due to the position not being filled, the excess money has not been used.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
N/A
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The previous employee in the unexpected resignation caused the funds to become available.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A COOK COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PUBLIC HEARING
WHEREAS, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), nearly 60 million Americans
experience a mental health condition every year; regardless of race, age, religion or economic status,
mental illness impacts the lives of at least one in four adults and 1 in 10 children across the United States;
and
WHEREAS, deinstitutionalization, the name given to the policy of moving severely mentally ill people
out of large state institutions and then closing part or all of those institutions began in 1955 with the
widespread introduction of chlorpromazine, commonly known as Thorazine, the first effective
antipsychotic medication, and received a major impetus 10 years later with the enactment of federal
Medicaid and Medicare; and
WHEREAS, deinstitutionalization has inadvertently helped create the mental illness crisis by discharging
people from public psychiatric hospitals without ensuring that they received the medication and
rehabilitation services necessary for them to live successfully in the community; and
WHEREAS, this policy further exacerbated the situation as once the public psychiatric beds had been
closed, they were not available for people who later became mentally ill, a situation that continues to this
day; and

Page 350 of 370

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

WHEREAS, in addition, over the past decade, states have cut billions from their mental health budgets,
shuttering clinics across the country including here in Illinois and Cook County; resulting in thousands of
mentally ill people funneling in and out of the nation's jails that are ill-equipped to handle them, effectively
criminalizing mental illness; and
WHEREAS, according to the most recent national study conducted by the Justice Department's Bureau
of Justice Statistics in 2006, more than half of all prison and jail inmates, including 56 percent of state
prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners and 64 percent of local jail inmates, were found to have a mental
health problem; and
WHEREAS, jail and prison are particularly bad places for the mentally ill as men and women with
behavioral disorders and mental illness end up in stressful prison environments and many are put in
seclusion for long stretches of time that further exacerbate their conditions; and
WHEREAS, according to a 2010 study by the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Treatment Advocacy
Center, nationwide more than three times as many mentally ill people are housed in prisons and jails as in
hospitals; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, it is estimated that up to 30% of inmates being held in the county jail have
a mental illness on a given day, making the jail Illinois’ and one of the nation’s largest mental health
facilities; and
WHEREAS, it costs $143 per day to house an inmate at the Cook County jail that number jumps to
upwards of $200 and sometimes far more for an inmate with a mental illness, due to the costs of
medication and the extra supervision and care that are required to support them; and
WHEREAS, their cases clog the courts with largely minor offenses that in turn lengthens the jail time for
everyone. The average length of stay is now eight days longer than it was just a few years ago, costing
county taxpayers $10 million more every year, which doesn’t include the associated court costs putting a
strain on the entire criminal justice system in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, treating the mentally ill in health clinics costs a fraction of what it costs to house them in the
county detention center, not to mention the human aspect of housing the mentally ill in a jail setting, where
they are often preyed upon while incarcerated, or disciplined because of trouble following rules, and are
much more likely than other prisoners, for example, to be injured in a fight; and
WHEREAS, the advent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and resulting County Care program along with
State Medicaid has given the County a tool to potentially change the makeup of the jail population,
decrease the burden on local taxpayers, and ensure that the most vulnerable patients have access to
coordinated health-care coverage; and
WHEREAS, at present up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated at the County Jail have signed up
for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act; and

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 10, 2014

WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System plays an important role in providing care for
the mentally ill at the jail by administering Cermak Hospital, but also can play an important role in the
community at large along with its network of health-care providers and community-based organizations
to service the mentally ill population in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that this government understands the nature, scope and costs associated with
the mental health crisis facing our county in order to make informed decisions to better respond to said
crisis while making efficient use of our limited resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
request a public hearing be held to bring together key stakeholders in order to fully understand the status of
mental health in Cook County and its associated costs.

(a)Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a tax is imposed upon the privilege of transferring title to,
or beneficial interest in, real property located in the County whether or not the agreement or contract
providing for the transfer is entered into in the County. The tax shall be at the rate of $0.25 per $500.00 of
the transfer price, or fraction thereof, of the real property or the beneficial interest in real property. If,
however, the real estate is transferred subject to a mortgage, the amount of the mortgage remaining
outstanding at the time of transfer shall not be included in the basis of computing the tax.

transfer.
(d)The primary incidence of the tax and the obligation to pay the tax are on the seller, grantor, assignor or
other transferor; provided however, that if the transferor is exempt from the tax solely by operation of State

entity is effected affected by one transaction or by a series of related transactions. For purposes of this
subsection, it shall be presumed unless proved otherwise that transactions are related if they occur within

(f)Nothing in this article shall be construed to impose a tax upon any transaction or privilege which, under
the constitutions of the United States or the State of Illinois, may not be made the subject of taxation by the
County.

signed by at least one of the transferees, or by their respective attorneys or agents. The declaration shall be
on a form prescribed by the Recorder, and shall contain such information as the Recorder may reasonably
require. Declarations may also be submitted electronically through a transfer tax management software
program approved by the Recorder of Deeds, and these shall be considered filed with the Recorder upon
the Recorder’s receipt of a unique transaction identification number. Electronically submitted declarations
shall also be considered signed by the parties when they are clearly identified with a statement of attestation.
(b)If the declaration is signed by an attorney or agent on behalf of transferors or transferees who have the
power of direction to deal with the title to the real property under a land trust agreement, the trustee being
the mere repository of record legal title with a duty of conveying the real property only when and if directed

No trustee of a trust which holds title to or beneficial interest in real property located in the County shall
accept or acknowledge an assignment of a beneficial interest in the trust unless the trustee has received from
