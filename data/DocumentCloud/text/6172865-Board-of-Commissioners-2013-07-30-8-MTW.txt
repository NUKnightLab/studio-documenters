RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan
Amendment.
The Executive Vice President (EVP) and the Office of the General Counsel have completed all necessary
due diligence to support the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval of this item

CORPORATE GOAL
1.
Provide more housing options for families
2.
Assist residents in achieving self-sufficiency
3.
Increase the cost-effectiveness of public housing and HCV program administration.
Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) is proposing an Amendment to the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan. A
38-day public comment period was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to
submit comments orally and in writing, regarding the information contained in the proposed Plan. The
public comment period ran from May 28 through July 5, 2013. During such time, on June 11, 2013, a
public comment hearing was held. Prior to finalizing the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment, CHA
gave consideration to comments received during the public comment period. Announcements for the
public comment process appeared in the Chicago Defender, Chicago Sun-Times and Hoy newspapers in
May 27- June 3 (weekdays only) and again on June 10-14, 2013.
To this end, CHA has complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and HUD regulations
regarding annual plans. CHA requests that the Board of Commissioners approve the FY2013 MTW
Annual Plan Amendment. Pending Board approval, CHA will submit the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan
Amendment to HUD.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) laws.
The EVP concurs with the recommendation to approve the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment.
The CEO/President recommends the approval of the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment.
