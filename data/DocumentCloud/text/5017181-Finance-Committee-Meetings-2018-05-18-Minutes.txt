Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided introductory comments regarding a recent report by the
Cook County Office of the Inspector General (OIIG), pertaining to accounts receivable.
May 18, 2018
Finance Committee Remarks
Dr. Jay Shannon
Before we get started with today’s Finance Committee meeting, I want to address the OIIG
report on Accounts Receivable as well as the recent media stories.
First and foremost, I want this Board to understand that we do not know how the IG arrived
at the numbers that were in his report. We have asked for the methodology but have not
received it.
It is also critical for you to understand that the IG did not interview our Chief Financial Officer
or our Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Finance and Strategy during the course of the
investigation.
It is hard to imagine that the two individuals closest to this matter wouldn’t have had
pertinent information to share.
As this Board knows, we have spent considerable time and resources in the past three and a
half years building the competencies in billing and collections.
We explicitly address many of these things in the Strategic Plan.
Overnight we went from an organization who had two primary audiences – the uninsured
and Medicaid – and one payor – the state’s Medicaid program. We counted patients every
day and sent a bill to the State.
Much has changed and we have had to change with it. We now have contracts with 20
different payors from Medicaid MCOs to pharmacy benefit managers to Medicare. This has
required us to build systems we never had and train staff on the complexities of each
individual contract.
And despite what the media says – it has paid off for our patients and our taxpayers.
Many of our patients are now insured and have access to primary care. And our taxpayers
are paying 75% less today than they were in 2009.
The local taxpayer allocation toward the operation of this health system is $102 million. Let
me remind you, our budget is a little over $2 billion.
In this year’s budget alone, we have absorbed more than $370 million through other revenue
sources, mainly patient fee revenues. We believe that says a lot about progress work the
system has made to reduce the reliance on local taxpayers and successfully be reimbursed
for the care we provide to those who do have coverage.
Page 2 of 72

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items
Finance Committee Remarks by Dr. Jay Shannon (continued)
The compounded result of the reduced tax allocation has resulted in the County being able to
redirect $2.5 billion to other areas of County Government over the past 10 years.
In addition to this, we are assuming the debt service on new projects and equipment as well
as paying the current pension liability.
No other County agency can say that.
It is unfortunate that our critics want to focus so narrowly but for our staff and leadership
team, we must look at the bigger picture.
People wanted us to stand on our own two feet and we are doing that.
People wanted us to do more with less of a burden on taxpayers and we are doing that.
People wanted us to build a portfolio of behavioral health services to address the growing
crisis in our communities and we have done that.
And despite what people say, the mission of this organization is charity.
We are the public safety net system that spends $250 million dollars every year providing
charity care to those who meet financial eligibility.
There isn’t another health system in this county doing this level of charity care and we are
doing it without any support from the local taxpayer.
And if we weren’t collecting patient fees at a rate never before seen by this system, we could
not do it.
As long as we are the safety net for the most vulnerable with dwindling resources coming
from County government – we need to pay for it.
I take issue with anyone who questions our commitment to make sure that this organization
succeeds.
There is no group of people more interested in seeing this organization succeed than our
staff and our leadership team.
And we aren’t interested in success for our sake – rather for our patients.
What we have accomplished in the past four years is remarkable. And I can’t let that get
overshadowed by a couple negative stories by a media outlet who has never supported us or
our mission.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items
Finance Committee Remarks by Dr. Jay Shannon (continued)
So as we move forward, I want to publicly thank our Board, our employees and our
leadership team for the unwavering commitment to adapt to an incredibly complex
healthcare environment for the benefit of the patients we serve.
We must keep our eye on the ball, which is long term sustainability, as long as we have
patients other systems will not care for.
Chairman Reiter commented that he has worked with the leadership and employees here at the System on a
variety of issues; he sees the commitment everyday to doing the job better and understanding how important the
System is from the top of the organization all the way down to its grassroots.
Director Richardson-Lowry stated that it is important that Dr. Shannon reaffirm for the record, he did in some
part, that it is his intent and the leadership team’s intent to address any ongoing challenge associated with the
operations of this System. Dr. Shannon responded that this is absolutely true; they have put in place training,
technologies, education, assessment and ongoing performance feedback in all the different steps relating to
revenue cycle, from registration through coding and billing and denials management. He noted that the
organization is not where it wants or needs to be, but significant progress is being made.
Charles Jones, Chief Procurement Officer, provided an overview of the contractual requests presented for the
Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 8, Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy,
provided an example of the information available on the eConsult platform.
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Jones noted for the record that Cook Radiation Oncology, S.C. is a Countycertified Minority Business Enterprise vendor.
With regard to request number 22, Director Richardson-Lowry had two (2) questions: 1) why not use CCHHS
employees for this; and 2) what are the special skills of this company? Mr. Elwell responded that the
administration continues to recruit for these positions, but it is taking longer than expected; the intent is to have
these services provided in-house. There are currently thirty-six (36) positions that are vacant, and the position
requires applicants to have one (1) year of experience. This vendor has experience in this area, and is already
providing these types of services to other Chicago-area clients. The administration believes that this vendor was
head and shoulders above the others who submitted a proposal. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether
performance incentives are built into the contract. Mr. Elwell responded affirmatively; he stated that the vendor
only receives a percentage of what they collect - if they collect nothing they will not get paid. They are also
required to present reports so the administration can monitor for any potential cherry-picking of the process, to
keep the vendor from only working on the large bills. Mr. Elwell added that another separate request for
proposals (RFP) was issued for coding and physician billers, which involves a separate expertise. The
administration also plans to have these services as employee-staffed functions, but contractual services will be
necessary as recruiting for those positions continues.
Chairman Reiter, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved the approval
of request numbers 1 through 22, subject to completion of review by Contract
Compliance, where appropriate. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)
• Metrics
• Financials through March 2018
Ekerete Akpan, Chief Financial Officer, provided an overview of the information contained in the report. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Munar commented on the need to continue to educate all of the System’s constituents about the
System’s four (4) lines of business, about how diverse they are, and how the overall budget rolls up through
those four (4) lines. The ratio that is third party or Medicaid versus local tax dollars is an important part of the
narrative, because that gets lost in some of the reporting. The organization should continue to emphasize
those diverse lines of business and diverse revenue sources, and reflect how the System is efficiently
managing them together for the benefit of the people of Cook County.
With regard to the information provided on slide 24 regarding payor mix, Director Junge inquired whether
there is a way to reflect correctional health as a segment under “uninsured” or “other”. She stated that this
should be included whenever possible, as it is a huge responsibility that the System does well, and should also
be part of the narrative. Dr. Shannon responded that this is a good point; however, the System is reimbursed
with local tax dollars for provision of those services. He commented on Director Munar’s observations; he
stated that, if one looks at the System’s number of Medicaid and uninsured patients, that amounts to nearly
80% of the patients served. That is a dramatically challenging payor mix. Additionally, when one looks at all
of the System’s patients who are insured, the dominant payor out of the insured subset is Medicaid, which is a
low payor. He agreed that they have to do a better job of presenting and clarifying those important facts.
Mr. Akpan also reviewed a presentation on Revenue Cycle Initiatives (included in Attachment #3), which
included information on the following subjects:
•
•

People / Process Improvements
Technology Investments

Mr. Akpan noted that, for the upcoming Board Meeting, he plans to also present Revenue Cycle metrics.
Page 5 of 72

 V.

Report from the Chief Financial Officer (continued)
Following the presentation, Director Munar suggested that the administration consider using a pilot program
approach, using high volume, high complexity areas to refine and enhance processes around revenue cycle
improvements. Mr. Akpan responded that this is exactly the approach they are using.

VI.
