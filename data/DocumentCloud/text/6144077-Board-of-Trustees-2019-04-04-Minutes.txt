mitigating any potential interaction between District mosquito abatement operations and

matter of policy and practice.
President Zbesko also said that the District has always taken measures to protect nontarget species and has taken steps over the last year to mitigate any impacts to the Rusty
Patched Bumblebee. The District will continue to examine its operations in consultation
