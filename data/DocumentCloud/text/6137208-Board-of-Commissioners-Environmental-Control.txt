WHEREAS, the EPA requires testing of municipal water systems between 300-480
times per month; and
WHEREAS, supplying the plastic for the water bottles consumed by Americans
required more than 47 million gallons of oil annually, equivalent to the release of one
billion pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; and
WHEREAS, the transportation and shipment of bottled water burns massive quantities
of fossil fuel; and
WHEREAS, 86 percent of plastic water bottles used in the U.S. end up in landfills,
where they will take up to 1,000 years to biodegrade; and
WHEREAS, the incineration of the plastic bottles releases toxic byproducts such as
chlorine gas and ash laden with heavy metals into the air; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Los Angeles, Ann Arbor, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and
Santa Barbara have banned the city-financed purchase of plastic water bottles and the
sale of plastic water bottles on municipal property; and
WHEREAS, the cities of Oklahoma City, Charlottesville (VA), and New York are
considering bans; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors passed a resolution calling for a study on
the impact of plastic water bottles on municipal waste systems, citing the increased
plastic waste created by the bottles, the fossil fuels used to produce and transport
them and the billions spent by city governments on water each year; and
WHEREAS, methods exist to provide purified water to County employees through
means that minimize harm to the environment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that no County department or agency shall purchase single serving

and that this prohibition will apply to County contractors and County funded and/or
sponsored events; and

Maintenance shall, within 90 days of passage, work with all County departments to
conduct a water audit to assess their current water usage, availability of fresh tap
water, and the feasibility and cost of installing water purification systems; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such audit shall determine the viability of switching
all bottled water dispensers to bottle-less water dispensers; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such audit shall also determine the viability of
turning on all currently disconnected drinking water fountains; and

After determining that a quorum was not present, Chairman Quigley convened the meeting for
the purpose of taking witness testimony until such time a quorum was present.
Commissioner Beavers inquired as to the cost of installing water fountains if this resolution were to be
approved. He added that water fountains were removed from City Hall due to security reasons.
Chairman Quigley responded that part of the resolution calls for an audit to assess the Countyâ€™s current
water usage, availability of fresh tap water, and the feasibility and cost of installing water purification
systems. He stated that currently the County spends an estimated $400,000 per year on bottled water.
