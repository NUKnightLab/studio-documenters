RE: Review of the 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAF R) for the City
of Detroit

Executive Summary

The Legislative Policy Division (LPD) in this memorandum provides the City Council a report
on the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 (2018
CAFR). A copy of the 2018 CAP has been presented to the members of the Budget, Finance
and Audit Committee for review.

We acknowledge and commend the efforts of the OCFO (Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer)
staff to complete the 2018 CAFR on December 14, 2018 ahead of the deadline of December 3 
2018.

Plante Moran, PLLC, the City?s independent auditor, issued an unquali?ed (?clean?) Opinion
for the 2018 CAFR, including its audited ?nancial statements and related footnotes. A clean
Opinion does not mean that the City?s ?nancial condition is satisfactory. Essentially a ?clean"
opinion means that the City?s 2018 CAFR is fairly presented in all material aspects. As a result,
investors, creditors, rating agencies and other interested parties reading the City?s 2018 CAFR
can rely on the audited ?nancial statements and the information contained therein.

review of the 2018 CAFR was based on the following focus questions:
I Will the City of Detroit be able to pay its hills (both expected and unexpected) on
time (near-term ?nancing situation)?
0 Is the City of Detroit?s ?nancial health improving or deteriorating (long-term
?nancial condition)?
0 To what extent has the City?s emergence ?'om bankruptcy on December 10, 2014
improved the City?s ?nancial condition (post-bankruptcy impact)?

1

 Is it likely that today's ?nancial position for the City of Detroit will improve or
deteriorate in the future (economic condition)?

review of the 2018 CAFR focuses on major issues we raise from our review of the 2018
CAFR as we feel the 2018 CAFR addresses the preceeding focus questions. However, to gain a
broader ?high level" understanding of the 2018 CAP from a ?nancial perspective, LPD
encourages the reader of this report to also read the ?Introductory Section Transmittal Letter"
(pages of the 2018 CAFR) and the ?Management Discussion and Analysis? section (pages
4-16 ofthe 2018 CAFR) in the 2018 CAFR.

Maior lssges from; the City?s General Fund Financial Statements in the 2018 CAFR (Near-
term Qersgeetive)

Note: the governmental fund ?nancial statements are used to assess a government's near-
tenn ?nancing situation since their measurement focus is primarily near-tenn. The City?s
chief governmental fund that is reported in the 2018 CAFR is the ?General Fund?. Most
of the City?s basic services, such as public protection (police and recreation and
general services, are reported in the General Fund. Taxes and intergovernmental revenue
generally fund these services. Whether or not the General Fund?s ?fund balance" (assets
and deferred out?ows of resourcesI less liabilities and deferred in?ows of resourcesz) is
in a surplus or de?cit position is a key indicator of the ?nancial health of the City of
Detroit as a government from a near?term perspective.

The City?s General Fund ended up with an $18.4 million operating surplus for FY 2018.

. The General Fund had an accumulated unassigned ?tnd balance (surplus) of $131.5
million at June 30, 2018, a $37.5 million decrease from the $169.0 million accumulated
unassigned surplus at June 30, 2017.3 This means the City had suf?cient assets to pay its
obligations at June 30, 2018. Expenditures were less than budgeted mainly due to
un?lled positions.

The City?s General Fund assets and deferred out?ows of resources exceeded its liabilities
and deferred in?ows of resources by $611.2 million. As a result, the General Fund had a
total ?md balance at June 30, 2018 of $611.2 million, an $18.4 million increase from the
$592.8 million total ?ind balance at June 30, 2017.

Most of the General Fund total fund balance of $611.2 million at June 30, 2018 is
assigned for reinvestment, future liabilities, and potential risks: a) $62.3 million for

 

A deferred out?ows of resources is a consumption of net position that applies to a future period and so will not be
recognized as an out?ow of resources (expense) until then. An example of a deferred out?ow of resources is an
employer pension contribution made after the measurement date.

1 A deferred in?ows of resources is an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period and so will not be
rec0gnized as an in?ow of resources (revenue) until that time. An example of a deferred in?ow of resources is a
grant revenue received past the period of availability.

The City has used the General Fund accumulated unassigned surplus for important expenditures. Of the FY 2017
$169.0 million accumulated unassigned surplus, $52 million was used to pay off the Notes in FY 2018; $45.2 was
budgeted in FY 2019 for blight remediation; and $52.2 million was budgeted in FY 2019 for capital imprOVements.
0f the FY 20 8 $131.5 million accumulated unassigned surplus, $73 million was budgeted in FY 2020 for blight
remediation; $32.5 million was budgeted in FY 2020 for capital improvements; and $12.1 million was budgeted in
FY 2020 for risk management.

Budget Reserve; b) $66.8 million for Risk Management Fund; 0) $100 million for blight
and capital projects; and d) $58.6 million for subsequent appropriations. In addition, a
total of $103.3 million of the ?rnd balance is set-aside and restricted for future pension
contributions.

The General Fund?s cash and investments and restricted cash at June 30, 2018 totaled
$643.4 million. The main reason for the General Fund?s improved liquidity was the
signi?cant reduction of certain obligations (especrally pension and retiree health care
costs) ?'om the bankruptcy. The graph below details the General Fund?s improved
liquidity per cash and investments and total fund balance for ?scal years 2018, 2017, and
2013.

June 30, 2013 102,176,954 (72,980,749)

Although the General Fund is now able to pay its bills on time, and its ?nancial health is
improving, cautionary notes are warranted. First, the City still has looming increases in
pension and debt obligations. Secondly, although $643.4 million in General Fund cash
and investments is sizable, the lion share of it is either obligated, restricted or assigned to
a speci?c purpose.

Maior Issues from the Cit-V?s Governmental-Wide Financial Statements in the 2613 CAFR {Long-
term perspective) 

Note: the government-wide ?nancial statements are designed to provide readers with a
broad overview of the City?s ?nances, in a manner similar to a private sector business.
The government-wide ?nancial statements are used to best assess the City?s citywide
?nancial condition since their measurement focus is primarily long?tenn. For
govemment?wide statement of net position balance sheet), how net position (total
assets and deferred outflows less total liabilities and deferred in?ows) changes over time
can indicate how well a government is covering future cost of governmental operations
with available resources over the long-term.

The governmental activities and business-type activities ?nancial statements comprise
the primary govemment?s (citywide) ?nancial statements: Government activities? most of
the City?s basic services, such as police and ?re, are reported under this category. Taxes

3

and intergovernmental revenue generally fund these services; Business-type activities-
the City charges fees to customers to help it cover all or most of the cost of services it
provides, such as water and transportation.

Over time, increases and decreases in net position measure whether the City?s citywide
?nancial condition is improving or eroding. The primary government?s (citywide) net
position (net worth) was $898.0 million, meaning total assets and deferred out?ows of
resources exceeded total liabilities and deferred in?ows of resources by $898.0 million at
June 30, 2018, an increase of $86.0 million from the $812.0 billion net position at June
30, 2017. The increase was mainly due to the $96.7 million decrease of the net pension
liability and the $101.9 million gain from bifurcation from both the Water and Sewage
disposal funds.

The graph below details the primary govemment?s ?nancial results for ?scal years 2018,
2017 and 2013.

As the previous graph indicates, the primary govemment?s unrestricted net position
deficit was $958.9 million, which means there was a shortage of assets available to meet
all the City?s obligations if they were immediately due and payable on June 30, 2018.
This was mainly due to the City?s huge legacy pension and debt obligations which are
detailed below for ?scal years 2018, 2017, and 2013.

0 The City?s net pension liability of $1.56 billion and $1.4 billion of LTGO (Limited Tax
General Obligation) debt4 are 32% and 29%, respectively, of the primary govemment?s
total liabilities of $4.9 billion on June 30, 2018. These large pension and debt obligations
threaten the ?nancial health of the City moving forward. While the bankruptcy reduced
or eliminated pension, retiree health care (OPEB), and POC (Pension Obligation
Certi?cate) long-term debt, the City still has substantial obligations for the legacy
pension and LTGO debt. The LTGO debt will mostly be paid from the revenues of the
General Fund which will leave less funding available for City services.

I A?er June 30, 2023, the City will have signi?cant annual obligations to ?nd pensions,
especially if the Net Pension Liability is not signi?cantly reduced by then. Beginning in
2024, the Plan of Adjustment assumed that the UAAL would be ?Jnded over 30 years and
projected an annual General Fund contribution of $111 million beginning in ?scal year
2024. Based on the latest actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2016, the anticipated General
Fund contributions starting in FY 2024 are projected to be $150 millions. Fortunately,
the OCFO has taken action to mitigate the pension required contributions in 2024 by
setting aside $103.3 million from Gneral Fund surpluses in the Retirement Protection
Trust Fund as of1une 30, 2018.

- Of the primary govemment?s $1.56 billion net pension liability at June 30, 2018, $757.5
million was attributable to the General Retirement System (GRS), and $803.4 million
was attributable to the Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS). The primary
government?s $96.7 million decrease in net pension liability from June 30, 2017 was due

to improved investment returns on assets of both the GRS and PF RS pension plans in FY
20176.

I 0f the GRS primary government net pension liability of $757.6 million, $748.6 million
was attributable to the GRS legacy Component ll pension plan, and $9 million to the
Component I new pension plan per the bankruptcy. Of the PFRS net pension liability of
$803.4 million, $828.2 million was attributable to the PFRS legacy Component ll
pension plan, and $24.8 million (net pension asset) to the Component I new pension plan
per the bankruptcy. The GRS legacy Component [1 pension plan was 67.57% funded as
ofJunc 30, 20177. The PFRS legacy Component II pension plan was 77.92% funded as of
June 30, 20173.

0 The General Retirement System (GRS) Legacy Pension Fund (Component II) had total
expenditures of $258.3 million for the year ended June 30, 20189. The total Net Position
of the fund was $1.953 billion at June 30, 2018, a $25.4 million decrease from the prior
year'?. The GRS Legacy Pension Fund has a high payout ratio compared to its net
position, meaning if GRS pension expenditures continue at this rate, total GRS pension
net position would be depleted in approximately seven years and six months. The Net
Pension Liability to the GRS Legacy Pension Fund was $944.1 million as of June 30,
2017.1 I The City?s pension obligations are a burden that have to be closely monitored.

0 The Police and Fire Retirement (PFRS) Legacy Pension Fund had total expenditures of
$313.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2018?. The total Net Position ofthe fund was
$2.871 billion at June 30, 2018, a $55.5 million decrease from the prior year?. The PFRS
Legacy Pension Fund has a lower payout ratio meaning the total PFRS pension net
position would be depleted in approximately nine years and two months at this rate of
PFRS pension expenditures) than the GRS Legacy Pension Fund but it is still of concern.
The City?s Net Pension Liability to the PF RS Legacy Pension Fund was $828.2 million
as ofJune 30, 20] 

The OCFO has taken commendable steps to reduce the LTGO debt and gross debt service
for ?scal years 2025-2030 by redeeming certain bond obligatibns. In FY 2018, the
OCFO redeemed $52.3 million of the 2014 bonds with surplus funds, which saved the

City $11.7 million in interest expenses?. In addition, on December 13, 2018, the City
issued approximately $176 million of Distributable State Aid Fifth Lien Financial
Recovery Refunding LTGO Series 2018 Bonds for the purpose of purchasing and
canceling approximately $198 million of Financial Recovery LTGO Series 2014 Bonds.[6

I The OCFO estimates the debt service for FY 2025-2030 will be reduced by $155 million
because of these redemptions. Debt service beginning in ?scal year 2025 would have
increased by approximately $31 million per year through ?scal year 2030 in absence of
these transactions. In addition, to the reduced debt service, the City will also save
approximately $21.7 million ($11.7 million interest savings on 2014 Bonds and $10
million on 2014 3(1) and 2014 Bonds) as a result ofthese transactions.?

- The primary government (citywide) realized $1.98 billion (includes the $101.9 million
special item-gain) in total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $67
million from the prior ?scal year. The primary government realized $1.89 billion in total
expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018, a decrease of $230 million from the prior
?scal year.

DWSD and GLWA, as certain estimates from prior years were adjusted as a result of the
?nal agreement. As a result of bifurcation negotiations and the 2018 MOU, DWSD has

due to the DWSD bifurcation special item gain of $101.9 million. The enterprise fund

million increase from the $696.2 million in FY 2017.

In FY 2018 Water and the Sewage Disposal Funds had unrestricted net positions of
$446.5 million and $555.8 million, respectively, mainly due to the bifurcation which
exchanged the water and sewer regional systems assets and liabilities including long term
debt to GLWA for $50.0 million in annual lease payments over 40 years effective
January 1, 2016. The unrestricted net positions increased $114.3 million ($44.6 million
Water and $69.7 million Sewage) in FY 2018 from the prior year mainly due to the
DWSD bifurcation special item gain of$101.9 million.

While the Water and Sewage Disposal Funds have large unrestricted net positions at June
30, 2018, both funds have large capital and infrastructure repair and replacement needs
and debt obligations to GLWA that will require a large share of that unrestricted net
position. A benefit of the net unrestricted net position is that water and sewer rate
increases to Detroit customers will be mitigated, as the unrestricted net position through
the annual $50 million lease payment from GLWA, will provide a signi?cant amount of
the ?nding for both Funds? capital, infrastructure, and debt obligation needs.20

In FY 2018, both the Water and the Sewage Disposal Funds had positive income before
capital contributions, transfers, and special item of $10.5 million and $13.5 million
respectively.

The lease receivable from GLWA on Statement of Net Position does not agree
with the lease payable on Statement of Net Position for FY 2018. GLWA
shows the lease to be $59.4 million less than DWSD for the Water Fund and $85.5
million less for the sewage Disposal Fund. Detailed below is the difference. In the
questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain why the GLWA and DWSD
amounts for the lease receivable from GLWA does not agree on .1 une 30, 2018.

it is important to note that as of June 30, 2018, the Sewage Disposal Fund shows a
balance of $53.6 million in a liability account entitled ?Due to Great Lakes Water
Authority?.?' This appears to be attributable to a negative balance caused by a budget
shortfall of $47.8 million for the DWSD sewer fund which exceeds the two percent
threshold actual receipts falling short of budget for either the water fund or sewer
hand by greater than two percent) per the 2018 MOU. The budget shortfall not cured by
the end of the ?scal year following the year in which they arise shall be repaid in in
installments over a period not to exceed three ?scal years. The installment payments will
include a surcharge based on the three-year U.S. treasury note plus 150 basis points.22 In
the questions section of this report we ask the OCFO to provide supporting detail of the
$53.6 million that is due and how does the DWSD plan to cure this shortfall.

The City needs to closely observe the ?nancial performance of the Water and
Sewage Disposal Funds after the bifurcation to ensure revenues cover expenses and
essential services are provided.

The Transportation Fund had an unrestricted net position de?cit at June 30, 2018 of
$223.7 million, a $13.4 million increase ?'om the $210.3 million de?cit on June 30, 2017,
mainly due to a $10.2 million increase in net pension liability. The General Fund
contributed $55.2 million in subsidies to the Transportation Fund in FY 2018, which is
$6.4 million less than the General Fund contribution of $61 .6 million made in FY 2017.

The Public Lighting Authority of Detroit (the had a $34.9 million net position at
June 30, 2018, a $2.7 million increase from the $32.2 million at June 30, 2017. In
addition, the City provided a subsidy of $10.3 million to the PLA. The FLA had an
unrestricted net position of $21 .8 million in the FY 2018 CAFR, which is mainly due to
the $18.3 million excess utility user tax revenues collected that will be used to pay its
future debt obligations (the PLA collects $12.5 million in utility users? tax annually from
the General Fund to meet annual debt service requirements).23

Other Enterprise Funds include the Airport Fund and Parking Fund. The Parking Fund
net position on June 30, 2018 was $32.4 million, a decrease of $42.5 million from the
$74.9 million net position on June 30, 2017. The Parking Fund sold the Premier garage
in FY 2018 and recorded a $21.1 million loss on the sale of assets, which was the main
reason for the decline in net position in FY 2018. 24 The Airport Fund had a $3.8 million
unrestricted de?cit net position on June 30, 2018, an increase of $7 million ?'om the $3.1
million unrestricted de?cit net position at June 30, 2017. The General Fund subsidy to
the Airport decreased $2.1 million to $9 million for FY 2018 from the $3.0 million in FY
2017.

City of Detroit?s Financial Condition has improved since its Emergence from Bankruptcy
on December 10, 2014
Since bankruptcy, the City?s ?scal position has stabilized and strengthened?:

The City now has achieved a baimzced budget for the fourth consecutive year. While the
Finance Review Commission (PRC) has no active role any longer it will continue to exist
for a 10-year term. The City is still required to submit ?nancial reports, adopted
budget and 4-year ?nancial plan to the PRC each year. So long as the City continues to
balance its budgets and meet other basic ?scal requirements, the FRC will stay inactive
for the rest of its existence.?

Note, however, that even though the City has achieved a balanced budget for four years
in a row, the level of the annual surplus is diminishing:
General Fund surplus for FY 2015 $384.3 million27

{Economic condition perspectiv?

lnevitably, a government?s ?nancial position will be effected by its circumstances the
vitality and diversi?cation of the local economy, the breadth and depth of the government?s tax
base). Economic condition focuses on the likelihood that today?s ?nancial position will improve
or deteriorate in the future. Much of the information needed for assessing economic condition
involves either non?nancial data population and unemployment) or ?nancial data presented
for multiple years 10-year trends). Such data typically are located either in the introductory
section transmittal letter of the CAFR, in the statistical section28 of the CAF and/or as part of
the required supplementary information (R8019.

The following major observations regarding the economic condition perspectives of the City and
other initiatives are from review of the introductory sectionmin the 2018 CAFR:

- The City?s current economic condition is improving. The future outlook for recovery and
improvement is positive. Businesses are transferring employees from suburban cities to the
City of Detroit. New residents are moving into the City. However, much of the improvement
in economic development is located in concentrated areas of the City mid-town,
downtown and certain neighborhoods of the City).

0 The City has committed to a multi-year effort to improve City services that impact its citizens'
quality of life and that enhance sustainability. Services across all neighborhoods have
drastically improved. Activities and accomplishments include? a) 50,000 prevented

foreclosures of occupied homes under programs to assist families in need; b) 65,000 new
LED streetlights; c) 8,000 summer jobs for Detroit youth; d) 275 parks being ?illy
maintained, up from only 25 in 2013, 40 of which are completely remade; e) 120 new DDOT
buses added to the ?eet, nine new 24-hour routes, and six brand new bus lines; f) IS minute
police priority 1 response time, down nearly 30 minutes on average; and g) Eight minute
emergency medical service response time, down from nearly 20 minutes on average.

- Blight remediation remains one of the City's highest reinvestment priorities and is progressing at
a strong pace. The City is leveraging substantial Federal grants, including $258.8 million in
Hardest Hit Funds, alongside City funds to demolish dangerous structures and return the
parcels to productive uses. Activities and accomplishments include: a) 15,000 dangerous
vacant houses demolished; b) 10,000 blighted abandoned homes boarded up; and c) 3,000
vacant homes being rehabbed and reoccupied under land bank programs.

I The City is strategically using the alignment of City assets to grow and diversify Detroit?s
economy. The City and its economic development arm, the Detroit Economic Growth
Corporation, are working to secure 10,000 jobs and $3.4 billion of investment and open 140
small businesses citywide by 2020.

- Detroit?s strength as a business location is evident through its successes. Since 2012, Detroit
has seen almost $1 billion invested in automotive manufacturing at new and existing
suppliers and $96 million invested in over 14 full-service grocery stores. Downtown
Detroit?s vacancy rate has fallen 12 percent in the past ?ve years to 17.5 percent.

City of Detroit?s Risk Factors and Potential Opportunities

Although the City of Detroit has increased its ?nancial position in recent years, and it is likely
that the City?s economic condition will improve, the following represent economic and ?scal
risks that should be considered?:

0 Loss of federal funds due to changes in federal ?scal policy.

0 Increased uncertainty in federal government monetary and trade policy.

II Reduction of Statutory State Revenue Sharing dollars due to challenges in the State?s
budget from declining ?nances and other critical issues.

- Lower census numbers result in loss of federal/state ?inds tied to population.

0 Potential recession in the near future.

The following represent potential opportunities for the City of Detroit to further improve
revenues:

0 Potential for increased economic development to increase the City?s tax base and
generate additional revenues for the City.

I Sales tax on internet purchases may increase state local share distributions to
city villages townships.

Other Maior IssuesJObservations from the Review of the 2018 CAFR

I The Solid Waste Fund had a $61.4 million Fund Balance on June 30, 2018 compared to a
$52.2 million find balance on June 30, 2017. Other Special Revenue Funds had large
Fund Balances at June 30, 2018. These include: (1) Construction Code Fund (BSEED) -
$19.6 million; (2) Drug Law Enforcement Fund - $9.0 million; (3) Street Fund - $71.3
million; and (4) Telecommunications Fund - $5.4 million. It appears the City has not
properly allocated pension and legacy costs and other reimbursable costs (such as central
staff services costs) to these funds which have the means to pay for them and relieve the
General Fund of these costs. In the questions section we ask the OCFO what
methodology will be explored to ensure these Special Revenue Funds are reimbursing the
General Fund for reimbursable costs.

I The Plan of Adjustment (POA) requires the BSEED to annually repay the General Fund a
series of payments through FY 2023 totaling $17.7 million for the loans made to the
BSEED when it ran de?cits prior to the bankruptcy?. Even though the Construction
Code Fund has a $19.6 million ?md balance nothing has been repaid to the General Fund
and the FY 2019 Budget and Four Year Financial Plan does not include any provision for
repayment. In the questions section we ask the OCFO why BSEED is not repaying the
General Fund per the POA.

- As of June 30, 2018, the City lacked proper controls to ensure compliance with laws and
regulations, which included: I) the City failed to escheat balances to the State of
Michigan; 2) the City was not in compliance with the State?s Public Act 2 of 1968,
Uniform Budgeting and Accounting Act, because in some accounts actual expenditures
exceeded appropriations approved by Council, and 3) in certain instances, the City?s
general ledger records were not always accurate, which violated certain federal
regulations.

- Several funds had a large unassigned fund balance de?cit or unrestricted net position
de?cit on June 30, 2018, including: the General Grants Fund (Special Revenue Fund)?a
$10.4 million de?cit; the Detroit Public Library (Component Unit)?a $3.5 million de?cit;
the Local Development Finance Authority (Component Unit)-a $21.6 million de?cit; the
Transportation Fund (DDOT) (Enterprise Fund)-a $223.7 million de?cit; and the Airport
Fund (Enterprise Fund)-a $3.8 million de?cit . However, the City is not required to ?le a
de?cit elimination plan with the State for any of these funds or component units because
they had a positive working capital (current assets resources exceed current liabilities) as
oflune 30, 2018.

0 Of concern is the $10.4 million de?cit in the General Grants Fund and the impact to
the General Fund. In the questions section we ask the OCFO what is causing the
deficit and how much will the General Fund have to pay to liquidate the de?cit.
Also, we ask if there is an accounting issue where expenses are not being charged to
the proper fund.

0f concern is the $21.2 million of long-term advances the City had made to: 
Sewage DiSposal Fund $4.9 million: (2) Transportation Fund $4.8 million; (3) Water
Fund $2.9 million; (4) Nonmajor enterprise funds $450,000; and (5) Component
Units $8.1 million??5 In the questions section we ask the OCFO to explain in detail
what the long-term advances are and what they are for and why they did not come
before City Council. LPD assumes some of these advances are related to those
funds that are obligated to pay the General Fund for the 2014 bonds that were
redeemed by the general fund in FY 2018.

In FY 2018, two new Special Revenue Funds were added to the CAFR: the Bridging
Neighborhoods Fund, which had an $18.4 million ?Jnd balance on June 30, 2018; and the
Noncompliance Fees Fund, which had a $420,000 ?md balance on June 30, 2018. In the
questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain the purposes of these new funds.

CDBG Revenue. Of concem was that CDBG (Community Development Block Grant)
Fund federal grant revenue dr0pped by $14.2 million in FY 2018 from FY 2017. In the
questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain the reason for the large reduction in
FY 20! 8.

The Introduction to the Reportnsection of the 2018 CAFR was excellent and highlighted
the accomplishments of the City, which showed what a good stewardship of resources by
the City's leaders. management and employees.

The Managements, Discussion and Analysis in the 2018 CAP was not
suf?ciently detailed to explain major variances and other relevant ?nancial information.
As a result, we have many unanswered questions concerning major changes to the City?s
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018. In the
questions section of our report we are asking the OCFO to explain the signi?cant changes
in FY 2018 so we can gain better knowledge of the City?s ?nancial condition on June 30,
2018.

The Administration should be commended for the thoroughness of the 2018 CAFR. It
behooves the Budget, Finance and Audit Committee to continue to do its due diligence to
understand and examine the 2018 CAFR.

Introduction

The Budget, Finance and Audit standing committee is in the process of reviewing and analyzing
the 2018 CAFR. The Legislative Police Division (LPD) provides this report to facilitate the
committee?s review of the 2018 CAFR.

The 2018 CAFR was issued on December 14, 2018 before the deadline of December 31, 2018.
LPD acknowledge and commend the efforts of the OCFO (Of?ce of the Chief Financial Of?cer)
staff to complete the 2018 CAFR before the deadline for the ?rst time since the FY 2012 CAP R.

Independent Auditor's Report on the Ci??s 2018 CAFR
The City?s independent auditor, Plante Moran PLLC gave the City?s 2018 audited ?nancial

statements and related notes to the ?nancial statements included in the 2018 CAFR an
unquali?ed (?clean?) opinion.

A ?clean" opinion means that the audited ?nancial statements are free of material misstatements
and present fairly the ?nancial position of the City as of June 30, 2018 in accordance with US.
generally accepted accounting principles. As a result, investors, creditors, rating agencies and
other interested parties reading the City?s 2018 CAF can rely on the audited ?nancial
statements and the information contained therein. The clean Opinion, however, does not mean
that Plante Moran is signifying that the City has a ?nancial clean bill of health.

In conjunction with its opinion on the 2018 CAFR, Plante Moran did have an ?Emphasis of
Matter" paragraph, however. The American institute of Certi?ed Public Accountants 
de?ne an ?Emphasis of Matter" paragraph as: paragraph included in the auditor's report that
is required by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), or is included at the auditor's
discretion, and that refers to a matter appropriately presented or disclosed in the ?nancial
statements that, in the auditor's professional judgment, is of such importance that it is
fundamental to users' understanding of the ?nancial statements." Plante Moran had the
following ?Emphasis of Matter" paragraph included in its opinion?.

1. Water and Sewaec Disposal Fund Special Item iBi?Jrcation GainL AS described in Note
12 to the ?nancial statements, effective January 1, 2016, the City of Detroit, Michigan
entered into lease agreements (Leases) and related service agreements with the Great
Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) under which GLWA will operate the regional water and
sewage system for the term of 40 years. The ?nal negotiations of the transaction during
the year has resulted in the recognition of a special item (bifurcation gain) in the
statement of revenue, expenses, and changes in net position. Our opinion is not modi?ed
with reSpect to this matter.39

2. ?Focus and Questions Considered while Reviewing the City?s 2018 CAF 
The table below represents focus while reviewing the City?s 2018 CAFR.

Focus

Maiar Issues from the City?s General Fund Financial Statements il_1 the 2013 CAFR (Near-
term Eerspective)

The governmental fund ?nancial statements (general fund, special revenue fund, debt service
had, capital projects fund, and permanent fund) are used to assess a local government?s near-
tenn ?nancing situation since their measurement focus is primarily near-tenn. The
governmental ?md ?nancial statements shows for the ?scal year the revenues collected and the
services they were spent on such as public protection, recreation, debt and capital. It answers the
question ?What did you do with the money we gave you?"

The chief governmental fund is the general fund. The general fund ?nancial statement is based
on modi?ed accrual accounting, which means that the general fund also represents the City?s
check book of receipts and disbursements for the day to day operations to provide the City?s
most basic services (police, ?re, administration, recreation, etc.) over a one-year period. As a
result, the state of the general ?Jnd requires a near-term focus to ensure the bills are being paid
on time.

General Fund Bankruptcy lmpact as of June 30, 2018. As can be seen in Attachments I and
11, the City eliminated its General Fund de?cit and has greatly improved since FY 2013 due to
the bankruptcy settlements. The General Fund is now able to pay its bills on time. its ?nancial
health is improving. The future outlook for the City?s ?nancial health is relatively good as of
June 30, 2018. However, there are still many issues such as the legacy pension and debt
obligations, education system, poverty levels, low property assessed values and low tax base that
could impair the City?s ?nancial recovery if not satisfactorily addressed.

The General Fund?s ?lnd balance went from a de?cit of $73.0 million in FY 2013 to a surplus of
1.2 million in FY 2018, an increase of $684.2 million due to the bankruptcy settlements and
issuance of new debt for restructuring and Quality of Life projects.

The $18.4 million increase in the fund balance in FY 2018 was mainly due to the impact of the
bankruptcy which resulted in the reduction of pension and retiree health care expenses. In FY
2018 the City?s General Fund spent more on retirement of debt service (2014 Bonds), blight,
and capital projects which lowered the unassigned General Fund surplus. The non-spendable,
restricted, and assigned fund balances increased $55.9 million in FY 2018 mainly due to City?s
increased contribution of $50.0 million for blight and capital funds.

The Risk Management Fund had a $73.4 million fund balance in FY 2017 and the City normally
would have committed fund balance for the full amount of $73.4 million. The OCFO
determined that $66.3 million of the fund balance should be committed and assigned. The fund
balance committed for the Risk Management operations was lowered to $20.0 million in FY
2016 in accordance with the City ordinance that requires a minimum $20.0 million fund balance
for that fund. An additional ?md balance assigned for Risk Management operations of $46.8
million was established in FY 2018 to provide for projected ?Jture payments from the fund. The
remaining $6.6 million of the Risk Management Fund balance was classi?ed as unassigned and
is included in the $131.5 million General Fund unassigned surplus.

The fund balance assigned for Subsequent Appropriations was $58.6 million and will ?nd
additional approved appropriations in FY 2019. The fund balance assigned for blight and capital
was $100.0 million and will fund demolitions and capital assets. The fund balance assigned for
pension contributions was $103.3 million and will be set aside in the Retiree Protection Trust
Fund to help stabilize City pension contributions beginning in FY 2024 when per the FDA the
City must begin to ?nd the legacy pension systems (Component II).

General Fund Surplus. The General Fund had an accumulated unassigned fund balance
(surplus) of $131.5 million at June 30, 2018 a $37.5 million decrease from the $169.0 million
accumulated surplus at June 30, 2017 and $264.1 million increase from the $132.6 million
accumulated de?cit on June 30, 2013. The change in the General Fund accumulated unassigned
surplus from June 30, 2017 was primarily due to the: (1) $18.4 million General Fund operating
surplus, or net change in fund balance (revenues less expenditures and other ?nancing sources
and uses)?; and (2) less the $55.9 million increase in assigned, restricted and committed fund
balances, including the increase of $50.0 million assigned for blight and capital.42

General Fund Solvency. The General Fund?s liquidity and solvency was much improved at
June 30, 2018. The General Fund assets and deferred out?ows of resources exceeded its
liabilities and deferred in?ows of resources by $61 1.2 million, and cash and investments totaled
$643.4 million.? In FY 2013 the City?s liabilities exceeded its assets by $73.0 million and it
only had $102.2 million in cash and investments. The main reason for the General Fund?s
improved liquidity and solvency was the elimination of certain obligations from the bankruptcy.
While the bankruptcy substantially reduced the City's obligations, especially legacy pension and
retiree health costs, challenges and risks remain to secure the liquidity to ?nd the resources
necessary to provide satisfactory City services such as public protection and transportation. The
City?s liquidity risk will continue until the changes adopted under the Plan of Adjustment are

An additional cautionary note regarding General Fund liquidity is warranted. Although $643.4
million in General Fund cash and investments as of June 30, 2018 is sizable, the lion share of it
is either obligated (there is $85 million due to other funds as of June 30, 2018), restricted (for
instance there is $38.3 million in unspent exit ?nancing bond proceeds as of June 30, 2018 that
at some point will be spent) or assigned (for instance $62.3 million represents the budget reserve
and another $103.3 million represents the pension payment going to the Retiree Protection Trust
Fund as of June 30, 2018) to a speci?c purpose. As a result, available cash for discretionary
spending is minimal?.

General Fund Cash. In FY 2016 the OCFO classi?ed restricted cash for the ?rst time for cash
that was restricted such as for debt service, grants, and escrow requirements.45 A total of $171.0
million of restricted cash was included on the General Fund?s balance sheet on June 30, 2018
compared to $130.5 million on June 30, 2017. The General Fund had $643.4 million of cash on
June 30, 2018 which included $171.0 million of restricted cash compared to $647.6 million of
cash on une 30, 2017 including the $130.5 million of restricted cash. In the questions section
we ask the OCFO to explain why the restricted cash increased $40.5 million in FY 2018.

General Fund Property Taxes Receivable. The General Fund pr0perty taxes receivables were
$19.2 million on June 30, 2018, a decrease of $61.1 million from the $80.3 million on June 30,
2017. In the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain why these accounts declined
so much.

General Fund Income Tax Assessments Receivable. Income tax assessments receivables on
June 30, 2018 were $33.2 million less than on June 30, 2017. In the questions section we are
asking the OCFO to explain why this account balance declined so much.

 

4? Since June 30, 2018, the General Fund unassigned fund balance of $13 I .5 million has been signi?cantly reduced
Council approved the FY 2019-20 budget which uses $1 17.6 million of the $131.5 million in General Fund
unassigned fund balance: $73 million for blight remediation; $32.5 million for capital projects; and $12.1 million for
risk management.

General Fund Allowance for Uncollectablc Accounts. The allowance for uncollectable
accounts on June 30, 2018 were $236.4 million, a decrease of $40.6 million from the $277.0
million on June 30, 2017. in the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain why this
account balance declined so much.

General Fund Advances to Other Funds. Advances to other funds were $13.0 million on June
30, 2018, an increase of $13.0 million from the zero balance on June 30, 2017. In the questions
section we ask the OCFO to explain what these advances are and what is the plan to pay them
back to the General Fund. We also ask why these advances were made without City Council
approval.

General Fund Advances to Component Units. Advances to component units totaled $8.1
million on June 30, 2018. In the questions section we ask the OCFO to explain what these
advances are and what is the plan for repayment to the General Fund. We also ask why these
advances were made without City Council approval.

General Fund Due from Component Units. The Detroit Public Library owed the General
Fund $3.2 million on June 30, 2018. [n the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain
in detail what is owed and if the General Fund is subsidizing the Library. We also ask why this
loan was made without City Council approval.

General Fund Due to Other Funds. The due to other funds was $67.6 million on June 30,
2018, a $28.7 million decrease from the $96.3 million on June 30, 2017. 46 In the questions
section we are asking the OCFO to explain why the Due to Other Funds was so much less in FY
2018. Also, we are asking the OCFO to explain the $24.8 million owed to DDOT on June 30,
2018.

General Fund Chargebacks. For accounting purposes, the transfer of delinquent property taxes
receivable to Wayne County is recognized as a sale, with a corresponding liability recorded for
the estimated amount that will be charged back to the City. The amount owed to Wayne County
for chargebacks is included in the line item due to other governmental agencies on the General
Fund Balance Sheet. During the year ended June 30, 2018, the General Fund transferred (sold)
to the County $30.3 million of delinquent property taxes receivable, and $12.4 million were
charged back to the General Fund from prior year sales. As of June 30, 2018, the General Fund
has recorded a liability of $3.1 million million estimated chargeback less $6.0 million
auction receipts) for the estimated amount of property tax receivables sold to the County that will
be charged back in future years.? The General Fund?s liability for chargebacks due Wayne
County on June 30, 2017 was $8.3 million. As the City?s property tax collection rate and auction
receipts improve, the chargeback liability decreases.

General Fund Deferred In?ows of Resources. The deferred in?ows of resources was $211.1
million on June 30, 2018, a decrease of $49.7 million from the $260.8 million on June 30,
2017.?8 The $179.4 million ?iture amount due from the BIA and Foundations per the ?Grand
Bargain" in the Plan of Adjustment cannot be recognized as revenue in the General Fund
because they have not been received within 60 days of the end of the City?s ?scal year per the

City?s modi?ed accrual basis of accounting.? Per the ?Grand Bargain? annual amounts will be
received by the General Fund through June 30, 2023. While they are accounts receivable, they
are considered deferred in?ows of resources and not recognized as revenue until actually
received. The main reason for the decline in deferred in?ows of resources was that unearned
revenue declined $42.7 million. In the questions section we ask the OCFO to explain why the
unearned revenue decreased $42.7 million in FY 2018.

General Fund Property Tax Revenue. Property tax revenue was $119.1 million in FY 2018, a
$10.4 million decrease from the FY 2017 amount of $129 5 millions0 The decrease was mainly

General Fund Principal Expense. Principal Expense was $62.3 million in FY 2018, an
increase of $45.7 million from the $16.6 million in FY 2017 The main reason for the increase
was the $52.3 million redemption of the 2014 bonds in FY 2018, which saved the City $11.7
million in interest expenses?.

General Fund Interest Expense. Interest expense was $45.9 million in FY 2018, a $22.3
million decrease from the $68.1 million in FY 2017. Per the responses to our questions
last year the FY 2017 interest expense was higher is due to a one-time $19 million dollar
deferred charge on the re?lnding that took place in August 2016, offset by actual interest
savmgs.

General Fund Capital Outlay. Capital outlay was $49.3 million in FY 2018, a $26.9 million

outlays made.

General Fund Transfers In. General Fund Transfers In were $26.3 million in FY 2018
compared to zero in FY 2017. Transfers In from Nonmajor governmental funds were $926,936
and Transfers In from Nonmajor enterprise funds were $25.3 million. The $25.3 million
Transfers [n were from the Parking Fund and were related to the 2014 Bonds, which were
liquidated in FY 2018?.

General Fund Proceeds. Proceeds from Bonds and Notes Issued in FY 2017 were much higher
than in FY 2018 (no bonds and notes were issued during FY 2018) because of the re?inding of
the $345.5 million Limited Tax General Obligation (LTGO) First and Third Lien DSA Bonds
(2012C Self Insurance Bonds - 116.0 million and 2010 DSA Bonds - $229.5 million) that
occurred in FY 2017 from proceeds of $364.1 million (2016C (1) - $240,965,000 and 2016C (2)
- $123,175,000 LTGO refunding bonds).54

Financial Review Commission?

Michigan Public Act 181 of 2014, M.C.L. 141.1631, et seq. (Act 181) established the Detroit
Financial Review Commission (the ?Commission?) as of the Effective Date (December 10,
2014) to monitor the City?s compliance with the Plan of Adjustment and Public Act 181 and to
provide oversight of the City?s ?nancial activities. The Commission has broad authority to obtain
and review the City?s ?nancial records on an ongoing basis, approve budgets and contracts, and
conduct ?nancial audits of the City. Michigan Public Act 182 of 2014, M.C.L. 117.4s-t, imposes
further requirements, including that the City adopt a multi-year ?nancial plan and appoint a chief
?nancial of?cer (CFO).

On April 30, 2018, the City of Detroit exited active state ?nancial oversight, achieving ?ill self-
govemance for the ?rst time in four decades. The FRC voted unanimously to end active
oversight after the City delivered its third consecutive audited balanced budget?.

The FRC will continue to exist for a 10-year term, although it will play no active role in the City
of Detroit Operations. The City will be required to submit ?nancial reports and will also
submit its adopted budget and 4-year ?nancial plan each year. So long as the City continues to
balance its budgets and meet other basic ?nancial ?scal requirements, the PRC will stay inactive
for the rest of its existence.

The nature of the oversight is scaled back. The Commission must waive many of the
requirements such as budget and contract approval on an annual basis. The Commission may
rescind the waiver if it determines that there is a substantial likelihood that certain criteria will
occur, including the City failing to pay debt when due, the City incurring a budget de?cit in any
year in excess of 5 percent of expenditures in that year, or the City failing to comply with the
revised municipal ?nance act or to obtain the prior approval of the Commission to issue debt. If
the Commission waives the requirements for 10 consecutive years, the Commission is
dissolved?.

Major Issues from the Citv?s Government-Wide Financial Statements in the 2018 CAFR
(Long-term perspective)

The govemment-wide ?nancial statements are used to best assess local government?s ?nancial
condition since their measurement focus is primarily long term. They include the Primary
Government, Governmental and Business (Enterprise Funds) - Type Activities and Component
Units of the City.

The govemment-wide ?nancial statements are designed to provide a broad overview of the
City?s ?nances and operations, in a manner similar to a private sector business. They show how
current services are funded and the full cost of the services provided. They answer the question
?Did this year?s taxpayer pay the full cost of the services delivered this year?? The ?nancial
statements include the Statement of Net Position balance sheet), and the Statement of
Activities income statement). These statements are prepared using the economic resources
measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting.

?3 Page 118 ofthe 2017 CAFR (Note 13)

25

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities are two ?nancial statements that
report information about the City as a whole, and about its activities that should help answer this
question: How has the City?s ?nancial position, as a whole, changed as a result of this year?s
activities? These statements include all non-?duciary assets and liabilities. The Statement of Net
Position presents all of the City?s assets and liabilities, with the difference between the two
reported as net position. Over time, increases and decreases in net position measure whether the
City?s ?nancial position is improving or eroding.

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the City?s net position changed
during the most recent ?scal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the
underlying events giving rise to the change occur, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.
Therefore, revenues and expenses are reported in these statements for some items that will only
result in cash flows in future ?scal periods uncollected taxes and, earned but unused
vacation leave).

Attachments 111 and IV are respectively, the Primary Govemment?s FY 2018 Statement of Net
Position and Statement of Activities (Changes in Net Position) compared to FY 2017 and FY
2013. These statements show the City?s Primary Govemment?s ?nancial condition: (I) pre-
bankruptcy (FY 2013); and (2) post-bankruptcy (FY 2017 and FY 2018). The following analysis
of Attachments 111 and 1V provides details on the major issues and variances for the Primary
Government?s Government-Wide ?nancial statements in the FY 2018 CAP when compared to
FY 2017 and FY 2013.

Primary Government?s Statement of Net Position. At June 30, 2018, the City?s primary
government had a Net Position of $898.0 million, an $85.9 million increase from the $812.1
million Net Position on June 30, 2017. 59 The increase was mainly due to the $96.7 million
decrease of the net pension liability and the $101.9 million gain ?'om bifurcation from both the
Water and Sewage disposal funds.

The decreases in assets and liabilities from June 30, 2013 are mainly due to the bifurcation and
transfer of the regional water and sewer systems? assets and liabilities to GLWA, which included
$5.1 billion of revenue bonds?).

Bankruptcy Impact as of June 30, 2018. As can be seen in Attachments and IV, the
bankruptcy enabled the City to reduce its legacy pension and OPEB (retiree bene?ts) and debt
costs. The net pension liability was $2.918 billion in FY 2015 and was actually based on the
amount due as of June 30, 2014, which was prior to the bankruptcy exit on December 10, 2014.
The net pension liability post-bankruptcy on June 30, 2017 was $1.560 billion or $1.358 billion
less due to the changes agreed to in the bankruptcy.

The City, since the bankruptcy, still has a large net pension liability and other large debt
obligations which will be a challenge to the future ?scal health of the City. Furthermore, there
are many other social and economic issues such as the education system, poverty levels, low
property assessed values and low tax base that could impair the City?s ?nancial recovery if not
satisfactorily addressed.

The large net pension liability and LTGO (Limited Tax General Obligation) debt is of concern.
While the bankruptcy reduced or eliminated pension, retiree health care (OPEB), and POC
(Pension Obligation Certi?cate) long-term debt, the City still has substantial obligations for the
legacy pension and LTGO debt. The LTGO debt increased due to the exit ?nancing and other
debt issued per the City?s Plan of Adjustment. This debt will mostly be paid from the revenues
of the General Fund which will leave less funding available for City services. The LTGO debt
was reduced in 2018 due to the redemption of $52.3 million in principal due on the 2014 
bonds, which saved the City $11.7 million in interest expenses?. The chart below shows that the
net pension liability and LTGO debt are 32% and 29% of the primary govemment?s total
liabilities of $4.9 billion on June 30, 2018. A ?nancially healthy government would have no or
very small percentages of total liabilities for such legacy costs.

Primary Government?s Unrestricted Net Position. The primary govemment?s unrestricted net
position was a de?cit of $958.9 million as ofJune 30, 2018, a $225.8 million decrease from the
$1.185 billion de?cit at June 30, 2017 and $1.396 billion decrease from the $2.4 billion de?cit
on June 30, 2013.62 A de?cit in unrestricted net position means there was a shortage of assets
available to meet all the City?s obligations if they were immediately due and payable on June 30,
2018. The City?s legacy debt and pension liabilities are major contributors to the de?cit.

Retiree Protection Fund. Under the City's bankruptcy plan of adjustment, the City's required
pension contributions to its legacy plans are based on a ?xed schedule through FY 2023.
Beginning in FY 2024, the City's required pension contributions to its legacy plans will be based
on a funding policy to be established by the Retirement Systems to amortize the remaining
unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities of each legacy plan. Under these requirements, the City's
General Fund required contributions increase from zero in FY 2023 to an actuarially determined
annual amount beginning in FY 2024. To meet this challenge, the City developed and began
executing a funding strategy during 2017. Under the strategy, the City will contribute $335
million to the newly established Retiree Protection Fund (RPF) through FY 2023 to build up
trust assets that will be used to partially offset the City's required pension plan contributions that
resume in FY 2024??. This process allows the City to gradually build up its capacity to meet the
annual required pension contributions from its General Fund budget. The RPF is an irrevocable
IRC Section 115 trust established in August 2017 under new legislation adopted by the City.
Each year, the City will continue revising its funding plan as new information becomes available
in conjunction with the annual budget and planning process?. In ?scal year 2016, the City
began to set aside funds ($30 million in 2016 and $60 million in 2017) in a restricted fund for
application to a portion of its annual General Fund contribution obligation to the pension plans

beginning in ?scal year 2024 to allow the City to better manage its liability at that time.65 The
balance of the RPF on June 30, 2018 was $103.3 million.

Primary Government?s Cash and Investments. The City?s cash and investments were $1.24
billion on June 30, 2018, a $116.3 million increase from the $1.12 billion on June 30, 2017."6
The increase was mainly due to the bankruptcy impact which reduced legacy expenses, increased
cash through borrowing exit ?nancing) and improved liquidity.

Primary Government?s Advance to Component Unit. The advance due from component
units totaled $8.1 million on June 30, 2018. The advance to the Detroit Land Bank Authority
(DLBA) was $7.0 million in FY 2018.67 The ?nancial statements indicate it was an
advance (?bridge funds?) for the Hardest Hit Fund demolitions until the grant funds are received
and the City can be reimbursed from MSHDA. The City has granted the DLBA a $20.0 million
line of credit. The advance to the Detroit Public Library (DPL) totaled $1.1 million on June 30,
2018. This was for the share of the 2014 Bonds redeemed by the General Fund in
2018.

Primary Government?s Receivable from GLWA. The receivable from GLWA was $1.09
billion on June 30, 2018.68 The receivable was for the present value of the $50.0 million annual
lease payment due over the next 39 years per the City?s ?nal agreement with GLWA. The
annual lease payment ?om GLWA to the Water Fund is $22.5 million and the present value of
the receivable from GLWA on June 30, 2018 was $485.7 million. The annual lease payment
from GLWA to the Sewage Disposal Fund is $27.5 million and the present value of the
receivable from GLWA on June 30, 2013 was $606.5 million?.

Primary Government?s Capital Assets. Total primary government capital assets were $2.82
billion on June 30, 2018, a $31.4 million decrease from the $2.85 billion on June 30, 201770.

Major capital assets acquired and projects completes 0" in ProgTess during the Year ended June
30, 2018 included the following?

$39.9 million for road construction and resurfacing

$12.8 million for renovation of parks and recreation centers

$16.9 million for police and ?re department capital improvements

$35 million for police, ?re and department of public works (DPW) vehicles
$3.6 million for DPW facility improvements

Primary Government Capital Asset Impairment. During the year, the City entered into a land
swap agreement with a third party. The net book value of the land and building provided
exceeded the fair market value of the land and. or proceeds received. The land and property
provided in the land swap was vacated by all ?nd employees in 2018 and, as a result,
management determined that an impairment event had occurred. The Transportation Fund

recognized impairment expenses of $2,107,426 and presented the impairment as an operating
expense on the statement of revenue, expense and changes in net position.72

Primary Government?s Deferred Out?ows of Resources. The deferred out?ows of resources
decreased $122.3 million in FY 2018 from the prior year mainly due to the net difference
between projected and actual earnings on pension plan investments and differences between
expected and actual experience for both the GRS and PFRS pension systems?. In the questions
section we are asking the OCFO to explain why this decreased in FY 2018. Deferred out?ows of
resources, represents a consumption (expense) of net position that applies to a ?iture period(s)
and so will not be recognized as an out?ow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. The
deferred out?ows on June 30, 2018 for the two pension ?Jnds were based on a measurement date
of June 30, 2017 and the pension contributions received subsequent to the measurement date
even though received in FY 2018 will be recognized as an expense and reduction of the net
pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2019. 74

Primary Government?s Accounts and Contracts Payable. Accounts and contracts payable
were $125.1 million on June 30, 2018, a $29.7 million inerease from the $95.4 million balance
on June 30, 2017. In the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain the increase.

Primary Government?s Due to Other Governmental Agencies. Due to other governmental
agencies was $87.1 million on June 30, 2018, a $77.8 million decrease From the $164.8 million
on June 30, 2017. [n the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain why the due to
other govemmental agencies decreased so much in FY 2018 and whether escheatments were
made from this account.

Primary Government?s Net Pension Liability. The primary government?s net pension liability
on June 30, 2018 was $1.56 billion (GRS - $757.5 million and PFRS - $803.4 million), a $96.7
million decrease ?'om the $1.66 billion (GRS $790.9 million and PFRS $866.7 million) on
June 30, 2017. The primary government?s $1.56 billion net pension liability in the June 30, 2018
Statement of Net Position is based on the actuarial report dated June 30, 2017.75 The
Police and Fire Retirement System (PFRS) and General Retirement System (GRS) Legacy
Pension Plans (Component and the new pension plan (Component 1) are detailed in Footnote
8 ofthe FY 2018 CAFR.76 GLWA and the Library respectively have $179.0 million and $17.4

The net pension liability signi?cantly decreased from the $3.128 billion on June 30, 2013.
However, it is still substantial and will consume large amounts of General Fund revenues in the
future leaving less for City services such as public protection. The graph below shows the net

During November 2015, the actuary for each of the plans revised the calculation of the Unfunded
Actuarial Accrued Liabilities (UAAL) for the frozen plans using updated mortality tables and
other assumptions The effect of the revised calculations was to increase the UAAL for the
frozen plans by approximately $491 million. Beginning in 2024, the Plan of Adjustment assumed
that the UAAL would be funded over 30 years and projected an annual General Fund
contribution of $1 11 million beginning in ?scal year 2024. Based on the revised calculations, as

 

an The FY 2013 net pension liability of $3,128,446,017 (GRS - $2,209,515,597 and PFRS - $918,930,420) billion is
from the FY 2015 CAFR page 99 of Note VII (1). In FY 2013, GASB 68 net pension liability reporting was not
required. However, we are including it here for comparison purposes to show the reductions resulting from the Plan
of Adjustment. In FY 2014 the net pension totaled $2,918,025.938 (GRS - $1,786,441,192 and PFRS

of November 2015, the General Fund contribution was projected to be $194 million per year. In
?scal year 2016, the City began to set aside funds ($30 million in 2016 and $60 million in 2017)
in a restricted fund - Retirement Protection Fund (RPF) for application to a portion of its annual
General Fund contribution obligation to the plans beginning in ?scal year 2024 to allow the City
to better manage its liability at that time.? On June 30, 2018 the balance ofthe RPF was $103.3
million. The latest estimate of the General Fund contribution for FY 2024 is $150 million based
on the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation.82

Primary Government?s Long-Term Obligations. Total primary government long-term
obligations were $2.86 billion at June 30, 2018, a decrease of $115.4 million ?'om the $2.97
billion at June 30, 2017.34 The long~term obligations decreased mainly due to the $58.9 million
($38.7 million Water and $20.2 million Sewer) million decrease in contractual obligations to
GLWA35 and the redemption of the $52.3 million of 2014 bonds. Part of the decrease in
contractual obligations to GLWA was due to the 2018 agreement between GLWA and DWSD
on the debt allocation, resulting in reductions of $26.7 million and $9.0 million to the debt
allocated for the Water Fund and Sewage Disposal Fund, respectively. The reductions to the
debt allocation for the Water and Sewage DiSposal Funds are included in the $101.9 million
special item gain for the bifurcation.86

As mentioned previously, the decreases in long-term obligations from June 30, 2013 are mainly
due to the bifurcation and transfer of the regional water and sewer systems? assets and liabilities
to GLWA, which included $5.1 billion of revenue bonds?. Also, the reductions in retiree health
care (OPEB) and POCs resulting ??om the bankruptcy contributed to the decrease in long-term
obligations from 2013.

City debt ratings have improved because of the improved ?nancial condition of the City and the
revenues securing the payment of the debt. The City credit ratings for the uninsured general
obligation bonds are below investment grade due to weakness in Detroit?s economic base
relative to its peers. Because of the credit rating below investment grade the City will have
higher borrowing costs.90

LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS POST-BANKRUPTCY. The bankruptcy exit
provides the City relief from legacy costs mainly OPEB and pension obligations. However, LPD
provides the following observations:

0 While the City eliminated a substantial amount of its obligations with the bankruptcy
settlements, it did incur additional debt to provide for some of the settlements and
restructuring/Quality of Life projects. Much of the new debt such as the 2014 3(1) and
8(2) bonds was limited tax general obligation (LTGO) debt and will have to be paid from
the general revenues of the City. This along with other ?secured" LTGO bond debt
issued before the bankruptcy will divert the City?s General Fund?s revenues, which could
have been used for core City services such as police and ?re, to pay off the debt service.
Of the City?s primary government?s $1.68 billion of General Obligation bond debt at
June 30, 201894, a total of .41 billion? is LTGO debt which will ultimately have to be
paid from the general revenue. Furthermore, much of the debt issued for the bankruptcy
settlements was structured to defer principal payments for several years and will have a
greater adverse impact on the General Fund in the years (2025-2030} the principal

becomes due. For example, the City is not required to make a payment on the 2014 (1)
bonds principal totaling $616.6 million until June 30, 2025 when the ?rst principal
payment will be $30.8 million??.

The OCFO has taken commendable steps to reduce the LTGO debt and gross debt service
for ?scal years 2025-2030 by redeeming certain bond obligations. In FY 2018, the
OCFO redeemed $52.3 million of the 2014 bonds with surplus ?rnds. Recently (FY
2019), on December 13, 2018, the City issued its $176 million Distributable State Aid
Fi?h Lien Financial Recovery Refunding Bonds (LTGO) Series 2018 Bonds (the ?2018
DSA Bonds?) for the purpose of purchasing a portion of its Financial Recovery Bonds,
Series 2014 (1) and its Financial Recovery Bonds, Series 2014 (2) (together, the
?Financial Recovery Bonds, Series 2014 and paying the costs of issuance associated
with the 2018 USA Bonds. The 2018 DSA Bonds are secured by a pledge of the City?s
Distributable State Aid State Revenue Sharing) on a statutory ?fth lien priority basis
and a pledge of the limited tax full faith and credit of the City.?

In addition, on December 13, 2018, the City purchased and canceled, at a discount from
par, $197.6 million of its Financial Recovery bonds, Series 2014 ($192.2 million Series
2014 at a purchase price of $87 per $100 in principal amount and $5.4 million
Series 2014 (2) at a purchase price of $85 per $100 in principal amount) in exchange
for the proceeds from the 2018 USA Bonds noted above. Lastly on December 13, 2018,
the City deposited into escrow funds to redeem $3.1 million of its Financial Recovery
Income Tax Revenue and Refunding Bonds, Series 2014-B. The redemption is scheduled
to occur on January 22, 2019.

The OCFO estimates the debt service on LTGO bonds for FY 2025-2030 will be reduced
by $155 million because of the above debt issuances. Debt service beginning in ?scal
year 2025 would have increased by approximately $31 million per year through ?scal
year 2030 in absence of these transactions. In addition, to the reduced debt service, the
City will also save approximately $21.7 million ($11.7 million interest savings on 2014 
Bonds and $10 million on 2014 8(1) and 2014 3(2) Bonds) as a result of these
transactions."8

On December 10, 2018, the City issued $135,000,000 Unlimited Tax General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2018 for the purpose of ?nancing the cost of certain capital projects of the
City and paying cost of issuance associated with the 2018 UTGO Bonds. The 2018
UTGO Bonds are secured by the debt millage on City property taxes. The 2018 UTGO
Bonds are tax exempt and mature on April 1, 2038.99

Also, pension obligations have only been reduced and not eliminated even though the
City?s required contributions are limited by the Plan of Adjustment through June 30,
2023. A?er June 30, 2023, the City will have signi?cant annual obligations to fund
pensions, especially if the Net Pension Liability is not signi?cantly reduced by then.

Beginning in 2024, the Plan of Adjustment assumed that the UAAL would be funded
over 30 years and projected an annual General Fund contribution of $111 million
beginning in ?scal year 2024. Based on the latest actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2016,
the anticipated General Fund contributions starting in FY 2024 are projected to be $150
million?. As mentioned previously, the OCFO has taken action to mitigate the pension
required contributions in 2024 by setting aside $103.3 million in the Retirement
Protection Trust Fund as of June 30, 2018.

- If new revenue sources are not established, and revenues as projected in the Plan of
Adjustment do not materialize, the City will severely struggle to maintain a viable
government without strong cost containment measures. The years after June 30,
2023 will be challenging as the City resumes making regular pension contributions
and much of the principal on the debt issued from the bankruptcy settlements
become due.

Major lssuLes from the City?s Enterprise F?d_Financial Statements in the 2018 CAFR
(Long-term perspective!

Enterprise Fund?s Net Position. The City?s enterprise funds had a net position of $1.24 billion
at June 30, 2018, an increase of $76.3 million from the $1.16 billion net position at June 30,
2017 primarily due to the DWSD bifurcation special item gain of $101 .9 million. The enterprise
fund cumulative unrestricted net position was a surplus totaling $797.1 million in FY 2018 a
$100.9 million increase from the $696.2 million in FY 2017??.

The Water and Sewage Disposal Funds had a combined $101.9 million special item gain)
during FY 2018 from the bifurcation. A ?nal Memorandum of Understanding agreement was
executed on June 30, 2018 (2018 MOU) concerning the bifurcation of DWSD and GLWA.
Certain estimates from prior years were adjusted as a result of the ?nal agreement, including pre?
effective liabilities and related cash balances and the portion of the debt assumed by GLWA that
was utilized for local system improvements, whose debt will continue to be ?inded by DWSD.
As a result, of the bifurcation negotiations and the 2018 MOU, DWSD has recognized gains
(losses) from bifurcation in the current year and prior two years as follows:

 

 

Sewage
Water Disposal
Fund Fund Total
June 30, 2016 776,532,736 808,913,176 1,585,445,912

Cumulative total gain on bifurcation 726,120,184 803,231,132 1,529,351,316

 

Water and Sewage Disposal Funds. In FY 2018 Water and the Sewage Disposal Funds had
unrestricted net positions of $446.5 million and $555.8 million, respectively, mainly due to the
bifurcation which exchanged the water and sewer regional systems assets and liabilities
including long term debt to GLWA for $50.0 million in annual lease payments over 40 years.
The unrestricted net positions increased in FY 2018 from the prior year mainly due to the $101.9
million ($35.5 million Water and $66.4 million Sewage Disposal) bifurcation gain'09.

While the Water and Sewage Disposal Funds have large unrestricted net positions at June 30,
2018, both funds have large capital and infrastructure repair and replacement needs and debt
obligations to GLWA that will require a large share of that unrestricted net position. According
to DWSD representatives, a bene?t of the net unrestricted net position is that water and sewer
rate increases to Detroit customers will be mitigated, as the unrestricted net position through the

annual $50 million lease payment from GLWA, will provide a signi?cant amount of the funding
for both Funds? capital, infrastructure, and debt obligation needs.' '0

Per page 18 and 27 of the 2018 CAFR, there is recorded a $1.1 billion receivable from GLWA
for the lease as of June 30, 2018. The receivable was for the present value of the $50.0 million
annual lease payment due over 40 years per the City?s agreement with GLWA. The annual lease
payment from GLWA to the Water Fund is $22.5 million and the present value of the receivable
from GLWA on June 30, 2018 was $485.7 million. The annual lease payment from GLWA to
the Sewage Disposal Fund is $27.5 million and the present value of the receivable from GLWA
on June 30, 2018 was $606.5 million.

It should be noted that the $50 million lease payment is ?Jnded from a portion of the common-to-
all revenue requirements for the regional systems. The lease payments follow the ?ow of funds
under the related GLWA Master Bond Ordinance. The parties to the Leases anticipated that, due
to ef?ciencies, restructuring opportunities, local and regional capital improvements underway or
planned for the ?iture, and other cost savings, funding of the lease payment would not increase
the revenue requirements for the regional systems by more than 4 percent per year. Nothing in
the Leases changes the obligation of GLWA to comply with the rate covenant under the Master
Bond Ordinances. The lease payments are not treated as a GLWA operation and maintenance
expense and may be applied by the City, solely at the City?s direction and discretion, to the cost
of improvements to the local system infrastructure located within the City (payable after debt
service and pension liability payments in the ?ow of funds), the payment of debt service on
GLWA Bonds associated with such improvements, or the City?s share of debt service on GLWA
Bonds associated with eommon-to-all improvements. Any bonds to ?nance regional system
improvements or DWSD local infrastructure are now issued by the GLWA and are secured by
the net revenue (as de?ned in the Master Bond Ordinances) of the systems.

Pursuant to the Leases, GLWA has exclusive right to establish rates for water and sewer service
for both wholesale and retail (City of Detroit) customers; however, GLWA may delegate rate
setting to an agent and under the Water and Sewer Services Agreement, and as provided in a
December 15, 2015 Court Order, has delegated to the City?s Board of Water Commissioners its
rights to set rates and collect revenue with respect to retail customers of the City.

As a result of the Leases, DWSD reports activity only related to City retail customers (Detroit
retail class). Per the Water and Sewer Services agreement between DWSD and GLWA and the
Master Bond Ordinances, the Detroit retail class continues to pay its common-to-all share of debt
service revenue requirements and its allocated share of debt service revenue requirements
associated with improvements to the local water and sewer systems based on a percentage of
total debt service

The lease receivable from GLWA on Statement of Net Position does not agree with the
lease payable on Statement of Net Position for FY 2018. GLWA shows the lease to be
$59.4 million less than DWSD for the Water Fund and $85.5 million less for the sewage
Disposal Fund. Detailed below is the difference. In the questions section we are asking the

In FY 2018 the Water Fund had $8.8 million in operating income while the Sewage Disposal
Fund had $8.8 million in operating income, a $29.0 improvement over the $20.2 operating loss
in FY 2017??. Sewage Disposal Fund revenues were up while expenses were down in 2018
compared to the prior year.

It is important to note that as of June 30, 2018, the Sewage Disposal Fund shows a balance of
$53.6 million in a liability account entitled ?Due to Great Lakes Water This
appears to be attributable to a negative balance caused by a budget shortfall of $47.8 million for
the DWSD sewer ?md which exceeds the two percent threshold actual receipts falling short
of budget for either the water fund or sewer fund by greater than two percent) per the 2018

they arise shall be repaid in full, in installments over a period not to exceed three ?scal years.
The installment payments will include a surcharge based on the three-year U.S. treasury note
plus 150 basis points. As of November 7, 2018, DWSD has discussed options to cure this
shortfall with its Board of Commissioners and at a Reconciliation Committee meeting on
October 19, 2018. A written agreement is presently under discussion to document the plan to
cure."" In the questions section of this report we ask the OCFO to provide supporting detail of
the $53.6 million that is due and how does the DWSD plan to cure this shortfall.

The City needs to closely observe the ?nancial performance of the Water and Sewage
DiSposal Funds after the bifurcation to ensure the funds maintain solvency and the
resources to provide the City?s citizens with excellent water and sewage service.

Transportation Fund. The Transportation Fund had an unrestricted net position deficit at June
30, 2018 of $223.7 million, a $13.4 million increase from the $210.3 million de?cit on June 30,
2017. This was mainly due to the $10.2 million increase in the net pension liability from $188.2
million at June 30, 2017 to $198.4 million at June 30, 2018. The General Fund provided $55.2
milliorl't1 sin subsidies to the transportation Fund in FY 2018 compared to $61.6 million in FY
2017.

Notwithstanding the Transportation Fund, which traditionally receives a large general fund
subsidy for its Operations, the business?type ?lnds are struggling to fully recover their cost of
delivery. There will be a constant need to re-evaluate the fees rates assessed by the business-

2017.

Public Lighting Authority. Because the FLA is in substance a part of the City?s operation, its
?nancial statements are blended (Blended Component Unit) with the City?s ?nancial statements
in the Enterprise Funds section. The FLA had a $34.9 million net position at June 30,
2018, a $2.7 million increase from the $32.2 million at June 30, 2017.1 '6 The FLA had revenues
of $13.3 million including $12.5 million transferred from the General Fund?s utility users? tax
revenues. In addition, the City provided a subsidy of $10.3 million to the PLA. The FLA had
$12.7 million of expenses for the year ended June 30, 2018. The FLA debt service was $8.4
million.

The FLA had an unrestricted net position of $21.8 million'min the FY 2018 CAFR, which is
mainly due to the $18.3 million of excess utility user tax revenues collected that will be used to
pay its future debt obligations, which is shown in the table below. in the questions section we are
asking the OCFO why isn?t the $18.3 million of the unrestricted net position instead
re?ected as being restricted for debt service.

The FLA also has received General Fund subsidies from the City?s General Fund. Article 4 of
the Interlocal Agreement between the City and PLA'Iqrequires the City pay FLA for its operating
and maintenance, extraordinary maintenance, and administrative costs. In addition, the
agreement requires that the City, in no event, be obligated to pay more than $8,024,000 (Annual
Cap Amount) in any given year, excluding any payments for extraordinary maintenance. Article
5 of the agreement requires quarterly payments to the PLA and a reconciliation by the PLA of
actual expenses with the quarterly payment made. If the reconciliation discloses an overpayment
by the City, the Authority shall credit the difference to the City against the next amounts that
may become due under the Agreement. As can be seen from the table below, from FY 2013
through June 30, 2018 a total of $35.5 million in subsidy has been paid to the PLA. The FLA
has incurred $35.7 million ofoperating expenses from FY 2013 through FY 2018.

Other Enterprise Funds. Other Enterprise Funds include the Airport Fund and Parking Fund.

The General Fund subsidy to the Airport decreased $2.1 million to $9 million for FY 2018 from
$3.0 million in FY 2017. The Airport Fund had a $3.8 million unrestricted de?cit net position on
June 30, 2018, an increase of $7 million from the $3.1 million unrestricted de?cit net position at
June 30, 2017.

The Parking Fund net position on June 30, 2018 was $32.4 million, a decrease of $42.5 million
from the $74.9 million net position on June 30, 2017. Parking Fund revenues in FY 2017 were
$12.0 million, a $2.8 million decrease when compared to the $14.8 million in FY 2017, The
Parking Fund had a $5 million unrestricted net position on June 30, 2018, a decrease of $7.4
million from the $7.9 million unrestricted net position on June 30, 2017. The Parking Fund sold
the Premier garage in FY 2018 and recorded a $21.1 million loss on the sale of assets, which was
the main reason for the decline in net position in FY 2018. 

City of Detroit?s Fingncial Condition has improved since its Emergence from Bankruptcv
on December 10, 2014
Since bankruptcy, the City?s ?scal position has stabilized and strengthenedm:

- The City now has achieved a balanced budget for the fourth consecutive year. While the
Finance Review Commission (FRC) has no active role any longer it will continue to exist
for a 10-year term. The City is still required to submit ?nancial reports, adopted
budget and 4-year ?nancial plan to the FRC each year. So long as the City continues to
balance its budgets and meet other basic ?scal requirements, the PRC will stay inactive
for the rest of its existence. '33

0 Note, however, that even though the City has achieved a balanced budget for four years
in a row, the level of the annual surplus is diminishing:

General Fund surplus for FY 2015 was unusually large due primarily to the one-time elimination of debt, pension
liability and other liabilities, coupled with an extraordinary gain coming out of bankruptcy on December 10, 2014.

Three credit rating upgrades in less than three years.

Income tax revenue has increased 22% over four years ($310.2 million in FY 2018
compared to $253.8 million in FY 2014).

The Property tax collection rate has increased to 8??o in FY 2018 compared to 69% in
FY 2014.

Over the past three years, the City?s grants management reform efforts have reduced the
City?s questioned costs by millions of dollars, decreased the number of audit ?ndings,
and helped to close numerous federal corrective action plans. More specifically, FY 2018
represents the third consecutive year of zero questioned costs of federal grant awards
compared to $7.3 million in FY 2012 and $18.5 million in FY 2013. As a result, the City
is a more successful grantee and has secured hundreds of millions in public and private
grants to support neighborhood revitalization and service improvements.

Transitioned the processing of City income tax and withholding to the State of Michigan,
as a result, taxpayers can now e-?le and pay taxes electronically and the number of new
?lers has substantially increased.

Accomplished a substantial turnaround on paying City suppliers more timely: for
example, compared to FY 2017, in FY 2018 there has been an 85% reduction in
backlogged invoices on hold waiting to be processed.

to February 2018, the OCFO established an Administrative Issuance System, which is the
system for documenting, issuing, and implementing key policies, process ?ows, standard
operating procedures, and detailed work instructions for all operations with the OCFO.
delroitmieov administrative-issuance-
system can be visited for a current listing of all policies.

In June 2018, the City established the Forecasting and Economic Analysis division within
the Of?ce of Budget. The purpose of the new division is to provide information and
tools to support planning and decision-making across City government, with a focus on
revenue and economic analysis and ?scal sustainability.

Maior Observations on Ecgmtie Condition a_nd City Improvements from the City?s Otl?
Supplementary Information in the 2018 CAFR

Inevitably, a govemment?s ?nancial position will be effected by its circumstances the
vitality and diversi?cation of the local economy, the breadth and depth of the govemment?s tax
base). Past experience often is vital to predicting ?Jture deveIOpments Have
intergovernmental revenues been increasing or decreasing over time? Has the government?s
population been growing or shrinking?). Economic condition focuses on the likelihood that
today?s ?nancial position will improve or deteriorate in the future. Much of the information
needed for assessing economic condition involves either non?nancial data population and

46

unemployment) or ?nancial data presented for multiple years 10-year trends). Such data
typically are located either in the introductory section transmittal letter of the CAFR, in the
statistical section'? of the CAFR and/or as part of the required supplementary information



The following major observations regarding the economic condition perspectives of the City and
other initiatives are from review of the introductory sectionmin the 2018 CAP R:

The City?s current economic condition is improving. The future outlook for recovery and
improvement is positive. Businesses are transferring employees from suburban cities to the
City of Detroit. New residents are moving into the City. However, much of the improvement
in economic development is located in concentrated areas of the City mid-town,
downtown and certain neighborhoods of the City).

The City has committed to a multi-year effort to improve City services that impact its citizens?
quality of life and that enhance sustainability. Services across all neighborhoods have
drastically improved. Activities and accomplishments include?:

75,000 constituent complaints resolved through new Improve Detroit app

50,000 prevented foreclosures of occupied homes under programs to assist families in
need

65,000 new LED streetlights

8,000 summer jobs for Detroit youth

2,000 miles of neighborhood residential streets being swept three times a year after a
seven-year absence

1,200 new units of affordable housing opened or in development

400 Project Green Light businesses with real-time camera connections to police
headquarters helping to keep the City safe, up from 196 last year

275 parks being ?illy maintained, up ?'om only 25 in 2013, 40 of which are
completely remade

120 new DDOT buses added to the ?eet, nine new 24-hour routes, and six brand new
bus lines

100 new small businesses (78% owned by entrepreneurs of color) opened, under
construction or funded through Motor City Match

27 Recreation Centers open this past summer including 16 new Summer Fun Centers
in partnership with the Detroit Public Schools

15 minute police priority 1 response time, down nearly 30 minutes on average

Eight minute emergency medical service response time, down from nearly 20 minutes
on average

Blight remediation remains one of the City's highest reinvestment priorities and is progressing at
a strong pace. The City is leveraging substantial Federal grants, including $258.8 million in
Hardest Hit Funds, alongside City ?mds to demolish dangerous structures and return the

parcels to productive uses. Activities and accomplishments include:

15,000 dangerous vacant houses demolished

10,000 blighted abandoned homes boarded up

3,000 vacant homes being rehabbed and reoccupied under land bank programs

- 10,000 side lots sold to neighbors for $100, up from 7,000 last year

1 10,000 vacant lots now being cut 3 to 4 times a year after being left overgrown for years

The City of Detroit, Michigan is tackling the geographic and strategic alignment of City
assets to grow and diversify Detroit?s economy. De?ned by a three-year vision, the City and
its economic development arm, the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, are working to
secure 10,000 jobs and $3.4 billion of investment and open 140 small businesses citywide by
2020. To achieve this goal, the City?s economic development strategic positions are to: 
attract and direct investment by showcasing Detroit?s assets and building the case for
investment, (2) lead land development efforts that unlock economic growth citywide, and (3)
support small and large businesses to locate and grow in Detroit.

Detroit?s strength as a business location is evident through its successes. Since 2012, Detroit
has seen almost $1 billion invested in automotive manufacturing at new and existing
suppliers and $96 million invested in over 14 full-service grocery stores. Downtown
Detroit?s vacancy rate has fallen 12 percent in the past ?ve years to 17.5 percent.
Additionally, according to the 2014-2015 Annual Michigan Venture Capital Research report,
Detroit is becoming a new focal point of venture capital activity, with 24 firms receiving
$186 million in investment. Over 52 percent of those are tech-related.

Since FY 2014, coming out of bankruptcy, with better economic conditions and with the
institution of greater ?nancial controls, the City?s main operating account, the general fund,
has experienced healthier ?nancial results.

City of Detroit?s Risk Factors and Potential Opportunities

Although the City of Detroit has increased its ?nancial position in recent years, and it is likely
that the City?s economic condition will improve, the following represent economic and ?scal
risks that should be considered'?:

Changes to federal ?scal policy may negatively impact federal entitlement programs
resulting in a loss of funds to state and local municipalities.

Increased uncertainty in federal government monetary and trade policy. Failure to raise
debt ceiling would have a negative impact on the economy.

Challenges to State budget from declining local ?nances and other critical issues may
unfavorably impact the Statutory State ReVenue Sharing distribution to local

municipalities. Lower Sales Tax revenues/slowing auto sales directly impact local share.

Risks to estimated property tax collections clue to the impact of Wayne County
chargebacks netted against the delinquent accounts revolving fund payment.

Loss to personal property tax collections not fully reimbursed by the state.
Lower consumer con?dence depresses spending and reduces sales tax revenues.

Rising interest rates resulting in lower consumer spending/housing activity. Uncertainty
in fed actions on when/how much Fed Fund Rate will rise.

Rising in?ation adversely impacts economic performance.
Lower census numbers result in loss of federal state funds tied to population.

Potential recession in the near future.

The following represent potential opportunities for the City of Detroit to ?irther improve
revenues:

Major development projects, announced or in process, are not included in revenue
estimates until revenue stream to the City materializes. The potential for increased
economic development to increase the City's tax base and generate additional revenues
for the City.

- Ongoing improvements to collection efforts in FY 2018 results in additional tax revenues
not currently re?ected in the estimates

- State of Michigan processing of the City?s income tax and subsequent withholding
collections results in increased compliance and generate additional revenues for the City.
E-pay payment option should improve collection activity.

1- Passage of State legislation requiring non-Detroit businesses to withhold income taxes of
employees residing in Detroit should signi?cantly increase income tax collections.I32

- Sales tax on intemet purchases may increase state local share distributions

Other Maior lssuelebservations from the Review of the 2018 CAFR

Downtown Development Authority Capital Grants and Contributions. The Downtown
Development authority reported capital grants and contributions totaling $354.9?3 million for the
year ended June 30, 2018. in the questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain what
these revenues are and if they are related to the Little Caesars Arena ?nancing.

Tax Abatement Disclosures. In the FY 2018 CAFR, Note 13 Tax Abatements are reported as
required by GASB Statement No. 77, Tax Abatement Disclosures?. The City disclosed the

In FY 2018 the City gave an estimated $38.7 million of tax abatements so as to be competitive in
Southeastem Michigan to encourage business and residency growth. This was $2.7 million more
than the $36.0 million in tax abatements for FY 2017.

Fair Allocation of Legacy Costs to Solid Waste Fund. The City is not properly allocating the
pension and legacy costs to the Solid Waste Fund and some other City ?inds BSEED, and
Street Funds) that have the means to pay for them. Legacy costs were allocated to funds based on
payroll costs. The Solid Waste Fund was partially privatized for waste di3posal and recycling
services in FY 2014. When a Fund is privatized and the City payroll is reduced or eliminated
there is no process to properly allocate all the legacy costs that the Fund has incurred. The
General Fund is left having to pay for those legacy costs. The Solid Waste Fund had a $61.4
million Fund Balance on June 30, 2018, which was a $9.2 million increase from the $52.2
million Fund Balance in FY 2017.'35 The Solid Waste Fund was not charged for its share of the
settlements for OPEB retiree health care) through the 2014 8(1) and 3(2) bonds (VEBA
Bonds) and the POCs in FY 2015 - FY 2018. The Solid Waste Fund Balance is growing because
it is not paying its fair share of the legacy costs.

Other Special Revenue Funds with Large Fund Balances Other Special Revenue Funds had
large Fund Balances at June 30, 2018. These include: (1) Construction Code Fund (BSEED) -
$19.6 million; (2) Drug Law Enforcement Fund - $9.0 million; (3) Street Funds - $71.3 million;
and (4) Telecommunications Fund - $5.4 million.136 The large fund balances could be due in
part to the Fund not being charged its fair share of costs incurred. The City needs to ensure
legacy costs and other costs are properly charged to these Special Revenue Funds and the grant
funds Block Grants and General grants). There is a risk that the General Fund will pay for
costs incurred by other Funds that have revenue sources outside the General Fund that could
have paid for those costs.

The Plan of Adjustment (POA) requires the BSEED to annually repay the General Fund a series
of payments through FY 2023 totaling $17.7 million for the loans made to the BSEED when it
ran de?cits prior to the bankruptcy'?. Even though the Construction Code Fund has a $19.6
million fund balance nothing has been repaid to the General Fund and the FY 2019 Budget and
Four Year Financial Plan does not include any provision for repayment. 1n the questions section
we ask the OCFO why BSEED is not repaying the General Fund per the FDA.

General Grants De?cit. Of concern is the $10.4 million de?cit in the General Grants Fund
and the impact to the General Fund. In the questions section we ask the OCFO what is
causing the de?cit and how much will the General Fund have to pay to liquidate the de?cit.
Also, we ask if there is an accounting issue where expenses are not being charged to the
proper fund.

Of concern is the $21.2 million of long-term advances the City had made to: Sewage
Disposal Fund $4.9 million; (2) Transportation Fund $4.8 million; (3) Water Fund $2.9

million; (4) Nonmajor enterprise funds $450,000; and (5) Component Units $8.1 million.?38
In the questions section we ask the OCFO to explain in detail what the long-term advances
are and what they are for and why they did not come before City Council. LPD assumes
some of these advances are related to those funds that are obligated to pay the General
Fund for the 2014 bonds that were redeemed by the general fund in FY 2018.

Bridging Neighborhoods Fund. The Bridging Neighborhoods Fund is new Special Revenue
Fund added in FY 2018. On June 30, 2018 it had an $18.4 million fund balance.?39 In the
questions section we are asking the OCFO to explain the fund purpose and how it received $18.0
million from the sale of capital assets.?40

CDBG Revenue. 0f concern was that CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) Fund
federal grant revenue was $34.0 million in FY 2018??, which was $14.2 million less than the
$48.2 million in federal grant revenue in FY 2017. Federal grant revenue for the CDBG Fund
was $45.0 million in FY 2016. [n the questions section we ask the OCFO to explain the reason
for the large drop in CDBG revenue in FY 2018.

Noncompliance Fees Fund. The Noncompliance Fees Fund is a new Special Revenue Fund
added in FY 2018. On June 30, 2018 it had a fund balance of $419,679?? The FY 2018
revenues totaled $4.8 million. We assume that these revenues are the CRIO (Civil Rights
Inclusion and Opportunity Department) ?nes for non-compliant businesses. In the questions
section we ask the OCFO to explain the Noncompliance Fees Fund and its purpose.

Solid Waste Fund. The Solid Waste fund had $63.8 million in fees (Sales and charges for
services) in FY 2018 which was $9.4 million higher than the $54.4 million in fees collected in
FY 2017.'43

Other Governmental Entities. The other governmental entities? June 30, 2018 ?nancial
statements and related management letters should at least be presented to the Council?s Budget,
Finance and Audit committee since ?the elected of?cials of the primary government
are ?nancially accountable? of the legally separate organizations termed ?Discretely Presented
Component Units?. As a result, the B, role is more critical to the legislative body's role of
maintaining ?duciary responsibility for the City.

Non Compliance with Legal and Contractual Provisions. The City was not in compliance
with legal and contractual provisions for the year ended June 30, 2018 (see Note 2 and 2 
in the which included:

0 The City was not in compliance with legal and contractual provisions for the year ended
June 30, 2018, which included: I) the City failed to properly escheat balances to the State

budgeted expenditures not to exceed estimated revenue plus accumulated fund balance.
The City?s ?nal budget for several non-major special revenue funds resulted in a
projected de?cit. The City incurred expenses against certain appropriations in excess of
the amount appropriated by City Council. The City amended the FY 2018 budget
subsequent to year end.

a The City was not in compliance with 2 CFR 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements,
Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, Section 200.302, which
requires the City to: ?Identify, in its accounts, all federal awards received and expended
and the federal programs under which they were received.? The City?s general ledger
records were not always accurate at the individual grant level, as required.

0 Special Revenue and Component Unit De?cit Unassigned Fund Balances. The
following are funds that had a de?cit unassigned fund balance or de?cit unrestricted net
position on June 30, 2018. The General Grants Fund (Special Revenue Fund) had a
de?cit of unassigned fund balance of $10.4 million. The Detroit Public Library
(Component Unit) had a de?cit of unassigned fund balance of $3.5 million. The Detroit
Transportation Corporation (Component Unit) had a de?cit unrestricted net position of
$859,064. Eastern Market (Component Unit) had a de?cit unrestricted net position of
$404,696. Local Development Finance Authority (Component Unit) (LDFA) had a
de?cit unrestricted net position of $21.6 million. The Detroit Employment Solutions
Corporation (Component Unit) had a de?cit of unassigned fund balance of $96,474. The
Museum of African American History (a Component Unit) had a de?cit unrestricted net
position of $780,342. The Transportation Fund (DDOT) (Enterprise Fund) had a de?cit
unrestricted net position of $223.7 million. The Airport Fund (Enterprise Fund) had a
de?cit unrestricted net position of $3.8 million. The City is not required to ?le a de?cit
elimination plan with the State for any of these funds or component units because they do
not meet any of the State?s criteria for ?ling, mainly because they have positive working
capital (current assets/resources exceed current 

Syncora Bankruptcy Settlement?? The City and Syncora reached an agreement effecting a
global settlement of all matters and litigation between the parties related to the Bankruptcy Case,
as set forth in the Syncora settlement documents. The parties entered into the Syncora
Development Agreement and the Syncora Option Agreement. The City and Grand Circus
Holdings, LLC, an af?liate of Pike Pointe Holdings (owned by Syncora), have negotiated a 30
year long- term master lease for the Grand Circus Park Garage upon terms consistent with the
Option Agreement. Representatives of Syncora have presented to the Planning and Development
Department (PDD) and the Detroit Economic Development Corporation (EDC) an initial master
plan and marketing booklet for contiguous parcels at Atwater and Rivard streets.

During the term of the lease agreement and upon its termination, the City will maintain
ownership of the Grand Circus garage. The Lessee (Pike Pointe Holdings, LLC) is obligated to
operate and maintain the garage during the lease term at its sole cost and expense and has the
right to collect all parking revenue derived from the Grand Circus garage. The Lessee is also
responsible, at its sole cost and expense, for all necessary capital expenditures for the Grand
Circus garage.

Rent to the City will be calculated as 25 percent of ?Free Cash Flow". Free cash ?ow is de?ned
as revenue collected from the Grand Circus garage minus operating expenses, minus initial
capital expenditures up to $13.5 million during the ?rst ?ve years of the lease term, and minus a
return of 140 percent on its initial capital expenditures. Accordingly, the Lessee shall be entitled
to all free cash ?ows until a maximum of up to approximately $18.9 million of free cash ?ows
are received. Subsequent to that point, the City will begin to receive 25 percent of the ?Jture free
cash ?ows.

Introduction to the Report. The Introduction to the Reportmsection of the 2018 CAFR was
excellent and highlighted the accomplishments of the City, which showed what a good
stewardship of resources by the City?s leaders, management and employees.

The Administration should be commended for the thoroughness of the 2018 CAFR. lt behooves
the Budget, Finance and Audit Committee to continue to do its due diligence to understand and
examine the 2018 CAFR.

Property Tax Note The property tax footnote?s last paragraph states, ?approximately
$69.4 million of delinquent property taxes receivable was transferred (sold) to the County"'48.
The statement is in error as delinquent solid waste and water fees were also included in the $69.4
million transferred to the County. The $69.4 million total included delinquent solid waste fees
totaling $21.5 million and delinquent water fees totaling $9.3 million.

Questions for the Administration

Listed below are LPD's questions for the City?s Administration on the 2018 CAFR. LPD
respectfully requests that the Administration respond to the issue/observations indicated in four
weeks LPD wants to thank the Administration in advance for these responses.

1. The Plan of Adjustment (POA) requires the BSEED (a/kfa ?Construction Code
Fund? for CAFR purposes) to annually repay the General Fund a series of
payments through FY 2023 totaling $17.7 million for the loans made to the BSEED
when it ran de?cits prior to the bankruptcy'?. Even though the Construction Code
Fund has a $19.6 million fund balance nothing has been repaid to the General Fund
and the FY 2019 Budget and Four Year Financial Plan does not include any
provision for repayment. Please explain why isn?t BSEED repaying the General
Fund per the POA.

2. In addition to the Construction Code Fund, there are other Special Revenue Funds
that large balances at June 30, 2018, including: 1) $61.4 million for the Solid Waste
Fund; 2) $9.0 million for the Drug Law Enforcement Fund; 3) $71.3 million for the
Street Funds; and 4) $5.4 million for the Telecomminications Fund. It appears the
City has not propertly allocated pension and legacy costs and other reimbursable

ATTACHMENT 
Relevant for FY 2018: Questions on FY 2017 DWSD Financial Statements Net Position
and DWSD Management Responses

The FY 2017 ?nancial statements for the Water and Sewage Disposal Funds show unrestricted
fund balances of $401.9 and $486.1 million, reapectively. How do you explain that the
unrestricted balances cannot be used to reduce the water and sewer rates charged to its
customers? How do you explain to the employee unions that the unrestricted net position cannot
be used to provide salary and bene?t increases?

Mm

Generally speaking, public utilities are capital-intensive operations that frequently rely on
the accumulation of signi?cant reserves in order to manage cash flow requirements. DWSD
is currently executing on a $500 million capital program that will be funded from multiple
sources including unrestricted fund balances. Utilizing currently available funds also allows
DWSD to better manage its long-term debt program by allowing ?exibility in the timing of
debt issuance.

It is also important to understand that DWSD water and sewer rates are derived from the
calculation of revenue requirements that are determined using a modi?ed (or contractual)
basis of accounting. ln estimating the annual revenue requirements for water and sewer
operations, lease collections, debt service payments and capital expenses are calculated on
the cash basis of accounting. Depreciation expense is excluded from the calculation. All
other revenues and expenses are determined on the accrual basis of accounting.

For rate-setting purposes, the future collection of lease principal amounts, which in the
aggregate approximate the unrestricted fund positions of the water and sewer funds, will be
applied to reduce future revenue requirements and, arguably, will be considered a source of
revenue that does, in fact, reduce future water and sewer rates. The Department may
choose in future years to apply these resources in a manner that effectively funds salary and
bene?t increases, or to any other operational requirement as they may deem appropriate.

Will the Water and Sewage Funds decide in the future to restrict some of the net position for
needed capitalfinfrastructure expenditures?

DWSD Response

Amounts may be required to be restricted in connection with the future issuance of bonds to
?nance such capital/infrastructure expenditures. The Department has no ability to
unilaterally ?restrict? funds for such purposes, however, it is our intention to maximize the
use of lease receipts for Improvement and Extension Fund projects.

Why does the Water and Sewage Disposal Funds have such a low not investment in capital assets
when the net capital assets are so much higher?

DWSD Response

The net investment in capital assets is reduced for the amount of outstanding indebtedness
related to the capital assets. These amounts include the Obligations payable to GLWA
(representing allocated share of pre-bifurcation debt), Revenue bonds and State
revolving loans as identi?ed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.

What is the condition of the DWSD's water and sewer capital infrastructure? How crucial is it to
dedicate available resources to ?mding repairs and replacement over other needs?

DWSD Response

The water and sewer infrastructure is showing its age and in need of signi?cant repair
and/or replacement. We are currently in the process assessing the condition of all water and
sewer assets with the intention of developing a long?term plan to address those needs. The
Department is currently committed to a ?ve-year, $500 million program to address the
more immediate system concerns.
