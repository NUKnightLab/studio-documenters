PROPOSED ORDINANCE
SWEETENED BEVERAGE TAX
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section 6(a) of
the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Constitution provides that home rule units may exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs including, but not limited to, the power to regulate for the
protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; to license; to tax; and to incur debt; and

 WHEREAS, Illinois law (55 ILCS 5/5-1009) permits home rule units to impose "taxes not based on the selling or
purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property"; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the
World Health Organization, based on a summary of the available evidence linking intake of added sugar and sugar
sweetened beverages to adverse health outcomes including obesity and diabetes, have recommended that Americans
consume no more than 10% of their daily calories in the form of added sugar; and
WHEREAS, numerous organizations and agencies, including the American Heart Association, American Diabetes
Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, American Medical
Association, and the Centers for Disease Control, recommend limiting intake of added sugar and sugar sweetened
beverages to improve health; and
WHEREAS, studies show that sugary beverages flood the liver with high amounts of sugar in a short amount of
time and that this “sugar rush” over time leads to fat deposits and metabolic disturbances that cause diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and other serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, diseases connected to sugary beverages disproportionately impact minorities and low-income
communities; and
WHEREAS, two out of three adults and one out of three children in the United States are overweight or obese and
on any given day, half the people in the U.S. consume sugary drinks, with one in four consuming at least 200
calories from such drinks and 5% drinking at least 567 calories (equivalent to four cans of soda); and
WHEREAS, the University of Connecticut RUDD Center for Food Policy & Obesity found that residents of the
City of Chicago consume approximately 140 million gallons of sweetened beverages per year; applying such
analysis to the County, Cook County residents are estimated to consume approximately 269 million gallons of
sweetened beverages per year; and
WHEREAS, sodas, sports drinks, coffees and other sugar sweetened beverages packed with calories constitute the
largest source of added sugars in the diets of American children and consuming only one sugar sweetened beverage
per day correlates positively with weight gain for children and adolescents; and
WHEREAS, a 2008 study found drinking more than two servings of diet soda (a beverage containing non-caloric
sweeteners) a day doubled the risk for kidney decline in women; and
WHEREAS, the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis found that daily consumption of beverages containing noncaloric sweeteners was associated with 36% greater risk for metabolic syndrome and 67% increased risk for type 2
diabetes; and
WHEREAS, a 2012 study found that consumption of diet soft drinks was associated with increased risk for vascular
events, including stroke;
WHEREAS, in the San Antonio Heart Study, participants who drank more than 21 beverages containing noncaloric sweetener per week were twice as likely to become overweight or obese as people who did not drink such
beverages; and

Page 2 of 11

 WHEREAS, the World Health Organization recently stated that implementing taxes on sugar sweetened beverages
can lower consumption and reduce obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to promote public health, including lowered obesity rates, the Board of Commissioners
has determined that a County tax not based upon the selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale
or purchase thereof should be imposed on the sale of sweetened beverages in Cook County, as provided herein.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
FISCAL YEAR 2017 REVENUE INITIATIVE AND MODIFICATION OF FUTURE COOK COUNTY
HOME RULE AND PROPERTY TAXES
WHEREAS, since FY 2011, the overall full time employee positions (“FTE”) have decreased by over 2,000 FTE’s,
with the General, Health and Grant Funds realizing a 10% reduction since FY 2011; and

Page 7 of 11

 WHEREAS, through the passage of the FY 2016 Annual Appropriation Bill, Cook County Board President, Toni
Preckwinkle ("President") and the Cook County Board of Commissioners took significant steps to promote the
long-term sustainability of County government; and
WHEREAS, given the fiscal challenges facing the County in FY 2016, additional expenditure reductions and new
sources of revenue were implemented in order to begin to address the County’s long-term needs in a responsible
manner so as not to unduly burden the children and grandchildren of current taxpayers with extensive debt and
unfunded pension liabilities; and
WHEREAS, despite efforts to continue to stream line services and hold the line on revenue increases in FY 2017,
the County’s Preliminary Budget forecast released in June projected a budget shortfall of $174.3 million for FY
2017; and
WHEREAS, the fact remains that 87% of the County’s operating budget goes to to Public Health and Public
Safety; revenues fail to keep pace with the rate of inflation; and technology, pharmaceutical and other costs have
exceeded the rate of inflation; and
WHEREAS, in order to continue to build a fiscally sound foundation with long term financial sustainability, efforts
have been undertaken in the proposed FY 2017 budget recommendation to further streamline County services;
reduce vacant and filled positions; prioritize the delivery of critical public safety and health services; and address
the County’s revenue needs; and
WHEREAS, the FY 2017 budget recommendation includes an additional one percent reduction in positions;
includes the layoff of 300 employees; implements non-personnel reductions and proposes various management
initiatives as cost saving measures; and
WHEREAS, the FY 2017 budget recommendation includes over $78 million in expenditure reductions; however,
to seek additional expenditure reductions would result in a significant impairment of our public health and public
safety operations; and
WHEREAS, in order to prevent devastating cuts to the County’s public safety and public health operations, a one
cent sweetened beverage tax is being sought to generate the funds needed to cover the remaining $74.6 million
deficit for FY 2017; and
WHEREAS, implementing a sweetened beverage tax on both sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages
will not only allow the County to address various public safety and health funding needs but it is an important public
health initiative to discourage sweetened beverage consumption among youth and adults which over time should
assist in lowering obesity rates, preventing type 2 diabetes, reducing cardiovascular disease, reducing kidney decline
in women and reducing other serious health problems; and
WHEREAS, implementing a sweetened beverage tax on largely consumed sweetened beverages could result in
healthier beverage and food choices by both youth and adults and a healthier Cook County community long term;
and
WHEREAS, proposing a new revenue initiative, streamlining services, reducing vacant positions and
implementing layoffs are not easy choices; however, Cook County and its leadership must continue to act
responsibly to address the long-term needs of the County's residents and taxpayers and balance the proposed
sweetened beverage tax with cuts.
Page 8 of 11

 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do
hereby support passing a one cent sweetened beverage tax in an effort to improve public health as well as cover the
remaining $74 million deficit for the FY 2017 budget and avoid devastating cuts to the County’s public health and
public safety budgets; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the sweetened beverage tax revenue estimates for FY 2018 would allow the
County to maintain the proposed streamlined services levels recommended in the FY 2017 budget in FY 2018; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
resolve upon passage of the proposed sweetened beverage tax, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners will not further increase any of the tax rates provided in the County’s home rule tax ordinances in
FY 2017, FY 2018 or FY 2019 or deviate from the property tax restrictions provided in the County’s Cook County
Property Tax Relief Ordinance as provided in Chapter 74, Article II, Section 74-38 of the County’s Code of
Ordinances.
