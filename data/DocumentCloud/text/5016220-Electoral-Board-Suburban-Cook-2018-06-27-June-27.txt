PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ADDRESSING
THE
HARMFUL
EFFECTS
OF
IMMIGRANT
CHILD
AND
FAMILY
DETENTION AND CALLING ON THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
TO RESCIND THE “ZERO TOLERANCE” POLICY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants,” as defined in 07-R-240; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has demonstrated leadership and commitment towards upholding the rights of
immigrants by being the first county in the nation to develop and approve a policy of how to respond to
Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers per Ordinance 11-O-73; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has benefitted culturally, socially and economically from the diversity of its
residents, including over one million immigrants from throughout the world; and
WHEREAS, On April 6, 2018, United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum

Page 4 of 56

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 27, 2018

requiring all federal prosecutors along the Southwest border to adopt a zero tolerance policy for attempted
entries as defined under 8 U.S. Code § 1325; and
WHEREAS, There are migrant parents who have been criminally prosecuted as a result of this zero
tolerance policy and are currently being detained in immigrant detention facilities in Illinois, despite their
children being scattered across the country and thus further complicating the litigation of their asylum
cases; and
WHEREAS, This has vastly expanded the criminalization of adult migrants, some of whom are presenting
asylum claims and are now being criminally prosecuted before federal judges, instead of appearing in civil
immigration proceedings, and has resulted in the separation from their minor children who have been
erroneously labeled as unaccompanied alien children; and
WHEREAS, There has been a spike in separations after the issuance of the zero tolerance policy
memorandum with nearly 3,000 children separated from their parents with an unspecified number of these
children being sheltered in Chicago facilities with no plan to reunify the children with their parents per a
June 21, 2018 Chicago Sun-Times report; and
WHEREAS, On June 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order requiring
that families be detained together indefinitely during criminal or immigration proceedings, with expanded
use and construction of facilities as needed, yet does not rescind the zero tolerance policy and further
contributes to the mass incarceration of people of color in the United States; and
WHEREAS, The federal government has not clarified a pathway to reunification for families who have
already been separated, whom are experiencing extreme duress, as evidenced by the suicide of a
Honduran father who killed himself in a detention cell after being separated from his child in June 2018;
and
WHEREAS, Adding to a growing pattern of permanent family separation, the Chicago-based National
Immigrant Justice Center reports that some parents have already been deported to their home countries
without knowledge of their children’s whereabouts; and
WHEREAS, The Office of Refugee Resettlement has historically been charged with reunification of
unaccompanied minors with sponsors, but now, any future sponsors of the separated children, including
parents, would be subject to investigation and discretion by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
per a recent April 2018 Memorandum of Agreement between said department and the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services which would continue to put the well-being of children and families at risk;
and
WHEREAS, These practices impose long-lasting, trans-generational toxic stress on impacted families
with negative ramifications on public health, according to decades of research on the factors needed for
healthy child development; and

Page 5 of 56

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 27, 2018

WHEREAS, Furthermore, in light of a May 2018 joint report from the American Civil Liberties Union
and the International Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School which details
evidence of abuse against immigrant children while in government custody as well as separate reports that
Immigration and Customs Enforcement will start destroying records of abuse against detained immigrants,
it can be argued that detained families are in a perilous state with no accountability; and
WHEREAS, Renowned mental health organizations such as the Illinois Childhood Trauma Coalition and
the American Psychological Association have decried the practice of separating families and have
emphasized the harmful effects that trauma caused by detention and deportation can have on children and
families; and
WHEREAS, Moreover, mental health providers have reported that they cannot adequately address
pre-migration trauma that causes youth and families to seek asylum when trauma is further compounded
by family separation and family-based detention practices and current actions that place undue stress on
families, including in Cook County, who await reunification with loved ones via asylum; and
WHEREAS, The American Psychological Association’s Society for Community Research and Action
documented that the broader community can suffer negative consequences of immigration enforcement
and deportations by becoming more fearful and mistrustful of public institutions and being less likely to
participate in community activities such as school, church, and social services; and
WHEREAS, The situation has prompted a national outcry for the federal government to address the
malignant effects of detention, with leading immigrant rights organizations demanding U.S. House and
Senate leaders scale back funding for immigrant detention and enforcement; and
WHEREAS, In the United States, there already exists very limited mechanisms to safeguard parental
rights, let alone for the precarious situation of newly arrived migrant parents who are unduly being
referred to federal custody for criminal prosecution; and
WHEREAS, Elected officials across the country, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, have
either participated in various actions or issued statements condemning the practice and calling out the lack
of legal basis in the “zero tolerance policy”; and
WHEREAS, The current actions on behalf the Executive Branch are burdening practitioners in the social
service and legal sectors and are further unnecessarily entangling families into indefinite interaction with
both child welfare and criminal justice systems.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, Cook County call on the United States Attorney General
Jeff Sessions to rescind the zero tolerance policy enacted in April 2018 which prosecutes families at the
border and instead adhere to core human rights as stated by the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights in order to allow USCIS to properly review and process asylum cased to
ensure the safety of all children and families within our borders; and

Page 6 of 56

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 27, 2018

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, Cook County calls on the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to retract their Memorandum of
Agreement that allows for the Office for Refugee Resettlement to share data on minors and potential
sponsors with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and keep the work of these agencies separate to
safeguard the basic rights of children and families; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT, The Cook County Board President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners do hereby demand that the Congress of the United States and the Executive
Branch ensure that separation of families and the detention of families at the Southern border is halted and
define a reunification pathway for impacted families.

BOARD AGENDA

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This extension would allow Sentinel Offender services, LLC to continue to provide electronic
monitoring and Global Positioning System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and Juvenile
Probation and Court Services Department for youth and adult clients who are ordered by the court to
wear electronic monitoring devices. Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult
probationers and pretrial defendants in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy
Bischof Law, which calls for the monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS
technology. The law allows the court to order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to be
monitored electronically by the Adult Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail
or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with
orders to stay away from the complaining witness, the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any
other protected address specified. There are currently more than 210 adults under GPS monitoring and
110 victims who carry GPS devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective on 1/1/2015, new
legislation (Public Act 98-1012, 725 ILCS 5/110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to
be considered for GPS monitoring as a condition of bail.

GPS technology is used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor high-risk
youth in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release into the
community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from pre- adjudication
through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings.
This extension will allow the corresponding Request for Proposals process to be completed. The extension
will also provide a brief period of time to begin to transition services to a new provider.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC was originally awarded this contract
based on established evaluation criteria.

Summary:
This first of two (2) one-year renewal will allow the contractor to provide patient care
management services to adult offenders participating in the Circuit Court of Cook County’s adult mental
health treatment courts located geographically in the South (Area 2) covering the George N. Leighton

drug treatment and support to persons charged with felony prostitution. The program helps low level
criminal defendants who suffer from an underlying mental health, social or substance abuse problem from
becoming repeat offenders. The hallmark of the program is intensive judicial supervision and the delivery
of treatment and services from community-based sources, such as TASC which has provided services to
the Circuit Court's Specialty/Treatment Courts Program since 2010.
This contract was awarded through a Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. TASC, Inc. was selected based on established evaluation criteria.

Summary:

This grant would continue funding from the State of Illinois Adult Redeploy Illinois Program,

through the Criminal Justice Information Authority, for the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Access to
Community Treatment Court (ACT) Program. The grant would also provide transition funding for the
Adult Redeploy Illinois (ARI) HOPE Program
The ACT Court is a drug court probation program that operates in the Circuit Court Criminal Division. Its
goal is to help certain nonviolent, felony criminal offenders suffering from substance abuse problems from
becoming repeat offenders and incarceration. The program links participants with behavioral health,
vocational, and educational treatment services from community-based sources. The court closely monitors
participants’ compliance with program protocols and provides encouragement for success through a range
of rewards and sanctions. Incarceration is used as a last resort and for short periods.
The grant will fund treatment and toxicology services for participants not covered by Medicaid health
insurance. Funds will also be used for court staff salaries and payroll fringe benefits, program evaluation,
training, supplies and county indirect costs.

PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County Sheriff’s Office
Grantee: Cook County Sheriff’s Office
Grantor: U.S. Department of Justice
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose:

State and local law enforcement agencies receive equitable sharing funds by participating

jointly with Department of Justice agencies on investigations that lead to the seizures and forfeiture of
property.

Once an investigation is completed and the seized assets are forfeited, the assisting state and

local law enforcement agencies can request a share of the forfeited assets or a percentage of the
proceeds derived from the sale of forfeited assets.

Generally, the degree of a state or local agency’s

direct participation in an investigation determines the amount or percentage of funds shared with the
agency.

Before requesting a share of the seized assets, a state or local law enforcement agency must

first become a member of the DOJ Equitable Sharing Program.

To participate in the program, agencies

sign and submit to DOJ an equitable sharing agreement and certification form.

The agreement must be

renewed annually, and by signing and submitting the agreement, the officials of participating agencies
certify that they will use equitable sharing funds for law enforcement purposes.
Grant Amount: TBD
Grant Period: 12/1/2017 - 11/30/2022
