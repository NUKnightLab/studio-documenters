Next Steps
1. Refine definition of (compatible) “Conservation
Recreation”
2. Use tools to conduct pilot assessments
3. Use tools to assess existing recreation programs,
establish recreation context, help understand
priorities, future direction, and co-funding
opportunities
4. If programs are recommended to be eliminated,
identify stakeholders and develop engagement
process.
5. Continue coordination with the Racial Equity group to
ensure a racial equity lens is applied to this process.
