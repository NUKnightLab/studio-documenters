COOK COUNTY RECOGNIZES SEPTEMBER 27, 2015 AS "PUPPY MILL AWARENESS DAY"
WHEREAS, September 27, 2015 is National Puppy Mill Awareness Day, where the National Puppy Mill
Project and animal advocates around the country will join together to end puppy mills and their cruelty to
animals; and
WHEREAS, pet stores selling live animals, both within the United States and abroad, have traditionally
been a sales outlet for young dogs bred commercially in puppy mills; and
WHEREAS, according to the Humane Society of the United States, it is estimated that 10,000 puppy mills
produce more than 2,400,000 puppies a year in the United States and that nearly all pet store puppies come
from puppy mills; and
WHEREAS, puppy mills are mass-breeding facilities that chum out puppies with an emphasis on profit
over welfare. These mills usually house dogs in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions without adequate
veterinary care, food, water and socialization. Puppy mill dogs do not get to experience treats, toys, exercise
or bas ic grooming; and
WHEREAS, the inhumane conditions in puppy mill facilities lead to health and behavioral issues as well
as congenital and hereditary illness and disease. Puppy mill puppies often arrive in pet stores and their new
homes with various diseases including giardia, parvovirus kennel cough, heartworm and distemper. These
diseases can lead to excessive veterinary costs both upfront and down the line; and

Page 28 of 301

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 9, 2015

WHEREAS, the lack of enforcement resources at local, state and federal levels allow many inhumane
puppy mills to operate with impunity. According to a spokesman from the United States Department of
Agriculture, due to budget constraints, the Illinois Department of Agriculture employs only seven inspectors
that are charged with overseeing more than 1,300 dog dealers, kennel operators and pet shop operators; and
WHEREAS, every year millions of cats and dogs are euthanized in our nation's animal shelters because
there are more pets than there are responsible homes for them. Puppy mills contribute to pet overpopulation
and cause countless animals lifetimes of suffering in squalid wire cages; and
WHEREAS, according to information obtained from the Illinois Department of Agriculture regarding
publicly run animal care and control facilities located within Cook County, in 201 lthese faci lities
impounded 19,442 dogs and cats that were not reclaimed by the owner, and euthanized 6,6 18 of these
animals (roughly 34% of total). In 2012 these facilities impounded 22 ,679 dogs and cats that were not
reclaimed by the owner, and euthanized 8,035 of these animals (rough ly 39% of total); and
WHEREAS, on April 9, 2014 the Cook County Board of Commissioners unanimously passed a
law that limits the retail sale of puppies and kittens in Cook County pet stores to animals
sourced from shelters, humane adoption centers and small-scale breeders; and

WHEREAS, across the country, thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains operate
profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not on the sale of dogs
and cats; many of these stores collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space
and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises; and
WHEREAS, Cook County residents are encouraged to 'adopt and not shop ', because adopting homeless
dogs from shelters and rescues helps put us closer to our goal of making Cook County a no-kill community
and helps put bad breeders out of business.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that September
27, 2015 be recognized as "Puppy Mill Awareness Day" in Cook County.
Approved and adopted this 9th of September 2015.

Page 36 of 301

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 9, 2015

CATEGORIES OUTLINED IN THE UNITED STATES CENSUS DATA COLLECTION
WHEREAS, as of August 25, 2015, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office does not track whether
the deceased individuals on which it keeps records were individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish
origin; and,

WHEREAS, the absence of this detail in the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office poses a significant
problem when it comes to tracking the identities, backgrounds and relevant circumstances of individuals
killed by gun violence in Cook County; and,

WHEREAS, according to data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office, in 2013 the total number
of gunshot homicides was 425; of which 345 were African American victims, meaning 80 were listed as
Caucasian; and,

WHEREAS, the fai lure of the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office to note whether the deceased
victims of gun violence are individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin means that of the 80
Caucasian individuals referenced in the above paragraph, a number of those individuals are in fact
individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin; and,

WHEREAS, the failure of the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office to note whether the deceased
victims of gun violence are individuals of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin creates an incomplete
picture of the nature and the extent of the impact of gun violence; and,
WHEREAS, without a complete picture of the nature and the extent of the impact of gun violence,
including a firm grasp of the ethnic groups and cu ltures most heavily impacted by gun violence,
policymakers at the County level cannot hope to be able to arrive at the necessary policy solutions to
effectively reduce that gun violence; and,

WHEREAS, Latinos make-up 24.7% of the population of Cook County, and 26% of the population of the
City of Chicago; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office has an obligation to record accurate data, which
is respectful to the victims and their families ; and,

WHEREAS, Cook County government, like all units of government, has a responsibi lity to its residents
and taxpayers to do everything possible to preserve life, record data, and allocate resources consistent
with that data to communities highly impacted by gun violence;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of Cook County and the Board of
Commissioners hereby call upon the Cook County Medical Examiner' s Office to modify its reporting of
gunshot homicides to include the classification of victims of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin, consistent
with the categories outlined in the United States Census Data Collection.

A motion was made by Commissioner Boykin, seconded by Commissioner Garcia, that this
Resolution be withdrawn. The motion carried.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
REPLICA FIREARMS AND PAINT PELLET GUN ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 54, Article XII of the
Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
ARTICLE XII. REPLICA FIREARMS AND PAINT PELLET GUNS
Sec. 54-420. Replica guns.
(a) Title. This division shall be known and may be cited as the "Replica Firearms and Paint Pellet
Page 40 of 301

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 9, 2015

Gun Ordinance" of Cook County, Illinois.
(b) Purpose and Policy. Like other major cities across America, the Cook County Government
faces the ongoing challenge of combating the scourge of gun violence in our communities. Many imitation
and replica firearms are manufactured in a manner that makes them nearly indistinguishable from working
firearms ; and imitation and replica firearms pose the greatest threat to mistakes in the use of force by police.
Several foreign manufactured mobile phone cases which have the appearance of 9mm handguns have
recently appeared for sale on several online retail outlets, and the one "Gun Grip Case" features the grip of
an actual gun and trigger guard attached to the housing of a phone cover. When placed in a pocket, this
product is indistinguishable from a working handgun. Law enforcement officials from New York, New
Jersey and Michigan among others have advised people not to purchase or use this product. Numerous
incidents have been reported by law enforcement officers across the country who have mistakenly identified
imitation or replica firearms to be working handguns.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, possess, conceal, use, sell , give away or
otherwise transfer, or to engage in the business of selling or to exhibit for sale, a replica fireann, paint pellet
or paint pellet gun in Cook County, except as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
(d) Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following tenns shall have the following
meanings:

Paint pellet means a pellet or projectile of paint which explodes upon impact.
Paint pellet gun means any fireann, toy firearm or toy in the nature of a firearm which is powered
by compressed gas and which fires paint pellets.
Replica firearm means any device, object or facsimile made of plastic, wood, metal or any other
material, that a person could reasonably perceive as an actual firearm but that is incapable of being fired or
discharged, including, but not limited to mobile phone cases, lighters, and cameras, except that the term
shall not include any replica of an antique firearm. Each such replica firearm shall have as an integral part,
permanently affixed, a blaze orange plug inserted in the barrel of such replica firearm. Such plug shall be
recessed no more than six millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel of such fiream1.
(e) Exceptions. The manufacture, marketing, distribution, sale and possession of replica fireanns
are permitted if the devices are manufactured, marketed, distributed, sold or held solely for subsequent
transportation in intrastate, interstate or foreign commerce. Such devices shall not be displayed to the
general public or sold for other use in the city. The use or possession of a paint pellet or paint pellet gun is
permitted if the use or possession is solely within premises licensed as a public place of amusement; or if
the use or possession is solely for the purpose of transporting the paint pellet or paint pellet gun to or from
those premises by the licensee or agent or employee of the licensee, or by a common carrier, for purposes
of initial delivery, repair or disposal of the paint pellet or paint pellet gun.

(t) Violation. Any person who violates the provisions of this section, upon conviction thereof, shall
be fined not less than $100.00 nor more than $750.00 for each offense. Any such violation may also be
punishable as a misdemeanor by incarceration in a penal institution other than a penitentiary for up to six
months under the procedures set forth in Section 1-2-1 . 1 of the Illinois Municipal Code as amended, and in

firearm , paint pellet or paint pellet gun shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, just two short years ago, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners made
good on the pledge to taxpayers and businesses by repealing the last .25% of the so-called ' Stroger sales
tax '; and
WHEREAS, the decision and votes to cut taxes on everyday items a majority of residents need to help
working families , toothpaste, milk, baby formula and other everyday necessities, was made as a means of
lessening the burden on them and stimulating the economy; and
WHEREAS, the tax rollback fulfilled a pledge we made to businesses that were concerned their
customers would buy goods outside Cook County and as such, not only benefited Cook County shoppers,
but also the retailers that serve them; and
WHEREAS, economic development also benefited as the tax climate is one of the many variables that
businesses consider when deciding where to create jobs; and
WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of the sales tax rollback yielded roughly $440 million in annual
savings for taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, a sales tax is recognized as an inherently regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the
least fortunate among us; and
WHEREAS, the same arguments and reasoning used to gather support and passage of the rollback of the
regressive sales tax are just as valid today as they were then; and
WHEREAS, the recent decision to reinstate the 1% sales tax increase in its entirety restores these same

Page 42 of 301

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNA L OF PROCEEDINGS

September 9, 2015

burdens on Cook County residents, families and businesses that compelled the Board to roll back this tax
in the first place; and
WHEREAS, given that the proposed 2016 budget has yet to be introduced, raising the sales tax was a
premature burdening of our taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes each and every
year into perpetuity; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this action, Cook County consumers and visitors are fac ing a nation-leading
sales tax of between I 0.25 percent and 11 .25 percent. The highest rate, 11.25 percent, would be paid by
consumers in the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority area, which makes up most of the City of
Chicago's core; and
WHEREAS, this access to a massive influx of new taxpayer dollars will only serve to lessen pressure on
the administration of the President and on the Board to continue to seek ways to improve the efficiency,
transparency and operations of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, in order to preserve the impetus and maintain the pressure to continue to reform county
government and reaffirm that there is more that needs to be done, and done soon, this Honorable Body

within the T .I.F. District. Each and all of the four parcels shown above are vacant land (no buildings) and
are tax delinquent.

The Village will file for tax exempt status on each and all of the above listed parcels and hold them with
other exempt parcels within the T .l.F. until such time as appropriate commercial development is
identified and approved. No third party requestors are currently involved in this request and the Village
has no agreements or proposals from any third parties regarding the above shown subject parcels. The
Village Attorney is retained as legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds for the subject parcels and the

Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the "Village") has targeted five locations within the Village for
vacant land redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. ln the interest of utilizing these
properties for said purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and
requests that the Cook County Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for all five properties on
behalf of the Village. This Request Package contains the five (5) PINs which are vacant parcel s of
abandoned land at 857, 837, 817, and 802 Colonial Drive and 896 Valley Stream Drive. The Village has
determined the land to be undevelopable, but acquiring them could help aid in the development of four
parcels nearby (two Village owned parcels on Elmhurst Road and two privately owned parcels at the
west end of Colonial Drive). The land would be used by the Village for storm water management and
parking to increase the financial feasibility of developing the four adjacent parcels that are out of the
flood plain. Acquisition of the parcels will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues of creek
maintenance and public safety (the police regularly have complaints regarding the overgrown lots). In
addition, there is a good possibility of making a connection to a park to the west.
The Village does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request by a developer, organization or
other private party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of purchase or the perfected tax deed
of the above-listed PlNs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village will file for tax exempt status as long
as it retains the PlNs for municipal use, maintaining that status until any tax deed either or both
properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village agrees to submit, to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five years,
or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid
Ordinance. Village of Wheeling will work to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with acquisition of the parcels.

A motion was made by Commissioner Sims, seconded by President Pro Tempore Steele, that this
No Cash Bid Request be referred to the Finance Subcommittee on Tax Delinquency. The motion
carried.

JOB ORDER CONTRACT

Department:

Department of Capital Planning & Policy

Summary: The Department of Capital Planning & Policy, as authorized by the Cook County Chief
Procurement Officer, plans to participate in the Cook County' s Job Order Contract (JOC) program to
complete the two (2) capital projects listed below. JOC is a quantity based procurement process that
allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a
single, competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.

The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perfom1 certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The .JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region. JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any
work performed by the contractor is a contractor markup form the price book. The Gordian Group would
receive 5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The
Gordian Group will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant
with the terms and conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.
The Department of Capital Planning & Policy proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian
Group to share with participating JOC contractors.
Project Descriptions:
Cook County Administrative Building (CCAB) Swing Space - Basement and 9th Floor - A total gut
re-hab for the Law Offices of the Public Defender (LOPD) on the 7th, 8th and 9th floors of the
CCAB-George Leighton Administration Building. The project scope will produce an upgraded
professional work environment that adequately supports the attorneys and staff of 277 full-time
employees and 34 Interns. This project estimated cost is $240,000.00.
Medical Examiners Conference - Project scope includes the renovation of conference room and
technology at 2121 W. Harrison St. The conference room is located in the basement. Fixtures,
equipment, (Audio I Video) in the space are all original to the facility which was completed circa 1983.
Many of these systems are non-functional and obsolete and will be addressed as part of the renovation.

Project Rationale:
Cook County Administrative Building (CCAB) Swing Space - Basement and 9th Floor Construction of a swing space to relocate the Law Office of the Public Defender during construction will
be built out in the second basement of the CCAB. Renovation work is to be coordinated to develop
staging and phasing logistics to allow the Public Defender's Office to remain operational, during
construction activities.
Medical Examiners Conference - Project was initiated to address carpet that had mildew odors due to a
past water infiltration which has since been mitigated . Upon review of the space it was noted that
various systems and components were obsolete and I or non-functional. The Medical Examiner's office
utilizes the conference room for many functions, hosting continuing education for staff monthly, hosting a
yearly seminar for the Illinois Coroners and Medical Examiners Association, and hosting the Cook
County Disaster Response Team training seminars, to name a few. Providing
a
fully
functional
conference room will allow additional opportunities and additional use of the space for daily Quality
Assurance Case reviews, for example.

Agreement period: 10/ 1/2015 - 913012018
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/ A
Agreement Number(s): NI A
Summary/Notes: The County owns the majority of the parcel referred to as the Rosemont Transit Center,
at Des Plaines River Road and the Kennedy Expressway in Rosemont. The CT A has utilized a large portion
of the site for a parking area and customer access and service areas related to the Rosemont CTA Blue Line
Station. The bus area requires improvements in order to improve pedestrian and vehicular areas, and to
accommodate an increase in public transportation demands due to the inauguration of express Pace services
associated with the Jane Addams reconstruction. The County, CTA, Pace and other governmental agencies
have collaborated in developing the plan for these improvements, which will increase the area utilized by
Pace and cause a minor reduction in parking. This agreement memorializes the CTA's agreement to this
reduction in parking and the ongoing rights and responsibilities of the parties. This item is being submitted
simultaneously for approval by the Chicago Transit Authority Board at the next avai lable meeting.

A motion was made by Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Butler, that this
Interagency Agreement be approved. The motion carried.

Summary: In December 2012 , the County issued the Multi-Juri sdictional All Hazards Mitigation Plan
RFP, and Tetra Tech Inc. was awarded a contract based on established evaluation criteria. On 4/1 7/201 3,
the Board of Commissioners approved an agreement w ith Tetra Tech lnc. to develop the Countywide
Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) on behalf of the Department of Homeland Securi ty and Emergency
Management. On 9/ 10/2014, Cook C ounty Board of County Commissioners approved the Cook County
Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. To date, we have an 86% Planning Partner jurisdictional
plan adoption rate. To ensure success, another aspect of the HM P is creating a program to manage the
plan. With proven experience in preparing HMPs and managing planning processes, the Planning Team
elects to enter a new agreement with Tetra Tech, Jnc.
Regional Inventory Central Hub: Tetra Tech initially developed the Regional Jnventory Central Hub
(RIC H) as part of the Chicago Regional Catastrophic Planning Team (RCPT) initiative. To complete the
database application for Cook County, the Tetra Tech team needs funding to manage the final data
upload, database migration, testing, and technical support. These final scope items could not be
accomplished because no host platform for the RICH database was identified during the RCPT's
Logistics Proj ect period of performance.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

A motion was made by Commissioner T obolski, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, that this
Contract Amendment be approved. The motion carried.

Summary: The Cook County Clerk 's Office is requesting an increase to Contract No. 1484-13 877 to
include State-mandated Election Notices (Election, Referendum, and Polling Places), Sample Ballots and
Election Ads (i.e. voter registration, early voting, mai l voting, election day, judge recruitment, etc.) for
the Primary and General Elections in 2016. This contract amendment will satisfy the statutory
requirements set forth in Article 12 of the Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/ 12-1 et seq . The Cook County
Clerk 's Office is required to place notices in a minimum of two newspapers for each suburban
municipality in the election jurisdiction. If multiple vendors are involved, there could be a scenario
where some newspapers in certain muni cipalities have different publication dates. This would result in a
loss of coordination of the notices and possible confusion among the voters. Therefore, it is necessary to
have one source that can publish notices in all election municipalities on the same day. Cook County
Suburban Publishers is the only vendor that can provide the geographical coverage and guarantee that
notices are placed in the correct papers on the same day.
This contract was awarded as a Sole Source procurement pursuant to Section 34-1 39 of the Cook County
Procurement Code.

Total Amount of Transfer: $ 11 , I 08.91
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
Received invoices in the requested amount on August 6, 20 15 that triggered need for infusion of funds.
The account balance was $0 as of June 22, 20 15. At that time, no additional expenditures were
anticipated.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
A smaller than average number of precincts involved in the Consolidated Primary election produced a

County C le rk

Summary: Submitting for approva l c hanges in suburban Cook County precinct boundaries under the
jurisdiction of the Cook County C lerk's Election Department. The Clerk proposes el iminati ng 74 voting
precincts, chang ing the total number from 1,673 to 1,599 . This reduction represents a 4 percent decrease
in voting precincts.
The C lerk's Election Department targeted combining precincts that had low registered voters and shared
a polling place. An analysis of the precincts revealed many that were underutilized by too few voters or
that could be easily combined with other precincts.
Reducing the number of precincts and combining precincts wi ll decrease costs associated with the Judges
of Elections, equipment programming, equipment delivery and polling place rental fees. The precinct
reduction is anticipated to save $ 100,000 per election in even-numbered years. In 201 6, it will result in at
least $200,000 in savings.

A motion was made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, that this
Miscellaneous Item of Business be approved. The motion carried.

accounts listed below.

Page 134 of 301

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

September 9, 2015

Reason: This transfer of funds, which represents less than one-quarter of one percent of our 2015 budget,
should be sufficient to fulfill our obligations for the remainder of the fiscal year for three accounts with
projected shortages. These accounts are: 250-217 Transportation for Specific Activities, where we have
seen higher than anticipated costs for bringing in witnesses from out of state and extraditing prisoners from
other jurisdictions; 250-232 Boarding and Lodging of Witnesses, primarily due to the cost of relocating
and protecting witnesses who are threatened; and 250-268 Court Reporting Services, where expenditures
for court transcripts have been slightly higher than projected.
From Account(s): 250-441 , $40,000.00; 250-445, $ 175,000.00.
T o Account(s):

250-217, $90,000.00; 250-232, $75,000.00; 250-268 , $50,000.00.

Total Amount of Transfer: $215,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On 8/1 , Account 217 had a balance of approximately $25,000; on July 1st the balance was approximately
$105 ,000.
On 7/ 1, Account 232 had a balance of approximately $13,000; on June ! st the bal ance was
approximately $65,000.
On 8/1, Account 268 had a balance of approximately $200,000; on July 1st the balance was
approximately $4 15,000.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
These were the accounts, based on current year to date spending and known obligations, which were
projected as most likely to have remaining balances at year end.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

If the answer to the above question is "none" then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Although spending fluctuates from year to year in many accounts, our original budget requests were
based on our best projections at that time.

RESOLUTION URGING GOVERNOR RAUNER TO SUPPORT ROSELAND
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL BY IMMEDIATELY RELEASING FULL FUNDING AND
SUPPORTING CONTINUED FULL FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET-TO ALLOW THE
INSTITUTION TO CONTINUE PROVIDING VITAL AND LIFE-SAVING SERVICES FOR
THE COMMUNITY
WHEREAS, Roseland Community Hospital has been a life-saving anchor for 90 years, serving a
community that is over 98% African-American and that suffers a poverty rate that is nearly 1.8 times that
of the Jllinois state average-and an extreme poverty rate more than double the state average.
WHEREAS, Roseland Community Hospital is located in a healthcare desert and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services has designated it as serving a medically underserved area/population, and as
a primary care, mental health and dental health professional shortage area.

WHEREAS, should Roseland Conununity Hospital be forced to close due to the current funding crisis,
residents would have to travel five miles to the next closest hospital, Advocate Trinity, and nearly eight
miles to the nearest trauma center, Advocate Christ, putting residents with life-threatening conditions at a
greatly increased risk of death or negative health outcome.

WHEREAS, past funding shortfalls and the current state budget crisis have already decimated vital support
programs in the Roseland community, leaving Roseland Community Hospital as the only institution still
standing from which residents can receive life saving care and support.

WHEREAS, the Rauner administration has chosen to stop payments to Roseland Community Hospital,
including both State and Federal Medicaid funding, despite public appeals by the community and
community advocates that the administration continue these life-saving payments.

WHEREAS, without such payments, Roseland Conununity Hospital is at immediate risk oflayoffs, service
shutdowns and institutional closure.

WHEREAS, despite the intervention of a Federal judge ordering the continued flow of Federal Medicaid
funding the the institution, Roseland Conununity Hospital continues to face the risk of closure, and its
residents an increased risk of death and devastating health outcomes, due to the lack of current state funding
and the threat of funding cuts in the state budget currently being negotiated.

WH EREAS, the refusal of the Rauner administrat ion and the state legislature to seek out progressive
revenue solutions greatly increases the risk that Roseland Community Hosp ital will face conti nued fund ing
shortages in the future.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon
Governor Bruce Rauner to release all necessary fund s to keep Roseland Community Hospital fully fu nded
for the present-and for the Governor and the state legislature to fully fund the hospital in the upcoming
budget through progressive revenue-so that the hospital is able to continue to provide vital services to the
community.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLV ED, that a copy of this resolution be presented to the Secretary of State of
the State of Illinois, the Clerk of the House of the Illinois House of Representatives, and the Secretary of
the Senate of the Illinois Senate.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: In collaboration with the Cook County Offices of the Assessor, Clerk, Treasurer, Board of
Review, and Recorder of Deeds, the Bureau of Technology seeks Board approval of a contract with Tyler
Technologies, Inc. to replace the County's legacy property tax system. The County currently employs
40-year-old technology to manage and implement tax collection across 1,500 taxing districts. The system
incurs more than $5M per year in support costs and depends upon inflexible and disparate legacy systems,
including paper-based validation of system reports. These costs are expected to increase as the IT
industry and future generations of IT professionals abandon the legacy technology upon which the
County's property tax domain currently depends.
The proposed contract will re-engineer business processes and workflows through the implementation of
modem technology and provide myriad benefits, including increased property tax revenue from improved
assessment, appraisal, and collection operations, an improved ability to accommodate property tax
workloads without requiring additional staff, and enhanced public services and responsiveness for County
tax payers.
Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County Procurement
Code. Tyler Technologies, Inc. was recommended based on established evaluation criteria.

A motion was made by President Pro Tempore Steele, seconded by Commissioner Garcia, that this
Contract (Technology) be approved. The motion carried.
Commissioner Fritchey, voted "no".

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A HEARING OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEE
OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS ON ELECTRONIC MONITORING
WHEREAS, Electronic monitoring is a pre-trial program that was created with the objective of relieving
overcrowding in the Cook County Jail. Instead of jail confinement, electronic monitoring provides a
community-based alternative that allows non-violent defendants and short-time sentenced inmates to
remain in the community; and
WHEREAS, since 2014, Cook County judges have ordered a record number of criminal defendants onto
electronic home monitoring; an increase that has significantly helped Cook County reduce jail population
and costs, however, it has also created public safety concerns; and

WHEREAS, specifically amongst the juvenile probation population, Cook County has recently
experienced incidents in which defendants on electronic monitoring have committed violent crimes while
in the community. These incidents have resulted in Cook County Juvenile Probation conducting internal
audits of electronic monitoring staff, policies, and procedures; and
WHEREAS, in consideration of the significant implications on public safety and the criminal justice
system of Cook County, it is imperative to understand how Cook County operates its Electronic
Monitoring Program under the Juvenile Probation Department in order to detennine if comprehensive
changes are necessary to ensure its effectiveness and to increase public safety; and

WHEREAS, it is also vital to understand the measures and policies in place for Cook County to ensure the
safety of the employees that are responsible for the administration and implementation of its juvenile
Electronic Monitoring program; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County President and the Board of Commissioners that the
Law Enforcement Committee of the Cook County Board of Commissioners is authorized to call a subject
matter hearing regarding the operations, staffing, policies, procedures, and public safety implications of
the Cook County Electronic Monitoring Program under the Juvenile Probation Department for Tuesday,
October 6, 2015 at 3:00pm at 118 North Clark Street, Rm 569, Chicago, Illinoi s.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County President and Board of Commissioners
does hereby request a meeting of the Law Enforcement.
