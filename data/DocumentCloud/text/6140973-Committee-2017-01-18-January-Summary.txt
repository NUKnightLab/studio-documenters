In addition to the benefits granted to members and spouses each month, the Secretary will also be
presenting, for informational purposes only, items of interest that may affect our members. Questions
regarding any member’s specific situation should be addressed directly to the Fund Office.
MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM THE FUND SECRETARY

There continues to be some confusion and misinformation among the membership concerning the
implementation of the recent legislation granting a 3% COLA for members born within the 11-year
period from 1955 through 1965. The Pension Board Trustees present at the January meeting
unanimously voted to grant a 3% COLA for those members going forward beginning in January
2017. Additionally, the Trustees unanimously voted to grant a retroactive calculation of the COLA
amount for each full year of retirement for those members that have not yet received a “initial
increase” or COLA benefit. However, based on the language of the legislation, the Trustees voted
unanimously to not retroactively calculate the COLA benefit for those members that have already
started receiving the COLA benefit.
The reasoning for the Trustees unanimously voting to not grant the retroactive calculation for the
approximately 217 members who had already received an “initial increase” in their retirement
annuities is that the new language in the pension code clearly excludes these members from receiving
an additional retroactive benefit. The Trustees had a thorough discussion of what, if any, legislative
intent existed to support interpretation of the law; but barring any clear direction from the Legislature
to clarify and modify the existing law, the Trustees felt they would be neglecting their fiduciary
obligation by enhancing benefits that weren't legally granted by the language of the recent
legislation. The Board struggled with what the intent of the Legislature was, because it did not seem
fair to the Board that the Legislature would exclude members who had already received a benefit
from the retroactive calculation; but that is what the language adopted by the Legislature says. And
the Board can only administer the pension code by what is written, not what we think was intended.
So, to be clear, the Pension Board Trustees did not unanimously vote to deny any members benefits,
they voted to grant the benefits clearly afforded in the pension code. To use the term 'deny' would
imply the benefits were lawfully granted by the pension code, which they clearly are not.
Additionally, I would like to add that the Pension Fund Trustees did not take this matter lightly and
spent a substantial amount of time deliberating the merits of the vote. The Pension Fund Board
Trustees, as a whole, are thoughtful, deliberate and intelligent. The Trustees include an attorney, a
CPA, a Harvard MBA and a current and former Local 2 Executive Board member. There was no
political spin or maneuvering to circumvent our fiduciary obligation, I believe each Trustee feels the
unanimous decision the Board made was straightforward and clear.

 Local 2's Director of Political Action, Dan Fabrizio, did address the Board and asked us to give some
weight to a tape of the legislative committee hearings discussing the legislation. He felt the tape
supported the legislative intent to grant the 3% COLA retroactive calculation to those members that
have already received the benefit. The Board listened to the tape but could not find the legislative
intent that Local 2's Director of Political Action felt was expressed on the tape. After the Pension
Board came to its decision, the Local 2 Director of Political Action provided a letter from a legislator
on the committee that considered the legislation in question. In that letter, the legislator chides the
Board for misinterpreting the legislation. However, the letter is riddled with errors that ironically
leaves the Board further confused as to the intent of the entire Legislature. I cannot speak for the
entire Board, but I believe the path to getting the result advocated by Local 2’s Director of Political
Action adopted by the Board, is for the Legislature to go back and modify the pension code in clear
straightforward language that supports their intent. A simple fix to the legislation would eliminate
any doubt as to what the Legislature intended. If it truly is the Legislature’s intent to provide the
benefit to all members even if they have already received a COLA increase, then they can easily fix
the legislation to reach that goal.
I would like to add that this exact language in the pension code affects the Chicago Police pension
fund members too. The Police Pension Board and its legal counsel interpreted the language exactly
the same as the Firemen's Pension Board did. The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Dean
Angelo, shared your Pension Board's sentiment that applying the pension code literally would be
unfair. The Police Pension Board asked Dean Angelo to work with the legislators responsible for the
legislation to draft communication that expressed the legislative intent of the law. The Police
Pension Board did not indicate if receipt of such communication would be sufficient to change how
they voted to administer the law. However, while I was at the Police pension meeting, the Police
Pension Fund legal counsel stated he would expect the law to be modified to indicate the true
legislative intent. Again, the Police Pension Fund and its lawyers have acted in the same manner as
the FABF Pension Fund and its lawyers.
Also, the independent actuaries that calculated the cost of this additional benefit to both the Police
and Firemen Funds interpreted the language the exact same way as the Fire and Police Pension Funds
did. So, I think those facts support the view that your Pension Board is not interpreting the pension
code in an unreasonable manner. To imply your Pension Board is somehow acting irrationally or
misinterpreting the law, is just not supported by the facts.
As I stated last month, "the Pension Board does not advocate the Legislature for more benefits....that
is the function of Local 2.... The Pension Fund administers the Fund based on the laws the Legislature
in Springfield pass.” Your Pension Board should not be granting benefits with no basis in law,
interjecting such a practice would not be prudent or fair to all pension fund members. In the bigger
picture, I believe engaging in such a cavalier attitude risks eroding the goodwill our members enjoy
in the public eye and erodes confidence in public pensions. It is my opinion that your Board had the
foresight to recognize that although this decision seemed unfair to a few, the decision was in the best
interests of all Fund members by protecting the integrity of how the Fund is administered.
What is most concerning to me is that if the Legislature thought the Pension Board would grant
benefits based upon a mere letter from a single legislator and ignore the clear language of the law as

 currently written, where was the legislative deliberation of the additional costs? In the tape provided
by Dan Fabrizio, there was testimony to members of the Legislature that the cost of this benefit, as
currently written, is $140 million. During testimony, certain legislators expressed concern about the
costs and the current funding level of our Fund. If the Legislature, via a letter from a single
legislator, is now saying the intent was to grant a more generous benefit, where is the legislative
discussion on the true costs? Fund staff has calculated the increased costs of complying with the
proposed legislative intent at approximately $2 million annually. Is the entire Legislature going to
take into account the additional costs of the legislation they intended or is it just going to be one or
two legislators that speak on behalf of the entire Legislature? I think a reasonable person would
anticipate that modifying the law would require additional hearings? In my opinion, it is this type of
end run around transparent policy making that is so frustrating and what may lead to the demise of
our Pension Fund. I ask all members to not ignore how your pensions are funded and administered,
not just for your pension, but for your fellow member's pension.

Please continue to stay safe and look out for one another.
Fraternally,

Timothy McPhillips
Fund Secretary
