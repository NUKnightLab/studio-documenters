The following individuals attended the meeting: Clay Diette, City of Chicago and Joe Healy,
Laborers Local 1092.
Mr. Mohler opened the meeting by discussing issues related to the proposed legislation currently
pending in the legislature. Mr. Mohler stated his concerns with the legislation based on the
proposed funding structure and the subordination clause placing Fund members behind bond
holders with respect to payments from the City of Chicago.
Trustee McMahon inquired of Mr. Diette whether the City had removed the sections of the
proposed legislation regarding the subordination of members rights to bondholders and/or the
“police powers” language. Mr. Diette responded that the City had redrafted the legislation
removing the both clauses, as well as removing changes to the composition of the Board. Mr.
Diette requested that the Board consider withdrawing its opposition slip to SB 2437 based on his
representations that these changes were incorporated into the current draft of SB 2437. Trustee
Guest requested that the Board be able to review SB 2437 prior to its reintroduction. Mr. Diette
said that that would not be possible.
Discussion amongst the Board members, Fund Counsel and staff ensued.
On a motion by Trustee Guest, the Board moved into closed session at 9:35 a.m. in accordance
with 5 ILCS 120/2(c)(11) to discuss issues related to potential litigation. Seconded by Trustee
Johnson.
