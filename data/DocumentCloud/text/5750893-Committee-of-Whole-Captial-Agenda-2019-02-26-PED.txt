RE: Request for the Establishment of Obsolete Property Rehabilitation District at
8646 Kercheval, 1817 Fischer, Detroit, MI 48214 (AMENDED)

Honorable City Council: - 

Please accept this letter as a request to establish an Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
District for the property located at 8646 Kercheval, 1817 Fischer, Detroit, MI 48214
and described on Attachments.

Companv Summart:

Kercheval East LLC is a new company founded by Alex DeCamp and Reimer
Priester, local developers who focus their real eatate development efforts in the Villages.

Alex is a West Village resident who has been a member of the West Village
Association and its board for over four years and on the board of the Villages
Commercial Development Corporation and Jefferson East Inc for one year each. He has
helped in projects such as the community garden, the Villages
Farmer?s Market and the West Village Eco-D efforts. Alex handles the ?nancing,
abatement process and other planning for the company. He sits on the board of
Transportation Riders United which advocates for increased transportation options for
Wayne County residents. Alex holds a master?s degree in urban planning and real estate
development from the University of Michigan.

Reimer has a background in arts fundraising and made the shift to real estate
development full time in 2014. He has since completed the Michigan residential
builde?s license course and has overseen the construction, leasing and management of

six historic developments totaling thirty-seven units in Detroit. His daily site visits are
instrumental in ensuring ef?cient timelines and schedules. Reimer is on the board of and
chairs the development committees for the Detroit Public Schools Foundation and

Michigan Humane Society.

Keroheval East LLC was formed in 2017 to renovate two vacant and obsolete
structures and one vacant lot into a mixed-use development. Other projects include a
historic mixed-use renovation in Midtown, a six unit mixed-use development at 8044
Kercheval, the renovation of three vacant historic duplexes into one six-unit mixed-use
structure, a historic apartment building near Indian Village, and multiple residential

properties in the area.

l?uruusc for Establishment of the District:

In order to offer ?fteen new apartments and four new commercial spaces (3300
SL1 It), Kereheval East must he completely renovated to meet today's building code.
Historic structures like those in this project typically require extraordinary construction
costs to restore elements of the building to their original quality. This project will be
especially costly due to the historic masonry, new construction and the necessary repair
to structural damage. All windows, mechanical systems, kitchens, baths. doors and
hardware will be replaced, repaired or updated. There will also be signi?cant costs to
remove or encapsulate lead?based paint, abate possible asbestos, and to recon?gure the

layout to current designs. The new residential units will be the ?rst of its kind on the
city?s east side.

Once construction is completed, we also anticipate normal operating costs related
to heating, cooling, securing and maintaining a historic structure. The high construction
costs, operating costs normal for historic structures, along with the burden of higher
property taxes would make this project cost prohibitive. Additionally, the higher
property taxes will cause the project costs to jump in such a way that it will be extremely
unattractive for any potential retail tenant. The taxes must be abated in order to matte
the project economically feasibte. Please note this application is out); for tire abatement
of 8646 Kerciievai Ave and 181 7 Fischer Ave, two vacant and obsolete buildings. The
Project includes new build on 1811 Kerclieval but that parcel does not qualify under
the ordinance for abatement.

Bene?ts to the (.?itv and ('mnmunitr:

The redevelopment of Kercheval East will combat community deterioration and
promote revitalization by transforming an underutilized and worn structure into a
destination that adds value to the neighborhood.

Combat Community Deterioration. The project will eliminate the blighting
in?uences found at the project site through the renovation of a vacant and underutilized
building. The building?s current status gives the impression of an unsafe and
economically depressed area which detracts from the vibrancy of East Village. An
occupied building will also improve the actual safety of the area since future residents
will equate to more watchful eyes in the neighborhood to prevent crime. The increased
exterior lighting will also help to reduce theft and vandalism by giving criminals fewer

places to hide.

Promote Community Revitaiizarion in the Area. Kercheval East promotes
community revitalization on three different levels: economic, physical, and social.

1 This project will continue the economic investments being made by
other projects in the area, such as the construction of 8044 Ketcheval, Kercheval
3, Sister Pie, the Bank Building, The Coe, The St. Charles Lofts and future
developments. This project will impact the following:

Income Tax Base. Add to the income tax base of the City of Detroit

New Development. Spur other potential development projects in the area
and increase the taxable value of surrounding properties

0 New Residents. increase the number of residents in the area and thereby
increase the demand for retail, restaurants and other commercial amenities

ull-T ime Jobs. Increase the number of permanent full-time jobs in the
area through the addition of commercial tenants

0 Retail Jobs. Create approximately 24 full time equivalent retail positions
(commercial space)

a Construction Jobs. Generate approximately 30-35 full time equivalent
temporary construction jobs

Ensign]; This project will impact the following:

- Quality apartments. Convert a building from an obsolete state into quality
market mixed-use spaces

0 In?ll. Add new affordable residential units to what was most recently a
vacant and overgrown lot

- Neighborhood Vibrancy. Turn a quiet and unused strip along a
commercially zoned street into a vibrant retail destination

- Set the standard. Set high standards for ?tture developments in terms of
design, construction and historic preservation

Hm; i ll: This project will impact the following:

- Walkability appeal. Appeal to a diverse group of potential residents, by
offering a walkable living location in one of Detroit?s emerging
neighborhoods

0 Population density. This project is consistent with efforts by the Villages
CDC to increase population density and create a more walkable and
pedestrian friendly community

- Alignment with city goals. This project is consistent with long-term
planning efforts by the City of Detroit as indicated by zoning and Detroit
Future City. It will add new residents and commercial locations, eliminate
blight, increase safety and help enhance a tiniving neighborhood

Summary:
The project will bene?t the City of Detroit at various levels.

1) Activates vacant spaces and stimulates energy within the neighborhood. It
activates a vacant and obsolete structure and land on the edge of an active street.
Reactivating this building into a place of residence and business will extend the
lively energy already seen near Van Dyke and attract more visitors to the
surrounding retail.

2) Creates jobs and new residents. The construction ot?the properties will create
approximately thirty full time equivalent temporary construction jobs and the
retail tenants will create approximately twenty-loin l?ul] time equivalent jobs.
There will also be an estimated eighteen new residents in the residential units.

3) Grow retail density, improving safety. This project will bolster other
commercial development along Kercheval adding greater retail density and eyes
on the streets. This increased activity will help make Kercheval a safer place and
therefore encourage residential development and home ownership in the
surrounding area. This is especially important with the blighted and vacant
homes and open land nearby since residential development in that area will
increase overall safety for the neighborhoods.

Taxes on the property are current and abating them for twelve years will allow for this
development to happen. Without the abatement the project is not economically feasible.

I-Lliuihilih-z Kercheval East is classified as functionally obsolete according to the
de?nition in Act 381 of 1996, "the property is unable to be used to adequately perform
the function for which it was intended due to a substantial loss in value." The building is
currently not being utilized to its highest and best use and, as a result, the building is
vacant. The loss in value has resulted primarily from the following items:
- The ?oor plans must be recon?gured for the best and highest use.
- All heating, cooling, plumbing and electrical systems will have to be
replaced due to outdated conditions, stolen components, or being damaged
beyond repair.

RE: Obsolete Property Rehabilitation Certi?cate Kercheval East LLC
Address: 8646 Kercheval Avenue and 1817 Fischer Street
Parcel Numbers: 17000103. and 17006079.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Obsolete Property Rehabilitation
certi?cate application for the property located at 8646 Kercheval and 1817 Fischer located in the East Village district in the City of

Detroit.

The rationale for granting Obsolete Property Rehabilitation certificates under PA 146 of 2000, as amended, is based on the
anticipation of increased market value upon completion of new construction and /or signi?cant rehabilitation of existing commercial
property and commercial housing property. Normal repair and maintenance are not assessed and do not necessarily generate

additional market value.

Kercheval East LLC plans to renovate and also include new construction to two vacant and obsolete structures and one vacant lot
into a mixed-use development in order to offer ?fteen new apartments and four new commercial spaces. The certi?cate
application excludes the vacant lot. The property at 8646 Kercheval is a vacant mixed-use 2 story building that is in a state of
significant disrepair and obsolete built in 1910 with 7,200 square feet of building area on .100 acres of land and 1817 Fischer is a
vacant 4-unit house built in 1922 with 4,320 square feet of building area on .103 acres of land. The proposed renovations include
repair to structural damages, new construction, exterior facade repairs, new windows, mechanical systems, kitchens, baths and
doors, that will be replaced, repaired or updated.

The 2018 values are as follows:

17006079. 1817 Fisher 26,900 6,272 700 408

 

This property meets the criteria set forth under PA 146 of 2000, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and
contaminated properties. "Rehabilitation," meaning that changes to qualified facilities that are required to restore or modify the
property, together with all appurtenances, to an economically efficient condition. The property is part of an initiative to provide
affordable incubate-style shared of?ce space to help the development of startup companies on the east side of Downtown Detroit.

The developer proposes to completely rehabilitate this functionally obsolete property by restoring and rehabilitating the exterior,
repurposing the roof to a rooftop terrace with enclosure and gutting the building to include energy efficient building materials.

FROM: Esther Yang, Planning and Development
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Obsolete Property District at 8646 Kercheval Avenue 1817
Fischer Street
DATE: December 21, 2018
CC: Maurice Cox, Director

In order to ensure that the issuance of a certificate for an Obsolete Property District is in conformance with
the City?s Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to increase commercial activity;
create, retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban area; or increase the number of residents
in a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public Act 146 of 2000 (section 125.2784), the Planning and
Development Department submits the following interpretation. The petitioner for this development is
Kercheval East LLC

Proiect Description:
Renovating two vacant structures and infill development on one vacant lot into a mixed-use development.

The development will include four commercial units (3,300 square feet) and 15 residential units.

Proiect Location: 8646 Kercheval, 1817 Fischer

Interpretation:
The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation for the site is Low/Medium Density Residential. Low/

Medium - Density Residential (RLM) areas should have an overall density of 8 to 16 dwelling units per net
residential acre. The areas are often characterized by two or four family homes with small yards, on-street
parking or garages with alley access.

Although the density exceeds the range for the RLM area, the project includes renovation of an existing
residential and commercial building in proximity to a Secondary Street (Kercheval). As per the commercial
component, most residential classifications allow for neighborhood?scale commercial development.
Furthermore, a comprehensive planning effort has been under taken for the area. The plan includes "near-
term rezoning recommendations? including rezoning the subject area along Kercheval "to support density,
mixed-use development, and retail.? It is anticipated that the Master Plan will be amended to accommodate
development similar to the mixed commercial and residential development proposed for the area. PDD also
anticipates further amendments pending the completion of the comprehensive planning effort for the
surrounding area. The developers and City agencies, with input from area residents, should coordinate
efforts to minimize the development on the Indian Village Historic District immediately to the west.

The Master Plan Future General Land use categories used on all the maps are generalized. Boundaries are not
meant to be precise as to blocks or property lines. Categories are descriptive of general development
recognizing that some intermixtures are permissible or desirable.

The proposed development and rezoning is compatible with the anticipated development and plans for the
Kercheval corridor.

FROM: Council Member Raquel Castaneda?Lopez 
DATE: February 20, 2019

RE: Development Commitments made RE: District Detroit

 

The City of Detroit Downtown Development Authority has entered into multiple agreements with
Olympia Development to allow for the construction of the new sports and entertainment arena
and the surrounding "District Detroit." Through these agreements and during deliberation at City
Council, the developers made a number of commitments to the City and the community. One
notable commitment was the renovation of the historic Hotel within one year of the
opening of the new arena. The arena opened for events in September of 2017 and the 
has not been opened.

I would like to request that LPD produce report outlining an exhaustive list of commitments made
by Olympia Development in conjunction with this development and the current status of each
commitment. In the event of a violation, I would like to request that the Law Department and LPD
opine on the City?s options for recourse.

To the DDA, has the project generated the economic spin-off activity in the surrounding district
that the city and the authority were expecting since the arena began construction? Please provide
a report to support your findings.

Thank you. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our office.
