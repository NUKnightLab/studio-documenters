For Council?s review, the attached schedules present the gaming tax revenue activity through

February 2019 and prior ?scal years.

Through the eighth month of the ?scal year the casinos reported a combined gross gaming
receipts increase of 3.87% compared to the same period in the prior ?scal year. Broken out by
casino, gross receipts are up by 5.38%, Motor City?s are up by 1.69% and Greektown?s
are up by 4.29%, compared with the ?rst eight months of the prior ?scal year.

In the eighth month of the ?scal year, the City collected $13.63 million in gaming tax revenue,
which was 4.06% greater than February 2018, as re?ected in Chart 1. Chart 2 Detroit
Gaming Tax Collections? through a twelve-month moving average trend line shows an increase
of 3.49% since last February among the combined casino tax revenues. Based on existing data,
there is projected to be a surplus of $2.71 million for the ?scal year for a gaming revenue total of

$183.48 million, a 2.52% increase over last year.

Adjusted gross casino gaming receipts were reported at $114.56 million for the month of
February 2019 as shown in Chart 1A. This represented a 4.06% gain compared with February
2018. Chart 2A Detroit Gaming Receipts? through a twelve?month moving average

trend line shows growth of 3.49% among the combined casino receipts.

MGM and Motor City are each paying 12.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the City,
While Greektown Casino is paying 11.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts and is broken out as
follows. By state law, all casinos are now paying 10.9% of adjusted gross gaming receipts to the

labels Jim mu] mm PI) I January 201') doc

City as wagering tax. The casinos also have an additional 1% payment because of the 2002
amended development agreement with the City. Additionally, if a casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year, like MGM and Motor City, then an additional
1% is paid to the City per the amended development agreement of 2002.

There is not a complete one-to?one relationship between the adjusted gross receipts and the tax
revenue collection increases when comparing prior years, due to two factors. First, there is the
fact that MGM and Motor City casinos began paying the City 1% less due to the permanent
casinos opening on October 3 and November 29 of 2007. This reduction to the City is part of
state Public Act 306 of 2004, when the legislature amended Public Act 69 of 1997, which was
the original casino gaming legislation. PA. 306 increased the wagering tax by 6% of which 2%
went to the City of Detroit. P.A. 306 also allowed that when the permanent casino had been
certi?ed by the state gaming board as having operated for 30 consecutive days and once the City
determined the project was complete, 5% of the 6% additional wagering tax would be
eliminated, with the remaining 1% allocated to the City where the casino is being operated.
Greektown continued to pay the 6% additional wagering tax 4% to the state, 2% to the City 
until its permanent status was agreed to by the Administration and approved by the State Gaming
Commission, which occurred on March 9, 2010.

Second, the amended development agreement of August 2002 between the City and the casinos,
which is separate from the state law, has all casinos, beginning in January 2006, paying an
additional 1% over the state law, plus another 1% when the casino reaches $400 million in
adjusted gross gaming receipts in a calendar year. For the thirteenth year, MGM and Motor City
each did exceed $400 million in the calendar year and increased gaming tax collections by
$11.09 million between August and December. MGM reached $400 million in August, a month
earlier than prior years, and Motor City reached $400 million in October similar to last year.
additional 1% totaled $6.19 million and Motor City?s totaled $4.89 million.

Re: Questions for the Detroit Fire Department Budget Hearing

 

1. The Fire Department started providing Firefighters with Emergency Medical training.

Is this training still taking place? If so, for whom and at what expense? Also, what effect
does the training have on the need for EMT services and the EMT budget?

2. Firefighters are required to respond to various emergencies unrelated to firefighting.

Are there funds in the budget to provide emotional/mental supportive services to deal with
the stress associated responding to these emergencies?

3. It been reported that residents transported to medical facilities by private EMT service

providers have been overcharged in the past.

How many and ambulances are need to reduce/eliminate our reliance on private
EMT service providers? Would bringing all the EMT services in-house generate enough
revenue to cover the expenses associated with right-sizing EMT services?

4. Union leadership has spoken out against the use of firefighters to clean up blood and
other bodily fluids at crime and fire scenes.

What training is provided to firefighters to perform these duties and at what cost? What is
the standard operating procedures for such duties in similar major cities?

I: 

The Fire Department?s budget does not show any appropriations for capital projects.
Why aren?t there any appropriations in the threat budget for capital projects? What is the
status of fleets for fire and EMT services? What is the overall condition and need for
upgrades and improvements to the firehouses?
