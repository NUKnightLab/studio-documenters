1 25 West 18th Street and South Sangamon Street; Stop Sign. stopping east and west
bound traffic on West 18th Street at South Sangamon Street. Not Recommended.
West 18th Street is a collector roadway with higher volumes than South Sangamon
Street, a local street. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as 18th Street
tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a false sense of
security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Additionally, stop compliance is
particularly low at T-intersections. Stop Sign. Not Recommended. CDOT does not
recommend a stop sign stopping traf?c on 18th Street -- (18?01130503) [Or2018-133]

2 25 West Jackson Boulevard and South Sangamon Street; Stop Sign, Stopping east and
west bound traf?c on West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. West
Jackson Boulevard is a major collector roadway with signi?cantly higher traf?c volumes
than South Sangamon Street a local roadway. Stop signs on streets with
higher volumes such as West 47th Street tend to inerease rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Additionally, the 25th Ward has recently funded two curb extensions on the west
leg of West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. These bump-outs should
improve pedestrian safety by narrowing the crossing distance across West Jackson
Boulevard. Not Recommended. CDOT does not recommend an All Way stop at this
location. The funded curb extensions at this intersection will improve pedestrian
visibility and safety (1&01131073) [Or2018?134]

West Jackson Boulevard and South Sangamon Street; Stop Sign, Stopping east and
west bound traffic on West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. West
Jackson Boulevard is a major collector roadway with signi?cantly higher traffic volumes
than South Sangamon Street a local roadway. Stop signs on streets with

higher volumes such as West 47th Street tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase
congestion, and create a false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will
stop. Additionally, the 25th Ward has recently funded two curb extensions on the west
leg of West Jackson Boulevard at South Sangamon Street. These bump-outs should
improve pedestrian safety by narrowing the crossing distance across West Jackson
Boulevard. Not Recommended. CDOT does not recommend an All Way stop at this
location. The funded curb extensions at this intersection will improve pedestrian
visibility and safety (18-01131073) [Or2018-134]
