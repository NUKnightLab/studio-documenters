PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION URGING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO ENACT A MORATORIUM ON IVORY
SALES
WHEREAS, Increasing demand for ivory is fueling the brutal slaughter of African elephants; and
WHEREAS, Illegal trade in elephant ivory is the most significant threat to Africa’s elephant populations and is
driving the mass slaughter of elephants, especially across Central and Eastern Africa; and
WHEREAS, Approximately 35,000 wild African elephants were poached in 2012 because of the demand for their
tusks, which contain ivory; and
WHEREAS, The wild African elephant population has declined from 1.2 million in 1980 to just 420,000 in 2012,
and Central Africa’s forest elephant populations have declined by 75% in the last decade due to illegal poaching for
ivory; and
WHEREAS, Elephant ivory currently sells for about $3,000 per kilogram, representing a value of $20,000 per
elephant; and
WHEREAS, With an estimated value between $10 billion and $20 billion per year, the illegal wildlife trade is a
major trans-national crime run by professional criminal networks and is strongly linked to other trans-national
organized criminal activities such as narcotics, weapons, and human-trafficking; and

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 20, 2014

WHEREAS, There is significant evidence that illegal trade in high-value wildlife parts, including elephant ivory, is
being used as a source for financing criminal organizations and armed groups that pose a threat to U.S. economic
and security interests in Africa and elsewhere, including the Lord’s Resistance Army, al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda,
Sudanese militias, and other groups with potential terrorist ties; and
WHEREAS, The State Department of the United States has provided that criminal organizations’ involvement in
wildlife trafficking “perpetuates corruption, threatens the rule of law and border security in fragile regions, and
destabilizes communities that depend on wildlife for biodiversity and eco-tourism”; and
WHEREAS, In 1989, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned the
international commercial trade in ivory; and
WHEREAS, In the United States, the import, export, interstate trade, and commercial sale of ivory removed from
the wild after the CITES ban (and in some cases even earlier) is illegal, with a few exceptions; and
WHEREAS, In many cases, documented ivory predating the 1989 ban (called “pre-convention” ivory) can be
traded. However, laws vary by state and by species; and
WHEREAS, A major challenge to effective enforcement is that parallel legal ivory markets serve as a cover for
illegal ivory from recently killed elephants as it is extremely difficult to distinguish between legal ivory, including
antiques and illegal ivory, once it is within our borders, therefore parallel legal ivory markets are contributing to the
elephant poaching across Africa; and
WHEREAS, With limited enforcement, minimum penalties in addition to elaborate forgery schemes, traffickers
are able to get illegal ivory into the U.S. market; and
WHEREAS, As long as demand for ivory remains high and enforcement effort is low, the legal trade will continue
to serve as a front and criminal syndicates will continue to drive elephant poaching across Africa, which will lead to
the extinction of wild elephants in Africa; and
WHEREAS, The United States is the world’s second largest importer and market after China for ivory sales, and
because current laws allow for the legal trade in certain ivory products, and include broad loopholes and
exemptions, there is significant illegal trade in ivory in the United States; and
WHEREAS, As the United States reaches out to China, the world’s largest ivory consumer nation, and other
countries to crack down on the illegal ivory trade it is important for the United States and for the State of Illinois to
stop the trade within our own borders and lead by example; and
WHEREAS, States have an opportunity to lead the way during this critical time for Africa’s elephants by
establishing moratoria on the sale of all elephant ivory and ivory products; and
WHEREAS, States can eliminate the significant enforce-ment challenge posed by the legal ivory trade, raise
consumer awareness, reduce poaching pressures on elephants, and set a criti-cal example for other state and federal
lawmakers as well as other countries; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Zoological Society, which manages the Brookfield Zoo, the Lincoln Park Zoo and
Shedd Aquarium are three Illinois-based organizations accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums that
operate significant wildlife conservation programs locally and around the world; and

Page 3 of 16

BOARD AGENDA

May 20, 2014

WHEREAS, Chicago Zoological Society, Lincoln Park Zoo, and Shedd Aquarium are partnering with the Wildlife
Conservation Society, an international conservation organization that has launched “96 Elephants” a campaign
named for the number of elephants killed each day in 2012 by poachers to raise awareness about the alarming rate at
which wild African elephants are being poached because of the demand for ivory; to generate action in support of
elephants and raise consumer awareness; and to encourage state and federal lawmakers to eliminate the significant
enforce-ment challenge posed by the legal ivory trade;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That, I, Toni Preckwinkle, along with the members of the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County Board of Commissioners and on behalf of all citizens of Cook County, do hereby urge the
Illinois General Assembly to enact a moratorium on all ivory sales and applaud the Chicago Zoological Society,
Lincoln Park Zoo, and Shedd Aquarium for raising awareness of the plight of African elephants; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this resolution be tendered to Dr. Stuart Strahl, President
and CEO of the Chicago Zoological Society and Director of the Brookfield Zoo; to Dr. Kevin Bell, President and
CEO of Lincoln Park Zoo; and to Ted A. Beattie, President and CEO of Shedd Aquarium in recognition of their
support of a U.S. moratorium on illegal ivory, bolstering protection of African elephants, and educating the public
about the link between ivory consumption and the elephant poaching crisis.

BOARD AGENDA

May 20, 2014

Summary: The original language approved on 1/14/2014, requested authority to enter into and execute
contracts with specified contractors under Cook County’s Job Order Contracting (JOC) Program. The original
language required all projects of $25,000 or more to go through a second round bidding process, except for
projects approved on an emergency basis. District staff is now seeking to amend the original language contained
in the board item “Summary” section to remove the required second round bidding process. This amendment will
expedite procurement of time-sensitive construction projects. The amended “Summary” section will read as
follows:
“On 3/11/2013, the Cook County Board approved contracts with the contractors listed above under its Job Order
Contracting (“JOC”) Program following a competitive bid process (RFQ 12-28-340). The District is seeking to
procure similar construction services in certain cases to expedite projects under its capital improvement programs,
pursuant to Section 1-8-2(X) of the District Code. Section 1-8-2(X) states: “If a governmental agency has awarded
a contract through a competitive method for the same or similar supplies, equipment, goods or services as that
sought by the District, the Procurement may be made from that vendor at a price or rate at least as favorable as
that obtained by that government agency without utilizing a competitive procurement method set forth in the
Procurement Code.”
JOC is a quantity-based procurement process that allows facility owners to complete a multitude of repair and
maintenance and construction projects with a single, competitively bid contract. The District plans to use JOC
contractors in the following instances: 1) the District receives unacceptable bids through the traditional bidding
process, 2) time is of the essence, and/or 3) the project is straight-forward job that is especially suited to
catalogue-based unit pricing. JOC contractors will be selected for District projects by either: 1) identifying
projects for such selected contractors, or 2) conducting a second round bidding process whereby certain select
JOC contractors bid on projects in competition with each other and (from time to time ) non-JOC
contractors.
All projects for $25,000 or more will go through the aforementioned second round bidding process, except for
projects procured on an emergency basis.
The District contracts will incorporate the same terms as the County’s existing JOC contracts and will include a
few additional terms, conditions and instructions to contractors reflecting the unique work desired by the District.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group, for which they are
compensated by the successful bidder. The Gordian Group established and maintains an area price book for
Cook County, which is utilized by Cook County Government and captures the prices for specific construction
work items within this region. Tis price book also will be utilized by JOC contractors for work procured by the
District.”

PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (the “Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to the Village of Winnetka, Illinois, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain 9-foot by
5-foot concrete box culvert under Tower Road to the Tower Road Lagoon (south of Tower Road, east of
Forestway Drive). The new culvert will replace an existing 36-inch storm sewer at the same location, which
severely restricts flow going into the pond. The installation will allow fuller utilization of the design capacity of the
existing lagoon. As part of this project, the Village will stabilize the lagoon banks with 3:1 slopes, emergent
plants and wet prairie plants, and restore the encroachment area with low profile grasses. A few low value trees
impacted by this project will be replaced with new trees within the restoration area. The Village will manage the
restoration area for 5 years to establish the new plantings. No increase in size or other changes to the lagoon are
proposed.
