REPORT
Department: Department of Budget and Management Services
Report Title: 2017 Performance Based Management and Budgeting Annual Report
Report Period: 12/1/2015 - 11/30/2016
Summary: This report is to comply with the amendments to Article X of the Cook County Code
(PERFORMANCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING), approved by the Cook County Board
of
Commissioners on June 29, 2016. The purpose of the amendments was to enhance the effectiveness of the annual
budget process by establishing administrative units called “programs.” Amendments to Article X also created a
new process for the submission of performance data.
“Programs” were identified for the purpose of being the primary building blocks of an agency’s or department’s
budget request, making it possible to distinguish assigned employees and costs (i.e. inputs), and the resulting
program performance metrics, i.e. outputs, outcomes, and efficiency.

 Performance data submission was to take the form of an Annual Report, with submittals being due within 45 days
of fiscal year end, by each County Department and Agency, and as part of its annual Budget Request, as described
in Section 2-933. The President or his or her designee, the Budget Director, is to prepare a summary report of these
values to be presented to the Board at a Board meeting to occur no later than the Month of March. This report is
submitted for said purpose.
