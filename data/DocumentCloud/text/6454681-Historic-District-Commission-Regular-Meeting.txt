PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: DEMOLISH EXISTING SUN PORCH, CONSTRUCT NEW PORCH
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 2085 Atkinson Street is a 2 ½-story single-family residence constructed in 1924. The structure
is clad in variegated red brick and features cast stone details as well as stucco and decorative half-timbering in the
roof gables. The massing of the house is L-shaped with the front entrance located at the intersection of the two wings.
The original wood double hung windows are remaining. The multi-gabled roof is covered in what appears to be clay
tile. Situated on the southeast corner of Atkinson Street and 14th street, the front, side, and rear yards are all visible
from the right-of-way. The rear of the structure currently includes an enclosed addition at the west side of the rear
elevation and a two-story porch structure at the east side of the elevation. The rear yard is enclosed with a chain link
fence.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to demolish the existing addition and
covered porch at the rear elevation and erect a new porch across the rear elevation per the attached drawings
and application. Included in the proposal are the following scope items:
• Demolish existing addition in its entirety. Existing exterior windows and door at the rear brick wall of the
house are to remain.
• Demolish existing two-story porch structure in its entirety
• Construct new 8’ deep raised wood porch (1’-9” above grade) across entire rear elevation including:
o New two-story portion in the same location as the existing two-story porch structure
o New 15’W pergola structure over the portion of deck where the secondary door is located (west end of
elevation)
o 42” guardrails around second-story platform as well as around the perimeter of the proposed raised
deck
o (3) new steps at the east end of the elevation to navigate from the raised porch down to grade and the
existing sidewalk
o All wood to be stained a natural color to match the proposed replacement fence and complement the
existing brick and green roof of the house

 •

Replace existing chain link fence around the rear yard with a new 6’ tall treated natural pine wood fence with
column caps at each post. Fence is proposed to be painted white.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The rear of the house is visible from the right-of-way
• The rear structures proposed for demolition are not historically significant features of the property
ISSUES
• The proposed finish for the porch (natural stain) is different than the proposed finish for the fence
(painted white)
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, retains and preserves the historic character of the building, its site, and
setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness as the proposed work
meets the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
However, staff recommends that the Commission issue this Certificate of Appropriateness with the following
conditions:
• The porch be painted rather than stained. Paint color to complement the house.

 Sec. 21-2-139. - Atkinson Avenue Historic District.
(a)

An historic district to be known as the Atkinson Avenue Historic District is hereby established
in accordance with the provisions of this article.

(b)

This historic district designation is hereby certified as being consistent with the Detroit
Master Plan of Policies.

(c)

The boundaries of the Atkinson Avenue Historic District, as shown on the map on file in the
Office of the City Clerk, are as follows:

On the north, the alley between Atkinson and Edison; on the east, the center line of the John C.
Lodge service drive; on the south, the alley between Atkinson and Clairmount; and on the west, the
center line of Linwood. (These boundaries include Lots 561 to 682, Joy Farm Sub (L32/P39 and 40); Lots
1—16, Lewis Park Sub (L30/P96); Lots 1—16, Jackson Park Sub (L30/P95); Lots 1—72, Boston Boulevard
Sub (L29/P23); and Lots 1—16, Guerold's Sub (L29/P87).)
(d)

The elements of design, as defined in Section 21-2-2 of this Code, shall be as follows:
(1)

Height. Virtually all the houses in the district have two full stories plus an attic or
finished third floor within the roof; these are generally called "two-and-a-half" story
houses. Some two-story two-flat buildings on the 1600 block of Atkinson between
Woodrow Wilson and Rosa Parks Boulevard are slightly taller in height than the singlefamily residences. The commercial row on Rosa Parks is two stories tall with a flat roof;
the church building on Rosa Parks is also two stories in height.

(2)

Proportion of buildings' front façades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on
age, style, and location within a specific subdivision. Most houses are slightly wider than
tall or as wide as tall, excluding the roof. Exceptions occur primarily on corner lots
where the houses that face the north-south street are wider than tall. The commercial
row on the southeast corner of Rosa Parks is wider than tall.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the façades. Window openings are almost always taller
than wide; several windows are sometimes grouped into combinations wider than tall.
Window openings are always subdivided, the most common window type being doublehung sash, whose area is sometimes further subdivided by muntins. Façades have
approximately 15 to 35 percent of their area glazed. Dormer windows exist in a variety
of shapes and sizes.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front façades. In buildings derived from Classical traditions,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the
façades. In examples of other styles, particularly those of English Medieval inspiration,
voids are arranged with more freedom but usually result in balanced compositions.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on street. The spacing of buildings on Atkinson Avenue
is generally determined by the setback from the side lot lines. There is little variance in

 the size of lots on Atkinson between the Lodge Freeway Service Drive and Linwood; lots
average 35 to 40 feet wide. Most buildings are centered on their lots and are at least
four feet from the side lot lines as required by subdivision restrictions, with little or no
side yards. Many properties have narrow driveways along the side lot line.
(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Most buildings in the district have
entrance and/or porch projections facing the street, creating a rhythm where they exist
in numbers. In those buildings of classical inspiration, porches and entrances tend to be
centered on the front façades. Other stylistic examples display more freedom in
entrance and front-porch placement. A few houses have front porches extending to the
sides of the building; some houses have their major entrances on the side of the
building. The multi-unit buildings between Woodrow Wilson and Rosa Parks Boulevard
frequently have second-story porches above the first-story porches. Many porches,
particularly those in the western half of the district have metal or cloth awnings.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The major building materials in the district are brick and
stucco, sometimes used in combination, wooden functional trim and window frames
and sash are common, and wood is used in many examples as decorative trim as well.
Wood sheathing is occasionally used on the attic story and/or dormers. Stone is
occasionally used as a material for window sills, porch trim, and other functional trim.
Rough-cut stone is the main material used on a rustic porch in the district. Roofing
materials include asphalt shingles, slate, and Mediterranean tiles, asphalt shingles being
by far the primary roofing material in the district.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that
of low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of
wood or stone trim. Stuccoed surfaces contrast with brick when used in combination
and with wood or stone trim. Half-timbering on Neo-Tudor buildings creates textural
interest. Tile and slate roofs have particular textural interest where they exist, whereas
asphalt shingles generally do not.

(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate on
wall surfaces. Where stucco and concrete exists, it is usually left in its natural state or
painted in a shade of cream. Asphalt-shingled roofs are predominantly in natural colors
(tile and slate colors), and in appropriate lighter colors. Paint colors often relate to style;
the Classically-inspired buildings generally have woodwork painted in the white and
cream range. Doors and shutters feature an array of colors, usually harmonizing with
the main body of the house. Colors known to have been in use on buildings of this type
in the 18th Century or early 19th Century on similar buildings may be considered for
suitability. Buildings of Medieval or Craftsman inspiration generally have painted
woodwork and window frames of dark brown, cream, or other natural tones. Original

 color schemes for any given building may be determined by professional paint analysis
and, when so determined, are always appropriate for that building and may provide
suggestion for similar houses.
(10)

Relationship of architectural detail. These generally relate to style; Neo-Georgian and
Colonial Revival buildings display classical details, mostly in wood. Areas commonly, but
not always, treated are porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer
windows. Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings include arched
windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of Medieval inspiration tend to have
details in the form of half-timbering and leaded windows. In general, the various houses
on Atkinson Avenue range from scarce to rich in architectural detail.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist in the district, often relating
to style. Hipped roofs with dormers and pitched roofs with either frontal or side-facing
gables predominate. Flat roofs are present only as subsidiary roofs on residential
structures and on the commercial row at the southeast corner of Rosa Parks at
Atkinson.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings with their
uniform setbacks within blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of
continuity. Where rows of trees have survived in sufficient numbers or new trees are
planted in rows, minor walls of continuity are created.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical
treatment of individual properties is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass
turf, subdivided by a walk, usually straight but sometimes curving, leading from the
curb to the steps of the front entrance. There is sometimes a sidewalk beginning at the
public sidewalk leading to the rear when a driveway does not exist. Materials for such
walks are primarily concrete. Plantings of a deciduous character are also present.
Hedges between properties are occasional; few extend along the side yard to the front
lot line. The most prominent type of fences in the district are the chain-linked fence and
wire mesh with wooden posts. Fences extending to the front yard are rare; most back
yards are fenced. Some large American elm trees remain on the tree lawns in the
district, although they are virtually extinct. Replacement trees should be characteristic
of the era and period in which the houses were built (1915-1930); if elm, only a disease
resistant cultivar would be a practical choice. Many straight side driveways from the
street to the rear yard are present; a common treatment of the surface of the driveway
is two concrete strips with grass in between or all concrete. On corner lots, garages and
driveways face the side streets. Tree lawns along Atkinson are uniformly wide, about
eight feet. Street pavements are asphalt; curbs are concrete. Alleys are also paved in
concrete. Lighting poles on Atkinson are of the wood telephone pole variety.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form

 of a small amount of vacant land between a few houses due to housing demolition. A
City playground on the southwest corner of Atkinson and Rosa Parks Boulevard and an
empty parcel on the northeast corner of Rosa Parks Boulevard and Atkinson Avenue are
present. The John C. Lodge Freeway on the east end of the district is depressed and not
visible although it results in a strong boundary to the neighborhood. All houses have
rear yards as well as front yards.
(15)

Scale of façades and façade elements. The scale of houses remains fairly constant
throughout Atkinson Avenue due to the consistency of the lot sizes. Houses are modest
in scale; houses facing the north-south streets appear more substantial in character.
The size and complexity of façade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the
scale of the façades. Façade elements have been determined by what is appropriate for
the style. Window sashes are usually subdivided by the muntins or leaded glass, which
effects the apparent scale of the windows within the façades.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. The expression of direction on residential
blocks is generally neutral, although individual houses, particularly those on corner lots,
may emphasize horizontality or verticality according to style. Some two-flat buildings on
Atkinson between Woodrow Wilson and Rosa Parks Boulevard are slightly vertical in
expression.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Setbacks from front-lot lines are fairly consistent
throughout the district. The varying designs of the buildings, frequently with projecting
porches of different designs, cause the buildings to relate to the front setback line in
different ways; this creates a light variation in setback appearance. Corner houses
facing the north-south streets are set back approximately 20 feet from the north-south
street.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverages. Lot coverage averages approximately 20 to 30 percent in
the district.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the façade. The degree of complexity has been determined
by what is typical and appropriate for a given style. The classically-inspired buildings
usually have simple, rectangular façades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other
styles, such as those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have façades complicated by
gables, bays, and slight setbacks. In general, the houses in the district are of varying
complexity.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances
oriented towards Atkinson Avenue. Houses on LaSalle Boulevard at Atkinson face
LaSalle. At 14th and Atkinson, the house on the southeast corner faces towards the
corner and the house on the northeast corner is oriented towards Atkinson. Garages

 are frequently oriented towards the alley and the front drive, or side street in the case
of corner lots where driveways exist. Almost all garages are detached and at the rear of
the lot. A few houses have side or corner entrances as their major entrance.
(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Classically-inspired buildings are generally
symmetrical. Other styles, including the Neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetric but result
in balanced compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. Atkinson Avenue, from the John C. Lodge Freeway
Service Drive to Linwood, with its long straight street, wide tree lawns, and moderate
size single-family and two four-family homes, has an urban, substantial low-density
residential character.
