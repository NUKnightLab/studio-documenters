 Press Ganey Surveys
Reasons for low response rates?
Many variables impact so virtually impossible to be definitive.
• Written reminder to “please” fill out survey/we want your feedback” if you get one on depart/discharge forms
• Repeat message verbally by every staff person at the care transition
• Include messaging in routine follow-up phone calls post-depart/discharge
• Posters/other displays/rounding mentioning the surveys

Feedback from Press Ganey on specifics
• No external research on response-rates for safety-net or low-literacy organizations that does not violate proper survey
communication in some way

• Safety net organizations might experience greater language barriers and health literacy issues that prevent response, but
this is only an inference and there is no definitive cause and effect data.
• Lower scores tend to result in lower response rates, again an inference.
• The PG research team is also doing analysis related to return rates for different survey modes and looking at other variables
like race and language. No conclusions have been made.

 ACHN: Representative Comments
Voice of the Patient

 Trying to reach the clinic is very difficult since one of their phone numbers doesn’t work and they
don’t pick up.
 Had to schedule the appointment 3 months in advance; our previous appointment was not placed in
the system after we called and told we had it.
 Always a good experience with my doctor. He is thorough and understanding.
 Because I don’t know how to speak English, they do not treat me well and it is difficult to make
appointments.
 It’s like watching a family/community in action. I enjoy coming to the office.
 During my last appointment, I waited in line to check-in for 45 minutes and then was told I was
already checked as a “no show”.
 The times I have had an appointment they have attended to me very well

 Provident Hospital – Representative Comments
Voice of the Patient
8 West Med/Surg unit
•

Nurses were very professional (1 comment out of 5 processed)

•

I experienced one error regarding the IV (1 of 5)

• The doctor that discharged me was extraordinarily kind. I do not speak English so he took me to the
pharmacy and helped me process my order.
Emergency Department

•

Triage took too long after waiting 3 hours (1 of 6)

•

The doctor didn’t want to listen to me; just wanted to give me his own input. I haven’t heard
test results for 3 weeks (1 of 4)

•

Provident Hospital is a very good community hospital. I have nothing but it's all aces in my
book. I recommend to anyone and to anybody. There's a caring staff, caring check in staff. The
doctors are concerned. The emergency room is very efficient and to the point.

 What Are We Trying to Accomplish?
Current HCAHPs scores for Stroger Hospital are well below
the national average. We hope to improve these by specifically
targeting changes in routine activities that effect our
HCAHPs scores in areas of communication, cleanliness, and
patient assistance.

18

 Project Description
Improving as a Place of Caring
We will focus on improving areas related to Caring For The Patient
• Communicating about side effects of medicines patients may
never have taken
• Keeping the care areas clean and quiet
• Responding to our patients’ needs in a timely fashion

19

 AIM Statement
Within one year, we will increase our HCAHPs scores
to be on par with national averages in eight measures
(Recommend, COMP 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, Quiet and Clean,
through Quick Test of Change Projects on the
Med/Surg floors, ER, Units, 4 Flex and Post Partum).

20

 Expected Outcomes
We expect that improvement as a Place of Caring will lead to
a greater patient satisfaction and create an improved work
environment for our employees. As an organization this
should improve our patient volumes and reduce employee
turnover. This should also lead to improved HCAHPs scores.
