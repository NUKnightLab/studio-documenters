Energy Center to generate steam and chilled water for DTE Energy’s
headquarters’ buildings on at 90,500 square foot lot in a 50,923 square foot

PROPOSAL:

Spectrum Neon/John Haddad requests permission to establish a Business
Identification Sign internally lit BY seeking waivers from developmental
standards, use regulations and dimensional variances for a sign with electronic
message board display. Per Sec. 61-6-12, Electronic Message Board signs are
considered flashing signs and not permissible within this Traditional Main Street
Overlay District (all zoning lots abutting Woodward Avenue between the center
line of Temple Avenue/Alfred Street and the city limits of Highland Park) in a B5
zone (Major Business District). This case is appealed because electronic message
boards are not allowed to cover more than 25% of the sign face area and are
considered flashing signs. In the Traditional Main Street Overlay area, animated
signs with flashing or moving lights are prohibited. However, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may modify this developmental standard specified in this article (Article
XIV of this Chapter; Traditional Main Street Overlay Area) and after a public
hearing, a variance may be granted by the Board based on the approval criteria
of Section 61-4-81 of this Code in this instance. Also, excessive sign height may
be waived by the Board under Section 61-6-38 of this Code. (Sections 61-6-10
Electronic Message Boards, 61-6-7 Business Sign, 61-14-300(13) Illumination of
Signs in TMSO area, 61-6-14 Identification Sign, 61-4-92(2) and 61-4-81 Approval
Criteria).AP

Ali Zeineddine request to change a nonconforming (current legal use of 12730
Joy Road a Motor Vehicle Car Wash, by permit number 95834, issued January 16,
2007 while the current legal use of 12726, 12734 and 12738 Joy Rd. is vacant land)
to a nonconforming Major Motor Vehicle Repair Facility in a 1,400 square foot
building established via rezoning (BSEED Case No. 133-17) to B2 Zone (Local
Business and Residential District) in a B4 Zone (General Business District). This
case is appealed because a non-conforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use only where reviewed and approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals in accordance with the procedures that are specified in Section 61-2-46
of this Code and the Board of Zoning Appeals may approve such change of use
only where the Body determines that the new proposed use will be less injurious
to the surrounding area than the previous nonconforming use. (Sections 61-1520 Change of Use to Other Nonconforming Use, 61-15-17 Required Findings).AP
