 a. Review and Approval of August 24, 2017 Health Benefits Committee
Recommendations
Jane Hawes, Senior Manager of Health Benefits, stated that the Health Benefits
Committee met on August 24, 2017, and reviewed the 2018 expected plan expenses
and made a recommendation to the Board about the contributions that would be due
from the members and the Fund for health benefits. Ms. Hawes reported that the
plan’s 2018 expenses are expected to be a 6.4% increase over the 2017 projected
expenses. The 2018 projected increase includes medical and pharmacy trends; reflects
actual plan experience through June 30, 2017, and also includes additional savings
estimates from the implementation of the EGWP program. Pharmacy expense
projections made last year for 2017 were based on RDS subsidies only and did not
include the additional impact of EGWP savings.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee DeGraff that the Board
approve the recommendation made by the Health Benefits Committee at their
meeting on August 24, 2017 to change the 2018 subsidy to 50% for annuitants and
65% for survivors for the Choice Plan Medicare, the Choice Plan Non-Medicare and
for the ChoicePlus Plan with Medicare.

account into a lower cost vehicle as part of Callan’s Domestic Equity Structure
Review. This move would save the County Fund approximately $408,000 in annual
management fees. Ms. Hackett also informed the board that the security lending
search performed by Callan could not be applied in accordance with the contract and
not be waived.

5. Presentation of Linea Solutions – Operational Needs Assessment
Stephen James, of Linea Solutions, presented a summary of the operational needs assessment
that was made of the Fund’s pension administration system, PBMS. He said that PBMS,
which was developed and currently maintained by Novitas, is loosely integrated with other
platforms, particularly MS Office suite products. Mr. James stated that while the data
appears to be well preserved on the current technology, manual interventions by Fund staff
are required for most processes. The reliance of PBMS on key personnel and the
obsolescence of its technology, which is not likely to accommodate statutory reform, are
serious limitations for its future use.
The limitations of PBMS could be resolved by pursuing one of four options: 1) to further
modify PBMS, 2) to develop a fully customized PAS, 3) to customize certain ‘off the shelf’
solutions (“COTS”) or 4) to develop framework phased components for specific PBMS
solutions. He stated that a COTS solution would likely be the most efficient and economic
approach for the Fund. The Board discussed the assessment made by Linnea and how the
various presented solutions would impact Fund operations.
6. Review and Approval of 70 West Relocation Vendor
Nickol Hackett presented a summary of the status of the communications and technology
infrastructure in preparation for the relocation to 70 W. Madison. She explained that the
Fund’s current infrastructure and equipment has reached end of life status and cannot be
supported in a cost effective way. Current infrastructure is inflexible and cannot support a
5

 growing service base and is too slow for operations performed as well as approaching
obsolesce for VOIP communication upgrades being performed. Additional recommendations
would be revisited at the October 2017 board meeting relating to movers, firewall, and
enterprise-wide Wi-Fi solution.
It was moved by Trustee Kouruklis and seconded by Trustee DeGraff that the Board approve
the recommendation to purchase hardware, support and services from CDW to provide
network flexibility and additional storage space and engage them to facilitate network
upgrades in compliance with County and building standards at an estimated cost of $151,916.

7. Legal Matters
a. Office #172971 Felony Conviction
Brent Lewandowski, Senior Benefits Manager reported to the Board about the
member identified by Office #172971, who pled guilty to charges of official
misconduct in violation of 720 ILCS 5/33-3(b) and theft, in violation of 720 ILCS
5/16-1(a)(1), in the Circuit Court of Cook County. Mr. Lewandowski stated that on
August 1, 2017, the member was sentenced to twenty-four months of probation and
was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $40,000, by February 1, 2018.
The member was terminated from County service on June 25, 2014, and had earned
11 years and 7 months of pensionable service credit. If the facts underlying the
charges are related to her service as a County employee, she would not be eligible for
benefits from the Fund pursuant to Section 9-235 of the Illinois Pension Code. The
member is not eligible to receive a refund pursuant to Section 9-164(1) of the Illinois
Pension Code because she is 64 years old and has more than 10 years of service.
It was moved by Trustee DeGraff and seconded by Trustee McFadden that the Board
will consider whether the member is eligible for benefits pursuant to Section 9-235 of
the Illinois Pension Code at their next regular meeting. The Fund staff is to notify the
member of the hearing date, that she has the right to consult with an attorney and to
present evidence. Fund staff should contact the member to consider how the facts
underlying the conviction will be presented to the Board.
