of such new construction or substantial rehabilitation to qualify for a Class 6b incentive.
With respect to abandoned property, the Class 6b application must be made to the Assessor
prior to the commencement of the reoccupation of the vacant and unused property.

d.

There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or

2.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances,
shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 6b
application. If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the

"abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be
obtained. The applicant must obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required
finding of special circumstances and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County prior to its determination as to whether it will validate

finding that special circumstances exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance
or Resolution validating such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at the time of filing the Class 6b eligibility
application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the date an
assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to Class 6b. If the Resolution is not
filed at the time of the Class 6b eligibility application, the applicant shall instead file, at
that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been requested.
If the real estate is located within an Industrial Growth Zone, prior to filing a Class 6b
eligibility application with the Assessor and in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, an
applicant may obtain from an authorized officer of the municipality or an authorized
officer of the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area, a letter stating that the municipality or the County Board, as the
case may be, supports and consents to the filing of the Class 6b application with the
Assessor. Such authorized officer shall have been designated by the legislative body of the
municipality or, in the case of an unincorporated area, by the Cook County Board.

has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer and a certified copy of
the legislative action designating the authorized officer, the Bureau of Economic
Development will forward the application to the Assessor’s Office for filing. A certified
copy of the legislative action designating the authorized officer and the authorized officer
letter shall be included with the Class 6b application at the time of filing the application
with the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the industrial development
project qualifies for the Class 6b classification.
Temporary Emergency Economic Recovery Modification (TEERM) Program: In the
instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as defined
herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that
special circumstances justify finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purpose
of a Class 6b under the TEERM Program if there:
1. There has been no purchase for value; and
2. The buildings and other structures have been vacant and unused for at least 12
continuous months.
The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the special circumstances, and
a determination that the applicant's participation in the TEERM Program is necessary for
the development to occur, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of remaining vacant
and unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to
the Class 6b application under the TEERM Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes
of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that
effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances
exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "abandoned" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed
at the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant
shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may
Page 19 of 55

 be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been
requested.
Sustainable Emergency Relief (SER) Program: In the instance where real estate does not
meet the definition of abandoned property as defined herein, the municipality or the
County Board, as the case may be, may still determine that special circumstances justify
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purpose of Class 6b under the SER
Program if:
1.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises has been at the same location for a
minimum of ten years prior to the date of application for the SER Program; and

2.

The industrial enterprise that occupies the premises submits evidence of hardship
supporting a determination that participation in the SER Program is necessary for the
industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and maintain its
staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant
and unused.

The finding that a property is qualified, along with the specification of the special
circumstances, and a determination that the applicant's participation in the SER Program is
necessary for the industrial enterprise to continue operations at its current location and
maintain its staff, and that without such designation the industrial enterprise would not be
economically viable causing the property to be in imminent risk of becoming vacant and
unused, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and consenting to the
Class 6b application under the SER Program.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution where applicable shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
If the Ordinance or Resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the County Board
is required to validate such a finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes
of Class 6b, and a County Resolution to that effect shall be obtained. The applicant must
obtain the municipal enabling Ordinance with the required finding of special circumstances
and present such municipal Ordinance to the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
prior to its determination as to whether it will validate such a finding that the property is
deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b and provide a County Resolution to that
effect. A certified copy of an Ordinance or Resolution finding that special circumstances
exist, as well as a certified copy of a County Ordinance or Resolution validating such a
finding that the property is deemed "qualified" for purposes of Class 6b need not be filed at
the time of filing the Class 6b application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the
Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the class change to
Class 6b. If the Resolution is not filed at the time of the Class 6b application, the applicant
shall instead file, at that time, a letter from the municipality or the County as the case may
Page 20 of 55

 be, confirming that a Resolution or Ordinance regarding special circumstances has been
requested.
Applications for Class 6b incentives pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program
under a Class 6b application must be received by the Assessor's Office on or before
November 30, 2018 to receive consideration.
The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of annual reports by recipients of Class 6b
incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program as to the use of the property and the
number of persons employed at the Class 6b site. In such reports, recipients shall be
required to certify whether the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application continues its operations at that location. In addition, recipients of
Class 6b incentives granted pursuant to the SER Program shall be required to report to the
Assessor within 30 days if the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the time
of the SER application ceases operations at that location. A copy of such reports will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the affected districts. Failure to file such reports within
the time established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the
period relating to the non-filing. Additionally, if the industrial enterprise that occupied the
premises at the time of the SER application ceases operations at that location, then the
Class 6b incentive granted pursuant to the SER program shall terminate.
e.

This classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such new
construction (excluding demolition, if any) or such substantial rehabilitation was
completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property, from the date of
substantial re-occupancy, or in the case of incentives granted pursuant to the TEERM
Program, from the date of the notice of approval. In the case of incentives granted pursuant
to the SER Program, this classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date
of the notice of approval, or until the industrial enterprise that occupied the premises at the
time of the SER application ceases operations at that location if that occurs sooner.

f.

Unless a Class 6b granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or the SER Program, this
incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a ten percent
assessment level pursuant to Section 74-64(7), if the following requirements are met:

g.

1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of intent to request renewal of the
incentive from the municipality or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class 6b; and

3.

A copy of the Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Assessor's Office before the expiration of the ten percent assessment level period.

Class 6b incentives that are granted pursuant to the TEERM Program or SER Program are
not renewable. For all other Class 6b incentives, the number of renewal periods is not
limited as long as the property continues to apply and meet the requirements for Class 6b.
Page 21 of 55

 h.

A copy of the request for renewal of the incentive will be forwarded by the Assessor's
Office to the Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County
Board from the affected districts.

i.

If no renewal is obtained, the incentive shall be phased out over the next two years,
pursuant to Section 74-64(7). After expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate
shall revert to the applicable classification under this Division.

j.

The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
6b.

k.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class 6b recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class 6b site. A copy of such reports will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
affected districts. Failure to file such reports within the time established by the Assessor's
rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating to the non-filing.

(8) Class C. Real estate which is to be used for industrial or commercial purposes, including
abandoned property, as defined in Section 74-62, including the land upon which such property
is situated; or vacant land; where such real estate because of contamination has undergone
environmental testing and remediation and has received a "No Further Remediation Letter"
from the site remediation program.
a.

To be eligible for a Class C classification an applicant must have received a "No Further
Remediation Letter" confirming achievement of the remediation objectives based on the
industrial or commercial use.

b.

The owner of the property is rendered ineligible for the Class C classification by having
previously owned or operated the site, directly or indirectly, or having been a partner or
being associated through a family or business relationship with anyone who has owned or
operated the site, which ownership or operation caused the contamination which was
remediated pursuant to a site remediation, except for an employee who worked for an
owner, as defined herein, that operated the site. A present owner or employer who can
successfully demonstrate that the owner or employer was not responsible for the
contamination may be eligible for Class C classification.

c.

An applicant must obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located or the
County Board if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an Ordinance or
Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has
determined that the incentive provided by Class C is necessary for development to occur
on that specific real estate and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be,
supports and consents to the Class C application to the Assessor. A certified copy of the
Ordinance or Resolution must be filed at the time of application for the Class C
classification. A copy of that Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is submitted, will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
Page 22 of 55

 2. State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
d.

To qualify for the Class C classification, an application for Class C classification must be
made within one year of the receipt of the "No Further Remediation Letter". Where an
application for Class C classification encompasses less than all of the contiguous property
owned by the applicant upon which remediation has been completed, the one-year
limitation will be waived for any subsequent separate application for Class C classification
for the remainder or for additional portions of the property, provided that such subsequent
application is made within seven years.

e.

Additionally, to qualify for the Class C classification, the estimated remediation costs,
including site investigation, testing, oversight, remediation and removal costs, monitoring,
and engineering and legal fees associated with the remediation process, must total at least
$100,000.00, or alternatively, must total at least 25 percent of the market value of the real
estate as determined by the Assessor's property record card in the year prior to the
remediation, whichever is less.

f.

The initial Class C classification shall continue for a period of 12 years for both industrial
and commercial property. For industrial property, this incentive may be renewed during the
last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the following
requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a Resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class C; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16-percent assessment level period.

The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to apply
and qualify for Class C. Any property which applies for Class C treatment on or before the
adoption date of the ordinance from which this division is derived will be eligible for this
renewal term at the end of their original incentive period subject to the above requirements.
The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed with the Assessor's Office will be
forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to
members of the County Board from the effected districts.
g.

If, on November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class C treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing
and approval of the resolution and renewal application. However, if, as of that effective
date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
Page 23 of 55

 based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive
shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After such ten-year
period expiration of the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.
h.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class C incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject
to renewal and the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this
Division.

i.

The Assessor shall review the application and supporting documentation to determine
eligibility for the Class C classification. The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the
foregoing necessary to ensure proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and
continued eligibility for the benefits provided under the Class C classification.

j.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class C recipients as to the use of the property and the number of persons employed at the
Class C site. Such reports shall be verified. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules shall result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing.

(9) Class 7a. Real estate used primarily for commercial purposes, comprising a qualified
commercial development project, as determined pursuant to Section 74-65(a), located in an area
in need of commercial development, where total development costs, exclusive of land, do not
exceed $2,000,000.00, consisting of all newly constructed buildings or other structures,
including the land upon which they are situated; or abandoned property, as defined in this
Division, including the land upon which such property is situated; or all buildings and other
structures which are substantially rehabilitated to the extent such rehabilitation has added to
their value, including qualified land related to the rehabilitation. Land qualifies when the
rehabilitation adds vertical or horizontal square footage to the improvements. The amount of
land eligible for the incentive shall be in such proportion as the square footage added by the
rehabilitation bears to the total square footage of the improvements on the parcel.
a.

In the instance where real estate does not meet the definition of abandoned property as
defined herein, the municipality or the County Board, as the case may be, may still
determine that special circumstances justify that the property is deemed "abandoned" for
purposes of Class 7a. The finding of abandonment, along with the specification of the
special circumstances, shall be included in the Resolution or Ordinance supporting and
consenting to the Class 7a application.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, special circumstances may not be determined to justify
finding that a property is deemed "abandoned" where:

Page 24 of 55

 A. There has been a purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have not
been vacant and unused prior to such purchase; or
B.

There has been no purchase for value and the buildings and other structures have been
vacant and unused for less than 24 continuous months.

If a municipality enacts enabling legislation which a.) identifies, by permanent index

cannot be eliminated by unilateral action by the owner. If, however, the current
rent is lower than the use restriction, HUD may use the mark up to market option

qualifying for the S classification; and

iii. A rent comparability study conducted by HUD has demonstrated that comparable
market rents are above 100 percent of the HUD Fair Market Rent.
2.

HUD has approved a contract renewal for five years of the Section 8 contract under
the mark up to market under HUD's discretionary authority, after finding that the
property meets at least one of the required criteria:

ii.

There is a low vacancy rate in the area, which would make tenant based
assistance difficult to use, or a lack of comparable housing, or

iii. The project is a high priority for the local community, as demonstrated by a
contribution of state or local funds to the property.
3.

b.

c.

HUD has approved renewal of a Section 8 contract for a not for profit corporation

contract.
d.

Any property which, as of November 23, 1999, has an existing Section 8 contract with a
mark up to market option may apply for Class S classification for the any portion of the
2001 assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the
contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option. The
classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.
Any property which, as of (DATE AMENDMENT APPROVED), has an existing Section
8 contract renewal may apply for Class S classification for any portion of the 2006
assessment year encompassed within the contract term, and for the remainder of the
contract term, including any renewals approved with the mark up to market option, mark
up to market option under HUD's discretionary authority or a Section 8 contract that has
been renewed by a not-for-profit corporation under any available option under HUD's
renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8 Renewal Policy Guidelines. The
classification shall continue until the expiration or termination of the Section 8 contract.

e.

The incentive may be renewed if the Section 8 contract is again renewed under any of the

available option under HUD's renewal procedures as described in HUD's Section 8
Renewal Policy Guidelines. Upon filing an application with HUD, no less than 120 days
prior to termination of the contract, for renewal of the Section 8 contract, the taxpayer shall
provide notice to the Assessor's Office of its application for renewal. The taxpayer shall
provide a copy to the Assessor's Office of HUD's approval of the contract renewal, or
notification of other action.

f.

The Assessor's Office shall adopt rules consistent with this subsection necessary to ensure
proper review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the
benefits provided under Class S.

(15) Class L. Real estate which is to be used for commercial or industrial purposes and which is
designated as Class 3, Class 4, Class 5a or Class 5b pursuant to this Division; is a landmark or
contributing building; and has undergone substantial rehabilitation. The substantial
rehabilitation must constitute an investment by the owner of at least 50 percent of the building's
full market value as determined by the Assessor in the assessment year prior to the
commencement of the substantial rehabilitation.
a.

Generally, the incentive shall apply only to the building and will not apply to the land
underneath the building. However, if the entire building has been vacant and unused for at
least 24 continuous months prior to the filing of the eligibility application with the
Assessor, the land upon which the building is situated shall also be eligible for the
incentive.

b.

Prior to filing a Class L eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
an Ordinance or Resolution from the unit of local government in which the real estate is
located, which expressly states that the local government:
1.

Has determined that the incentive provided by Class L is necessary for the substantial
rehabilitation of the property;
Page 38 of 55

 2.

Supports and consents to the granting of the incentive; and

3.

Has reviewed and accepted its preservation commission's written recommendation of
the project for the Class L incentive. This recommendation will specify the project's
budget and proposed scope of work and will specify that the project will meets or
exceeds the Standards of the United States Department of the Interior for
Rehabilitation, Preservation, Restoration, and Reconstruction of historic properties.

4.

In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
i.

Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

ii.

State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and

iii.

State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.

c.

A certified copy of the Ordinance or Resolution need not be filed with the Assessor at the
time the Class L eligibility application is filed but the Ordinance or Resolution must be
filed with the Assessor no later than the date an assessment appeal is filed to request the
class change to Class L.

d.

If the Ordinance or Resolution is not filed at the time of the eligibility application is filed,
the applicant shall instead, include the following items with the eligibility application:
1.

A letter from the municipality or the County, as the case may be, confirming that a
Resolution or Ordinance supporting the incentive has been requested; and

2.

A copy of the preservation commission's recommendation of the project.

e.

A copy of the Resolution or letter confirming that a Resolution has been requested,
whichever is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

f.

Additionally, to qualify a landmark building or contributing building for Class L
classification, an eligibility application must be made to the Assessor within one year prior
to the commencement of substantial rehabilitation. After the substantial rehabilitation has
been completed, the preservation commission shall review the project to determine that it
is eligible under Subsection (14) of this Section. The applicant must supplement the
eligibility application with a copy of the determination of the preservation commission
prior to classification of the real estate as Class L.

g.

The initial Class L classification shall continue for a period of 12 years from the date such
substantial rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed.

h.

For property which was initially classified as Class 3, 4 or 5b, this incentive may be
renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16-percent assessment level, if the
following requirements are met:
1.

The taxpayer notifies the Assessor's Office of the taxpayer's intent to request renewal
of the incentive from the municipality, or the County Board if the real estate is located
in an unincorporated area;

Page 39 of 55

 2.

The municipality in which the real estate is located or the County Board, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a resolution expressly stating that
the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the
industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial to the local economy, and
supports and consents to renewal of the Class L; and

3.

A copy of that Resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the incentive period.
The number of renewal periods is not limited as long as the property continues to
apply and qualify for Class L. The notice of intent to request renewal which is filed
with the Assessor's Office will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary
of the County Board for distribution to members of the County Board from the
affected districts.

i.

If, as of November 23, 1999, a property is receiving Class L treatment, but the assessment
level is higher than 16 percent, that taxpayer may apply for renewal as outlined above and
receive a 16-percent assessment level for the prescribed period beginning after the filing
and approval of the Resolution and renewal application. However, if as of the effective
date, the taxpayer's assessment is higher than 16 percent and the taxpayer is granted a
renewal of the incentive for subsequent years, no reduction of the current assessment level
based on renewal of the incentive will be granted. If no renewal is obtained, the incentive
shall be phased out over the next two years, pursuant to Section 74-64. After expiration of
the last incentive period, the real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under
this Division.

j.

For commercial properties, once the original 12-year incentive period has expired, the
commercial Class L incentive will expire. The incentive classification will not be subject to
renewal subject to subsection (h) and the real estate shall revert to the applicable
classification under this Division.

k.

The Assessor shall adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to ensure proper
review of all factors relevant to determine initial and continued eligibility for the benefits
provided under Class L.

l.

The Assessor shall provide by rule for the filing of triennial reassessment reports by all
Class L recipients as to the continued landmark status of the property and the number of
persons employed at the Class L site. Failure to file such reports within the time
established by the Assessor's rules may result in loss of the incentive for the period relating
to the non-filing.

m. The Assessor shall provide the Chairman of the Business and Economic Development
Committee of the Cook County Board, annually on or before December 1, a report of each
Class L that was designated in the prior year. Such report shall consist of the address of
the Class L designated property, the date such designation was granted, the amount of
property taxes that were not assessed each year during which the Class L incentive was in
effect for such property, and if provided by the applicant, the aggregate amount of the
investment in the project and the number of jobs generated in connection with such project.

Sec. 74-65. - Qualifications for commercial development project status.
(a) To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the project
be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1) The area is or has been within the last ten years, currently, designated by Federal, State or
local agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development Areas
Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a Federal Empowerment Zone or
Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the
Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development Commission
Page 41 of 55

 Ordinance of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar statute
or Ordinance;
(2) Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined, remained stagnant or
potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed condition of the area,
and/or subject site, or property values as determined by the assessed value (AV) or equalized
assessed value (EAV) for the redevelopment area or specific subject site have declined over the
last six (6) years, or property values as determined by the AV or EAV are increasing at a rate that
is less than the balance of the municipality’s AV or EAV for the last six (6) years; or property
values as determined by the AV or EAV for the redevelopment area/site are increasing at a rate
that is less than Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as published by the US
Department of Labor for last six (6) years;
(3) There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation of the
commercial development project is viable and likely to go forward on a reasonably timely basis
if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore result in the economic enhancement of
the area;
(4) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation will
materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the area and the commercial
development project would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or
7b; and
(5) Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b designation is reasonably
expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment
opportunities within the area.
(b)Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain from
the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is located in an
unincorporated area, an Ordinance or a Resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County
Board, as the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this Section
are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents to the
Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor.
In addition, the Ordinance or Resolution shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
If a municipality enacts enabling legislation which identifies specific retail corridors or
geographies within the boundaries of such municipality that it deems to be distressed and
in need of development and which authorizes the submission of applications for Class 7a
and 7b incentives for properties within such retail corridors, applicants for Class 7a and
Class 7b incentives located in such retail corridors may obtain and submit to the Assessor,
in lieu of an Ordinance or Resolution, a letter from an authorized officer of such
municipality approving the submission of the Class 7a or 7b incentive application and a
certified copy of the municipal enabling legislation.
A copy of the authorized officer letter and a certified copy of the municipal enabling
legislation shall be included with the Class 7a or Class 7b application and submitted to the
Page 42 of 55

 Cook County Bureau of Economic Development for verification prior to filing of the
application with the Assessor.

In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;
2. State the applicant’s intended use of the property; and
3. State that an Economic Disclosure Statement, as defined in this Division, was
received and filed by the municipality or County Board, as the case may be.
Following verification that the Class 7a or Class 7b application is in a retail corridor, as defined herein,
and has been properly submitted with a letter from an authorized officer and a certified copy of the
municipal enabling legislation, the Bureau of Economic Development will forward the application to the
Assessor’s Office for filing.
A certified copy of such Ordinance or Resolution or authorization letter and certified copy of the
municipal enabling legislation (if applicable) shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the
time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy of the Ordinance or Resolution, whichever is
submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the Board for distribution to the
members of the County Board from the affected districts. The application shall include any other
information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the commercial
development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c) Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of the
County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the expense of
such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections
(a)(1)—(a)(5) of this Section for Class 7a applications.
(d) The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application and
supporting data.
(e) Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insufficient size
if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive offered" as
provided in Subsection (a)(4) of this Section, consideration may be given to any lawful
intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the appropriate
taxing districts.
(f) For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5)
of this Section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary
supporting data, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under
this Division.
(g) In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee of
the County. The Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with a finding
stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this Section are present. The Assessor
shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts.
Page 43 of 55

 Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)—(a)(5) of this Section exist, the
Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Division.
(h) Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the
commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)

To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it
is necessary that:
(1)The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the County determine
by lawful Resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically
feasible for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and
development of the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar
import;
(2) The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County apply to the Assessor for
certification of the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;
(3) Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial revitalization, the
Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a
determination of the severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the
"in need of substantial revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong
consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is located in a Federal
empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

(j)

Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in this Division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area. In
making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area
for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago
shall be the community area as defined in this Division; for all other areas in the County it shall be,
where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.

(k) If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the County Board
on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal
Resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible
for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of
the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import and
submits a request for Class 8 certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this
Division. However, each property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file
an application in a timely manner.
The Assessor shall provide the Chairman of the Business and Economic Development Committee of
the Cook County Board, annually on or before December 1, a report of each Class 8 area that was
designated in the prior year.
(l)

Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is defined in this
Division. The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.

would qualify for a Class 8 designation pursuant to Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for the fact
Page 45 of 55

 that the qualifying use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the
definition of abandoned property provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a designation as a
Class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has complied with all of the requirements
necessary to receive a Class 8 designation per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the

support of Class 8a designation absent abandonment when:
a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has obtained from the municipality in
which the real estate is located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the real
estate is located in an unincorporated area, an agreement to abate a portion of the local
government's sales tax generated by the industrial or commercial enterprise located on such
real estate and such abatement of sales tax must cover the period of time for which the
applicant would qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that due to national and regional economic conditions beyond its control the industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at

years; and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an

property will become vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least 24
months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence including, but not limited to, an
economic impact study that demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that designation as a Class 8a property will allow the industrial or
commercial enterprise to be economically viable and thereby continue its operations so that
the industrial or commercial enterprise can continue to occupy and fully utilize the real
estate for an extended period of time.

(2) Such a Resolution or Ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that industrial or
commercial enterprise has undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of at
least 40 percent in the year it makes application for the incentive as compared to the
average net operating income of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three
years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that Class 8a

to continue its operations and that without such designation the industrial or commercial
Page 46 of 55

 enterprise would not be economically viable causing the property to become vacant and
unused; and
c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that it supports and consents to
the designation of the property as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment requirement;
and

d.

operations and that without such designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the action by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to support designation of the property as a Class 8a
property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and consents to the Class 8a application to
the Cook County Assessor; and

assessed at the lowest percentage of market value provided for in Section 74-64(12), however
the term of the incentive will be limited to five years only and such Class 8a designation shall
not be renewed:

of this Section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners provides a Resolution or Ordinance in
support of such designation.

the real property on which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed by the state, and the
abandonment of the hospital would require the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of which
the applicant owns the real property on which the hospital is located, to obtain a permit or
exemption from the State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant
to the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital operations and
to obtain a second permit or exemption prior to reopening or otherwise reestablishing the
hospital after abandonment;

estate is located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or ordinance that
contains the following:
a.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that the proposed redevelopment
contemplated for the subject hospital or the property on which the hospital sits is necessary
and appropriate and that, without a classification having the impact of this Section, the
special circumstances that exist on the property on which the subject hospital sits
including, but not limited to, the unique requirement that mandates that the subject
hospital's operations are continually maintained without interruption in order for the State
of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board to issue a certificate of need and
licensure approval for the continued operation of the subject hospital and the extraordinary
need for the continued operation of the subject hospital within the applicable region, will
not be addressed and the property on which the subject hospital sits will become vacant
and underutilized and cause the continued exasperation of blighted factors within the
municipality and region;

b.

A finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that a classification having the
impact of this Section is necessary for the redevelopment to occur on the property on
which the subject hospital sits; and

c.

A statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality supporting and consenting to
the filing of an application for a classification having the impact of this Section for the
property on which the subject hospital sits.

(4) Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be
assessed at the lowest percentage of market value and for the term provided for in Section
74-64(12).
(5) In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8b designation, a Class 8 or Class 8b application
must be made or have been made to the Cook County Assessor. Any application for Class 8
submitted with required municipal approval after July 1, 2008, for hospital property where the
Page 49 of 55

 property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated for-profit acquirer, avoiding the Health
Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation approval, shall be reconsidered as an
application pursuant to this Section upon supplement of such Class 8 application with the
additional information required in this Section, if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook

with the application to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for consideration as to
whether the Cook County Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a Class 8b
designation. Real estate receiving a Class 8b designation pursuant to the provisions of this
Section shall be eligible for such designation beginning in the assessment year during which an
application for the classification having the impact of this Section is made to the Cook County
Assessor.
(6) Class 8b designation cannot be applied to real estate unless the following has occurred:
