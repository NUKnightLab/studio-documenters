Mr. Rich moved, seconded by Mrs. Darlington, adoption of the March 19-42
2019 Personnel Report. The roll call vote followed: Mrs. Adair, Mr. Casey, Mrs. MARCH 2019
Darlington, Mr. Rich, Mr. Rochford and Mr. Weber all voted aye. The motion PERSONNEL REPORT
carried.
Mr. Casey stated that he also wanted to thank Mr. Rochford for also
attending the OLC Legislative Day and his good lobbying efforts. Mr. Rochford
stated it was productive in that the library wanted to convince the legislators to
keep what the Governor had in his budget. The legislators were very receptive
when they looked at the numbers. The library is far below what the dollars were
in 2008-2009.
Ms. Hickson-Stevenson reported that this is the 4th Quarterly Strategic Plan
Update to the board. The library has a firm selected for the marketing plan work.
Security Manager George Taylor is/has been visiting each branch to discuss active
shooter situations, which need to be handled on an individual basis for each
location. Scan EZ stations will be a wonderful addition to the services we supply
for its translation purposes.

DIRECTOR’S REPORT:
QUARTERLY
STRATEGIC PLAN
UPDATE

Ms. Hickson-Stevenson also highlighted Legislative Day. She stated the LEGISLATIVE DAY
legislators expect the library staff to be there, but that they are appreciative when
the trustees take their time and a day off to attend. Mr. Casey was a bulldog,
leaning in and asking the legislators if they were committed to increasing the
public library fund. Mr. Rochford also brought years of experience dealing with
the legislators. Akron-Summit County Public Library was one of eight libraries
out of 251 in Ohio asked to display in the rotunda to show what is new in libraries.
The representatives were Monique Mason and Michele McNeal of Science and
Technology and Brett Neff of the Tech Zone. They drove to Columbus that
morning in order to be there by 8:00am to set up and spent a long day there. The
food computer was a very big hit. Ms. Hickson-Stevenson thinks the Dept. of
Agriculture had been invited by OLC to see the computer.
Ms. Hickson-Stevenson also stated that she wanted to thank Kim
DeBenedictis for hosting our meeting. Also thank you to Pam Plumley for setting
up this event.
Mr. Casey then recognized Mr. Marco Sommerville and former director
David Jennings for joining the meeting.

 There were no reports from the administration team.
There was no further public participation.
Mr. Casey then asked if there were any comments for the good of the order. GOOD OF THE ORDER
Mr. Rich then stated that in recognition of and in gratitude for her
exemplary service and dedication to the Akron-Summit County Public Library,
he moved that the board room of the main library be named after Lolita K. Adair.
The motion was seconded by Mr. Rochford, “thirded” by Mr. Casey and
“fourthed” by Mr. Weber. Mrs. Adair, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Darlington, Mr. Rich, Mr.
Rochford and Mr. Weber all voted aye. Mrs. Adair stated that she was speechless.

MOTION TO RENAME
MAIN BOARD ROOM AS THE
LOLITA K. ADAIR
BOARD ROOM

Mr. Casey read a citation from the Ohio House of Representatives, and
informed Mrs. Adair that we were waiting to receive one from Senator Vernon
Sykes. He had planned to attend but there was an unexpected finance committee
meeting.
Ms. Monique Adair Betty read a letter from her brother, who was unable
to attend the event. She also stated her pride in her mother for teaching her to be
a strong outspoken woman that stands up for what she believes.
Mrs. Adair said that she was very quiet when she started on the board. No
one gave her any orientation. David Jennings was working in Business and
Government at the time, and helped her find all the information she needed on the
Ohio Revised Code. She thought about giving up, but Dick Gregory claimed she
was the agitator in the washing machine and would clean things up. She stated
that has been her goal over the years.
Mr. David Jennings thanked Mrs. Adair for her years of dedicated service,
stating that she had chaired monthly meetings of the Buildings & Grounds
Committee during the building of new branches and expansion of Main Library
over the period 1998-2008.
Mr. Sommerville also made a statement from him and on behalf of Mayor
Horrigan thanking Mrs. Adair for her service to the library.
