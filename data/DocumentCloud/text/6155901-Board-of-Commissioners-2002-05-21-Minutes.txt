refinements in the utility design of the building, therefore, additional electrical, mechanical and

CAPITAL PROGRAM ITEM

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 16, 2002 from
MICHAELE. LAMONT, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
As requested by the President and the Board of Commissioners, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy
has completed an analysis of options for replacing the Domestic Violence Courthouse. The options
studied include renovation of existing County facilities, building new facilities, and renovation of a newly
acquired building. A written report of this analysis entitled the "New Domestic Violence Court Planning
Study" and dated May 2002 is being provided under separate cover for your review.
Based upon this study, the Office of Capital Planning and Policy recommends that the Board pursue the
lowest cost alternative, which is the purchase of 325 North Wells, Chicago, Illinois for redevelopment
into a Domestic Violence Court. This site appears to substantially meet the Court requirements as
expressed in the following letter from Chief Judge Evans to President Stroger, a copy of which is
submitted for your information.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
LETTER
May 1, 2002
Honorable John H. Stroger, Jr.,
President
Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street - Room 537
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear President Stroger:
I am encouraged by recent information indicating that your office has inspected several facilities as
possible sites for the relocation of the criminal/misdemeanor courtrooms currently operating at the Circuit
Court of Cook County facility at 1340 South Michigan Avenue. I recently toured one of the sites, 325 N.
Wells Street in Chicago, and also viewed preliminary drawings presented by your office. This facility
appears to possess the potential to meet the needs of the court in a successful relocation of the 13th and
Michigan facility.
I am on record stating any facility designated to replace the 13th and Michigan facility must address the
safety, dignity, and comfort of all persons coming before the court. To ensure this, such a facility should
meet the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

centrally located and easily accessible via public transit
adequate space for a minimum of nine standard size courtrooms and chambers with restroom
facilities
adequate space to accommodate the relocation of the Children's Advocacy Room and Clinic
adequate space for the advocacy groups, the Cook County Public Defender, the Cook County
State's Attorney, and the court's non-judicial offices that provide court related services
adequate lock-up facilities
conference rooms
security equipment to provide a sufficient level of safety for all involved

However a technical assessment and review of the 325 N. Wells Street site would appropriately determine
if the site indeed meets the court's requirements and therefore I would respectfully request that you direct
the Office of Capital Planning and Policy and the Department of Facilities Management to perform such a
study.
The court will continue to offer its assistance and cooperation to your office and the Board of
Commissioners in the review of the 325 N. Wells Street site or any other sites deemed appropriate by
your office and the Board.
Sincerely,
TIMOTHY C. EV ANS
Chief Judge
Circuit Court of Cook County

Accenture's knowledge of the Bureau of Information Technology & Automation and its role
in Cook County Government will provide additional value to the County as they update the
Bureau's information technology strategy plan for the next five years.

Bureau of Health Services; Alvin Holley - Chief Financial Officer of the Bureau of
Health Services; Daniel Degnan - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer's Office; and Jack

Court Reporter: Anthony Lisanti, C. P.R.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Thursday, May 2, 2002 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118
North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered, for informational purposes, the Fiscal Year 2002 1st Quarter report of
the County of Cook as submitted by the Bureau of Finance.
Chairman Daley opened the meeting by stating the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the Appropriation
Trial Balance which was entered into the record along with a letter on actual revenues dated April 24,
2002 from Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer. A report of both program descriptions and
operational statistics for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services dated April 30, 2002 from Ruth
Rothstein, Chief of the Bureau of Health Services was also entered into the record. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley then called on County Board President John H. Stroger, Jr. for remarks.
President Stroger commented that the County's financial operations should be reviewed on a quarterly
basis. He further stated that sound financial decisions made by the administration and the Board have
resulted in seven bond rating increases. He said that all commissioners and county elected officials must
be vigilant in managing county finances.
President Stroger continued to state that Cook County's budget and revenue sources are fundamentally
different from many other governments. He said county revenue sources have not been dramatically
affected by recent changes in the economy, and believes the events of September 11, 2001 only
highlighted a preexisting slow down in the economy. He stated that despite the present economy, the
fiscal year 2002 budget remains realistic and honors the Board's responsibility to fund vital public health
and safety sources. President Stroger concluded by saying that in light of the slowing economy, and in
order to monitor revenues, a hiring freeze was preemptively taken which ended in March 2002. If
necessary, he said the County is prepared to reinstate the hiring freeze or take other actions in order to
control County expenditures.
Chairman Daley remarked that the meeting is strictly for review of the Comptroller's Trial Balance
Report. The Chairman urged Board members to ask questions of the representatives who will appear
before the committee. He also thanked President Stroger for his strong leadership in helping move Cook
County forward.
The Chairman then asked Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, for a statement.
Mr. Glaser stressed that it is important to remember that the Trial Balance represents a snapshot of county
finances at a particular point in time. He said that since the budget is primarily payroll-driven,
expenditures and encumbrances are analyzed as payroll charges are incurred.

1859

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Mr. Glaser commented that the general ledger is closed monthly and significant variances are then
explored within individual operating departments. He also stressed that the Trial Balance includes both
expenditures and encumbrances; and that sometimes there are situations where encumbrances for an
entire year are undertaken very early in the fiscal year. As a result, the percentages that seem to be out of
line in one quarter will, over time, be more in line with percentage expectations in future quarters.
Chairman Daley asked Ruth Rothstein, Chief of the Bureau of Health Services, for a statement.
Mrs. Rothstein commented that the Bureau of Health Services' facilities are staffed 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. With respect to overtime, there are several factors to be taken into consideration, such as:
union contracts enable nurses to have every other weekend off; five of the thirteen paid holidays occurred
within the first quarter; scheduled vacations; sick time; work-related injuries; and a hiring freeze which
was in effect to March. All of these aspects factor into the use of overtime. Chief Rothstein said the
Bureau of Health Services has over 500 vacancies, including nurses, which are very difficult positions to
recruit.
Commissioner Quigley asked that he be recognized for a general question to Mr. Glaser. After
commenting on news reports of the State of Illinois' and Chicago's budgetary problems, Commissioner
Quigley asked how is Cook County different from these two governments and seems to be immune from
the acute financial problems occurring elsewhere in the public and private sectors.
Mr. Glaser responded that Cook County's revenue streams are somewhat different from other
governments. He said that the County's revenue forecasts are conservative, and present a realistic view of
where the Bureau of Finance expects finances to be throughout the year.
Commissioner Quigley asked which revenue sources are of concern to the Bureau of Finance?
John F. Chambers, County Comptroller responded that the major concerns are the sales tax and use tax.
He said the Bureau of Finance submitted revenue estimates that were below actual collections in 2001 in
anticipation of an economic downturn. Mr. Chambers said one other major concern is real estate tax
collections, which have been flat for the last three years. He said there is further concern this year due to
pending refunds.
Other areas of concern expressed by Mr. Chambers were court fees and taxes on gas, cigarettes, liquor
and other home rule taxes. He said cigarette use is also down which is why revenue estimates have been
decreased. Also, there is concern regarding the personal property replacement tax that was estimated on
target at $30 million in fiscal year 2001; however, this year the estimate is $15 million. Mr. Chambers
concluded by stating that the County is in a comfortable financial position.
Commissioner Quigley reiterated his concern about financial problems at the state level. He then
commented on the dramatic increase last year in fees from the Recorder of Deeds Office for home sales
that now may be decreased due to the economy.
Mr. Chambers responded that as County Comptroller, he continues to intentionally underestimate
revenues. He said the question of whether revenues can support programs going forward depends upon
many factors including collective bargaining agreements.
President Stroger asked to be recognized to make a statement regarding the impact of the State's budget
problems on Cook County. The President informed the commissioners that Governor Ryan deleted the
$7.5 million previously allocated to the County for the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center that is very
much needed.

1860

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Commissioner Quigley continued to say that the County receives a lot of funding through grants and
other means, through the state and federal governments. He said he believes eventually a lot of these
programs will catch up to the County and ifthe Board waits until budget time, then it may be too late.
Commissioner Quigley asked Alvin Holley, Chief Financial Officer for the Bureau of Health Services to
comment on the issue of overtime at the various facilities within the Bureau.
In response to Commissioner Quigley's inquiry, Alvin Holley explained that when the budget is prepared,
the goal is to fill one hundred percent of the budgeted positions. However, due to staffing shortages,
pa11icularly nurses, overtime is used and funds are transferred to the overtime account.
Commissioner Quigley asked if the number of vacant positions in the Bureau of Health Services is
constant?
Mr. Holley responded that the number of vacant positions remains at approximately ten percent. He
further said that there are five hundred hard-to-fill positions throughout the Bureau and the total number
of vacancies is nine hundred.
Commissioner Quigley commented that since the number of vacant positions has remained constant for
many years, it seems reasonable that the Bureau would allocate more dollars to pay overtime but has not
done so.
Mr. Holley stated that there is no way of knowing exactly what positions are going to be vacant, and
funding cannot be made in accounts for both salaries of regular employees and overtime.
Commissioner Quigley asked when the Bureau of Health Services no longer expects these positions to be
necessary?
Mr. Holley said that for the last five years the Bureau has been addressing the move to the new Cook
County Hospital and a reduction in staff. In response to Commissioner Quigley's question regarding a
recent staffing study prepared by American Practice Management, Inc. (APM), Mr. Holley said he would
provide a copy of the study to the commissioners. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of
the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley stated that a lot of the overtime at the Bureau is in the areas of acute care where it is very
difficult to fill positions, even through nursing registries.
Commissioner Collins asked when the budget is prepared, if any consideration is given to weighing the
costs for ove11ime against giving adequate raises for nurses, considering the nationwide nurses shortage.
Mr. Holley stated that there is extreme competition for nurses throughout the countty. He said that the
County must contend with collective bargaining agreements in addition to competing with other hospitals
who are able to give signing bonuses and who still have problems hiring nurses.
Commissioner Collins suggested that the Bureau look at reducing overtime and increase the pay for
nurses including signing bonuses and other incentives.
Commissioner Sims asked if a comparison was made in regards to what is paid in base salary to what is
paid in overtime in the study prepared by APM.
Mr. Holley said that overtime is paid time and a half and base salary is straight time.

1861

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Commissioner Sims further asked if it is possible for a nurse to receive more in overtime than in straight
salary.
Mr. Holley responded that based upon the area worked, such as in one of the Intensive Care Units, it is
possible to earn more in overtime.
President Stroger commented that many years ago, Cook County Hospital had its own School of Nursing
from which staff could be drawn. Since the program was closed, the hospital has not been able to recruit
adequate staff.
Commissioner Steele made comments regarding hiring part-time nurses instead of having staff to work
overtime. The commissioner also asked for a breakdown on the other areas where there are staffing
shortages that require overtime. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Daley stated that Mrs. Rothstein would provide the information.
Commissioner Maldonado remarked that since he has been on the County Board, he has heard that the
bulk of the savings to be realized will come from the maintenance side of building a new hospital. He
said that the Board cannot overlook the fact that most of the savings has already been projected, and no
one should expect a reduction in staffing when there will be an increase in the amount of square footage
in the new hospital.
Commissioner Maldonado said he wanted to make the point that there has been a shift in health care to
primary care and the County has followed this path. He said that forty percent of the new hospital would
be dedicated to inpatient care while sixty percent will be for primary care. In conclusion, the
commissioner said that the savings would not necessarily come from staff, but would be in the area of
maintaining the physical structure of the new hospital.
Commissioner Goslin asked for an explanation for the ninety-seven percent of spending at Provident
Hospital for medical, dental and laboratory supplies in the first quarter and eighty-eight percent for
surgical supplies.
Mr. Holley responded that the figures reflect encumbrances as well as actual expenditures.
Grace Colbert, Director of Budget and Management Services, explained that when a department requests
a contract for a vendor, the annual contract is committed to for the entire year on the Comptroller's
record. She said the goods and services may not have been shipped or received but the County is
committed to that use. Once a purchase order or contract is issued, the entire amount is encumbered.
Mr. Chambers further explained that the encumbrance system of accounting is a level of security so that
amount is not overspent unless there is a compelling reason.
In response to Commissioner Goslin's question regarding "locking in a price" when funds are
encumbered, Mr. Chambers said that given market indexes, some contracts such as food and drugs may
float but by and large the price is locked.
Commissioner Goslin asked if staff looks for deviations in analyzing the Trial Balance.
Mr. Glaser responded that an analysis begins at the summary level where the expenditures are shown. He
said if the analysis suggests that a particular line item is out of line, then explanations are sought from the
respective departments.

1862

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002

Mr. Chambers stated that if there is a chronic problem, the issue is addressed during transfer of funds
meetings.
Chairman Daley agreed that chronic problems could be addressed at transfer of funds meetings; however,
he said department heads and elected officials know how much money is left at the end of the year.
Commissioner Sutker asked when the Bureau of Finance comes across an aberration, if an historical
comparison is made.
Mr. Chambers said that historical information depends upon the size of the budget. He said that if
everything is constant in certain accounts, historical information is helpful. He said the Bureau of
Finance looks at a series of snapshots to determine what is in there, should it be there and was it
anticipated.
Commissioner Goslin asked what happens to the balances in the account for regular salaries and wages
for nurses and the overtime account at the end of the fiscal year.
Alvin Holley responded that there would still be an encumbered balance in the account for regular salaries
and wages at the end of the fiscal year.
Commissioner Quigley commented on the letter previously distributed by Chairman Daley regarding
requests for transfer of funds and the justification for the request. (The referenced document is on file in
the Office of the County Clerk.)
Grace Colbert stated that justifications must be submitted with the transfer request.
Commissioner Silvestri asked a question regarding the $20 million revenue source at the Bureau of
Health Services.
Alvin Holley expl11-ined that there is no single source of revenue for the $20 million. He said there is a
timing difference on how the County's Bureau of Finance calculates revenues and how the Bureau of
Health Services calculates revenues.
Commissioner Silvestri expressed concern that as the Illinois Legislature meets, there is the general belief
that local municipalities and counties can bear the burden of the decreased revenue of the State. The
Commissioner referred to the letter from Thomas Glaser wherein expenditures are substantially less than
anticipated. Commissioner Silvestri asked if we expect this trend to continue?
Mr. Glaser said that there are some timing differences that are taken into consideration. He said that the
Bureau of Finance is monitoring expenditures on a monthly basis. He further stated that the Bureau of
Finance would closely monitor revenues to see whether the County will continue to be in as good a shape
in the following quarters as it is in today.
President Stroger asked Mr. Glaser how the County's records would be affected by the new
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) rules and regulations.
Mr. Glaser responded that the most significant change is the GASB 34 which requires the County to
begin to depreciate our fixed assets, with the issuance of the 2002 financial statements. He said the
County has spent the last six or eight months working to identify fixed assets, and beginning December 1,
2002, those assets will be depreciated.

1863

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
President Stroger asked a question regarding the Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) and refunds issued
by the County Treasurer. President Stroger asked what impact would these refunds have on the budgetary
process.
Mr. Glaser said that this is a significant issue for tax-capped entities. Mr. Glaser stated that the County is
in the position of having a Working Cash Fund to cover shortfalls from refunds that have been issued. He
further said that other governmental units such as the Cook County Forest Preserve District are not as
fortunate in being able to address shortfalls with surplus liquidity. He said these refunds might require
the County to change its budgetary process in order to increase the loss factor and make certain enough
money is set-aside to cover refunds.
President Stroger asked for an explanation on how the loss in collection and the protest funds will affect
the County's budgetary process.
Mr. Chambers said that in preparation of the annual budget and the real estate tax levy component, a three
percent factor is built into the numbers. He explained that this means that the real estate taxes the County
extends in order to generate cash, are three percent more. History has shown that about three percent of
the real estate taxes is not collected in the year it was extended, and now tax caps, PTAB and the
elimination of the protest fund are all converging on the real estate tax distribution process. He said the
County Clerk and the Treasurer have no choice but to issue the refunds out of current levels. And, in
regard to the Forest Preserve District, PTAB has a severe impact. He concluded by saying that current
estimates indicate that refunds could be as high as five or six percent.
President Stroger added that the Sheriffs Office, particularly the Department of Corrections, requests a
lot of overtime. He said that the County cares for approximately 1,800 parole violators, who are the
responsibility of the State of Illinois. The President further commented that he would like State's
Attorney Devine to look at some of these unfunded mandates, and if necessary, challenge them on behalf
of the people.
In response to a question by Commissioner Collins, Dan Degnan, Chief Financial Officer for the
Treasurer's Office stated that the Office would not issue a refund until that refund has been perfected.
Part of the perfecting process is the receipt of a court order, and the Treasurer's Office receives court
orders for refunds on a daily basis.
Chairman Daley then asked Thomas Glaser to express any concerns regarding the issue of overtime for
the offices of elected officials and departments other than the Bureau of Health Services.
Mr. Glaser commented that overtime is a countywide issue that must be carefully watched. He said that
there are select accounts that are of some concern now, but the Bureau of Finance will be looking at them
in future quarters.
Chairman Daley stated that there would be quarterly meetings of the Finance Committee in order to
monitor the County's finances. He also was concerned that most of the meeting centered around overtime
at the hospital when other counfy departments and offices have rising overtime costs, too.
Commissioner Goslin asked that an executive summary of problems, expenditures or items that may be
out of historical sync be prepared by the Bureau of Finance and distributed to the commissioners prior to
meetings.
Commissioner Silvestri noted President Stroger's comments regarding increased overtime in the
Department of Corrections and asked if the Department is having difficulty recruiting correctional
officers.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Jack Kelly, Chief Financial Officer for the Sheriffs Office, indicated that there is a problem recruiting
correctional officers, which has impacted overtime. Mr. Kelly also expressed concern that medical
expenses have increased due to additional inmates.
Commissioner Moreno remarked that the members need some reports that would help identify issues and
problems so the Board can propose solutions. He asked that a study be completed on all costs associated
with the Department of Corrections' budget, including health services, food, housing, and maintenance as
well as any other costs.
Chairman Daley reminded the commissioners that they receive a Trial Balance on a monthly basis and
department heads, elected officials and their representatives are available to respond to questions about
their accounts at any time.
President Stroger asked Grace Colbert to prepare a memo to all departments regarding the monitoring of
overtime expenses and a justification for use.
Vice Chairman Carr moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health and Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant
to notice on Friday, May 17, 2002 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee received, for informational purposes, priorities and reports of the Bureau of Health
Services.
Chairman Butler opened the meeting by asking Bureau Chief Ruth Rothstein for remarks.
Ruth Rothstein, Bureau Chief, stated that every commissioner received information regarding the day's
meeting, including major accomplishments of the Bureau. Ms. Rothstein began by defining the Bureau of
Health Services that was established in 1992. She said prior to the Bureau, the county's health care
system was very fragmented and each institution functioned under different rules and different
regulations. Now, under the Bureau, all professional and support staff from the various institutions meet
in one group to address issues and resolve them in a coordinated manner.
Finally, Ms. Rothstein stated that representatives from the various facilities would be reporting on the
major issues that impact the facilities. Future issues to be discussed will be corporate compliance,
legislative issues, Baby Link project and quality assurance issues across the entire Bureau.
Ms. Rothstein further stated that another important component is the Bureau's community outreach.
These efforts include the internal development of a clinical network, broadening the connection to
community-based health providers, continuing to lead and help build the Chicago, Cook County
community health council, the Access to Care program and how the Bureau participates in that program
both financially and in strategic planning.

1914

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Following the agenda, Deputy Chief Patricia Terrell discussed Bureau of Health priorities for fiscal year
2002: Ms. Terrell commented on the "Expansion of the Bureau Network" and partnerships with St.
Anthony Hospital for deliveries, perinatal referrals and inpatient psychiatry; Bethany Hospital for primary
care, deliveries, perinatal referrals and inpatient psychiatry; St. Elizabeth Hospital for deliveries and
perinatal referrals; Jackson Park Hospital for perinatal referrals, family practice rotations and inpatient
psychiatry; Northwest Community Hospital for primary care and deliveries; St. James Hospital for
prenatal care and deliveries; Thorek Hospital for primary care; and Roseland Hospital for perinatal care.
These partnerships were formed for three reasons: 1) to allow for the most cost-effective expansion of
services, primarily outpatient care; 2) to generate additional revenue through keeping maternal patients
and increasing high risk perinatal referrals to Stroger Hospital of Cook County; and 3) to access services
for patients that the Bureau does not currently provide.
Ms. Terrell further commented that the Bureau has developed strong affiliations with federally-funded
community health centers that extend the Bureau's ability to access primary care for patients. The
affiliation with Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center encompasses academic training programs,
accessing highly specialized clinical services and the CORE Center. The Bureau is working closely with
the Chicago Department of Public Health to assure the effective coordination of services between the two
agencies.
Ms. Terrell stated that "Integration of the Bureau's Medical Staff' has allowed expansion of the clinic
system, development of regional hubs for specialty care, and coordination of the clinical care of patients
throughout the Bureau's institutions.
Other Bureau priorities include the ability to secure new sources of revenue and decrease the reliance of
the health system on the subsidy of County taxpayers (in 1991 the Bureau was subsidized at 61 percent,
today, the subsidy has been reduced to 41 per cent): a Bureau-wide effort to assure the appropriate
utilization of all inpatient acute care beds focusing on general medical/surgical beds; the implementation
of the new Cerner Clinical Information System will facilitate the integration of patient care between all
Bureau institutions; an initiative that will allow the County to contract with one pharmaceutical
distributor assuring that medications are available to Bureau patients when needed with lower purchasing
and distribution costs; and the coordination of all levels of care in addressing public health issues. In
2002, the Bureau has prioritized the prevention and treatment of asthma and diabetes.
Commissioner Quigley asked Bureau Chief Rothstein where the next clinics in the ambulatory care
system might be located?
Bureau Chief Rothstein responded that the Bureau's thrust is not to do it all. She said that the Bureau is
looking at certain demographics across the county and surveying facilities currently in place before
making a recommendation. However, one area that seems to be in need is the City of Chicago's BelmontCragin area where the Bureau is working with Resurrection Health System.
In response to comments from Commissioner Quigley regarding the City of Chicago's public health
clinics, Bureau Chief Rothstein indicated that she believes the City does not want to be in the clinic
business but wants to focus on the area of public health.
Commissioner Quigley asked how does the building of the new Stroger Hospital affect Provident
Hospital?

1915

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Bureau Chief Rothstein said that Provident Hospital has always been a teaching hospital and this would
not change. She further commented that this year in July, the family practice recruitment would be
consolidated at the Stroger and Provident Hospitals under the rubric of Loyola Medical Center for the
academic piece which would save revenue because fewer residents would be required and rotations could
be handled between the two institutions.
Commissioner Steele stated her concern with the "prime vendor" pharmaceutical contract and the Cerner
Clinical Implementation Plan.
Bureau Chief Rothstein responded that now since the lawsuit filed by DMS Pharmaceuticals has been
dropped, the Bureau is currently negotiating the contract with McKesson and working out details of an
implementation plan.
In response to another question from Commissioner Steele regarding current contracts with DMS
Pharmaceuticals, Bureau Chief Rothstein stated that as old pharmaceutical contracts expire, all new
requests will be moved to the prime vendor contract. The Bureau Chief further stated that many times the
pharmacies have been unable to fill patient prescriptions but this will be eliminated under the prime
vendor contract.
In response to a question regarding implementation of the Cerner Clinical Information Plan, Bureau Chief
Rothstein commented that the plan will be in place by early Fall 2002.
Commissioner Collins agreed with the need for increased public/private partnerships and observed that
because the western suburbs has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the County, the location for
new clinics should be based on need.
Stephanie Griggs, Chief Operating Officer of Provident Hospital of Cook County then addressed the
Hospital's role in the Bureau's Cancer Initiative. Ms. Griggs stated that a task force has been formed and
is chaired by Dr. Gail Shiomoto who planned the Infusion Center at Provident Hospital. Currently,
approximately nine hundred patients receive outpatient chemotherapy services annually at Provident. Ms.
Griggs concluded by stating that patients can now receive treatment at Provident Hospital after being
referred by a primary care physician.
Dr. Cynthia Henderson, Chief Operating Officer at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County was the next
presenter. Dr. Henderson said that the goals of restructuring at the Hospital are to improve patient flow
through the Emergency Room, to locate long term care residents closer to needed services and to
maximize the use of acute care beds to meet Bureau needs and to maximize revenue.
Dr. James McAuley, Medical Director of Cermak Health Services of Cook County spoke on continuity of
care at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC). He said the Bureau provided several reviews in
1999 and 2000 highlighting strengths and potential areas for improvement in the provision of medical and
mental health care at the JTDC. Dr. McAuley stated that the decision was made to have JTDC health
services personnel and policies directly responsible to Cermak Health Services with finances remaining
under JTDC.
Dr. McAuley commented that support was offered to JTDC in the following areas: pharmacy services
which is now provided by Provident Hospital; the implementation of infection control instruction; the
hiring of new personnel - a health administrator, several mental health staff, several key support staff, and
dental staffing support; implementation of a rape crisis and domestic violence abuse counseling program
for females; a mental health initiative by the State of Illinois linking children to services; implementation
of a new medical records system; and a new policy and procedures manual, orientation manual and
treatment protocols.

1916

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Dr. Robert Weinstein, Chief Operating Officer of the CORE Center provided statistical information
regarding patient volumes and expenditures. He stated that the CORE Center sees between 7,000 to
8,000 patients a year. They also see about 29,000 visits per year for case management, chemical
dependency, mental health counseling, and overall there were about 43,000 visits billed in 2001. Further,
he stated that pharmaceuticals have been a major cost in the outpatient area, and in FY 2000 over $12
million was spent primarily on medication for HIV. He also stated that from FY 2000 to FY 2001, there
was a 22 percent decrease in pharmacy prescriptions or about $11 to $12 million was in 2000 and
approximately $5 to $6 million was spent in 2001. This was the result of an increase in the number of
patients enrolled in the State-sponsored Aids Drug System Program and the number of patients who have
Medicaid who receive medication from outside pharmacies.
In addition, Dr. Weinstein stated that the CORE Center has begun to undertake some activities overseas to
export some of the CORE Center's expertise to other countries. He also informed the commissioners that
last year a physician from Mexico spent three weeks in an education session at the Center and some
CORE Center physicians are currently working in Botswana and Nigeria. Another activity the CORE
Center has is a collaborative effort with the National Institutes of Health and Northwestern University to
establish a research program in Nigeria where physicians will function between Nigeria and the CORE
Center.
Lacy Thomas, Chief Operating Officer at Stroger Hospital of Cook County, focused on two areas:
transitioning staff into the new Hospital and an employee information campaign. Mr. Thomas said that a
videotape was developed to further help employees with the transition.
Mr. Thomas made additional statements regarding patient care strategies and coordinated services
between the emergency rooms at both Stroger and Provident Hospitals. As it relates to information
technology, he commented that the Cerner Clinical Information System will be the hub of the new
hospital, particularly, in the radiology and order/entry departments.
Chairman Butler then entertained questions from the commissioners.
Commissioner Moreno asked the presenters to provide a summary of their remarks.
Commissioner Moreno asked Dr. Karen Scott what financial impact, if any, has bio-terrorism had on the
Bureau and the Department of Public Health?
Dr. Scott responded that staff has had to take on additional responsibilities because the Department has
not received funding; however, federal dollars are expected soon, so the costs of purchasing equipment
will be paid using federal grant dollars.
Commissioner Goslin asked a question regarding the Department of Public Health's immunization
program and whether it would be more cost-effective to work with the townships and the general
assistance coordinator instead of building new clinics. He asked if this has been discussed at the Bureau
or have attempts been made to expand the current program?
Dr. Scott commented on the Wellness on Wheels Program that helps identify health problems early.
Bureau Chief Rothstein further commented that the Bureau is currently working to establish a township
advisory committee that will enable the Bureau to find areas that need to have expanded services.
Commissioner Goslin asked a question regarding long-term care services, such as dementia for patients
over age 65 at Stroger Hospital.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 21, 2002
Bureau Chief Rothstein responded that the number of patients requmng long-term care at Stroger
Hospital is not significant; however, there is a large number of patients requiring such care seen at
Provident Hospital. She also remarked that Commissioner Goslin's recommendations will be taken into
consideration.
Commissioner Goslin asked if the administration at Stroger Hospital has been in contact with
representatives from Northwestern Hospital for recommendations on the transition, since it opened two
years ago .
Lacy Thomas responded that representatives from Northwestern Hospital have been very helpful.
Commissioner Steele asked Dr. Weinstein if any funding was received from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation to help support the CORE Center physicians now working in Botswana and Nigeria.
Dr. Weinstein stated that funds were received from the Gates Foundation to support physicians in
Botswana and funds from the National Institute of Health support physicians working in Nigeria.
Commissioner Steele further commented on the need for mental health services at Cermak Health
Services.
Dr. McAuley said that generally, 10 percent of the population or between 1,000 and 1,100 detainees are
under care for mental illness daily. He made additional remarks regarding Thresholds and said it is the
main organization that they work with regarding discharge. Mainly patients are going to outpatient
settings and if they need inpatient services they will direct them to the State Mental Hospitals.
Commissioner Goslin made statements regarding the need for the Bureau of Health Services to be at the
table in discussions on uncompensated care, which is a big problem across our country.
Chairman Butler expressed concern about clinics in the Grand Boulevard area that do not have extended
hours to accommodate working mothers and children.
Dr. Conway responded that most clinics have evening hours; however, he said many of the clinics are
located in facilities operated by the City of Chicago and it has been difficult to have the facilities close
later. However, he said there now seems to be a new openness to consider later hours. Dr. Conway asked
Chairman Butler to sp~cify those clinics of concern, so he could respond.
The Chairman then asked Bureau Chief Rothstein a question regarding the increase in revenues that the
Bureau of Health Services has been able to generate.
Bureau Chief Rothstein stated that because of the aggressiveness of the Bureau of Health Services, there
has been a major change in the level of subsidization, and remarked that all revenues generated are
deposited in a corporate bank account.
Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Goslin. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
