TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an industrial facility;
and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application from
CenterPoint Properties Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust, Chicago Title Land Trust, as
successor trustee, u/t/a dated February 17, 1994, a/k/a Trust #B8000468355, and Resolution No. 29-08
from Elk Grove Village, Illinois for an abandoned industrial facility located at 1201 Estes Avenue, Elk
Grove Village, Cook County, Illinois, County Board District #17, Property Index Number 08-34-205016-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined “abandoned property” as buildings and other structures that, after
having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased for value by a purchaser in whom
the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined an exception to this abandoned property definition shall be, if the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, finds that special circumstances justify finding that the
property is “abandoned” for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a
disinterested buyer Cook County may determine that special circumstances justify finding the property is
deemed “abandoned”; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires a Resolution by the County Board validating the property is deemed
“abandoned” for the purposes of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that from July 2007 to February
2008 the building had minimal staff and thereafter has been completely vacant prior to purchase, and that
special circumstances are present; and
WHEREAS, the re-occupancy will create an estimated 35-55 new full time jobs, 10-15 construction jobs,
and CenterPoint Properties, LLC plans to invest over $642,000.00 to $850,000.00 to refurbish the site in
addition to $50,000.00 to $100,000.00 that must be spent to resolve environmental issues on site, and all
marketing efforts to lease the property has been unsuccessful without the Class 6b. The 6b is necessary
for this development to occur on the subject property, and potentially generating additional property taxes
by increasing the tax assessment from vacant to full occupancy; and
WHEREAS, the applicant acknowledges that it must provide an affidavit to the Assessor’s Office
stipulating that it is in compliance with the County’s Living Wage Ordinance prior to receiving the Class
6b incentive on the subject property.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the property
located at 1201 Estes Avenue, Elk Grove Village, Cook County, Illinois, is deemed “abandoned” the
building up to current building codes with special circumstances under the Class 6b; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a
certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.

Transmitting a Communication, dated August 11, 2008 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to extend a grant award in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department
of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant provides funding for gender-responsive treatment
services provided to nonviolent felony offenders referred to the Criminal Division’s Mental Health
Treatment Court. The Mental Health Treatment Court pilot program was launched in April 2004 to
reduce incarceration of mentally ill, nonviolent felony offenders. The specialty court accomplishes this
by enhancing court supervision and improving the delivery of mental healthcare to such offenders, who
have significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders, some have other health concerns, as well,
such as positive tests for HIV. In its first three years of operation, the Criminal Division’s Mental Health
Treatment Court has received more than 200 referrals, both male and female. Early program results are
encouraging, with recidivism for participants substantially reduced. The grant funds will allow the
participant capacity of the program to increase by an additional 25 offenders, or 75 per year.
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on November 20, 2007 by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners in the amount of $200,000.00.
The grant requires matching funds only in the form of contributions of time from existing staff. As such,
the grant would have no fiscal impact on Cook County.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Funding period extension: October 1, 2008 through September 30,
2009.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents, and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
