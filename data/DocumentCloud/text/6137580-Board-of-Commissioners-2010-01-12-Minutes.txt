might be expanded to promote treatment as an alternative to incarceration on a broader scale within Cook
County.
A.

Assessments. Detainees who are considered for diversion must agree to undergo an
individualized mental health and physical evaluation and assessment and to accept
referrals for appropriate services including housing and case management. The program
must be designed to reduce the number of mentally ill detainees entering into the Cook
County Jail and afford greater opportunities for crisis intervention and essential
supportive services.

teams, when called upon to stabilize a crisis situation involving a mentally ill offender.
The crisis center and the crisis intervention team shall be subject to funding by the
intergovernmental agreement established in accordance with provisions set forth in
Article IV, Funding and Intergovernmental Agreement.

D.

Third Party Health Care Reimbursement Sources. In those cases where a Diverted
Detainee does not have a source of third party health coverage, the Cook County Bureau

Section 3.5

Types of Jail Diversion Programs
12

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 12, 2010
This jail diversion pilot program is designed to strengthen existing jail diversion efforts
which are currently used by some local law enforcement officials such as station
adjustments, peer juries, special courts, and other alternatives to incarceration.
A.

This Jail Diversion Pilot Program will include four types of Diversion, each of which
shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate authorities and have agreed-upon
conditions by all parties involved, the agreement shall be tailored to particular
circumstances, for which Diverted Detainees shall be held accountable. The four
categories of Diversion are as follows:
1.

Pre-booking Diversion:

Pre-booking Diversion may be sought by local law enforcement for mentally ill
detainees, booked for Class B and C misdemeanors, as often as possible. The arresting
officer shall be the first line of contact and shall be encouraged to take the following
basic steps prior to any official charges for minor and/or nuisance crimes:

2.

a.

Attempt to resolve any crisis without harm to the suspect, general public,
or law enforcement officials.

b.

Refer directly to a hospital or treatment center when appropriate.

c.

Contact parent or guardian if mentally ill detainee is under seventeen.

d.

Evaluate the situation and determine if the suspect is potentially
divertible.

e.

Determine if detainee can be sent to his or her residence under conditions
agreed upon by law enforcement, detainee, parent(s) or guardian, and the
victim of the crime.

f.

Contact a Community Based Mental Health Service Provider when
appropriate for proper assessment and referral for services.

g.

If no Community Based Mental Health Service Provider is available
contact the 24-hour regional crisis center for crisis intervention.

h.

In cases where the detainee has caused injury to a person or damage to
one’s property, the appropriate authorities shall be encourage to explore
all efforts for restitution as a condition of Pre-Booking Diversion.

i.

Complete a detailed incident report.

Post-Booking Diversion:

This category of Diversion may be sought by the State’s Attorney for mentally ill
detainees who are detained for crimes that constitute Class A misdemeanors and Class 4
felonies and which are nonviolent. The State’s Attorney may seek a pre-arraignment
investigation which may include, but need not be limited to, assessment by a Mental
Health Service Provider to determine whether the suspect is eligible for Diversion. If a
Diversion Plan is agreed upon by all parties involved, it may include a requirement that
the Diverted Detainee adhere to an individualized treatment and service plan developed
13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 12, 2010
by an appropriate clinician, provision for restitution with respect to injuries or property
damage caused by the Diverted Detainee and may identify a case manager who shall
monitor the Diverted Detainee’s compliance with the Diversion Plan and report on such
compliance as required in the Diversion Plan.
(3) Pre-Trial Diversion to Special Courts:
This level shall continue to emphasize proper assessment and speedy trials for
those detainees who have been diagnosed by the appropriate clinicians as being mentally
ill or mentally ill with co-occurring substance abuse disorder. If a detainee has been
diagnosed as being mentally ill or mentally ill with co-occurring substance abuse disorder
and is held over for trial the detainee shall have immediate access to the appropriate
treatment services. The case should be referred to the appropriate special courts for a
speedy trial. This category of Diversion is subject to the approval of the court.
(4) Post-Adjudication Diversion:
This category of Diversion is for persons adjudicated guilty of an offense by the
courts. In cases where a person has also been found, by a licensed clinician, as being
mentally ill and it has been agreed on by the courts that a Diversion plan may be
developed, that person shall be eligible for immediate treatment.
This category of Diversion consists of dispositions in the Juvenile Court and the
misdemeanor courts within the jurisdiction of the District 4, Maywood courthouse of the
Circuit Court of Cook County and the Mental Health Court. In appropriate cases as
ordered by the court, a Diversion Plan may be developed as a condition of a Defendant’s
probation or supervision. The court may consider assignment of a case manager to
monitor the defendant’s compliance with the Diversion Plan and may require notification
of the arresting law enforcement agency or other parties prior to the defendant’s release
from custody or discharge from hospitalization for mental health or substance abuse
treatment.
B.
Section 3.7

Resumption of Prosecution. Failure to comply with the Diversion Plan shall subject the
Diverted Detainee to further prosecution.
Crisis Intervention Training

The Intergovernmental Agreement shall explore funding and promotion of training opportunities
for law enforcement and service providers with respect to crisis intervention involving persons with
mental illness which shall include recognition of mental illness, knowledge of available local resources
and the use of less than lethal force.
Section 3.8

Confidentiality

The rules of confidentiality, as set forth under the Illinois Mental Health and Developmental
Disabilities Code and other applicable state, federal and local laws, shall be adhered to.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article 7, Section 6(a) of
the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with power to regulate those matters which pertain to it’s governmental
affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to public safety and maintaining compliance with the Federal
court’s Duran Decree at Cook County Jail; and
WHEREAS, the constant increase in crime due to the rapid increase in unemployment coupled with the
thousands of former inmates released from prison without any job opportunities or skills to provide a
living for themselves pose serious challenges to the Cook County budget to carry out our mission; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Jail has an overwhelming number of detainees who are awaiting trials for
minor charges who pose no real flight risk or harm to themselves or others; and
WHEREAS, such detainees could be diverted to alternative monitoring systems outside of Cook County
Jail; and
WHEREAS, when inmates are housed in Cook County Jail they lose all of their health benefits and Cook
County has to shoulder the burden of the cost for health, security and other necessities which is putting a
serious strain on our budget in addition to keeping Cook County from maintaining compliance with the
decree; and
WHEREAS, the County will be more financially responsible if they established a Revolving Loan Fund
which would loan bond amounts to persons arrested for minor crimes. Qualified persons must be
employed at time of arrest, with a good work history, agree to continue to work to enter into a payback
agreement plan that would allow payments of the loan to be deducted from their employment checks and
sent directly to the loan fund.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners conduct a feasibility study for establishing a Revolving Bond Loan Fund for qualified
arrestees awaiting trial in order to eliminate the cost of housing them in jail and to ensure public safety.

PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, it is estimated that in the United States in 2009, 11,270 women were diagnosed with
cervical cancer, and that 4,070 of these women died from this cancer; and
WHEREAS, it is estimated that more than $2 billion is spent on the treatment of cervical cancer each
year in the United States; and
WHEREAS, the five-year survival rate for the earliest stage of invasive cervical cancer is approximately
92%; the overall (all stages combined) five-year survival rate for cervical cancer is approximately 71%;
and
WHEREAS, in the past 40 years, the number of cases of cervical cancer and the number of deaths from
cervical cancer have decreased significantly; this decline is the result of many women getting regular Pap
tests, which can find cervical precancer before it turns into cancer; the importance of undergoing an
annual Pap test cannot be stressed enough in the prevention of cervical cancer; and
WHEREAS, cervical cancer tends to occur in midlife; most cases are found in women younger than age
50; cervical cancer rarely develops in women younger than age 20; however, almost 20% of women with
cervical cancer are diagnosed when they are over age 65; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, Hispanic women have the highest rate of cervical cancer; this rate is
more than double what is encountered in non-Hispanic, white women; African American women develop
cervical cancer about 50% more often than non-Hispanic white women; and
WHEREAS, HPV – Human Papillomaviruses – is a group of viruses that can infect the cervix, and
contraction of these viruses is the cause of almost all cervical cancers; there now exists a vaccine that can
immunize young women from the two cervical cancer causing strains of HPV; and
WHEREAS, although great strides in medicine have been made to curb the occurrence of this cancer,
there is still much progress to be made; to honor Cervical Cancer Awareness Month support those
individuals who are currently fighting the disease, and disseminate information about cervical cancer.
