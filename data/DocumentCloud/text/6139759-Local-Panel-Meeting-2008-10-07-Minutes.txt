BOARD ACTIONS
Case Nos. L-RC-06-013, L-RC-06-016, and L-RC-06-023
1.
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 31/Local 200, Retail,
Wholesale and Department Store Union/County of Cook

Member Sadlowski called the case. Acting General Counsel Brosnan discussed the issues presented by the
County's exceptions and recommended that the Board accept Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Clifford's
Recommended Decision and Order (RDO) and direct a representation election in the petitioned-for unit. The
Board Members then engaged in a lengthy discussion of the ALJ's determinations and the County's
exceptions. Member Anderson also questioned the acting general counsel to ensure that voters whose
eligibility was doubtful would be subject to challenge. At the conclusion thereof, Member Anderson moved
to accept the ALJ's recommendation. Member Sadlowski seconded the motion, and the Board passed it
unanimously, by a voice vote.
2.
Case No. L-CA-08-003
National Nurses Organizing Committee/County of Cook
Member Anderson summarized the case, noting that Executive Director Brosnan issued a dismissal on July
24, 2008, with an appeal filed. Acting General Counsel Wells reviewed the issues presented by the appeal
and recommended that the Board reject the executive director's dismissal of that portion of the charge dealing
with the request for information, and instead, issue a complaint for hearing. As to the remainder of the
charge, the acting general counsel determined that the Board had a choice of either upholding the dismissal,
or rejecting the dismissal and deferring the charge to the parties' grievance arbitration process. After a
lengthy discussion, Member Sadlowski moved to deny Charging Party's motion for oral argument, reject the
executive director's dismissal, issue a complaint for hearing on the information request portion of the charge,
and defer the remainder to arbitration. Member Anderson seconded the motion, and the Board passed it
unanimously, by a voice vote.
