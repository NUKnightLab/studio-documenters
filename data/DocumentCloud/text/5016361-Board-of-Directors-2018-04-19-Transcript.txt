BOARD MEMBER DELGADO:

Thank you, Vice

President Foreman.
Pursuant to Section 2-78-130 of

18

the Municipal Code of Chicago, I considered one

19

matter on which the Chief Administrator of the

20

Civilian Office of Police Accountability and

21

the Superintendent of Police did not agree

22

regarding the discipline of a police officer.

23

Request for REVIEW number 18 RR

24

03 involves allegations that Police Officer

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

Robert Rialmo shot Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie

2

Jones without justification.

3

The Chief Administrator

4

recommended sustaining the allegations and

5

discharging Officer Rialmo from the Chicago

6

Police Department.

7

recommended classifying the allegations as

8

exonerated.

9

The Superintendent

After reviewing this matter, I

10

find that the objections raised in the response

11

of the Superintendent of Police are not

12

sufficient to meet the burden of overcoming the

13

Chief Administrator's recommendation for

14

discipline.

15

Based on the facts and

16

circumstances of this matter, an evidentiary

17

hearing before the Police Board is necessary to

18

determine whether Officer Rialmo violated any

19

of the Police Department's Rules of Conduct.

20

This finding does not mean that

21

the conclusions reached by the Chief

22

Administrator are correct and that the

23

Superintendent's conclusions are incorrect, but

24

rather that the presentation of witness

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

testimony and evidence at a hearing is

necessary to determine whether there were any

3

rule violations related to these allegations.

4

A copy of the written opinion

5

will be posted on the Board's website as

6

required by the Municipal Code.

7

VICE PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

Thank you.

The

8

general orders and other directives issued by

9

the Superintendent of Police during the

10

previous month are listed in the books made

11

available at this evening's meeting and are

12

posted on the Police Department's website.

The next item is the

Superintendent's report to the Board, which we

are going to waive.

MR. ROGERS:

Good evening.

I want to thank

11

you for the opportunity to step before you and

speak.

13

that the objections made by Superintendent

14

Johnson were not well-founded to COPA's

15

findings.

16

Thank you for the finding acknowledging

I wanted to point out to this

17

body that the -- this is the first case to be

18

considered by COPA after the reforms have been

19

instituted by the City of Chicago after the

20

dismal response to police-involved shootings

21

that we saw with IPRA.

22

In this shooting, we have an

23

innocent woman, Bettie Jones, who was shot and

24

killed, and a young 19-year-old boy who was

shot and killed.

2

evidence, all of the physical evidence is found

3

inside the vestibule and apartment of Bettie

4

Jones.

Absolutely none of it is found on the

5

porch.

There's no objective evidence to

6

support what Officer Rialmo testified to with

7

regard to how this shooting happened.

8
9

And all of the physical

I wanted to point out to this
body that this is not only the finding of COPA,

10

but we have three independent expert witnesses

11

who we've retained in police practices who have

12

reconstructed this incident, all with findings

13

consistent with what COPA found.

14

There's objective evidence with

15

regard to the location of the shell casings

16

back by the sidewalk.

17

shell casings indicating that this officer

18

fired into this home where he knew innocent

19

people, both this young lady, Latisha Jones, as

20

well as her mother and another gentleman were

21

in that home.

There's a collection of

It is absolutely inexcusable what
Officer Rialmo did on that day.
We have a finding by
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

Superintendent Johnson that that was justified,

2

exonerating one of his own officers.

3
4
5
6
7

That is exactly why IPRA was
dismantled and COPA was created.
COPA was created because officers
protect officers.
What Superintendent Johnson did

8

is no different than what we've seen in the

9

history of IPRA, and it's no different than

10

what we've seen with regard to what Mayor

11

Emanuel acknowledged, a code of silence.

12

It is unacceptable for the City,

13

and I want to thank this Board for taking the

14

next step to lead to an objective evaluation of

15

this evidence.

16

there's more evidence out there to support

17

exactly what COPA found.

18

And I'm telling you that

Thank you for the opportunity.

Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones is very

close to my heart.

And I

I'm a landlord.

And when I went

18

back to work at my waitress job on the 27th of

19

December, and I saw the news, I was really

20

upset about it.

21

personally, because when you're a landlord, you

want to provide housing for people and to allow

people to live their life.

My condolences go out to you.

Rialmo needs to be fired.

This is

And I

6

talk to my customers, and I listen to them,

does include the police officers who are very

nice customers as well.

them what to think.

I don't tell them what I

do for my activism.

They don't know about

that.

But the general public
And I don't tell

I see and read the paper, and we
watch the news, and I ask them.

17

I also asked a ten-year-old child

18

that I babysit yesterday.

19

facts about this case, and he said, Why is that

20

man not fired?

21

I told him the basic

I said, I don't know.

And so I just think that if

22

you're concerned about the image of the police

23

in Chicago, this man has got to be fired.

24

Absolutely.

think this case is an example of that.

sorry, Bettie Jones and the other one.

And

I'm

analyze it, and I see the problem is I can't

Laquan McDonald.

I have the transcript of Pat

Camden, the media guy, saying the night of the

shooting he said, I did what I always do, I

7

lie.

8

corruption is, and this contract, they make it

9

so there can't be a citizen investigation.

They made -- the FOP is where the

10

They make it so -- they spend more money on

11

lawyering and protecting killer cops than they

12

do protecting the people.

13

this is corruption.

14

And the fact is,

I turned in a paper the last

15

couple of months ago, Crime, Corruption and

16

Cover-Up.

17

cover-up, systematic, and it starts with Rahm

Emanuel at the top.

19

starts.

20

say, one, you have to screen the people before

Emanuel to see that he worked for the Mossad.

1

I'm happy to see that COPA did

2

see that there is a cover-up and that this

3

officer should be fired.

4

this city is that you cannot reform something

5

that was never formed for the people.

6

But one thing about

Chicago Police has been corrupt

7

since Daley.

The first Daley.

From his son,

8

from the first Daley, to this Daley, and even

9

with Harold Washington.

It's called

10

suppression of evidence.

11

where the police cover up, from one generation

12

to the next generation to the now it's our

13

generation.

14

recognize this.

15

Continue to suppress

And you all do not want to

And for Eddie Johnson to say

16

that this officer should be fired, I guess not,

17

because his father is a rank-and-file fire

18

commander, just like Paul Bauer was, in the

19

fire department.

20

Nick Santos, or somebody, that got on the Mike

21

Flannery show before you made your decision,

22

Eddie, and said that you wasn't going to fire

23

him.

24

His godfather is the alderman

And he said that he didn't see a murder.
So these people, Paul Mc -- Garry

17

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

McCarthy, you all don't see a murder, so why

2

would you run for alderman and why would you

3

run for mayor, and why would you back them up

4

when they said that they don't see a murder.

5

They are defending they people.

6

So if they don't see a murder,

7

then you don't see a murder, then what are you

8

seeing that we see?

9

seen on tapes.

We don't see what is being

to hate you for it, you know, but I'm going to

be very, very disappointed in you.

8
9

So here's the bottom line.

I

have been working with this family for a very

10

long time, and I can tell you something that's

11

for absolute sure.

12

Jones should have been shot that night.

13

is no way that police officer should have been

14

able or should have even thought about shooting

15

at and/or near or around and in the vicinity of

16

Bettie Jones.

17

There is no way that Bettie

Okay?
I have read some of the things

18

where this man said that he saw her, he saw

19

her.

20

you see someone innocent standing behind

21

whoever you think is threatening you?

So how do you unleash seven bullets when

22

There's still a question of

23

whether or not Quintonio was actually where he

24

said he was.

1

But I still have a problem with

2

the fact that the police officer, his backup

3

didn't shoot Q.

4

danger, your backup shouldn't be tapping you on

5

your shoulder and saying watch out.

6

backup should be shooting the person who's

7

about to hit you in the head with a bat.

8

So if he didn't do it, it wasn't supposed to

9

happen.

10

Okay?

Because if you are in

Bettie should be here.

Your

Okay?

This

11

family should not be going through this.

12

the last thing -- thank you, Ghian, now shut

13

up.

14

And

My last thing is settle this

15

God-damn case.

16

There's no reason why an innocent person and an

17

innocent family should be drug through the mud

18

trying to get some money out of Chicago, the

19

City of Chicago.

20

family can move on and recover.

21

VICE PRESIDENT FOREMAN:

If you can give me one

Thank you, Mr. Preib.

MR. PREIB:

10

I just asked the officers

It is a tragic thing --

BOARD MEMBER O'MALLEY:

Come on, Sister,

it's not your meeting.

12

MR. PREIB:

It is a tragic thing to take

13

someone's life in the course of doing one's

14

job.

15

being forced to take a life to protect one's

16

own and then endure the process that today

17

results in such a decision is a peculiar kind

18

of madness.

19

A person never really gets over it.

But

I have come to learn that there's

20

only one true law in Chicago.

21

institution in the City exists only so far as

22

it serves as a political instrument to those in

23

power or those seeking.

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

today, for no person in their right mind can

2

argue that the actions of Officer Rialmo in

3

December of 2015 violated the use-of-force

4

rules.

5

The Center for Political Force

6

undermining our institutions are often

7

disguised as something other than what they

8

truly are, like claiming this despicable and

9

false Rialmo ruling is some kind of quest for

10

justice.

11

tactics and secrets, like hiding third-party

12

investigators from public view.

would expect from a Soviet satellite station or

an (inaudible).

16

It is not.

It is replete with rotten

Every now and then a kernel of
truth finds its ways into Chicago.

17

Recently two academics published

18

a report demonstrating that another po -- that

19

another politically motivated attack of the

20

police by the ACLU in 2015 led to a profound

21

decrease in the number of street stops and a

22

corresponding rise in the number of murders.

23

This report gave an academic voice to what most

24

police officers already know.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

22

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

The ACLU dressed up their motives

2

in the guise of social justice and civil

3

rights, but only carnage followed.

4

The findings of this academic

5

report will be ignored by COPA and this Board.

6

Ignored in the same way you have ignored the

7

large body of evidence that the wrongful

8

conviction movement, based on allegations of

9

police misconduct, is rife with fraud, costing

10

taxpayers millions of dollars and destroying

11

the lives of good police officers.

12

What you have done tonight is

13

paralyzed the police.

14

what he or she can do.

15

supposed to do their job?

16

No officer now knows
How then are the police

This Board and COPA and

17

the -- this Board and COPA and the media

18

advocates talk endlessly about the need for

19

transparency and holding police officers

20

accountable.

21
22

It's time you and COPA were also
held accountable.

MR. CARANZARA:

Superintendent, first of

2

all, I'd like to commend you for standing up.

3

It wasn't an easy decision to make, but you did

4

the right thing.

5

women, I applaud the fact that you took emotion

6

out of it, and you went with the facts.

7

On behalf of the men and

Now, in January or February of

8

'16, again in December of '16, I brought to

9

your attention the promotion of Commander

10

Barkley (phonetic), and the fact that he

11

sustained a complaint against him, yet he was

12

promoted twice, who is still on the job.

13

the time you told me you were going to look

14

into it.

It's been a year and a half.

SUPERINTENDENT JOHNSON:

You and I need to

talk offline.
MR. CARANZARA:

Secondly, in December of

18

'16, for the last time in the probably ten

19

years I've been bringing this up and still

20

haven't got an answer, the Cardinal's residence

21

gets police protection from the Chicago Police

22

Department 24 hours a day.

23

police protection.

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

they're crazy on the north side in the white

2

communities.

3

You know it.
I've heard you in your interviews

4

say you want the process to be fair.

5

emotions out of it.

6

can't take race out of it.

7

You were not the Superintendent of the people.

8

Rahm and the City Council circumvented the

9

system and now we have you.

10

Take

We're here today, you
And let's be clear.

So I'm saying it's time for Rahm

11

to go.

12

and I'm saying on record that Rahm is racist.

13

And I said it before.

14

Jewish community what he is doing to the black

15

community.

16

His executive leadership has failed,

He wouldn't do to the

Out of 1400 officers hired 2017,

17

according to Rahm, I want to know how many

18

officers are black.

19

know how many are black, because this Be The

20

Change campaign was to increase black officers.

21

I want to specifically

Violent neighborhoods.

When you

22

were out of that seat, there was another

23

officer there, I guess second deputy or deputy,

24

he said violent neighborhoods, his words, the

 Police Board Public Meeting - April 19, 2018

1

violent neighborhoods crime decreased.

2

if your officers go into neighborhoods with a

3

preconceived notion of violence, then that

4

presents a problem.

5

violent neighborhoods, I want to know which

6

neighborhoods are racist.

7

know how much of those officers come from those

8

identified racist communities and

9

neighborhoods.

10

Well,

So if he can identify

And then I want to

Training, you keep -- I'm not

11

trying to hear about implicit bias, unconscious

12

bias, social bias.

13

It is about the racism, and it's about the hate

14

of officers who hate this black skin.

15

I don't care about bias.

Now, you all can say it's not all

16

of them, but it's enough of them that we are

being murdered.
