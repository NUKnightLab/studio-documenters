BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
PRESIDENTIAL VETOES

Transmitting a Communication, dated February 27, 2004 from
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated, I hereby transmit to you my veto of Amendment 35 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation.
Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next meeting of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, March 9, 2004.

697

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto the motion approving Amendment number 35 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation
Ordinance adopted on February 24, 2004. This amendment calls for the Bureau of Administration
Human Resources to make a report within six months after the beginning of the fiscal year, identifying all
unfilled budgeted positions in every department and providing an explanation as to why each unfilled
position remained vacant.
I oppose this amendment on grounds that it is administratively impractical for the Bureau of
Administration Human Resources to determine why an unfilled position in departments throughout
County government is vacant at any point in time or for any length of time. Furthermore, the stated intent
of this amendment, to speed up the hiring process, reflects an intent of the legislative branch to interfere
with the discretion of the executive branch to administer personnel needs.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of Amendment 35.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to reconsider the vote by which
Amendment Number 35 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation was adopted. Commissioner Hansen
called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER THE VOTE BY WHICH AMENDMENT

Butler, Daley, Maldonado, Murphy, Sims, Steele, Stroger - 7.

Absent:

Moreno - 1.

The motion to reconsider the vote by which Amendment Number 35 to the FY 2004 Annual
Appropriation was adopted CARRIED.
Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to approve Amendment Number 35
to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation notwithstanding the veto of the President. Commissioner Hansen
called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO APPROVE AMENDMENT NUMBER 35 TO THE FY 2004
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE VETO OF THE PRESIDENT
Yeas:

Claypool, Collins, Gorman, Goslin, Hansen, Peraica, Quigley, Silvestri, Suffredin - 9.

JOHN H. STROGER, JR., President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated, I hereby transmit to you my veto of Amendment 36 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation.
Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next meeting of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, March 9, 2004.
Please be advised that I am hereby exercising my authority as President of the Board of Commissioners to
veto the motion approving Amendment number 36 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation Ordinance.
This amendment attempts to implement an executive compensation plan. Unfortunately the mechanism
provided in this amendment is overly simplified and will be nearly impossible to administer without
unfair and inconsistent results. I am submitting a memorandum from Mr. Kilgallon detailing his concerns
about implementing this amendment.
I call to your attention Amendment number 30 which I sponsored and the Board approved, calling for
development of an Executive Compensation Plan. In proposing this amendment, I committed to evaluate
the totality of issues surrounding the compensation for managerial level employees and to prepare a
detailed compensation plan with pay schedules for Board approval. I believe that a thoughtful plan must
precede any changes in the way we compensate our executive level employees.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of Amendment 36.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to reconsider the vote by which
Amendment Number 36 to the FY 2004 Annual Appropriation was adopted. Commissioner Hansen
called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:

COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
MID-YEAR BUDGET REPORTS AND ANALYSIS
WHEREAS, the traditional budget process which ensues at the end of the fiscal year does not allow
sufficient time to carefully analyze department and agency budgets; and
WHEREAS, by establishing a mid-year budget review, possibly in conjunction with budget transfers, the
County Board will have more time to evaluate current and proposed programs; and
WHEREAS, as part of this early budget analysis County offices, departments and agencies will be
required to submit annual reports to the Board of Commissioners for review; and
WHEREAS, the concept of these mid-year reports is to detail each office or agency's mandatory
obligations and the programs associated with those established obligations; and
WHEREAS, the annual reports should also detail each office or agency's discretionary programs, what
they cost, where the money comes from, who they serve, etc.; and
WHEREAS, to ensure that these annual reports are unifonn and relevant, the County Board will establish
specific criteria which reports must confonn to.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, that this Ordinance shall be assigned to the Finance Tax
and Revenue Subcommittee for discussion and further development of the parameters of the Annual
Budget Reports and Mid-Year Budget reviews; and

701

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that the criteria for the annual budget reports and mid-year budget
reviews be undertaken immediately and put in place for a 2004 mid-year review.

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
ROBERTO MALDONADO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is committed to respect the human rights of all people, including the right to
adequate housing for all; and
WHEREAS, an affordable housing crisis exists in Cook County as evidenced by the fact that there are
191 ,260 households in Cook County earning less than 30% of area median ($22,500 for a family of four)
who are rent burdened, meaning they pay more than 35% of their income for rent; and
WHEREAS, 7,280 households are on Cook County Housing Authority waiting lists for public housing
and housing choice vouchers; and
WHEREAS, HUD' s fair market rent for a 2-bedroom apartment in Cook County is $95 1.00; and a
household in Cook County earning 30% of area median income can only afford to pay $515.00 a month
for rent; and
WHEREAS, House Bill 4100, the Rental Housing Support Program, which is currently pending in the
Illinois General Assembly, would alleviate the affordable housing crisis in Cook County by creating a
rental subsidy program for households earning less than 30% of area median income funded by a new
$I 0.00 state surcharge for the recordation of any real estate related document and such surcharge would
be evidenced upon collection by a state seal from the lllinois Department of Revenue; and
WHEREAS, the program created by HB 4100 is modeled after a very successful program in Chicago, the
Chicago Low-Income Housing Trust Fund and the Trust Fund has been in existence for over ten years
and currently subsidizes over 2,000 units of housing in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in an estimated $14 million to be allocated to Chicago
and Cook County housing agencies to provide rental subsidies; and

702

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

WHEREAS, the passage of HB 4100 would result in at least 1,600 new units of affordable housing in
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, HB 4100, would create a new $10.00 state surcharge on real estate recordings to fund the
Rental Housing Support Program, with Cook County to receive $ 1.00 for every affected filing generating
an estimated $1.2 million to go directly to the County's general revenue fund to cover the County's costs
for collecting the fee created by the bill; and
WHEREAS, all of the funds generated in Cook County through the collection of the surcharge will go to
serve low income households in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Mayor Richard M. Daley and the City of Chicago are in support of HB 4100 and urge the
passage of the measure.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
Board does hereby declare its support for House Bill 4100 and urges the members of the Illinois General
Assembly to pass House Bill 4100, and in sequence, to urge the Governor to sign the measure into law.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations. (Comm. No. 2644 10). The
motion carried unanimously.

and FORREST CLAYPOOL, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, both the United States Constitution and the Illinois Constitution are intended to ensure the
freedom and equality of all citizens; and
WHEREAS, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens have yet to secure full legal protection in
either the United States or Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Constitution and the United States Constitution are the models for protecting
individual rights; and
WHEREAS, neither the Illinois Constitution nor the United States Constitution should be used to deny
the rights of anyone or to make segments of society second-class citizens; and

703

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

WHEREAS, proposed amendments to both the United States Constitution and the Illinois Constitution
which would define civil marriage as ' the union of a man and a woman' threaten to embed such
inequality permanently in our fundamental laws; and
WHEREAS, marriage law has traditionally been the purview of individual states, but a Federal
Constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman would effectively
prohibit the enactment of any State or local legislation that would provide for same-sex civil marriage,
and may also prohibit same-sex civil unions; and
WHEREAS, according to a I 996 United States General Accounting Office study, marriage in our society
currently confers over I ,049 Federal protections and benefits promoting the health and stability of its
citizens; and
WHEREAS, for the United States of America and the State of Illinois to introduce legislation that would
categorically deny rights to an entire segment of the population would be a large and unfortunate step
backwards in a long history of expanding civil rights, and the County of Cook has a long and proud
tradition of upholding and fighting for the rights of all its citizens; now therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the County of Cook opposes any amendment to the Federal Constitution or the
Illinois Constitution that would define marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the President of
the United States, Senate Majority Leader Frist, Speaker of the House Hastert and the members of the
Illinois Congressional Delegation ; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution shall be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to suspend the rules so that this

Transmitting a Communication from
JOHN W. DAVIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
On June 3, 2003, this Honorable Body authorized the conveyance of two excess parcels of real estate to
the Village of Skokie, which is assembling land for the construction of the proposed Holocaust Memorial
Museum. Those parcels were, in fact, conveyed to the Village of Skokie by quit claim deed.

requested that the County issue a quit claim deed to eliminate any possible cloud on title. The Cook
County Highway Department has no objections and concurs with this request.
Authority is hereby requested for the President and the County Clerk to execute and deliver a Quit Claim
Deed to the Lore) parcel to the Village of Skokie, for nominal consideration.
Approval recommended.

REALLOCATION OF INDEMNITY RESERVE. Transmitting a Communication, dated
February 27, 2004 from Peter N. Silvestri, Chairman of the Finance Committee's
Subcommittee on Litigation:
Re: Reallocation of Indemnity Reserve
Contract Modification #8 approved by County Board on April 15, 2003 Contract #97-501104 Rebid (Walsh/Riteway).
Please be advised that on December 3, 2003, the Litigation Subcommittee granted authority
to the Department of Risk Management to reallocate $450,000.00 of the Indemnity Reserve
($8.3 million) for payment of defense costs and fees to the law finn of Christiansen and Ehret
for general liability covered claims. John L. Hibbett, Director of Risk Management,
submitted this request.
On April 15, 2003, an indemnity reserve of $8.3 million was established to administer and
settle worker's compensation and liability claims arising out of the construction of the John
H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. These are claims which will not be paid by
insurance due to the liquidation of Reliance Insurance Companies. This reallocation was
accommodated within the Reserve without an increase in the total reserve.
For infonnation purposes, the focus of the work performed has been the exploration of other
sources of funds, such as insurance through subcontractors and the Illinois Guaranty Fund,
while initial discovery continued. This phase is now complete. $350,000.00 of the requested
amount is intended to cover fees and costs for discovery necessary to file summary judgment
motions or settlement discussions. Additional funds, about $100,000.00, are reserved for
such experts and trial costs.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

264005

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated February 2, 2004:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Countywide Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Study
and Renovations, Group II - Correctional Facilities and Group III - Hospitals. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This program addresses the concerns of the physically handicapped and the visually or
hearing impaired, regarding facility use and life safety issues. Public areas of County
facilities will be upgraded in accordance with Federal and State Americans with Disabilities
Acts (ADA).
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 2/19/04.
Commissioner Hansen asked how other amounts are being allocated.
Michael E. LaMont, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy stated that today the committee is
only acting on the $6.3 million and the remaining contingency.
Commissioner Hansen asked if the contingency has been approved.
Mr. LaMont stated that the contingency is the remainder of the appropriation minus the encumbrances,
and, additionally, he is not asking for a specific approval of contingency.
Commissioner Hansen suggested that the back up material should state the approval date.
Mr. LaMont stated that he will note Commissioner Hansen's suggestion.
Chainnan Sims asked whether the contingency is encumbered once the request is made by the vendor.
Mr. LaMont stated that the contingency at this stage of the project would be used for additional fees or
change orders, at the time that would need to be approved the Office of Capital Planning and Policy
would come back before the committee and note that what is being allocated for the change order is
coming out of the contingency.
Commissioner Collins asked what is the total amount of the project.
Mr. LaMont responded $ 12 million.
Commissioner Collins asked what percentage is set aside for a contingency contract.
Mr. LaMont stated about 10%. When starting out on an entire project about 10% to 20%.

Vice Chairman Butler, seconded by Commissioner Collins, moved approval of Communication No.
264005. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

264006

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated February 2, 2004:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for the Green Light Fixture Replacement Program, Phase II. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This project provides for the replacement of light fixtures at four outlying courthouses. The
placement of these new energy efficient fixtures will benefit the County with recognized long
term energy cost savings with an approximate three year return on investment.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 2/19/04.
Commissioner Hansen asked were is the 3 year estimate return.
Mr. LaMont stated that he will provide the Commissioners with the information.
Commissioner Moreno asked what is the status of the energy product that was produced by Electric City
that could save the County on the cost of electrical service.
Mr. LaMont stated that a pilot was done at the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center and one of the
garages. He stated that it is a product that regulates the voltage. Mr. LaMont further stated that it was
efficient in a place where the lights are always on, but in a room where you turn the lights on and off, it
was not found to be as efficient. Nothing else has been done at this time.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy should follow up on these
cost savings program.
Mr. LaMont stated that at 69 West Washington as the lighting is being replaced and the sprinklers are
being installed in the private offices, motion censors are being installed and are located at the light switch
and will go on right when you walk in the doorway. It can also be set if there is a time frequency and no
motion it will shut the lights off.
Commissioner Hansen asked Mr. LaMont to look into the escalators that run only when someone is on
the escalators which would help save money.
264007

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated February 2, 2004:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 7, payable to NATIONAL
RESTORATION SYSTEMS, INC., for the Department of Corrections Parking Garage
Renovation Project. This change order is for work necessary to complete the project. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
This change order will provide for repairs of the southwest and northwest stair/elevator
towers and for concrete repairs to nine existing columns. These repairs are for unforeseen
hidden conditions that were not part of the original contract.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 2/19/04.
Commissioner Gorman asked what the hidden conditions are.
Mr. LaMont stated that in the garage there are areas that not until you start the work can you see all the
underlying concrete conditions and additional work may be required by the contractor.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's question regarding the installation of the columns, Mr. LaMont
stated that it was in the late 70s or late 80s.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the useful life of the columns.
Mr. LaMont stated that the garage should be good for another 20 years.
Mr. LaMont stated that the damage that occurred in the parking garages is from the salt during the winter.
Commissioner Hansen stated the Office of Capital Planning and Policy should get together with Facilities
Management and try to resolve the salt problem.
Mr. LaMont stated that the brand of salt being used by the Sheriff's Office is no longer being used, but
salt is still being brought in by cars coming into the garage. He stated that the garage should be power
washed regularly; he will emphasize the problem with Facilities Management and make sure it gets done.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there was an expected life at the time of construction.
Mr. LaMont stated that the garage goes back to the 70s, but when the design criteria were discussed for
the new garage at the Skokie Courthouse it was for 40 years.
Commissioner Hansen stated that it is important to know what the estimated life longevity is on the
projects.
In response to Commissioner Peraica's statement that he is familiar with this location and that it was
recently renovated, Mr. LaMont stated that the work that is being discussed pertains more to the work
around the elevator itself and not the stairs. This project was not in the original scope. He further stated
that this work is not being duplicated.

B.

Evidence of such microchipping shall be entered on a certificate approved by the

Commissioner Butler asked if there was an implementation plan.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the effective date is immediate, but compliance is required within 90
days of the passage of the ordinance by the Board.
Commissioner Silvestri stated for the record that he would like to include in the report letters of support
in commendation for the Board from the Humane Society of the United States, The American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals and Dan G. Parmer, D.V.M., Administrator, Cook County
Department of Animal and Rabies Control. (The referenced document is on file in the County Clerk's
Office).
Commissioner Butler stated that the 90 day window was not enough time to notify everyone.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he agrees with Commissioner Butler. He stated that he was willing to
find a more acceptable date and amend it on its face.
Commissioner Butler stated he was concerned how the County would notify everyone in Cook County
who owns an animal not currently microchipped that they would have 90 days to comply with the
ordinance.

823

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

Commissioner Silvestri stated that the 90 day date was suggested by the Department of Public Health.
Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public Health, stated that Dr. Parmer was not
able to attend today's meeting because he was attending another meeting. Dr. Martin stated that
amending/extending the date would not be a problem. He further stated that the Department of Public
Health would work with Animal Control to get the word out.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Dr. Martin if he thought 180 days was sufficient. Commissioner Silvestri
stated that Kathy Kavanagh from the State's Attorney's Office was present at the meeting and helped
draft the ordinance.
Kathy Kavanagh, State's Attorney's Office, suggested that upon passage of the ordinance a press
conference would be held. She stated that many veterinarians are intrigued by the ordinance, and many
animals would be visiting their veterinarians for Spring health check ups and that this presents a huge
opportunity to get a lot of the animals done.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that a lot of the information on microchips will be disseminated through the
veterinarians and the Anti-Cruelty Society.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he was infonned by Dr. Parmer that the licensing is not contingent on
the microchipping.
Dr. Martin responded in the affinnative.
Commissioner Butler stated that the County should have a program that notifies everyone about the
microchip before going to the vet.
Chairman Collins asked whether the County could pay a fee to the microchip vendor to mount a public
relations program.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that Commissioner Collins had a great suggestion.
Dr. Martin stated that he would talk to Dr. Parmer regarding Commissioner Coll in' s suggestion.
In response to Commissioner Butler, Dr. Martin stated that the Department of Public Health and the
Animal Control Department can work together once the date is set and put a comprehensive public
relations program together. It would include not only reaching out to the press, but to the veterinarians as
well as the municipalities.
Commissioner Butler stated that he thinks it's not comprehensive enough.
Commissioner Gorman suggested that there should be a grace period after the 180 days.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the penalty provision include a warning upon the first violation if the
first violation occurs before April I, 2005 . That would give 180 days for compliance and 13 months
before actual penalty.
Chairman Collins asked what is the price of the microchip.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the microchip will cost the owners $ 15.00.

824

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 9, 2004

Commissioner Peraica asked ifthe County charges any fee for annual licensing.
Dr. Martin stated that he would have to get back to the Commissioner. Further he stated that the County
charges a fee for the rabies tag.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved to amend the effective date to
180 days. The motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Steele moved to amend Section C Penalty to
read as follows: Owner or custodian will receive a written warning upon the first violation prior to
April 1, 2005, after which the owner or custodian may be fined $20 per day for every day of noncompliance as to each animal owned. The motion carried.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved the approval of Communication
No. 262266, as amended. The motion carried.

WHEREAS, the United States' Congress introduced the Alternative Minimum Tax in 1978 to close
loopholes in the tax code that had enabled a small number of high income earners to avoid paying federal
taxes; and
WHEREAS, since 1978, the Alternative Minimum Tax has steadily extended its reach down the income
scale to include taxpayers from income groups that it was never intended to target; and
WHEREAS, the Alternative Minimum Tax is increasingly denying taxpayers' deductions and personal
exemptions under the standard income tax for middle income earners; and
WHEREAS, this situation has been created by the absence of adjustments for increases in inflation in
both the amount of taxable income and the exemptions under the Alternative Minimum Tax; and
WHEREAS, the impact of leaving the Alternative Minimum Tax in its present condition would be to
increase the tax burden on middle class Americans in Cook County and across the United States; and
WHEREAS, the Board of the National Association of Counties approved a motion by Commissioner
Carl R. Hansen to petition US lawmakers to refonn the Alternative Minimum Tax; now therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby encourage the
Illinois Congressional delegation to amend the Alternative Minimum Tax to include the indexing of
taxable income on which the tax is based to the annual rate of inflation, and the indexation of the
exemption granted under the Alternative Minimum Tax to the annual rate of inflation, from 2004 onwards
to eliminate the encroachment of this tax on middle income Americans.
