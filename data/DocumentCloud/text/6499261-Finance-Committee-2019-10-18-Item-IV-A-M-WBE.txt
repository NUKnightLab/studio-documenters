NOTE: The difference between Number of Contract Awarded and Number of Contracts with Goals = Contracts assigned a Contract specific goal of zero.
This means that there were no certified MWBEs to provide the specific Good, Service or Equipment.

May reflects a waiver where the vendor did achieve 5.33% MBE/WBE indirect participation but indirect participation is only considered a good faith effort. 
June reflects one full waiver and three partial waivers that caused a downward trend in participation.
