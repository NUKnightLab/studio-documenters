With respect to Ms. Kravitz’ private sector experience in government accounting

Ms. Kravitz’ strong background in government accounting and auditing, both in
the private and public sectors, will make her an asset to the Bureau of Finance as
the Comptroller.
I submit this communication for your approval.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans
Relations on 09-16-09.
Commissioner Daley asked Ms. Kravitz to provide a brief summary of the changes she would
like to implement were she to become the Cook County Comptroller.
Ms. Kravitz replied that what might be useful is a tracking system for invoices, as well as vendor
education concerning invoices.
Commissioner Daley suggested that the trial balance process be updated; currently the trial
balances arrive a few months behind schedule.
Mrs. Kravitz concurred.
Chairman Suffredin inquired whether Ms. Kravitz perceives any possible conflicts with the
current accounting firms with whom the County is working, based upon the subpoenas they
have received. He further inquired whether that would cause any delays in the processing of
the records and reports the County will need.
Ms. Kravitz replied in the negative. She stated that she has investigated these accusations very
thoroughly and she does not foresee any issues pertaining to issuing financial statements on
time.
Chairman Suffredin inquired whether the issuance of these subpoenas by a prosecutor’s office
will cause any potential conflict with the accounting firms being able to work with individuals
within the County’s Finance Department.
Ms. Kravitz replied in the negative.
Chairman Suffredin inquired how quickly Ms. Kravitz expects to be able to streamline and
computerize the trial balances, to achieve transparent and ease of search.
Ms. Kravitz replied that she would need help, and a database would need to be created; she
estimated overall this would take five or six months.
Commissioner Daley, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri, moved the Approval of
Communication No. 302612. The motion carried.
