4) 2017 Budget Modification for Security Cameras
There was a discussion that funds needed to be moved from another category in the
2017 budget to cover the expenses of replacing high definition security cameras. Cynthia
Ryan explained that security cameras were stolen in July 2017 off the rooftop of Paulina
Certified Market at 7622 N. Paulina, Chicago, Il 60626 and needed to be replaced with
four new security cameras. Funds were already used earlier in the year to replace all old
cameras in the Howard Street SSA with high definition cameras under the line item
“Safety Programs: Public Way Surveillance Cameras”. With replacing stolen cameras, this
line item went over the 2017 budget.
Cynthia Ryan proposed using funds allocated in the “Sustainability & Public Places: Place
Making” line item that has a budget of $20,000. Only $2394 had been used and no
other funds would be utilized for this line item in 2017. Cynthia Ryan proposed to move
$10,000 from “Sustainability & Public Places: Place Making” to “Safety Programs: Public
Way Surveillance Cameras” to cover the cost of the security cameras. Charlotte Walters

 moved to approve taking $10,000 from “Sustainability & Public Places: Place Making”
and placing it into “Safety Programs: Public Way Surveillance Cameras” for the 2017
budget to cover the security cameras. Barry Hoven second it. Motion passed
unanimously.
