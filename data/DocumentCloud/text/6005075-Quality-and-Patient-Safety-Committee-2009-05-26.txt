 Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Report of the Meeting of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee
May 26, 2009

ATTACHMENT #1 


 RE: Surgical Services Consolidation
My name is Diane Ellis. I am a PICU nurse and an NNOC member. I am here to
speak on behalf of the Registered Nurses of Cook County regarding the Surgical
Services Consolidation Project.
We understand CCHHS has an obligation to be fiscally responsible and do what
is necessary to efficiently use the County's lirnited resources for the delivery of
patient care. However, the County has contractual obligations with its registered
nurses which give our members rights. Our contract outlines these rights and
should be used as a guideline for any movement of our members.
To date CCHHS management, specifically Tom Daskus has engaged in activities
and inappropriate conduct in an effort to undermine our collective bargaining
agreement. His actions have been harmful to the process and are unjustifiable,.
Our ultimate goal is to ensure that we retain qualified nurses in the system. We
do not want to see a repeat of the mass exodus that played out in 2007.
To that end we have agreed to resume talks CCHHS regarding this consolidation
but we ask that the County follow our collective bargaining agreement in its
efforts. We call on this committee and the board as a whole to ensure that the
Registered nurses receive all the rights they are due.
We look forward to working with this committee and this board to ensure quality
RNs stay in the Cook County system through this consolidation and any that
follow.

Thank you,

Diane Ellis, RN

Backlog Status
Current Backlog:

for non-urgent, only do diagnostic tests, no
screening)
• Monthly appointment demand: 282
• Monthly appointment capacity: 158

• Monthly appointment demand: 758

SCC
Urology

Current backlog: 738
• Monthly appointment demand: 167
Monthly appointment capacity: 72

Action Needed
Backlog down from
4000 two years ago,
but growing again
from a low of 1000
12/08. More providers
and support staff
needed in Stroger
clinic R, plus space for
recovery area. More
capacity needed at OF
and Provident.
Stroger gynecology
needs to recover
positions lost in 2007,
to provide the badly
l1eeded services for
these patients.
Clinic capacity is one
challenge. More
difficult is the lack of
funding for the
prosthetics needed for
knees and hips. Over
90% of patients who
need knee or other
joint prosthetics do not
get them, despite
disabling pain and
difficulty walking.
Currently contacting
all patients on backlog
to assess need for test.

Lost most of its
providers in 2007.
Recruiting more staff,
need much more

 capacity to meet need.

Primary
Care

Current backlog: 260
Providing daily, systematic primary care
access to specialty clinics, ER, ASC, and
inpatients to refer to primary care.
Daily 40 slot allocation available to all sites.
Muchmore capacity needed. FQHCs a
potential partner for PC referrals.

. Backlog is for South
Suburban Clinics. To
be solved by new
PCPs getting hired for
Oak Forest Clinics

 Cook County Health and Hospital System 

Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

MOTIVATION FOR SURGERY CONSOLIDATION 

-

In Cook County, specialty care for the insured is the best in the
world.
­

-

In Cook County, specialty care (including surgical services) for
the uninsured is not adequate.

-

This creates a huge demand for surgical services within the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System.

-

A mismatch exists between facilities (Stroger, Provident and Oak
Forest) and utilization for surgical services with overutilization of
some resources and under utilization of others in the System.

 Cook County Health and Hospital System 

Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

MOTIVATION FOR SURGERY CONSOLIDATION

-

Stroger: High patient demand for both complex
and routine surgical services.

-

Provident and Oak Forest: Community Hospitals
with limited services, weak demand. Operating
rooms excessively (and inappropriately) staffed
for amount of surgeries performed.

 Cook County Health and Hospital System 

Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

MOTIVATION FOR SURGERY CONSOLIDATION

•

Authorization to move Stroger surgical specialists to off campus
locations (Provident and Oak Forest) to provide better access to
these specialists where they are closer to patients. New referral
source of paying patients for System. (Ophthalmology has done this
for 8 years).

•

Have expectations of sister community hospitals (Provident and Oak
Forest) realistically match capacity: Only perform outpatient surgery
at Provident and Oak Forest. Transfer all inpatient surgery to Stroger.

•

Saves costs for surgical care (OP vs. IP) while providing care at
Provident and Oak Forest for more 2nd tier of surgical patients that
currently do not receive care.

 Cook County Health and Hospital System
Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

MOTIVATION FOR SURGERY CONSOLIDATION 

-

Will permit 100% utilization of all three facilities (right now all 3
facilities have unused OR capacity "just in case" of an
emergency). Limit emergencies to 1 hospital - Stroger.

-

Building up clinics at Provident and Oak Forest will create local
referral network for operative cases at these locations.

-

By centralizing scheduling, selectively moving surgeons and
cases from Stroger to meet demand, and only performing
outpatient surgery at Provident and Oak Forest, can increase
surgical output and fill OR schedule at all 3 hospitals, and
increase needed capacity for performing complex surgical work
with high reimbursement (e.g. neurosurgery, vascular surgery,
orthopedics) at Stroger.

 Cook County Health and Hospital System

Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

Lack of OR capacity to meet need at Stroger
has insidious effects:
"Decay" of insured patient base:
Lack of capacity to schedule ("I can do your surgery here 3 months from
now").
Case cancellations (due to emergencies) without capacity to immediate
. rescheduling drives off insured patients, terrible customer service.

No existing Stroger OR capacity to serve insured patients that want to
come here with only 16 of 21 OR rooms staffed.

"Poaching" of insured patients.

8

 Cook County Health and Hospital System
Surgery Access and Enhancement Program
Lack of OR capacity to meet need at Stroger has insidious effects:
Every Stroger surgical division needs more OR time to meet demand of
patients seen in clinics.

Lack of OR capacity to meet need at Stroger
has insidious effects:
Diagnosing without treating is setup for liability expense.
We are immune from litigation for failure to diagnose, not
immune from litigation for failure to treat.

10

 ~----'

Cook County Health and Hospital System
Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

Lack of OR utilization at Provident and Oak Forest
also has insidious effects:
Provident and Oak Forest currently have low demand for flow
utilization of I surgical services.
Case volumes of some System surgeons is arguably too
low to maintain proficiency. Leads to poor outcomes.
Hard-working vs. non-working creates poor morale f
decreased productivity of hard working.

11

 Cook County He"81th and Hospital System 

Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

PROPOSAL:
Open all 21 operating suites at Stroger:
• 

Transferring to Stroger underutilized and misappropriated OR
nurses from Provident and Oak Forest.

• 

Transfer to Provident and Oak Forest OR technicians
(immediately improves cost I operation)

Centralize scheduling of operating suites across the System:
• 

Maximum utilization

• 

Penalize failure to utilize OR block scheduled time.
12

 Cook County Health and Hospital System
Surgery Access and Enhancement Program

PROPOSAL: 

-Cross-credentialing of physicians and mid-levels:
-Permits new surgical specialty clinics not offered at sister
locations to grow and meet need at more efficient cost.
-Perform new specialty outpatient surgery at Provident and Oak
Forest that is not being done. (piloted with General
Surgery)
-OR starting times @ 7:00 daily across System.
-Standardization of clinical/administrative procedures & protocols
across the System.
-Begin System-Wide 1st Case Delays reporting on June 1
-Stroger @ 9:30 am ( current schedule)
-Provident @ 9:45 am
-Oak Forest @ 10:00 am

Management of increase demand for surgical services
- Cook County Health System takes a vital role in
providing acceptable specialty surgical services
to the young and other uninsured, but frankly it
needs to provide competitive care for select
surgical problems that can attract paying patients.
- Contracting, purchasing, and accounts payable
functions are challenged and prevent adequate
inventory of surgical supplies.
