PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING A HEARING OF THE BOTANIC GARDEN COMMITTEE FOR A REPORT
FROM THE SENIOR STAFF OF THE GARDEN CONCERNING THE OPERATIONS AND
PROGRAMS OF THE CHICAGO BOTANIC GARDEN
WHEREAS, in 1962, the Chicago Horticultural Society agreed to help create and manage a new public
garden. With the groundbreaking for the Chicago Botanic Garden in 1965 and its opening in 1972, the
Society created a permanent site on which to carry out its mission; and
WHEREAS, the Garden has matured into one of the world’s great living museums and conservation
science centers. Within the nine laboratories of the Garden's Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Plant
Conservation Science Center, scientists and graduate students conduct a wide array of plant research. The
Garden is one of only 17 public gardens accredited by the American Association of Museums. Its
Lenhardt Library contains 150,000 volumes-including one of the nation's best collections of rare botanical
books; and
WHEREAS, the Garden has 50,000 members - one of the largest memberships of any U.S. botanic
garden. People of all ages, interests, and abilities participate in programs, take classes, and stroll the
grounds year-round. Annually, one million people visit its 27 gardens and four natural areas that are
uniquely situated on 385 acres on and around nine islands and six miles of lake shoreline; and
