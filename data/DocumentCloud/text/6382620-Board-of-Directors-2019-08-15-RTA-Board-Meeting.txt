[Draft 8/1/19

REGIONAL
TRANSIT AUTHORITY
OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN

 

 

REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN
FISCAL YEAR 2020 – DRAFT BUDGET
August 2019

The RTA spent the better of part of its Fiscal Year 2019 building partnerships with mobility providers and
other stakeholders as it sought to achieve its mission, including the preparation of an update to its
Regional Master Transit Plan. The recommended Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Regional Transit Authority (RTA)
operating budget is $ 4,631,506. The FY 2020 budget builds upon several of the accomplishments
started in 2019 and seeks to achieve a regional mobility vision that is built around four core principles:
-

Moving the Region’s People: Provides people with reliable, efficient, frequent, and

affordable transit services across a core transit network. • Supports access to jobs, education,
health care, special events and other daily needs for people who are more likely to use transit
based on ability, age or income. • Is flexible enough to keep pace with people’s ever-changing
needs as it relates to service frequencies and hours.

-

Investing in the Region’s Future: Increases the attractiveness of investment in Southeast

Michigan by providing sufficient mobility services that employers, businesses, the development
community, and the education system can depend upon. • Supports a talent pipeline in the
transportation services sector and other core economic sectors that are needed to deliver
mobility services today and into the future. • Establishes a framework that assures the region is
national leader in the implementation of new mobility services including the deployment of
connected and autonomous vehicles. • Ensures sustainability of existing and expanded mobility
services through the year 2045, allowing transit providers and other stakeholders to unlock
additional federal and state funding opportunities.

-

Enhancing the Region’s Quality of Life: Connects to the abundance of entertainment, parks,

open spaces and other recreational activities that exist across the region, giving people more
access and mobility choices to live, work and play across the region. • Makes transit and other
mobility services more user-friendly for all people choosing to use. • Improves bicycle and
pedestrian accessibility, giving people more choices to walk, bike and connect across the region.
• Improves the economic stability of the region and adds potential for more growth.
-

Connecting the Region’s Communities: Eliminates existing mobility deserts and connects

people in communities across the region with new transit and mobility services that today are
often very limited. • Leverages existing the region’s transportation assets, including the world
class Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport to allow more people to connect to and
through our region.

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance mobility options, to
improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic viability for the region.

 Like years past, there continues to
be many unanswered questions
with respect to what level of
investment our region will seek to
support for new or expanded
mobility options. RTA staff
remains fully cognizant of the fact
that budgets do, in fact, change
when circumstances change. The
following draft budget represents
the highest and best activities to
achieve the RTA’s mobility vision
within the RTA’s fiscal realities.
The 2020 budget has been prepared in accordance with the Michigan Uniform Budgeting and
Accounting Act of 1968, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and has been initially
reviewed by RTA’s Finance and Budget Committee. If approved by the RTA Board of Directors, this
budget will go into effect on October 1, 2019. RT A staff is pleased to submit this 2020 Budget to our
Board of Directors, the transit providers we coordinate with and the communities we serve, for review
and comment.

FY 2020 Budget
Each year the RTA sets an annual budget and does a three-year administrative outlook for planning
purposes. Based on estimated expenditures through June 2019, the RTA has prepared an estimate of
FY 2019 year-end closing balances. RTA has an estimated available funding carryover of $889,416 for FY
2020. The majority of this carryover is a result of cost-savings from the FY2019 budget, and federally
funded projects that took longer to procure and draw-down funds than anticipated.
FY2020 Proposed Revenue
Estimated Administrative Revenue: The RTA’s estimated administrative fund balance heading into FY
2020 includes funding from the following sources:
•
•

$ 764,766 in remaining funds from MDOT appropriation secured in previous fiscal years.
$124,650 in remaining funds from other funds.

Existing Grants Revenue: The RTA’s estimated grants fund balance includes funding from the following
grant:
•
•
•

$217,488 in remaining funds from the FTA 5339 Alternatives Analysis Planning grant and
associated state match secured in Fiscal Year 2013.
$235,773 in funds from the FTA 5310 for Mobility Management services
$661,406 in remaining funds from the FTA 5303 Metropolitan Transportation Planning Program

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

FY2020 Budget Narrative

 •
•
•

$526,823 in remaining federal funding (Transit Oriented Development funds - TOD/Earmark)
$450,00 in remaining federal funding (Earmark for AA to Detroit Rail Study)
$798,110 in remaining funding from the State of Michigan (Mobility Challenge Pilot Project)

The RTA anticipates that it will fully expend the balance of all of these grants in FY2020 for all of these
grants except for the 5303 funds that will span over two-fiscal years for the development of a regional
Coordinated Human Services Transportation Plan.
FY 2020 New Revenue:
MDOT has committed to provide an additional $135,893,000 in FY 2019 to continue supporting the
RTA’s Pilot Programs and administrative functions into FY 2020. At the time of the development of this
budget, the FY2020 State of Michigan budget has not been set. As such no specific commitment has
been made by MDOT for additional support for FY2020. For budgeting purposes, the RTA has assumed a
total of $400,000 of administrative support from the State of Michigan.
In FY2019 the RTA secured SDNT funding from MDOT to roll-out a data integration pilot project working
with the SMART. The RTA has assumed another $250,000 will be made available to implement the
second part (DDOT, AAATA) of this integration pilot project in FY2020.
The RTA has included $250,000 of speculative non-federal and state revenue sources in its FY2020
budget. It is assumed that this funding will directly support an expanded educational effort to
communicate the benefits of implementing the RTA’s 2020-2045 Mobility Vision.
As the federally recognized designated recipient for transit funds within the Southeast Michigan area,
the RTA also has several grant funded programs that it serves as a pass-thru agency. For these pass-thru
grants the RTA does not take any administrative draw-down, so there is no impact on the RTA budget.
FY2020 Proposed Budget
RTA’s FY 2020 budget begins on October 1, 2019 and runs through September 30, 2020. The FY2020
proposed budget identifies revenues totaling $4,729,080 and expenditures totaling $4,631,506. The
RTA’s operations are continued to be supported by an authorization provided by the Michigan
Department of Transportation and a proposed administrative capture of 5303 planning/research
funding available to support the development of a Coordinated Human Services Transportation Plan
(CHSTP), and two other federal grants/earmarks.
Compensation: The RTA currently has 3.5 FTEs. FY2020 expenditures are based on growing the RTA staff
to 5.5 FTEs with a projected total compensation of $749,984. This line item supports 5.5 full time
equivalents (FTEs) based on the following positions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

General Manager
Chief Financial Officer/Budget Manager
Program Manager (5310 Program & Grants)
Office Manager/Executive Admin/Accountant
Administrative Assistant
Intern

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

FY2020 Budget Narrative

 These proposed staffing levels would support the delivery of the following:
1) Added capacity and management for Federal and State Grant Oversight and compliance
roles identified in both annual and triennial comprehensive reviews completed by the State
of Michigan and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) respectively.
2) Development of a regional Coordinated Human Services Plan and associated Program
Management activities that come out of the development of the regional plan. Additional
support will be provided to assist with grant management and reporting functions.
3) Day to day operations of the agency with a focus on improving processes and programs
related to the delivery of regional programs that support the advancement of expanded
mobility options across are region. Specific initiatives include: Mobility Oriented
Development Study, expanded planning to support new commuter rail connections and a
single regional coordinated health and human services plan that the region’s providers can
point towards when developing their 5310 federal funding and program development.
RTA Administrative Contracts: Generally, the RTA Administrative Contracts remain largely unchanged
from previous years and will be used to support the day to day delivery of RTA’s service. Many of the
budget line items included in the draft budget are existing contracted services being provided to support
required activities to deliver the RTA work program and comply with Federal and State requirements.
These services include legal, audit, communications, legislative, and external communications services
that support staff and the Board of Directors requests throughout the fiscal year.
1.) Public Education Initiative/Outreach/Social Media: One of the lessons learned in 2018 is more
outreach is needed to better understand the overall mobility needs of our region including,
employers, educators, medical care providers, existing transit riders, new choice riders, and visitors.
More and different mediums
are also needed to help
educate the region on the
economic importance of
continued investment in
transit and mobility opt ions
as the region continues to
compete for new business
growth in a global economy
and a better quality of life
for the residents of the
region. Finally, as our
region continues to age,
fostering partnerships with
our medical providers will
continue to be one of our highest
priorities for providing expanded mobility options. Outcomes of this budget line item are
envisioned to produce expanded relationships, the creation and promotion of new materials
Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

 including videos, vignettes, printed material and other social media materials that will support the
implementation of the updated Regional Master Transit Plan.
2.) Development of a Comprehensive Implementation Plan (CIP): This line item will be used to develop
a Comprehensive Implementation Plan for those portions of the RTA who desire to advance forward
with specific implementation activities including a potential ballot initiative in November 2020. The
CIP is envisioned to be a rolling five-year plan that will describe the proposed service levels,
anticipated capital investment commitments, and other investments that the RTA will commit to
implement with dedicated funding. Given this will be the first formal CIP for the RTA, it is assumed
that a vendor will be contracted with to develop an overarching template that will address the
financial planning needs of those communities that will participate in the CIP process.
3.) RTA Program Planning Services Support: This budget line would be used to procure an as-needed
planning services consultant to support the day to day planning functions of the RTA. Envisioned
services would be project management of the RTA grants including RFP development, procurement
assistance, and consultant oversight, FTA grants management and reporting assistance, services
required to respond to RTA’s FY 2016-FY2018 Comprehensive Review, Board of Director’s planning
support, Pilot project development and implementation support, coordination with existing transit
providers and 5310 contracts, on-going planning outreach, as needed coordination with FTA and the
State of Michigan, and other services deemed necessary to deliver the FY 2020 RTA work program.
RTA Fixed Grants: The following are major fixed grant project/program initiatives that the RTA will
undertake in FY 2020:
1.) Regional Coordinated Human Services Plan: The RTA has completed procurement activities in 2019
and will kick-off the planning efforts in August
2019. Outcomes of this study will include the
assessment of regional transportation needs of
seniors and the disa bled, ultimately developing a
regional coordination plan for related
transportation services in Southeast Michigan.
This plan will reflect both regional and locallyspecific needs, including the option for
communities and agencies to maintain their own
local planning documents fitting within an agreedupon regional planning and policy framework.
The plan is needed to provide uniformity in the
analysis of system gaps, users, providers, and
origins and destinations, identify local priorities in
the City of Detroit, SMART service area, and
Washtenaw County, and to identify opportunities
to coordinate regional implementation of
overlapping local goals.
Currently, three of these agencies create their own
federally mandated Coordinated Human Services-Public Transportation Plans to fulfill requirements
Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

FY2020 Budget Narrative

 of the Section 5310 Program Guidance. Ultimately it is envisioned that one regional plan will
improve mobility for seniors and individu als with disabilities throughout the country by removing
barriers to transportation services and expanding the transportation mobility options available. FTA
provides Section 5310 grant funds for capital and operating expenses to recipients for public
transportation projects that meet the special needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities.
The RTA, as the Designated Recipient of Section 5310 funding for the Detroit and Ann Arbor
Urbanized Areas, has been asked by both state and federal officials to increase their role in the
coordinated planning and funding administration processes.
2.) Mobility Oriented Development (MOD) Study: The RTA completed procurement activities in 2019
and issued a Notice to Proceed in July 2019. This budget line item is being used to develop land use
and mobility development strategies and
typologies to suit the diverse station areas in
the regional transit network with a focus on the
Woodward and Ann Arbor to Detroit corridors.
This scope of work is focusing on the station
areas currently served by the SMART
Woodward FAST service (Routes 461 and 462)
on the Woodward corridor, and the existing
Amtrak Wolverine Line on Ann Arbor to Detroit
corridor. The plan will allow transit providers,
local governments, and transportation agencies
to have a framework for coordinating
development and mobility improvements with
the goal of providing the citizens of the region
better access to core regional transit services.
Each typology will be informed by two critical
layers of analysis: 1) real estate development
potential, and 2) local mobility and accessibility potential. The final study deliverable is envisioned
to serve as a template that can be applied to other rapid corridors in the updated RMTP.
3.) Ann Arbor to Detroit Commuter Rail Technical Analysis: This budget line is being funded 100% by an
existing federal earmark grant that is intended to evaluate the feasibility of expanded commuter rail
service between Washtenaw County (Ann Arbor) and Wayne County (Detroit). The draft Connect
Southeast Michigan plan includes proposed commuter rail service (eight trips per day) connecting
Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Wayne, Dearborn and mid-town Detroit. Interest has been expressed as part
of outreach held on the draft Connect Southeast Michigan plan to expand service levels and
potentially provide service extensions on both the east (to downtown Detroit) and west ends
(Chelsea) of the proposed service. This line item will be used to complete a study that will evaluate
the technical merits of requested extensions, including required capacity improvements, and
develop an estimated cost for these suggested changes. Outcomes of this study will be used to
evaluate the feasibility of making potential changes to the draft Connect Southeast Michigan Plan.

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

 4.) Data Integration Pilot Project: This budget line is being used to fund the second part of a data
integration pilot project that allows users to instantly pinpoint where and when performance issues
are occurring. Users can quickly visualize and understand system performance, including on-time
performance, running times, historical vehicle speed heat maps, and more. The objectives of the
pilot study are to work with AAATA and DDOT to test this software platform in FY2020.
5.) Michigan Mobility Challenge Grant: This budget line is being used to fund to develop a mobile
booking application for ADA paratransit trips. The RTA has partnered with the Southeast Michigan
Council of Governments (SEMCOG), the Area Agency
on Aging 1-B (AAA1B), the Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority (AAATA), the Detroit
Department of Transportation (DDOT), and the
Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional
Transportation (SMART) to secure a grant from
the State of Michigan to improve the experience
of ADA paratransit riders in the areas they serve.
This partnership has engaged with Menlo
Innovations to design a system that allows users
to manage and book ADA paratransit rides across
multiple counties.
The goal of this project is to design and
implement a solution that focuses on a way for a
paratransit rider to easily request a ride through a
mobile app, as well as see up to date information
about that ride. Additionally, the solution should provide an interface for schedulers to interact
with digital ride requests, while reducing call volume and preventing invalid requests from being
sent.
While there are a number of “pain points” the riders and transit authorities experience, this project
has specifically focused on alleviating the riders experience of long hold times and time-consuming
repetitive scheduling. In addition, the solution provides a way for riders to cancel a ride without
waiting on hold easing the process for the rider and potentially reducing “no-shows” and late
cancelations.
RTA Other Expenses: Other Expenses generally remain unchanged from FY 2019 with a slight increase
attributable to increase the overall size of RTA staff in FY 2020.
FY2020 is projected to close with a surplus of approximately $97,574.

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

FY2020 Budget Narrative

 RTA Other Priorities: The RTA has several other priorities that it is currently seeking funding to advance
including:
-

Ann Arbor to Detroit Commuter Express Pilot: Working with the AAATA and MDOT, the RTA
and TheRide are pursuing funding to allow for a new express bus service between Detroit and
Ann Arbor. The success of this idea will hinge on State and federal funding applications.

-

Municipal Mobility Pilot Project: Working with Planet M, MDOT, and SMART, the RTA is
pursuing funding to establish a pilot program that will seek to pair promising mobility solutions
with participating municipalities in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties to solve specific
mobility challenges that face the Metro Detroit region. These challenges include how to best
serve areas of the suburban Detroit region that have a reasonable propensity for transit, but
have been developed over time in a way that makes it difficult to serve efficiently with
traditional fixed route transit lines (e.g. lower-density, auto-oriented land use pattern). The
success of this pilot program will hinge on funding.

-

Workforce Development Task Force: In May 2019, the RTA Board of Directors held a retreat to
identify current and emerging priorities. One of the priorities that was identified was the
establishment of a regional workforce development task force. Southeast Michigan transit
providers are experiencing shortages in certified operators (drivers) and qualified diesel engine
mechanics. There are three parts of the staffing issues:
•
•
•

Recruitment
Training
Retention

These staffing shortages have led to difficulties in meeting pullout. If the staffing shortages
continue, or worsen, the RTA’s plans for significant improvement in transit services will be
neutralized.
This is not only a problem for RTA planning. It is an ongoing problem for the transit providers’
abilities to meet current performance objectives and desired service levels. Solutions will be
extremely difficult, if not impossible for transit providers to address on their own. Collectively,
through the RTA, there is a better chance to identify and implement possible solutions.
-

Our mission is to manage and secure transportation resources that significantly enhance
mobility options, to improve quality of life for the residents and to increase economic
viability for the region.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEMORANDUM

TO:

Executive and Policy Committee/Finance and Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Matt W. Webb, General Manager

SUBJECT:

Fiscal Year 2021 & Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Scenarios

DATE:

August 14, 2019

REQUESTED
ACTION:

No Action – For Information Only

The purpose of this memo is to present two budget scenarios for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 and FY
2022. This information is being presented for information and discussion purposes only.
As a best practice, the RTA has always included a three-year budget look ahead as part of its
annual budgeting process. For the FY 2020 budgeting process, two separate budget forecasts
have been developed around two alternatives scenarios:
•
•

Scenario A - No action taken in November 2020
Scenario B - Successful Ballot Referendum is passed in November 2020

Each scenario presents different opportunities and challenges for the RTA. The attached sheets
present two possible budgeting approaches, both will require continued support from the State
of Michigan. The FY2021 Scenario A forecast assumes either a larger share of State of Michigan
funding coming to the RTA to support a limited level of staff and work activities. The other
option for revenue could include the possibility of the RTA to draw Local Bus Operating (LBO)
funds in FY 2021 to support the administrative functions of the agency. This would represent a
worse-case option.
For the FY2021 Scenario B, the budgeting process will need to consider options to finance the
gap of when available of funding will come to the RTA is a referendum is successful. Based on
previous projections in 2016, the operations of the first two quarters of the year will be
impacted until revenue is collected from the 2020-2021 winter tax bill.
These are preliminary budget projections and should be treated accordingly. All assumptions
and forecasts are subject to change based on the events of FY 2020.

DRAFT - DBE GOAL:
FY2020-FY2022

Information found in this document can be provided in an alternative format upon request.
Please contact the Regional Transit Authority at 313-402-1020 to speak to a representative or
e-mail info@rtamichigan.org. The RTA will do its best to provide the requested alternative
format within a reasonable time.

 REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY OF SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN
FISCAL YEARS 2020 – 2022
DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE (DBE)
GOAL-SETTING METHODOLOGY
FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION (FTA) FUNDED PROJECTS
As required in 49 CFR Part 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Participation by Disadvantaged Business
Enterprises in Department of Transportation Financial Assistance Programs, the Regional Transit Authority
(RTA) of Southeast Michigan has completed its triennial review and set an overall goal for Disadvantaged
Business Enterprise (DBE) participation for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2020 – 2022 contracts funded in whole or in part
with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funds. The recommended goal of 8.26% attained through 4.51%
from race neutral participation and 3.75% from race-conscious measures reflects the relative availability of
DBEs to participate in contracts and procurements projected by the RTA of Southeast Michigan.
The term “Marketplace” is defined as businesses located in the State of Michigan, that are both Disadvantaged
Business Enterprises (DBE) and Non-Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, who are ready, willing and able to
participate in RTA of Southeast Michigan contracts.
In accordance with 49 CFR Section 26.45, RTA’s proposed goal will be published in media outlets, listed in
Appendix A.
METHODOLOGY
RTA considered a two-step process defined below to determine its DBE participation goal for FY2020-2022.
STEP 1) Determine the Base Figure for the overall goal:
•

Calculate the relative availability of DBEs to perform the types of work forecasted by RTA of Southeast
Michigan.

•

Weight the respective contract dollars to be expended in each type of federally-assisted project or
procurement.

•

Determine the weighted DBE relative availability in the projected types of work.

•

Aggregate the weighted availability figures to determine the base figure.

STEP 2) Adjustments to the Base Figure:
•

Due to the difference in types of projects and projected costs of projects, the RTA will be making no
adjustments to the Base Figure based on historical data or disparity studies.

Additionally, the methodology includes an explanation of how the forecasted overall goal will be achieved.

DRAFT - RTA DBE GOAL: FY2020 – FY2022

1

 Goal Calculation for FY2020-2022
STEP 1:

Determine the Base Figure for the Overall Goal

The RTA of Southeast Michigan determined that the Michigan Unified Certification Program (MUCP) database of
Michigan DBEs and the 2016 United States (U.S.) Census Bureau data for Michigan provided relevant and reliable
data to assess RTA’s marketplace availability to DBEs operating within RTA geographic area, and for identifying DBEs
capable of completing or contributing to future RTA opportunities. This approach was taken for the following reasons:
•

All DBEs certified to work in Michigan are tracked by type of work and by their approved North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes on the web-based MUCP database located at

The U.S. 2016 Economic Census data provides economy-wide statistics for Michigan, including the number
of vendors by NAICS code on both a state-wide and county-wide basis. The county-wide data for the
RTA’s area (Macomb, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne Counties) was aggregated to develop an RTA
coverage area.

The RTA’s core services that are funded with partial/full federal funding is currently and anticipated during the
triennial period to be limited to communications, public relations, engineering and planning/landscape architecture
related services. As such the following NAICS codes were used to determine the base figure for RTA services:
•

541840

Communications

•

541820

Public Relations

•

541330

Engineering

•

541320

Urban Planning/Landscape Arch.

Table 1.0 lists the number of DBE firms willing and able to work in the market area for the defined RTA practice areas
listed in the MUCP. Table 1.0 also lists the overall firms willing and able to work in the RTA coverage area defined by

Adjustments to the Base Figure

RTA will be making no adjustments to the Base Figure based on historical data or disparity studies, the
DBE participation goal for the next tri-annual period will be set at 8.26%.
The current projects RTA has planned for the FY2020 goal period are different enough compared to the projects
from FY2017 – 2019. Due to the difference in projects planned and the difference in funding levels for projects
being continued or finished during this tri-annual period, RTA sees no reason to adjust the Base Figure using
historical DBE participation from its previous DBE goal.
Evidence has shown that DBEs have participated in the past projects RTA has put out to bid, these DBEs have
provided a wide range of goods and services with no evidence of disparity. No known statistical or anecdotal
evidence of over utilization or under-utilization of disadvantaged businesses exists within the RTA coverage area.

RTA has set a DBE goal of 8.26% for FY2020 – 2022

 RECOMMENDATION for RACE-NEUTRAL (RN) MEANS
The RTA expects to meet the maximum feasible portion of its overall goal by using race-neutral means of facilitating
DBE participation. We estimate that in meeting the overall goal of 8.26%, the RTA of Southeast Michigan will obtain
4.51% from race neutral participation and 3.75% from race-conscious measures.
The following is a summary of the basis of our estimated breakout of race-neutral and race-conscious DBE
participation:
•

In the previous triennial period, the RTA’s DBE goal was 8.8% of which 3.1% will be obtained from raceneutral participation and 5.7 through race-conscious measures.

•

During this period, the RTA had an actual DBE participation of 12.00% of which 4.00% was race neutral.

The RTA will consistently examine the effectiveness of using race-neutral means to ensure proper DBE participation
and will continue to evaluate the rational for establishing a race neutral goal.
Outreach to Minority and Women’s Groups
The RTA conducted consultation with the following minority, women’s, and business organizations were coordinated
with when establishing the RTA’s DBE goals. RTA sent correspondence out to the following groups to seek input on
the FY2020 – 2022 goal. Consultation is intended to review the proposed overall DBE goal, receive comments, to
obtain information concerning the availability of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged businesses, the effects of
discrimination on opportunities for DBEs, and help the RTA build long-term contracting relationships with DBEs in the
market area. In addition, staff commits to participate in local events in the upcoming year to increase awareness of
future RTA opportunities including those identified below.

regard must be determined by RTA to be either a defect that RTA will waive in
accordance with Acceptance/Rejection of Proposals or that the proposal can
be sufficiently modified to meet these requirements.

2.

Proposal price will not render this procurement financially infeasible, or it is
reasonable that such proposal price might be reduced to render the
procurement financially feasible. Any extreme proposal deficiencies, which
may render a proposal unacceptable, will be documented.

3.

No information, financial or otherwise, will be provided to any Offeror about any
of the proposals from other Offerors during the evaluation period.

Confidentiality of Proposals

writing the party involved. The party involved must respond within twenty (20) calendar
days with the identification of any and all proprietary, trade secret, or confidential
commercial or financial information and the party involved shall indemnify RTA’s defense
costs associated with its refusal to produce such identified information; otherwise all other
requested information may be released in accordance with FOIA.
RTA shall employ sound business practices no less diligent than those used for RTA’s
own confidential information to protect the confidence of all licensed technology, software,
documentation, drawings, schematics, manuals, data and other information and material
provided by Offerors and the Contractor pursuant to the Contract which contain
confidential commercial or financial information, trade secrets or proprietary information
as defined in or pursuant to the State of Michigan against disclosure of such information
and material to third parties except as permitted by the Contract. The Contractor shall be
responsible for ensuring that confidential commercial or financial information, trade
secrets or proprietary information, with such determinations to be made by RTA in its sole
discretion, bears appropriate notice relating to its confidential character.

SECTION II: SCOPE OF SERVICES
The Contractor is expected to deliver feasibility level planning analysis to support the RTA
on the following tasks related to the proposed Ann Arbor to Detroit Commuter Rail Project:
Task 1 – Project Management & Coordination
• Provide monthly progress report highlighting the progress achieved, and
identification of issues that may result in schedule delays or budget overruns
• Coordination with key stakeholders along the Ann Arbor to Detroit Commuter
Rail corridor, including but not limited to the underlying owners of the rail lines,
property owners adjacent to the rail lines that may or may not be needed to
accommodate proposed maintenance facilities/layover space/stations.
• Coordinate with other RTA vendors working on the Mobility Oriented
Development Study as directed by the RTA
Task 2 – Cost Estimate Review:
•

•

Review the cost estimates and assumptions developed in 2016 and make
necessary updates accounting for changes in economic conditions, changes in
underlying ownership, changes in capacity needs along the corridor, changes
in labor markets, and other contributing factors that may have caused the 2016
cost estimates to change greater than the rate of inflation over the same period.
Develop updated cost estimates given the outcomes of Task 3
6

 •

Identify risks associated with the newly developed cost estimate and conduct
a Monte Carlo Simulation to provide the RTA with an updated probable range
of cost for the Ann Arbor to Detroit Commuter Rail Project.

Task 3 – Evaluate Feasibility/Space Needs of Terminals:
Since the 2016 cost estimates were developed, several changes have occurred to land
uses along the Ann Arbor to Detroit commuter rail corridor. In particular there may be
new opportunities at both the east and west terminals to provide additional capacity and
leverage existing investments to provide space for the RTA’s proposed service to conduct
light duty maintenance or complete staging activities. To evaluate the feasibility of these
new opportunities, the RTA is requesting the Contractor to:
• Develop desired terminal layout for the east end assuming a connection to the
Michigan Central Depot (MCD) facility owned by Ford Motor Company.
Vendor shall coordinate with the Ford Campus Planning Team to develop
conceptual terminal layouts.
• Develop two proposed terminal layouts for the west end terminus; 1.) at the
proposed Ann Arbor Amtrak station, and 2.) in the vicinity of Dexter/Chelsea
• Develop updated cost estimates for each of these proposed terminal layouts
• Develop SWOT analysis for each of these proposed terminal layouts
• Identify any mainline capacity improvements that might be needed associated
with connecting to MCD on the east and Dexter/Chelsea on the west.
• Identify significant implementation challenges with any of the proposed
terminus options.
Task 4 – Summarize Findings:
• Vendor shall summarize findings of Tasks 2 & 3 in an electronic report format
acceptable to the RTA
• RTA and its stakeholders shall have an opportunity to review and comment in
a timely manner on all proposed deliverables
• Outcomes of this task will be used to support future funding requests so clarity
of findings is a must

No member of or delegate to the Congress of the United States of America, or Resident
Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of this agreement or to any benefit to arise,
herefrom.
ARTICLE XIX. CONTINGENT FEES
The Contractor warrants it has not employed or retained any company or person, other than bona
fide employees working solely for the Contractor to solicit or secure this Agreement, and that it
has not paid or agreed to pay any company or person, other than bona fide employees working
solely for the Contractor, any fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gifts, or any other
consideration, contingent upon or resulting from the award or making of this Agreement. For
breach or violation of this warranty, the RTA shall have the right to annul this Agreement without
liability or, at its discretion, to deduct from the fees due the Contractor, or otherwise recover, the
full amount of such fee, commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift or contingent fee.
ARTICLE XX. GRATUITIES
Section A. The RTA may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor
to proceed under this Agreement if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the RTA that gratuities
(in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any
agent or representative of the Contractor, to any official or employee of the RTA with a view
toward securing a contact of securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or
amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performance of this Agreement:
Provided, that the existence of the facts upon which the RTA makes such findings shall be in issue
and may be reviewed in proceedings pursuant to the "Disputes" Article of this Agreement.

29

 Section B. In the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section A., hereof, the RTA
shall be entitled (a) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the
event of a breach of the Agreement by the Contractor, and (b) as a penalty in addition to any other
damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined
by the RTA) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the costs incurred by the
Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.
Section C. The rights and remedies of the RTA provided in this Article shall not be exclusive and
are in addition to any rights and remedies provided by law or under this Agreement.
ARTICLE XXI. PRICING OF ADJUSTMENTS
When costs are a factor in any determination of a contract price adjustment pursuant to the
"Changes" Article or any other provision of this Agreement, such costs shall be in accordance with
48CFR Part 31.
ARTICLE XXII. EXCUSABLE DELAY
Except with respect to defaults of subcontractors the Contractor shall not be in default by reason
of any failure in performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (including any failure
by the Contractor to make progress in the prosecution of the work hereunder which endangers such
performance) if such failure arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or
negligence of the Contractor. Such causes may include, but are not restricted to: acts of God or of
the public enemy; fires; floods; epidemics; quarantine restrictions; strikes; freight embargoes; and
unusually severe weather; but in every case the failure to perform must be beyond the control and
without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. If the failure to perform is caused by the failure
of a subcontractor to perform or make progress and if such failure arises out of causes beyond the
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault or negligence of either of
them, the Contractor shall not be in default, unless (a) the services to be furnished by the
subcontractor were obtainable from other sources, (b) the RTA shall have ordered the Contractor
in writing to procure such supplies or services from such other sources, and (c) the Contractor shall
have failed to comply reasonably with such order. Upon request of the Contractor, the RTA shall
ascertain the facts and extent of such failure, if he shall determine that any failure to perform was
occasioned by any one or more of the said causes, the delivery schedule shall be revised
accordingly, subject to the rights of the RTA under the Article hereof entitled "Termination". (As
used in this Article, the terms "subcontractor" and Subcontractors" mean subcontract(s) at any
tier.)
ARTICLE XXIII. PRICE REDUCTION FOR DEFECTIVE COST OR PRICING DATA
Section A. If the RTA determines that any price, including profit, negotiated in connection with
this Agreement or any cost reimbursable under this Agreement was increased by any significant
sums because the Contractor, or any subcontractor furnished incomplete or inaccurate cost or
pricing data or data not current as certified in its certification of current cost or pricing data (EPA
Form 5700-41), then such price or cost or profit shall be reduced accordingly and the Agreement
shall be modified in writing to reflect such reduction.
Section B. Failure to agree on a reduction shall be subject to the "Disputes" Article of this
Agreement.

30

 ARTICLE XXIV. LIMITATION OF COST
Section A. It is estimated that the total cost to the RTA for the performance of this Agreement,
exclusive of any fee, will not exceed the estimated cost set forth in the Compensation Article, and
the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Scope of Services
and all obligations under this Agreement within such estimated cost. If, at any time, the Contractor
has reason to believe that the costs which it expects to incur in the performance of this Agreement
in the next sixty (60) days, when added to all costs previously incurred, will exceed seventy-five
percent (75%) of the estimated cost then set forth in the Compensation Article, or if, at any time,
the Contractor has reason to believe that the total cost to the RTA for the performance of this
Agreement, exclusive of any fee, will be greater or substantially less than the then estimated cost
hereof, the Contractor shall notify the RTA in writing to that effect, giving its revised estimate of
such total cost for the performance of this Agreement.
Section B. Except as required by other provisions of this Agreement specifically citing and stated
to be an exception from this Article, the RTA shall not be obligated to reimburse the Contractor
for costs incurred in excess of the estimated cost set forth in the Compensation Article, and the
Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance under this Agreement (including actions
under the Termination Article) or otherwise to incur costs in excess of the estimated cost set forth
in the Compensation Article, unless and until the RTA shall have notified the Contractor in writing
that such estimated cost has been increased and shall have specified in such notice a revised
estimated cost which shall thereupon constitute the estimated cost of performance of this
Agreement. No notice, communication, or representation in any other form or from any person
other than the RTA shall affect the estimated cost of this Agreement. In the absence of the specified
notice, the RTA shall not be obligated to reimburse the Contractor for any costs in excess of the
estimated cost set forth in the Compensation Article, whether those excess costs were incurred
during the course of the agreement or as a result of termination. When and to the extent that the
estimated cost set forth in the Compensation Article has been increased, any costs incurred by the
Contractor in excess of the estimated cost prior to such increase shall be allowable to the same
extent as if such costs had been incurred after the increase; that the increase is solely for the purpose
of covering termination or other specified expenses.
Section C. Change orders issued pursuant to the Changes Article of this Agreement shall not be
considered an authorization to the Contractor to exceed the estimated cost set forth in the
Compensation Article in the absence of a statement in the change order, or other contract
modification, increasing the estimated cost.

By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective lower tier participant is
providing the certification set out below.

The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was
placed when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that the
prospective lower tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in
addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or
agency with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including
suspension and/or debarment.
The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the
person to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective lower tier
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become
erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.

The terms “covered transaction”, “debarred”, “suspended”, “ineligible”, “lower tier
covered transaction”, “participant”, “person”, “primary covered transaction”, “principal”,
“proposal”, and “voluntary excluded”, as used in this clause, have the meanings set out in
the Definitions and Coverage sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549.
You may contact the person to which this proposal is submitted for assistance in obtaining
a copy of those regulations.
The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the
proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower
tier covered transaction with a person who is debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or
voluntarily excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by
the department or agency with which this transaction originated.
The prospective lower tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it
will include this clause titled “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension,
Ineligibility, and Voluntary Exclusion – Lower Tier Covered Transaction”, without
modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier
covered transaction.
A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not debarred, suspended,
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the

certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which
it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to,
check the Nonprocurement List (Telephone No. (517) 335-2513 or (517) 335-2514).

Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be considered shall be construed to require
establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification
required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to
exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of
business dealings.

Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these instructions, if a
participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered
transaction with a person who is suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded
from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the
Federal Government, the department, or agency with which this transaction originated
may pursue available remedies, including suspension and/or debarment.

2045 Vision

To better meet the needs of the people of the Southeast Michigan region, requires the
implementation of a regional mobility vision that seeks to achieve the following:

•

Provides people with reliable, efficient, frequent, and affordable transit
services across a core transit network.

•

Supports access to jobs, education, health care, special events and other
daily needs for people who are more likely to use transit based on ability, age
or income.

•

Is flexible enough to keep pace with people’s ever-changing needs as it
relates to service frequencies and hours.

•

Increases the attractiveness of investment in Southeast Michigan by providing
sufficient mobility services that employers, businesses, the development
community, and the education system can depend upon.

•

Supports a talent pipeline in the transportation services sector and other core
economic sectors that are needed to deliver mobility services today and into
the future.

•

Establishes a framework that assures the region is a national leader in
the implementation of new mobility services including the deployment of
connected and autonomous vehicles.

•

Ensures sustainability of existing and expanded mobility services through the
year 2045, allowing transit providers and other stakeholders to unlock
additional federal and state funding opportunities.

•

Connects to the abundance of entertainment, parks, open spaces and other
recreational activities that exist across the region, giving people more access
and mobility choices to live, work and play across the region.

•

Makes transit and other mobility services more user-friendly for all people
choosing to use.

•

Improves bicycle and pedestrian accessibility, giving people more choices to
walk, bike and connect across the region.

•

Improves the economic stability of the region and adds potential for more
growth.

•

Eliminates existing mobility deserts and connects people in communities
across the region with new transit and mobility services that today are often
very limited.

•

Leverages the region’s existing transportation assets, including the worldclass Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport to allow more people to
connect to and through our region.

 Transit and
Mobility Today

For Public Review
Summer 2019

Overview
Five transit systems currently provide service to people across southeast Michigan: the Ann Arbor Area
Transportation Authority (AAATA a.k.a. TheRide), the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), the Detroit
Transportation Corporation (DTC aka The People Mover), M1 Rail (operator of the QLINE streetcar), and the
Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART). In total these transit systems provide nearly
33 million trips in the region per year (Source: 2017 National Transit Database).
The Regional Transit Authority of Southeast Michigan (RTA) was established by the Michigan Legislature in 2012
to coordinate transit investments and service within four counties – Wayne, Macomb, Oakland, and Washtenaw.
Spanning over 2,600 square miles, the RTA area includes over 4 million residents and nearly 2.5 million jobs.

The Region today
Southeast Michigan is home to roughly 4.2 million residents, which is expected
to grow to 4.5 million by 2045. There were approximately 2.5 million jobs in 2015, and it is
expected to grow to 2.7 million by 2045. Residents of Southeast Michigan are looking for
continued transit growth to match and support regional population and employment growth.
People currently use transit to get to work, school, medical appointments, shopping, and for
recreational activities. There are many areas in the region that would benefit from additional
service, catered to the people that live there and the kind of service that would be a good fit for
their needs.

network companies (e.g. Uber, Lyft, etc.); bike sharing services (e.g. MOGO, ArborBike); and e-scooters (e.g. Bird, Lime, Spin). There are over 100
different providers that include North Oakland Transportation Authority, Richmond-Lenox EMS, Western-Washtenaw Area Value Express, Jewish
Family Services, Quicken Employee Shuttles, and Detroit Public Schools/Trinity Transporation.
The majority of the municipal and non-profit providers are focused on delivering service to seniors and people with disabilities within their
communities.

Transit propensity and frequent transit network
The transit propensity map below highlights areas where market demand supports additional transit services. The areas highlighted in
dark red and blue have high concentrations of populations that traditionally use transit services such as individuals over the age of 65,
under the age of 18, those with disabilities, individuals in poverty, households with no or one vehicle and veteran status.
Demand in SE Michigan is concentrated in urban centers throughout the region, but the map demonstrates the need for additional
services in the urban fringe to for local trips or connections to the larger regional transit system.

Transit and Mobility Today
Challenges people face today when using available transit and mobility options
The Region’s current transit providers are doing a great job providing a breadth of services that meets many of the needs of its current
customers. However, they are hampered by several challenges that can only be solved through a coordinated regional plan and
investment program:

Challenge #1 – Regional coverage is not
maximized
There are large gaps in transit availability throughout the region,
which limits people’s access to job opportunities and vital
services. Many of these are in areas that have a decent amount
of propensity for transit, but have elected to opt-out of the existing
regional transit system. There are over 250,000 jobs in the
communities that currently opt-out of the SMART services. Many
of these areas are key regional job centers, include large medical
facilities, and include major education institutions.

Challenge #2 – Increased service frequency,
service hours and reduced travel times are
needed to meet regional needs
There are few frequent routes (e.g. a bus every 15 minutes),
limited evening services, and very low travel speeds on routes
throughout the region, which make transit inconvenient for those
who rely on it and discourages most with other travel options from
using it. 12.5% of the existing service could be considered
frequent. There are some frequent services in higher density urban
areas and along some major regional corridors, but there are none
that cross the region east to west to meet that large travel market
and there is a steep drop-off between frequent routes and other
routes (e.g. bus every 60 minutes). Similarly, the level of transit
availability during the evening drops outside of the City of Detroit.
Finally, options for express trips are limited to peak commute
periods or a few regional corridors.

Challenge #3 – The region lacks premium
mobility choices
There are limited premium transit choices at the regional level,
which dampens the attractiveness of the service for potential new
riders and diminishes transit’s utility as an economic development
tool. Premium services could include things like arterial rapid
transit, bus rapid transit, branded airport services, commuter rail,
light rail, or streetcar expansions.

Challenge #4 – A comprehensive regional
solution for serving Detroit Metropolitan
Airport is needed
Most people in the region don’t have access to a transit connection
to the airport. This lack of connection forces travelers and
residents into expensive options like private taxis, transportation
network companies, and paying for long-term parking. In 2015, an
estimated 8.9 million passengers boarded flights at the airport.

Challenge #5 – A sustainable funding model
is needed to support expanded mobility
options

Challenge #6 – Major demographic trends
require action today to be ready for the
mobility needs of tomorrow
Seniors are 15% of the region’s population today, and they will be
25% of the region’s population by 2045. This will put pressure on
the transit providers to continue to support and expand specialized
services like ADA paratransit and other senior oriented services.
These services are expensive and require a high degree of
coordination and management.

Challenge #7 – Lack a clear plan to integrate
emerging and mobility options
There is a large global shift underway in how mobility services
are delivered, which presents an opportunity for our region to be
the leader in integrating new mobility services into our mobility
ecosystem. Companies like Uber and Lyft are becoming popular
alternatives to driving and taking transit for people throughout the
region. Studies have shown that only 78% of young adults own
vehicles, compared to 91% of older generations, and the trends
also show that young adults are more apt to use new services.

Challenge #8 – A stable and growing
workforce is needed to deliver expanded
service
There are over 2,000 people currently employed at the transit
providers. There is a persistent challenge in hiring willing transit
operators and trained mechanics, which constrains the providers’
ability to deliver existing service and will be a hindrance to
providing any expanded service.

Challenge #9 - A need to modernize our
system making transit and mobility options
more accessible to all people of southeast
Michigan
Technology is driving change across the region whether we like
it or not. The way people procure services, goods and amenities
is evolving at such a rapid pace; our transit and mobility services
need to stay current with consumer expectations to remain
competitive.

Challenge #10 - A one-size fits all mobility
solution does not work given the geographic
size and development patterns of the region
Providing high quality, reliable and frequent transit service requires
more dense land uses in order to be sustainable. The outer
fringes of metro Detroit region with low transit propensity are not
conducive to being efficiently served by traditional transit and do
not have a need for expanded regional transit services.

There is limited funding available to build and operate the transit
system that the region needs. The funding that does exist is
subject to frequent millage renewals, or annual budget approvals,
which limits the long-term sustainability of funding. This also
constrains the providers’ ability to make necessary long-term
capital investments needed to modernize vehicles, equipment, and
facilities.

Currently, there is no commuter rail service within the region. Amtrak operates passenger rail
through the state, but the service frequencies are not conducive for shorter trips. In Detroit,
there are two operational systems, the People Mover, an automated 2.9-mile light rail system
that operates on an elevated single-track loop in Detroit’s central business district, and the
QLINE, a 3.3-mile streetcar running along Woodward Avenue.
The fully-automated People Mover serves 13 downtown stations in a one-way loop. It provides
important connections that allow people to access downtown businesses, the Chemical Bank
Cobo Center, and the other major sporting and entertainment facilities downtown.
The QLINE connects downtown Detroit with Midtown and New Center. The streetcar provides
people the ability to connect with jobs, major destinations, universities, and medical facilities,
as well as, transfers to DDOT, People Mover and SMART services.

Supporting the overall vision
Community Transit Services are an essential element of the transit options available to the region. Traditional
fixed-route transit service does not meet the transportation needs of all the members of the community due to
cognitive or physical disabilities and, in some cases, age.

Individuals may need Community Transit Services for their entire life or just temporarily due to injury or
illness. Community Transit services provide origin-to-destination service (door-to-door) to meet federal
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements within ¾ of a mile of fixed route services or local
community services to provide transportation for those in need that do not meet ADA eligibility criteria.
Community Transit Service transportation is a key life line service for many in the region and is a key
component to maintaining quality of life for all community members regardless of age or ability.

How do people use COMMUNITY TRANSIT today?
Community Transit Services are used much like traditional
transit services and serve transportation needs that include,
entertainment, medical, work and education. Both ADA and
community-based services typically require a minimum one-day
notice to schedule a trip, in some cases 48 hours are needed.
Scheduling is typically done over the phone.

Current funding sources
The three primary transit providers spend
the majority of their operating costs
on local bus however the demand for
Community Transit services is growing as
is the cost to provide the services.

Most trips are completed with a one-seat ride, but there are
circumstances when a transfer between vehicles is required for
a trip of long distance.

The hours of service vary by service provider. ADA paratransit services provide the same
service span as nearby routes, running early in the morning, late into the evening and over
weekends. Community transit services are not only provided by the primary transit providers
in the region (AAATA, SMART and DDOT) but there are up to 150 organizations in the region
providing these services through community partnerships and non-profit agency participation.
Community based services frequently have minimal service hours and restricted service areas
due to budget constraints a typical service span in between 8am and 5pm on weekdays with
little to no service on the weekends.

 New Mobility
Services

For Public Review
Summer 2019

Investing in

WHAT IS MaaS?
What are NEW MOBILITY SERVICES?
New Mobility services leverage technology to provide on-demand
(passengers call it when they need it), dynamically routed (no fixed
routes or schedules), shared rides. On-demand mobility provides the
ultimate passenger convenience as vehicles are routed directly to meet
existing demand; and shared rides lower the cost to the passenger.
Technology is also used to improve existing fixed route service and
other shared ride services deployed by public and private providers.
As more mobility technologies become available through the
private market place, they can fill gaps in our public transit services,
especially if public transit and private providers align their services
properly. Ensuring that the public and private sectors coordinate
services is essential to filling current mobility gaps and improving the
transportation options for seniors, and persons with disabilities. These
gaps exist for making first and last mile connections, accessing jobs
and services that require crossing geographic boundaries, and simply
getting to the local grocery store or doctor’s office. The gaps are
caused by limitations in available services, and by a variety of barriers.
These services can be deployed to provide mobility options in
geographic areas that do not have dense populations or are not
easily served by a traditional fixed-route transit service. New Mobility
solutions are an effective approach to solving transportation challenges
such as first/last mile connections, serving senior populations and
providing late night service. Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applications
are being developed to integrate the various forms of new mobility into
a single mobility service that provides a diverse menu of transportation
options in one location and, in some cases, the ability to pay for them.

How do people use NEW MOBILITY services today?
New Mobility services are used today by
people to get to work, reach entertainment
venues, access healthcare and to get to
school. Currently in Southeast Michigan
there is no one-stop Mobility as a Service
solution to pay for a trip, but the Transit
app allows potential users to view all their
transportation options in one location from
the convenience of their phone. Options
include bus, Uber, Lyft, MoGO Bikeshare
and a growing list of electric scooter
companies.

Mobility as a Service
(MaaS) harnesses the power
of technology and combines
it with drivers, vehicles, and

Trips are generally ondemand, and customers get
rides that are fully dynamic,
meaning there are no static
routes or schedules. This
type of flexible service,
which is continuously
optimized based on realtime conditions, provides
maximum flexibility for the
region.

WHAT IS SaaS?

Quality of Life

What is ENHANCING THE SYSTEM?
Enhancing the System means to provide efficient, modern, reliable
and safe service for the people of the region. Eligible expenses under
this investment category will ensure transit and mobility assets in our
region meet performance expectations (e.g., service reliability, customer
friendly and comforts, safety, and other current industry standard(s)).

Adding enhancements to the transit system will keep transit services
modern by using funding to implement new technologies to adequately
keep pace with the changing mobility demands of the region.

How are SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS implemented today?
Federal programs are available to assist with the costs associated with keeping a transit
system in good repair, however a local funding match is required for federal funds. Historically
MDOT funds have been used for the local match. Despite the federal and MDOT funding, it is
difficult for transit agencies to keep place with their needs and changing technologies.
Today local providers, SMART, DDOT and AAATA all leverage the federal dollars mentioned
above and have recently paid particular attention to reducing the age of their bus fleets. In
the past year all agencies have added to their fleets. SMART has reduced the average age of
their fleet from 11.7 years to 6 years, and DDOT has replaced 30 buses in the past year with
more replacements on the horizon. DDOT has also received special funding for repairs to their
Coolidge facility.
Transit agencies develop asset management plans, incorporating the condition of their facilities
and fleets. These plans help the agencies and FTA access funding needs. These plans, which
were recently completed by local providers, help the agencies and FTA access funding needs.

Enhancements to the transit system can be a gauge for the health of services provided in
the region. It is critical that the existing fleet and facilities be maintained in good condition to
support further growth. Aging fleets discourage ridership and investment that is needed to
provide service. Building upon the existing transit infrastructure and assets, the region can
provide more transit to more places, supporting the vision of moving people, investing, and
improving quality of life.

Supporting the overall vision

Investing in workforce development with an emphasis on maintaining highly skilled workers plays a vital role in
supporting the RTA’s vision for improving access and performance of transit in southeast Michigan. A talented
workforce of bus drivers, mechanics, software developers, community transit customer support/trip booking
support, connected and autonomous, rail operators, and rail maintenance staff are the backbone to the
success of mobility in our region. Focusing on these issues ensures that workforce development does not limit
future expansion opportunities.

How are WORKFORCE NEEDS being met today?
Attracting, developing and retaining a diverse
workforce is critical to the continued success
of public transit in southeast Michigan. A
concerning trend impacting the regions service
providers has been difficulty in recruitment and
retention of qualified employees. Providers
today work with local community colleges and
organizations to attract new talent, such as
Wayne County Community college. Providers
also regularly attend and host job fairs.

Funding needs for near-term priorities

Near-term priorities
• Creation of regional taskforce to
investigate and develop plans that
improve recruitment and retention of
qualified operators and mechanics.

20 YEAR FUNDING SOURCE NEEDED

• Work collaboratively with the
Workforce Intelligence Network and
the Community Colleges across the
region to develop transit and mobility
training programs and modules that
are flexible and responsive to today’s
learning environment.

An additional $1M per year is needed to
develop, retain, and continually educate a
workforce to support our transit services.
Community Colleges are increasingly
closing transit-centered programs in
order to expand programs such as
HVAC and other vocational careers.
Funding would allow partnerships with
community colleges to develop training
programs to improve the region’s transit
and mobility workforce. These programs
can be implemented in cooperation with
community partners such as Goodwill
Industries, Focus Hope, and United Way.
These funds could also be used to
leverage additional federal and state
funding for our region.

• Develop effective recruitment and
retention strategies including employee
referral programs, social networking
sites (LinkedIn), overall job enrichment
and Improving connections with VA
and affiliates.

Future priorities and opportunities for improvement

Aspirational goals

The pursuit of talent is something that is a
region-wide need and not something specific
to the transit and mobility industry. Our
region’s workforce is not growing through
organic measures, nor are we experiencing
a net migration of new employees entering
the region’s workforce. As a result the supply
of employees trained and ready to work
is not keeping pace with the demand. To
address this labor shortage, a concentrated
effort is needed to identify those individuals
not currently in the workforce and provide
them with the training and opportunities to
fill future transit and mobility jobs. Many are
already working in this space, as such we
should seek to partner with those already
delivering these services to implement both
near-term and aspirational goals.

• Improve the overall image of a transit
career.
• Develop performance metrics for
recruitment and retention strategies.
• Development of a benchmarking
process that encourages continues
improvement.
• Evaluate regional employee incentive
programs that can be used to help
retain excellent workers exceeding
customer expectations.

What Level of Future Investment Is Appropriate?
The RTA is seeking feedback on the appropriate investment levels that should be included in the region's 20-year Master Transit Plan. The
diagram above illustrates the three different scenarios of investment that the RTA has heard to date:
1.) existing levels of investment
2.) two levels of expanded investment
a.) near-term priorities
b.) aspirational goals
When combined the 8 broad investment priorities presented on the previous pages make up the basis of a regional mobility program that can
be implemented over the duration of the Master Plan horizon (20 years). Of course, implementation requires financial resources that would
need to be secured from a number of potential sources and many other administrative, regulatory, and other governance approvals actions
that would need to be spelled out clearly in a future Comprehensive Implementation Plan.
