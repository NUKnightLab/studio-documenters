Committee Report - Final

March 19, 2019

19-0186
Presented by: ARNOLD RANDALL, General Superintendent
PROPOSED BID RECOMMENDATION
Department: Resource Management
Request: Authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to enter into

a construction contract with CPMH Construction, Inc., Chicago, Illinois for drainage improvements at
Eggers Marsh.
Reason: Contract #74000005477 issued under Project #18-31-106R consists of construction to replace

failed stormwater infrastructure controlling drainage of the Eggers Grove wetland complex. The work
includes, but is not limited to, the installation of approximately 2,500 feet of 10-inch PVC sewer pipe, three
(3) water level control structures, as well as associated storm sewer infrastructure and soil erosion
mitigation. These water control structures will allow for Forest Preserves to adjust water surface
elevation within the marsh to mimic historic hemi-marsh conditions, restoring water flow to improve
nesting conditions and habitat for target wetland bird species. Hemi-marsh is a type of wetland habitat
characterized by a ratio of open water and emergent aquatic vegetation that is favorable for migratory
birds and amphibians.
The hydrologic recovery plan being implemented was developed by a consultant as part of a 2014 grant
awarded to the Forest Preserves through the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Coastal
Management Program. Additionally, the project will be partially funded through a $100,000.00 grant
sub-awarded to the Forest Preserves by The Nature Conservancy via the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation, the receipt of which was approved by the Board of Commissioners on 12/13/2016. The
contract was competitively bid, with a total of three (3) vendors responding to the solicitation for bids.
Total project costs are $328,297.50, of which $37,223.71 is being provided through grant funding,
$100,000.00 has been committed by the Forest Preserves as grant match, and $60,000.00 is being
contributed by Audubon Great Lakes. The remainder of the funding will be contributed by the Forest
Preserves as additional match to ensure completion of the project.
