PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to the Village of Oak Lawn and other Municipal Customers of the Oak Lawn
Regional Water System, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain a water transmission main in the Tinley
Creek Preserves. Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and
negotiation of any and all relevant provisions as determined by the Preserves’ legal department, to enter
into and execute the License. The request is for approximately 20,060 linear feet of new water main
ranging in size from 24-inch diameter to 60-inch diameter to serve 12 southwest suburban communities.
The communities are currently served by a single 40 year old 48-inch transmission main. The addition of
a new 60-inch water transmission line will provide a looped system to increase capacity and provide
redundancy in the event of a failure.
Impacts: The new pipeline will extend through the forest preserves for approximately 3.8 miles and
require a license area of almost 7 acres, but will be routed primarily within an existing disturbed corridor
occupied by a ComEd transmission line. Approximately 1.5 miles of paved trail will be directly impacted
by construction.
Fees and Benefits: In addition to the license fee, the Grantee will pay an impact fee for temporary
construction use of 35.6 acres, based on a daily proration of the license fee. Also, the Grantee will
rebuild the impacted trail and approximately 2 miles of adjacent trail in order to avoid patchwork trail
segments. The Grantee will also provide funding to reimburse the Forest Preserves for the ecologic
restoration of 500 acres in the Tinley Creek Preserves. Finally, the Grantee will also provide funding for
a construction management service to monitor construction for the FPCC. The current estimate of all fee
associated with the issuance of this License is $3,944,795 as indicated below. However, due to the
unique size and scope of this project these numbers may change based upon the length, size and duration
of the work being conducted by the Grantee.
