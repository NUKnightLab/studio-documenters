 The Executive Director introduced the proposed 2020 PBC Administrative Budget and the Richard J. Daley
Center Operating and Capital Budget and reported that the PBC has the highest level of accountability and
transparency in managing and reporting how we spend taxpayer supported dollars.
The Executive Director reported that since 2017, through administrative cost savings, the PBC has built a
reserve of over $2,000,000. This reserve income is important to the PBC because it helps sustain the
organization without the Bond Lease Revenue which it had relied on in the past to more effectively manage
administrative expenses. The proposed 2020 Administrative Budget expenses are flat with no net change
from the 2019 budget.
The AO Committee accepted the report from the Executive Director.
The PBC’s Director of Finance provided a detailed analysis of the Richard J. Daley Center (Daley Center)
budget. The PBC develops an annual budget to cover the operating and maintenance costs for the Daley
Center, as well as a budget for capital projects which assist in maintaining and upgrading the 50-year old
facility.
•

The Daley Center Operating and Capital budgets are allocated among Cook County, the City of
Chicago and the PBC based on the square footage of leased space in the building. The total
Operating Budget for 2020 is $16,530,895 which is a 3.83% increase from the 2019 budget. The
resulting cost will be $12.97 per rentable square foot, an extremely competitive rate given the
location and landmark quality of the building.

•

The 3.83% increase in operating expenses equates to $609,247 and stems from increases in union
cleaning and engineering wages along with increases associated with the elevator maintenance
contract.

Daley Center Operating Goals
• The overall 2020 operating goals for the Daley Center are to pursue new energy conservation
measures and bolster building safety and emergency preparedness. The building conducted life
safety/threat and ADA assessments in 2019 which have yielded several new projects included in
the 2020 Operating and Capital budget.
•

The building is pursuing BOMA’s 360 certification and is making strides for a submittal for BOMA’s
TOBY awards in 2020. To achieve these goals, MBRE is planning the following projects:
1. Cleaning RFP: Cleaning services will be competitively bid to minority firms and will now
include annual maintenance of Picasso which was historically maintained outside of the
contract.
2. Security Services RFP: Security services will be competitively bid with minority
participation requirements of 40%.
3. MBE/WBE Participation: Work closely with several organizations that support minority
businesses to solicit interest for projects in the building.

 Commissioner Camargo asked about the current M/WBE status of firms working at the Daley Center.
Andre Wiggins, VP, General Manager with MBRE, responded that the Minority and Women Business
Enterprise Participation rate is currently 65% on the Security Service Contract, 100% on the Cleaning
Service Contract and 20% on the Elevator Maintenance Contract.
Daley Center Capital Improvement Plan
The 2020 Capital Improvement Budget includes $5,290,000 for projects. In 2020, we will continue projects
identified in the 2017 Property Condition Assessment.
The list of capital projects anticipated for 2020 are;

Next the PBC’s Director of Finance detailed the 2020 PBC Administrative Budget. The Director reported
that the PBC has taken the steps to ensure the organization remains stable after the final receipt of the
Bond Lease Revenue in 2020.
For the last two budget years the PBC focused efforts on generating revenues through a stable Work in
Place (WIP), while consistently improving efforts on cost efficiencies within the agency. The PBC’s main
source of resources is through project Administrative fees generated through the WIP. Since changing the
frequency of our Administrative fee collections in 2018, the PBC has been able to maintain a more stable
cash flow for administrative expense throughout the lifecycle of a project.
Total 2020 projected resources are $10,075,868.

Lease Revenue - $300,000
Administrative Fees - $7,850,868 (Completed $1,193,077/Active $6,657,791)
Reimbursable - $1,925,000

Over the past three years the PBC has generated a savings/surplus between resources and expenses, with
the largest anticipated this year. This is crucial to the organization due to the constant fluctuations in the
WIP.

 PBC only forecasts the percentage estimated to be completed in the upcoming budget year for the WIP.
The PBC breaks its WIP into two components, projects undertaken and planning projects. Based on this,
for 2018 we had $281,000,000 in actual undertaken projects with $8,000,000 for projects in planning. For
2019 we anticipate a WIP of $289,000,000 that includes $15,000,000 for projects in planning. For 2020 we
have a projected a WIP of $249,000,000 with no current projects in planning or announced. The look
ahead for 2021 is $97,000,000. Our projected total value of Work in Place for the three-year period 20192021 is $635,000,000.
The proposed 2020 Administrative Budget expenses reflect a flat budget as compared to the 2019 budget.
The total administrative expenses budgeted for 2020 is $9,620,487.
After careful assessment of the overall company environment, we have been able to identify areas of
savings and areas necessitating enhancements.
The biggest expense continues to be personnel which makes up 61% of the overall Administrative budget.
Total personnel services are $5,858,397 which is an 1% reduction over the 2019 budget.
The largest areas of increases for the 2020 budget are Rent/Leasehold Improvements which is a factor of
the Daley Center proposed budget and in the Insurance fees. The Daley Center Insurance continues to
have a projected increase of 21% for 2020. This variance is directly related to an increase in our
Commercial Liability which is a factor of the current market changes and WIP levels.
We continue to experience a favorable variance in legal fees and as a result have reduced this budgeted
area by 10%.
The PBC has undertaken technology service upgrades. In quarter two 2019, we began the implementation
to a new costs control system (e-Builder). The costs of this implementation have been budgeted between
the 2019-2020 Computer Maintenance, Equipment and Software category. These very important updates
to our technology systems will provide PBC staff and clients a more customer-oriented experience and
improve our overall efficiencies in project management.
The remaining budget areas remain flat with a slight cost savings in comparison to the 2019 budget.
The AO Committee accepted the reports from the Director of Finance.
Next, the Chief of Staff reported on a task order award for Specialty Consultant Material Testing Services
to Design Consulting Engineers, a Minority Business Enterprise firm, in the amount of $50,000 for the
Processor Career Academy Renovation Project.
The AO Committee accepted the report from the Chief of Staff.
The Chief Development Officer reported on field orders issued on various projects as follows;
