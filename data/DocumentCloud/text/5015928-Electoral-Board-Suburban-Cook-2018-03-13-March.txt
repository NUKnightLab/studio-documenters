REMEMBERING DISTINGUISHED
“GRIOT” DORIA DEE JOHNSON

AFRICAN

AMERICAN

HISTORIAN

AND

BELOVED

WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson, a woman whose exceptional leadership and great body of scholarly
work examining the African American experience will long be remembered and treasured. In her short
life she educated thousands and when she died, far too soon, at age the age of 56 she left behind countless
friends, family and an international community enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson was born in Evanston Illinois, the first of three children of Helen and
Charles Johnson. Her exceptional talent revealed itself very early in her life. As a young student, she
attended a Crawford family reunion near Abbeville, South Carolina where she learned the tragic history of
her great-great-grandfather, Anthony Crawford, who had been the victim of lynching. His story was a
part of a much broader, history of lynching in America, a vicious tool of racial control to suppress black
civil rights. Doria established the Anthony Crawford foundation in his name; his heart-rending story and
those of so many others provided the focus to her life’s work. On October 21, 2016, on the Centennial of
his tragic death, she lead a pilgrimage of scholars, justice advocates, faith leaders and artists from across
the country to a two day event entitled “Justice for Anthony Crawford, Freedom School and Speak Out.”
She worked with Public Interest Attorney Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative to establish
one of the few historical markers in the country dedicated to lynching, marking the site of her
great-grandfather’s death; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson spent her academic and professional life examining the deeply complex
and troubled story of the African American experience; she received her Bachelor of General Studies in
History with honors from Roosevelt University and later received her Master of Arts degree in
Afro-American Studies from the University of Wisconsin; she was pursuing a doctorate degree in U.S.
history at the time of her death. She was a faculty member of Strayer University in Baltimore, Maryland
and visiting scholar at the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was the resident scholar at the Shorefront
Legacy Center in Evanston and served on the Board of the Evanston History Center; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson traveled the world educating those she met about the history of African
Americans, becoming a well-known and much beloved Griot.
The term is a West African word
describing the vocal tradition of preserving genealogies and historical truth. Doria Dee Johnson essentially
became a “world village” Griot sharing her work with thousands the world over. She was named a
‘change-agent’ by the Nelson Mandela Foundation. She was an international lecturer and participated in
human rights initiatives in Palestine, Israel, South Africa, Europe, Sri Lanka, Chicago, Ferguson, Missouri
and Cuba; and

DeWitt Proctor Conference inspiring faith leaders across the country to reclaim the narratives of faith and

Commission that aligned with the United Nations Declaration of the Decade for the People of African
Descent; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson’s extensive scholarship and leadership on the United States Senate
Steering Committee for the Apology on Lynching culminated in securing a 2005 United States Senate
apology for lynching. She played a role in insuring that Emmett Till’s casket rests in the archives in the
National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC; and
WHEREAS, Doria Dee Johnson’s exceptional work was regularly singled out for recognition. She was
awarded many academic fellowships: the Andrew W. Mellow Dissertation Fellowship; the University
Wisconsin Advanced Opportunity Fellowship, the University of Chicago Black Metropolis Research
Consortium Dissertation Research Fellowship and Yale University Summer Public History Institute
Fellowship.
She was selected one of three United States Representatives as scholar in the Nelson
Mandela International Dialogues program of the Nelson Mandela Foundation; and

friend in Doria Dee Johnson. She will be sorely missed by friends, neighbors and colleagues. Her loss will
be felt most acutely by her father Dr. Charles Johnson and her sister Christina Johnson; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on
behalf of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Doria Dee
Johnson, and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable and innumerable contributions she
has made to the Citizens of Cook County, Illinois; and
