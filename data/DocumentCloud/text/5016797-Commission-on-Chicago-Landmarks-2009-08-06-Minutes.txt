 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
August 6, 2009
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on July 9, at 1:45 p.m. The meeting was held at 33 N.
LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Edward Torrez
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department of
Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cindy Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

664 N. Michigan
(Farwell Building – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed changes to the project as previously conditionally approved,
specifically regarding elimination of parking floors from the Farwell Building
and the substitution of new mechanical and back-of- house spaces in these areas;
and retail entrance and new residential entrance canopy details

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1.

Entrances:
(a) The two retail entrances on the east elevation and the entrance at the east
corner of the south elevation shall be a single centered door with equal
sidelites on either side, with a power operator to activate the door if
necessary to meet code. Should this option not be permitted by code, the
proposed single door with one sidelite configuration may be approved;
(b) The metal and clear glass canopy above the residential entrance is
approved as submitted, provided it meets all other applicable city code
requirements;

2. Window/Interior Treatments, relative to the exterior appearance of the
building:
(a) As depicted on the 6th-Floor Plan and the “East-West Section Through
Farwell,” dated June 19, 2009, drywall partitions shall be constructed
from the floor to the underside of the suspended ceiling creating 10’-0”
deep spaces along the perimeter of the east and south exterior walls of
the Farwell Building on the new mechanical floor. The interiors of these
spaces shall have finished walls and ceilings, including lighting. The
plans shall be revised to make all spaces accessible from the interior for
maintenance purposes. Also, the 6th-floor plan shall be modified to
show mini-blind window treatment instead of the proposed screen

 (b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

behind the western- most window on the south elevation;
As depicted on the “East-West Section Through Farwell,” dated June 19,
2009, a suspended ceiling with recessed lighting shall be installed at the
8th -and the 9th -floor ceilings for a distance of 17’-0” back from the
exterior walls (east and south) of the Farwell Building;
The east and south sides of the proposed residential storage units on the
9th floor shall have finished sides (such as painted drywall or other
material) or an alternative treatment to screen the storage units from
view from the street. Material information and details shall be reviewed
and approved by Historic Preservation Staff prior to permit approval;
The 11th -floor plan shall be revised to provide catwalks or other means
of access for maintenance of the interstitial space above the suspended
10th floor ceiling. Mechanical equipment and ductwork within this
space shall not be visible from the public way;
As depicted on the 11th-Floor Plan, dated June 19, 2009, partitions shall
be constructed from the floor to the underside of the suspended ceiling at
the northeast corner of the Farwell Building within the new mechanical
room. The interior of this space visible from the street shall have
finished walls and ceiling, including lighting;
As proposed, mini-blind window treatments shall be installed for all
office (floors 3 through 5), mechanical (floors 6 through 8, and 11) and
back-of-house (floor 9) windows as a building standard to unify the look
of the building from the exterior. These window treatments should be
maintained in good condition and should not be kept in a fully closed
position at mechanical and back-of-house spaces to allow some visibility
from the street into these spaces so that they appear as occupied floors
with active uses. The spaces on mechanical and back-of-house floors
shall be kept free of any visible mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
equipment and storage. The interior ceilings, walls and partitions,
lighting, window treatments and storage spaces as identified herein by
conditions 2(a) through 2(f) shall be finished materials to simulate the
appearance of occupied floors and be maintained in good condition. The
Commission’s approval shall be subject to a written agreement by and
between the owner and the City of Chicago regarding these conditions;

3. Signage: The submission as it pertains to signage is incomplete. The
Commission’s review of signage is therefore continued and not approved at
this time, pending submission of a signage master plan. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve a master sign plan for location,
size, and type of signage prior to any sign permit approvals. Final signage
details shall be submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval
when tenant signage is available; and,
4. Awnings: The awning submission is incomplete, and the Commission’s
review is therefore continued and not approved at this time. Proposed
awning elevations and details shall be reviewed and approved by the
Historic Preservation staff prior to any awning permit approvals.

 2.

6016 S. Ingleside
(Lorado Taft Midway Studios – 20th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed demolition of later 1970s and 1980s building additions west of the
Lorado Taft Midway Studios building (only partially within the boundary of the
designated landmark)

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that the project does not trigger the
requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing demolition of 40% or more of the
significant features of the landmark Lorado Taft Midway Studio ; and that the
1970s and 1980s additions to the Midway Studios are outside the period of
significance (c. 1929 – 1936) for the designation, and their removal will
therefore not have an adverse effect on the significant historical or architectural
features of the landmark.
The Committee strongly encouraged, however, that the University of Chicago
continue to explore options to retain and reuse the Dart Studio Building on site,
as Edward Dart is an important and significant mid-century architect, of whom
little work remains in Chicago.

3.

1515-1521 N. Hoyne
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a new 2-story masonry residence at the rear of newlysubdivided lot at 1515 N. Hoyne and a new 1-story rear masonry garage for the
adjacent house at 1521 N. Hoyne

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. Brick, slate and stone samples shall be submitted for review and approval
prior to permit approval.

4.

2222 N. Geneva Terrace
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed 3rd-floor addition and rooftop terrace; and replacement of stucco
cladding of a non-contributing, 2-story single-family residence

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the project would require zoning variances from the Zoning
Board of Appeals for side yard and rear yard reductions. The Commission
takes no position regarding the merits of any requested reduced yard
requirements; and,
2. As proposed, the new stucco wall will be a smooth finish and painted a dark
brown color to match the color of the existing stucco.

5.

2127 N. Hudson
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed removal of a section of the masonry parapet of a 1-story rear garage to
accommodate metal railings visible from the street

 Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. The design of the proposed railing shall be further refined and details shall
be submitted for Historic Preservation staff review and approval.

6.

2141-2143 N. Sedgwick
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of missing wood cornice for two attached masonry
rowhouses in Fypon, a high-density rigid polyurethane product, as a substitute
material

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve the manufacturer’s
detailed product drawings in comparison to the salvaged cornice pieces,
prior to order, to ensure the historic cornice will be accurately replicated.

7.

1809 N. Sedgwick
(Old-Town Triange District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new construction of a raised 2-story masonry single-family
residence and rear garage

Action:

Approved (3-1, Ed Torrez against) with the following conditions:
1. As depicted on the plans, dated June 18, 2009, the building shall have
a front- facing gable roof and shall be no taller than 35’-4 ¾” measured
from grade to top of the ridge and 27’-0 ½” measured from grade to
the underside of the eaves, except as pertaining to the side dormer;
2. The size, location and the design of the north side dormer and the two
skylights are approved as proposed. The skylights shall be low profile
with a curb and frame color matching the color of the roofing material;
and,
3. Detailing on the front façade (i.e., stone lintels, brackets, etc.) shall be
simplified so as not to appear too historical. Details shall be submitted
with the permit plans for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval.

8.

625 W. Deming
(Arlington-Deming District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: New projecting balconies, new masonry facade, enlarged
masonry openings, and new windows and terrace doors to an existing 5story non-contributing building

Action:

The Committee found that the building is non-contributing to the character
of the district; and that, in consideration that the work took place in excess
of 5 years ago, well before the preliminary vote to consider the
designation of the district, and that the subject building is a non-

 contributing building to the district, voted unanimously to approve the
project as submitted.
9.

921 N. Dearborn
(Washington Square District – 42nd Ward)
Informational Only: Partial demolition and reconstruction of a portion of a side wall of a
single- family residence resulting in the violation of a permit. The demolition and
reconstruction was deemed necessary to address the lack of structural stability of the
north wall.
