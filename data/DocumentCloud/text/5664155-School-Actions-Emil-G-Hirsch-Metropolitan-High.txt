a brief presentation of the school action.

MS. BRADLEY:

9

Thank you, Karen.

And good evening, and thank you all for being
here.

And on behalf of myself and all the colleagues

10

from CPS here, we really appreciate your feedback both

11

from the last community meeting and tonight.

12

In December of 2017, the

13

Board -- the Chicago Board of Education approved a new

14

charter school, Art In Motion Charter School, to open in

15

the fall of 2018 at a location to be determined.

16

Art In Motion, otherwise known as AIM,

17

is authorized to open in the fall of 2018 with Grades 7

18

through 8 and will grow one grade per year until it

19

serves Grades 7 through 12.

20

AIM is a performing arts middle and high school

21

with a project base in personalized learning curriculum.

22

They have established community partnerships with

23

organizations such as New Life and the Lynn Group and

24

anticipate on leveraging those partnerships to benefit

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 8
1

both AIM and the Hirsch High School communities.

2

Through the new school selection process,

3

Art In Motion conducted community meetings in and around

4

the surrounding Hirsch and Greater Grand Crossing

5

communities.

6

Community engagement has occurred through

7

various different activities, including community

8

meetings, events and aldermanic supports.

9

Additionally, the District conducted its own

10

public hearing on November 6th, 2017, to assess

11

community engagement and supports.

12

The proposed co-location supports the need for

13

qualities in the Greater Grand Crossing community and

14

provides an opportunity for cross school collaboration

15

and leveraging partnerships to serve students in both

16

the AIM and Hirsch community.

17

There are over 3000 students within a

18

three-mile radius of Hirsch, and 45 percent of those

19

students attend a school outside of that three-mile

20

radius.

21

Although AIM and Hirsch are two different

22

school models, their collaborative partnerships,

23

co-sharing benefits extended -- extend past sharing the

24

facility and provide supports such as shared teacher

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 9

professional development, student and family services,

2

afterschool programming.

3

The existing Hirsch facility provides common

4

areas including the cafeteria and gymnasiums for both

5

schools to use.

6

would not exceed the Hirsch building capacity.

7

The student enrollment of both schools

I will now pass it back to my colleague

8

Dr. Karen Saffold to facilitate the public comment

9

section.

10

MS. SAFFOLD:

So before we get started on the public

11

comment section, I want to go over a few logistics and

12

guidelines.

13

So prior to the public's participation, we

14

would like the opportunity for city, state and federal

15

elected officials to speak.

16

During public participation, each speaker that

17

has signed up will have an opportunity to speak for two

18

minutes to share his or her thoughts.

19

warning after one minute and then 30 seconds after that.

last name so the court reporter will be able to report

2

your name.

3

The meeting is scheduled to end 8:00 o'clock

4

p.m, and, again, the public is able to submit comments

5

at transitions@cps.edu.

6

If there is remaining time after elected

7

officials and registered guests have spoken, we will

8

allow participants to come back and speak again.

9

Please remember to start your comments with

10

your first and your last name and your affiliation to

11

the school.

12

Again, if you did not have a chance to comment,

13

you will have an opportunity to do so via

14

transitions.cps.edu.

15

As I said earlier there are representative in

16

the back to answer any questions that you may have.

17

Again, there's notecards for you as well.

18

At this time I'd like to introduce our

19

Principal Larry Varn from Hirsch to see if he would like

20

to say anything.

21
22

If not, please stand up so we can acknowledge
the principal.

23

MR. VARN:

24

MS. SUMMERS:

(Indicating.)
The first speaker that I see on the

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 11
1

list to speak this evening is Michael Brunson.

2

recording secretary for CTU.

He's

Mr. Brunson.
MR. BRUNSON:

Good afternoon, Everyone, or good

evening, I should say.

6

My name is Michael Brunson.

I'm reporting

7

secretary of the Chicago Teachers Union, and I'm sure

8

you know by now that we are opposed to this so-called

9

co-location just as we are opposed to closing the

10

schools in Englewood and not even providing them with

11

something new.

12

I came and spoke before, and I really don't

13

need to repeat what I said earlier, but I see a lot of

14

people here that were not here at the first meeting last

15

week so I just want to say this.

16

When we're talking about charter schools, the

17

money flows to the top.

18

in, and what is it, Arts in Motion, but they're just one

19

in a bigger wheel, and they fall under Distinctive

20

Schools.

21

You might have a school coming

And I think I see some people from Distinctive

22

Schools here again.

23

more people here from Distinctive Schools, which is the

24

big charter at the top that has a lot of problems, and

I wonder why last time there were

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 12
1

that I'm not going to go through because I'm not going

2

take up anybody's time.

3

I spoke to the board on December 6th in detail,

4

pretty much detailed the problems that we have with

5

Distinctive Schools because they have a history, they

6

have a very questionable history that showed that they

7

are not here for the benefit of the students, and my

8

great concern is because they have a history of, I won't

9

say corruption, I won't say scandal, I'll just say they

10

have a questionable history that you need look into, and

11

I'm going to make sure that it's published out there.

12

I'm looking for more information about them.

13

But I'm concerned about Chicago Public Schools

14

in doing another unnecessary scandal by dealing with

15

questionable operators.

16

selective enrollment school back in 2009, we went

17

through a scandal with one of our -- with our CEO back

18

in 2015 and this whole thing that's being said of

19

Distinctive Schools, and I'm telling you right now, it's

20

going to come out sooner or later.

21

to go through this?

22

We did with the scandal

Why should we have

Now, here's the biggest problem that I have.

23

They say they're going to put this charter school in

24

here and it's going to co-locate, and according to this

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 13
1

co-location plan, they're going to start out with 200

2

students and eventually move up to 900 students.

3

The capacity of this school, of

4

Hirsch Metropolitan High School is 1100 students.

5

they're eventually going up to 900, that's not

6

co-location.

7

to look at it like it is, okay?

8
9

That's a slow motion takeover.

So if

You need

Secondly, why do you want to put two different
schools in one building to begin with?

You know, you're

10

going to have one over here and getting all the

11

resources and the other one over here draining

12

resources.

13

never worked for black people, understand that,

14

segregation does not work for black people.

15

to push back against that.

That's segregation.

And segregation has

So you need

16

And you're going to see what I'm talking about

17

because I'm sure Distinctive Schools is going to get up

18

here talking, and you just look to see who comes up

19

speaking.

20

But, anyway, I want to tell you we are here

21

talking to each other really because Chicago Public

22

Schools and the Board of Education, they're just here

23

taking notes.

24

questions.

They're not going to answer any

They're not going to respond to any

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 14
1

concerns.

2

each other.

3

They're just going to let us just talk to

The big meeting is the one that's going to be

4

down at the Board of Education, I believe.

5

what the date of that is if somebody can say the date of

6

that.

7

the students of Hirsch Metropolitan High School, you

8

need to be at that meeting, you need to make your voice

9

heard because this high school has been here for years,

I don't know

That's the one where I think all the parents of

10

it's part of this community, and all it needs is the

11

support of your community but mostly the support of

12

Chicago Public Schools.

13

Why are they supporting a segregation policy

14

right here in their own schools?

15

things like that.

16

motive behind it because, if there is a problem here

17

with Hirsch, there's a problem with resources, not with

18

their ability to function as a well performing school,

19

resources.

20

You have to question

You have to question what is the true

And if this other group wants to come in and,

21

out of their magnanimous generosity, help this community

22

and help this school, then contribute to the resources,

23

don't take it over, you don't got to do that, because

24

that ain't about generosity, it ain't about love.

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 15
1

And when you bring these new teachers in, I

2

know the first thing I'm going to have to do if this

3

thing goes through.

4

because a worker is worthy, and, you know, those charter

5

schools, they don't treat them right, they have low

6

salaries, they have no benefits, they don't look out for

7

your retirement security and they definitely don't have

8

any voice in educational environment.

9

I'm going to pull all the salaries

So I'll be here for a while standing and

10

talking to each other like I said.

11

is to see you through CPS, and you should be demanding

12

that the transcripts not just from this meeting but from

13

all of these meetings be posted online because somebody

14

is taking notes up there.

15

these transcripts, find out who's doing all of this

16

speaking, and you know where I come from, find out where

17

everybody comes from and who they represent.

18
19

MS. SAFFOLD:

24

Thank you.

Will Speakers 1 through 5 come up to the podium
at this time?

22
23

We should be able to review

have someone that will hold up a card after one minute.

affiliation to Hirsch, first and last name, along with

MS. SMITH:

Hello, Everyone.

I'm Jocelyn Smith.

11

I'm a singer here at Hirsch, and I just have two

12

questions.

13

My first question is; why haven't we seen you

14

all before now?

15

you all helped us in four years?

16
17
18

And my second question is; why haven't

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER:

What is your

question?
MS. SMITH:

My first question is; why haven't we

19

seen you guys before now?

20

why haven't you all helped us in four years?

21

And my second question is;

And the reason I ask this is because here at

22

Hirsch, our students, we like our school, and to me,

23

honestly, putting another school with another school,

24

younger kids watch older kids' actions, and you may know

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 17
1

they're not like -- some parents may not agree with what

2

they may be seeing so I don't feel that underclassmen

3

should be commanded with upperclassmen or with the

4

schools.

5

because that was the situation at DuSable, Prague.

6

That's why I came here in the first place;

MR. MARTIN:

So we're going to ask Speakers 2

7

through 5, please start making your way up to the stage

8

and say your name nice and clearly when you get up.

9

Jessica Story, Number 3 we have Alliya Alston.

10

So your cards tell you which number you have.

11

to you.

12

you have Speakers 1 through 5, come up, stick to two

13

minutes.

14

We'll get

So your cards say which number you have.

If

15

THE TIMEKEEPER:

16

MR. MARTIN:

17

MS. STORY:

(Indicating.)

-- he will hold your time card, okay?
Good evening.

I'm Jessica Story, and

18

I'm a teacher at Distinctive Schools.

19

Distinctive schools for -- this will be my fourth year

20

with Distinctive Schools.

21

I have been with

So I guess I'm here to stand in front of you

22

today to talk to you about two perspectives, one from a

23

parent perspective.

24

As a parent of a young child who is very

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 18
1

involved in arts, in dance and technology and things

2

like that, we reside on the south side of Chicago, and,

3

unfortunately, we have to do a lot of traveling to get

4

her to programs like that that she's really interested

5

in.

6

As a parent, as a working parent, that's very

7

difficult for me to do on days when I have 29 other

8

students that are in my classroom from a significant

9

period of time.

10

I just think back when I was her age and the

11

few resources that were available for me so

12

participating in things that I enjoyed doing.

13

think that this -- this merge together, because we want

14

to embrace it as just not splitting, we want to come

15

together and embrace this opportunity for our Hirsch to

16

get the same resources that all schools are getting

17

within our community.

18

So I

We want to make sure that our students feel

19

safe in this merge, we want to make sure our students

20

feel trust in this merge that we are here to support the

21

students, the families of the community as well.

22

So just from a parent perspective, I just want

23

to make sure that we do want our children to be active,

24

we want them to be engaged, we want to make sure they're

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 19
1

involved in things to keep them off the street.

2

know where we live, we do know the things going around

3

us, and I think Distinctive and AIM is a good source to

4

bring to our school to help brighten our school and

5

bring more things for opportunities to our students that

6

they love doing because the goal is to do things that we

7

want the students to do.

8
9

You know, it's about the students, it's not
about the teachers, it's not about the staff, it's not

10

about the parents.

11

make sure we are faithful to them.

12
13
14

We do

It's about the students.

We want to

Thank you.
MS. ALSTON:

Hello, my name is Alliya Alston, and

I'm a junior at Hirsch Metropolitan High School.

15

Hirsch High School might seem like a bad

16

school, but it really isn't.

17

every time when we ask for supports, they always say we

18

don't have money.

19

claimed that they gave us money, but where's the money?

20
21

It isn't.

Some of us might even

Hi, my name is Adrienne Leonard, and

6

I'm a staff member at Distinctive Schools, but I'm here

7

to talk to you today about how performing arts can

8

really impact someone's experience to really develop

9

their skills while they're in high school to prepare

10

them for college and to prepare them for a career after

11

that.

12

So I'm going to tell you a little story.

In

13

1978 my parents moved to Chicago from another country

14

because they had hopes to achieve more in the U.S., and

15

they chose Chicago because they loved the community that

16

they saw here.

17

Soon after that they had my brother and I, and

18

so we started school.

19

elementary and middle school, but where I really started

20

to develop into more of a person that I am today is in

21

high school, and that was through performing arts.

22

We had great experiences in

When I was in high school, I began to really

23

love dance, and I began to really love music, and I took

24

voice lessons, I joined choir, I was able to connect

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 21
1

with so many other students through that as well as

2

talking to them about math and other skills, too.

3

Then in my senior year, I had one of the dream

4

experiences of my life.

5

it was something I'll always remember for a lifetime.

6

I was Wendy in Peter Pan, and

But then that senior year, I think about what

7

did I want to do when I got to college.

8

to college, I decided to major in communications, media

9

and performing arts, and I am proud to say I have

So when I got

10

graduated from Illinois University in Chicago, and it's

11

one of those ethnically diverse campuses in the U.S.

12

With that I was able to find a job.

13

Pretty soon after college I was aware I had a

14

lot of skills through performing arts.

15

taught me a list to collaborate with other people, with

16

groups as well as work independently.

17

how to read because I came from a family where English

18

was a second language.

19

how to make friends, how to collaborate and also have a

20

lot of confidence in myself.

21

of the confidence in myself, I might not have had the

22

courage to stand here today.

23
24

Performing arts

MR. GLOSSETT:

So hi.

I'm with Distinctive Schools.

First off, thank you.

That was an amazing

pronunciation of my name, probably one of the best.
I appreciate it.

I'm here representing Distinctive Schools and

12

providing additional information around Distinctive

13

Schools and what it's like to be a member of the

14

Distinctive Schools' family.

15

So

I joined Distinctive Schools this summer.

And

16

one of the reasons I joined Distinctive Schools is I see

17

other members of Distinctive Schools out in the crowd

18

because of what Distinctive Schools stands for and

19

because of the commission of Distinctive Schools and

20

what we -- what we strive for every single day; that we

21

work with our -- our students and our families in our

22

communities that we serve.

23

Tonight we're going to hear a lot of different

24

sides, a lot of information from different sides, a lot

remind us of is that, in this wonderful democracy, we

3

are able to share our opinions, share our beliefs and

4

share how we feel and share information.

5

And one of the things I'd like to

So what I'd like to share is the pride that I

8

love are two things that Distinctive Schools truly

I'm on the staff member with

So one of the things that attracted me to
Distinctive Schools is their personalized model, which

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 25
1

clarified my approach is it's tailored to meet the needs

2

of students and where they currently are.

3

something that I was not seeing in my previous

4

placements and previous schools that I was currently in

5

prior to coming to Distinctive Schools.

6

was a one-sized fit.

7

This is

A lot of that

Typically in a classroom, we have students

8

coming to us from various backgrounds, different

9

learning styles, they have different ways in which

10

they're learning academic abilities, and it's difficult

11

to meet them where they're at, and we're not tapping

12

into the resources and the things that they have

13

available to them.

14

So when I came to Distinctive Schools, I was

15

able to then incorporate those types of things into the

16

classrooms.

17

to send sixth grade students to college.

18

was, we went there, and students were able to tap into

19

things that they wanted to do in life.

20

see what were some of the professions that they wanted

21

more experience with, more knowledge with.

22

able to go to these classes and have those experiences.

23

This was some of the most lasting impressions that I

24

had.

My first year within a network, I was able

They were

year, but this was something they talked about

2

constantly.

3

They did not know what it was they wanted to do, and

4

this gave them the ability to have some experience

5

outside of the classrooms.

6

They did not have exposure to those things.

So as we move forward a partnership, keeping in

7

mind that the students are always at the forefront with

8

Distinctive Schools, all we want to meet is where you're

at and progressing to help them get where they're going

I've heard a lot today about how we all should

And now a question.

Why would CPS and the

doing when you rip and gut a program and fail to provide

Because that's basically what you're

I have no doubt that there are a few people

21

from the state who have great and lovely goals for their

22

people, but I have not heard one of them come in here

23

and say what they are going to do to benefit Hirsch

24

while they co-share this building.

TOOMEY REPORTING

And it's all good that you want to do those

2

things for your children, and your children are valuable

3

to you, but I want you all to know, my Hirsch children

4

are valuable to me, and if you have the funds to put in

5

another entire school that, by the way, has a maximum

6

capacity to edge my children out, then I'm asking you,

7

why don't you just give that money where it belongs,

8

right here in this city school with an existing

9

structure that has children with existing needs,

10

because, remember, it's all about the children?

11

So it's not about a corporation building in

12

that bottom line with CPS funds that my tax dollars

13

paid.

It's about using my dollars where I want them

14

used.

And I do not want them to fund a corporation.

15

want them to fund my children's future because,

remember, it's all about the children.

Well, Hirsch children are the children that we

need to be concerned about because this is their

they are not throw away children to be balked at and

MR. BUTLER:

Good evening.

My name is

Joseph Butler, and I'm a resident of the community.

3

And I've been a part of these processes before,

4

and the reason I'm here tonight is because I heard about

5

what was going on here, and I'm a little frustrated and

6

a little concerned because the way the community has

7

been involved and informed about the changes that are

8

happening here at this school have not been as

9

transparent as they could be.

10
11

There needs to be more

outreach and more engagement from the community.
One of the things that I did have an

12

opportunity to do prior to coming here was I was at

13

another meeting having this conversation, and I think

14

people who were in that room, they were talking about

15

the benefits of bringing AIM to Hirsch Elementary --

16

High School and about the opportunities that they

17

provide for the students here and how they could

18

cohabitate and create a symbiotic relationship where

19

both schools can strive.

20

I think that's important, but I think that that

21

starts right now where we have the opportunity to start

22

to bring, like Mr. Benifield just said, these young

23

people into the room and they have an opportunity to

24

have a conversation about what they think needs to

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 38

2

happen.
What I think what I heard this evening and even

3

the -- even before now is that everybody is invested,

4

everybody wants to see you all do as best as possible.

5

And I think what you said, Ms. Mary, earlier is

6

important; that we start to put aside some of the

7

fighting and the confusion between AIM and the community

8

and Hirsch and everybody else and we start to figure out

9

how we hold Chicago Public Schools accountable for

10

what's happening at the school because I think you have

11

an invested parter that's talking about coming and

12

cohabiting you all, and you have strong student voices,

13

strong parent voices and strong community members, and

14

now is the opportunity for us to work together to

15

leverage those voices.

16

The gentleman from CTU spoke about how -- like

17

who's going to come and speak on behalf of different

18

people, but the reality is we need to harness the power

19

and the energy that we all have together and put

20

pressure on the people making the decision.

21

It's not AIM.

It's not people here at Hirsch.

22

It's the Board of Education, and that's where the energy

23

and the focus needs to be.

24

Some people in the

First of all, before I start to talk or say

MR. BRUNSON:

Hello, again.

16

I'll tell you, I stepped out a few times so I

17

could be a little bit wrong and be off mark with this,

18

but it seems like I notice more people speaking from

19

Distinctive Schools than I do from names, and it's like

20

I told you; everything goes up to the top.

21

Now, I will say they stepped up their game, put

22

a little more play in it and a little more color in it,

23

but it's still all about Distinctive Schools.

24

You know, I'm sorry, I just got to say this

If AIM is so loving

our good school choices are no longer in the community,

I'm not here to speak about the education part.

4

I'm here to speak about my son in sixth grade and is

5

looking for a school next year whether it's selective

enrollment, art, or a private school.

7

A couple of things about my son.

He loves to

8

draw, he loves music, and he loves being around people

9

that's similar to him and has the same drive.

10

A selective enrollment school may not be a

11

possibility, but this could be a possibility for him

12

with the arts and the drawings and things like that.

13

And that's what this school made me excited

14

about; the education part of it but also the performing

15

arts parts of it.

16

My son is in sports, he is in different other

17

programs, and we have to go all the way up north.

18

when I get off work, I'm rushing in traffic to drive all

19

the way there where this is an opportunity where I can

he's got to stay in the community to take him and be a

MR. WILLIAMS:

Hello.

My name is Matthew Williams.

While I am from New Life, more importantly, I represent

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 58

artists, all right?

2

So let me just tell you a story.

I have a

3

young man who I mentored who is very talented who has

4

been able to end up going to Kenwood High School for

5

seventh grade and eighth grade because of academic

6

enrichment, but because it didn't offer the interns an

7

arts program, you then have to attend another high

8

school.

9

So the high school that he's going to now is

10

the Chicago Academy of Arts.

11

school costing 32,000 a year.

12

Shine Art Center, which is on the west side.

13

no performing arts high schools other than Dyer on the

14

south side.

That's a tuition-based
The only other school is
There are

15

So as a artist, I believe our communities

16

deserve more than one performing arts high school.

17

believe that the arts is on the cusp of being able to,

18

literally, put young people to be able to have a voice

19

in the political and social climate that we're in.

20

arts is the key.

21

I

The

So I guess my thing is that I don't want to

22

limit the arts being brought into this community

23

because, guess what, there are a lot of kids who are

24

artistically gifted, and if they don't have the right

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

 January 16, 2018
Page 59
1

atmosphere to go get these gifts to be brought out,

2

guess what, they go -- they basically go to waste, they

3

end up going into other professions and end up being

4

unsatisfied.

5

So my thing is, as an artist, wholeheartedly,

6

as an artist, the arts deserve to be on the south side,

7

from a high school perspective, other than just one high

8

school, if they can have it on the north side and the

9

south side, why can't we have that here on the south

10
11

side?
I just caution you, it's not about what one

12

school can do that the other can't, but it's what the

13

arts school can do for our community.

14

consider that among anything else, consider the arts.

15

There are artists within this community who would tear

16

down a wall to be able to work with people as artists

17

within our communities.

18

opportunity as well.

MR. CROWLEY:

22

I'm actually an artist myself.

24

over here, what was it like like seven years ago, and I

I actually grew up in

2

came back out this way as I grew up, I actually started

3

coming back towards this way.

4

I didn't actually stay in art school.

I went

5

into -- Criminal justice is something I actually went

6

into, but my heart wasn't into it.

7

I started doing is try to figure out what I wanted to do

8

as I got older.

9

So, basically, what

I'm definitely talented when it comes to art.

10

I've been on the south side, actually diverse learning,

11

an art school.

12

out here that are actually into art, like generally into

art, if they brought in another program, they're not

this was just the circle world, just the regular world,

So my question is; if there are scandals on the

table, why are we even here, why are -- why isn't that

unethical dealings that is going on with the same people

So that's what's sick right now, that's what

18

hurts right now, that's what's sad right now is that

19

we're talking about the church.

20

Well, you guys got to stop this that you want

21

to walk on top of our church to get what you want

because, if you care, you would come in and start

I do

20

have an invitation to visit local school council.

21

Charles has called me and invited me, and I will be

then we're going to figure out how to frame this thing

24

up so we can get to the people that it really matters to

Is that okay?

And then I think we need to have a focus group,

all of you community folks and, you know, New Life,

4

Distinctive, anybody, I don't care who you are, as long

5

as you are breathing and you got breathe in your body, I

6

don't talk to dead folks, and if they dead, they ought

7

to be buried, I don't have time for that, but if you're

to keep it moving to make sure that your voice is heard,

10

I have no children, but I have been fighting for all of

11

you, and I need to teach that it's just not about me or

you, but it's about your little sister, your little

to come behind you.

15

We want the best for them, right?

And we can do that.

Your voice matters, and

it's very important.

do a focus group, a small meeting, a listening campaign,

PRINCIPAL VARN:

Thank you, Mr. Martin.

Good evening.

You all come on up here, come on up here, come

6

on because this is -- this is the moment, this is a

7

position for you all, and that's what school is really

8

about; it's about leaving these doors, having

9

information and knowledge that you didn't have before

10
11

you got here.
First of all, thank you to the deputy chief of

13

the -- and the officer of incubation and innovation.

Yesterday we all celebrated Martin Luther King

18

19

Martin Luther King's life and legacy, it was his fight

20

for equality.

21

Essentially, what we have here and what we're

22

asking for at Hirsch is for equality; for the same

23

opportunities to be available to you as are available

24

not only to the potential students of AIM but to the

TOOMEY REPORTING

Someone has taken your

5

rights from you and have left you with nothing more than

6

a basic education.

7

And I apologize to you because I feel bad, I

8

feel bad every day that I walk in here and welcome you

diploma, and nothing more.

12

14

You deserve to have more than that.

15

I want to be able to give you more than that.

No, you didn't say no.

You

Now, that's okay because that's not your
responsibility.

6

That is not New Life's responsibility.

Who I am holding accountable for where Hirsch

7

is now is who allowed Hirsch to get here over the course

8

of the years.

9

because the tenants, in Apartment 3, have big screen

You see, back to the rent analogy.

Just

10

T.V.s, brand new furniture, outstanding Wi-Fi services

11

and everything else doesn't mean that the tenants in

12

Apartment 1A have those same things.

13

What I'm saying is we go back to Martin Luther

14

King that we have true equality, and what CPS is saying

15

to me in black and white is that they will not, they

16

will not give Hirsch any capital funds towards the

17

co-location.

18

AIM, will have great and wonderful things, and not here,

19

the people who I work for, the people who we are a part

20

of.

21

So what that means is that those tenants,

See, AIM is a part of a same school system,

22

Distinctive Schools.

23

care of that.

24

take care of Hirsch.

So Distinctive Schools should take

Hirsch is a part of CPS.

So CPS should

But CPS has said that they're not

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

Page 68

2

So where in CPS has the charter worked, a

3

co-location really worked in a high school?

4

question I've asked over and over and over to many, many

5

people and have not received a solid answer around it.

6

It's the

And I am here to say that perhaps maybe there's

7

a chance that this could be the model where co-location

8

between the charter school and a neighborhood high

9

school works, but there must be the proper investment in

10

both schools.

11

You see, Hirsch at some point in time got sick.

12

Our buyers dropped, the academics became to fell, the

13

level of the school began to come down.

14

CPS.

15

They were fleeing from the building.

And we were under

18

19

20

We were under

And if nothing is done to

So I'm not standing here to you today saying

21

that a co-location is not what's right for you, but if

22

AIM has honors classes, that doesn't give Hirsch

23

students honors classes, if AIM has arts classes, that

24

doesn't mean that you can go across the hall and dance

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

in their classes and get credit for that, that does not

2

mean that the opportunities that they have you'll have

3

because we are, unfortunately a part of CPS, which is

4

government by policies and procedures.

5

So our world, our fight, our fight is with who

6

we are a part of, who should be taking care of us.

7

fight is with our primary care physician who has allowed

8

us to get sick, allowed our buyers to drop, allowed us

MR. MULLINS:

Good afternoon.

My name is

3

Brian Mullins.

4

and I am against the co-location of this school.

5

I am a life-long community member here,

We can sit up in here and go back and forth all

6

day.

7

from the charter school and want the school to take

8

place here.

We can hear all this again coming from the people

9

But we know this is part of a larger scheme of

10

things that's been happening in Chicago.

11

and CPS has been closing 270 schools, I believe

12

including Mayor Daley, in our communities over the last

13

ten years.

14

will lead to closing down Hirsch High School and taking

15

it over.

16

like it is.

17

Rahm Emanuel

So this move they're making now, of course,

It's not a secret, and we shouldn't even act
I think we're doing everybody a disservice.

The gentleman before me, he talked about

18

New Life and what New Life does as far as Jesus is

19

concerned.

20

and let Hirsch handle education in our community.

21

Churches have come into communities in Chicago who are

22

connected to Rahm Emanuel and CPS, the same exact

23

formula, all black communities on the south and west

24

sides of Chicago.

I think we should let New Life handle Jesus

This is no different, and it's going

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

to take place.

doing to our community on a larger scale.

there, I was just like the teacher is telling me to do

5

this so I'm going to learn it.

What are you interested in?

7

What do you care about?

Where do you want to go?

Personally, AIM students think in a sense that

they're driving it and reflecting on their learning,

they're placing a world and driving it.

The arts are a proper way to tap into this as

UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:

I'm sorry.

Two minutes

wasn't enough.

3

But the reason why I get to speak again is

4

because I am the co-chair of CPS Community Action

5

Council.

6

Suburban School Educators and Teach for the Future

7

Incorporated.

I have an organization Chicago Alliance

8

As I said, since 1987 I've been involved as a

9

parent, a grandparent, a teacher, a union organizer, a

10

community organizer, and my latest endeavor is that I've

11

written a book about this education process.

12

What I want you to know is that all research

13

says that charters, there's no difference, no charter

14

schools, all the research, are providing any better

15

academic environment for our students.

16

It just didn't happen.

That's a lie.

It hasn't happened in 20 years.

17

The University of Chicago consortium says so.

18

Every research report says the only difference in what

19

the charters have brought is the color of the teachers

20

teaching.

21

terminated as a result of the proliferation of charter

22

schools.

23
24

There are 130,000 African-American teachers

There are ten thousand here in Chicago.
And you're bringing in all these other people

who are not certified, don't be fooled, they haven't

TOOMEY REPORTING
312-853-0648

gone through the vetting process that we had to go

2

through, they haven't recertified, they haven't

3

certified, they do not have the credentials to stand

4

behind or before our children, and that's the honest to

5

goodness truth.

6

And the fact is this; they are not succeeding.

7

So we can have a nice building, but what we need to do

8

is fund Hirsch.

9

I'm a musician.

All my children are musicians.

10

I was the chair at Kenwood for ten years raising money.

11

They will not fund music.

12

Music can be the heart

As the principal said, join, join it, support

13

it, bring your program here, but don't take the

14

academics, don't take the school because it's union

15

organized.

16

I saw how you took schools when a charter came;

17

public school kids on one side, private on the other,

18

charter, division.

We cannot allow this division to

19

keep taking place.

Support our schools, make us whole,

20

make our community whole, support the principal, support

21

the teachers, and then you will see change and demand

22

that CPS fund us, demand that they fund these beautiful

23

children here.

So to come here again, and I was here last

10

week, for some of you who weren't here last week, I just

11

invite everyone to just be a little curious.

12

want to be curious what does this mean about opening up

13

a charter school, co-locating, co-relating, all of that

14

stuff, right?

15

Right?

We

What does that mean?

The best we can do is educate ourselves on what

16

that means.

17

one side of the fence or another sharing what it means

18

to them, sharing what it doesn't mean.

19

We've had a bunch of people come up here on

We've been

20

doing all of that.

21

personally, where do you stand about it?

22

to the other side and checked in to see what it looks

23

like?

24

So when we think about it
Have you gone

Have any of you done that work.
For the folks who were here last week, if you

TOOMEY REPORTING

3

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER:

4

MR. AXINTUNDE:

5

Okay.

I checked it out.

So you checked it out.

Some of you haven't done that work yet.

So

6

before we even get into making a concrete decision,

7

right, because if you go to the store or you want to buy

8

a car, you don't buy the first thing you see, you do

9

your homework, right, you shop around, ask the other

10

people's opinions, and then you formalize your own

11

opinion.

12

So, again, I just want to invite everybody,

13

before you go ahead and say that this is bad and wrong

14

or this is great, go check in on the other side and find

15

out what could be the possibility if we actually

16

co-located and we actually shared resources.

17

What does that look like?

What type of

18

resources?

19

types of resources are you going to share.

20

students go from one class to another?

21

students keep the parents in the rooms?

22

students actually elevate their knowledge because

23

they're sharing students from a different place?

24

wrong with that?
