rules, but that the meeting did not convene due to a lack of a quorum. The trustees
discussed that the minutes be reviewed to verify how the referral was made to the
Legislative Committee. Trustee Goode clarified that the review of the administrative
rules had been referred to the Legislative Committee and stated that she will provide
the referral of the administrative rules matter from the Board to the Legislative
Committee. She also stated that she would recommend that minutes that have been
approved by the Board not be subject to further amendments at later meetings.

posted to BoardEffect as had been requested. President Fitzgerald suggested that the
incoming Board president might consider recording the Board meetings to assure that

3. Administrative Report
a. Open Enrollment Update
Jane Hawes, Senior Manager of Health Benefits, stated that the Fund held three Open
Enrollment meetings in 2017. Overall, the attendance at the meetings was about 10%
less than in the previous year, but not unexpected due to few venues and no plan
changes. Ms. Hawes stated that annuitants who attended the Open Enrollment events
were seeking basic information about how the health plan works, which indicated a
need for more health benefits education for current and new retirees. She noted a
significant number of members (96) switched from the more expensive Choice Plus
plan and that 47 members elected to stop coverage effective January 1, 2018. It was
discussed whether the Fund had information about the reasons for members dropping
coverage and that it might be useful to survey members as to their reasons for doing
so.
b. Relocation Update and Consideration of Disposal Plan
Nickol R. Hackett, Executive Director & CIO, presented the budget for the relocation
of the Fund’s administrative office to 70 W. Madison which showed the Budgeted
and Projected Buildout Expenses for costs incurred for both the renovation and the
move. It was noted that the rent abatement for the new location was more favorable
than anticipated and that the Fund’s out-of-pocket costs were about $60,000 and
below budget. The trustees discussed that the budget be presented at the next meeting.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the
presented relocation budget be reworked as the trustees discussed and be presented
again at the January, 2018 Board meeting.

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

The Executive Director stated that the Fund had received notice on November 16,
2017, from the Landlord at 33 N. Dearborn stating that the Fund was required to
remove certain HVAC and other equipment from the premises pursuant to the Lease.
The Landlord had offered to engage vendors on behalf of the Fund to remove the
identified items. The Landlord would charge the Fund a 10% administrative fee and
presented the proposals from the vendors that it received. The Fund attempted to
identify other vendors for the removals, but was not able to provide more competitive
pricing. The trustees discussed that outside legal counsel should review the Lease to
determine if the Fund was obligated to remove the items identified by the Landlord.
4

 It was moved by Trustee DeGraff and seconded by Trustee Nevius that the Board
authorize the retention of North Dearborn Building Company, LP to contract with, on
the Fund’s behalf, the identified vendors to remove and dispose of certain items
pursuant to the Lease at 33 N. Dearborn, as presented, at a total cost not to exceed
$16,000, such authorization being contingent upon confirmation from Burke Burns &
Pinelli that the Fund was obligated under the Lease to make such removals and
determine correct action as to the disposal issues. It was further moved that Fund staff
was authorized to take any reasonable action necessary to effectuate the foregoing
including, subject to legal review, the execution and delivery of related written by the
Executive Director on behalf of the Fund.

4. Legislative Matters
a. Ratification of 2018 Intergovernmental Agreement
The Executive Director & CIO stated that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
had approved an Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) with the Fund that provided
for additional distributions in the total amount of $353,436,000 to be paid by Cook
County to the County Fund in monthly installments beginning on December 31, 2017
and concluding on or before November 30, 2017. The Executive Director stated that
she highlighted to the Board of Commissioners, the number of annuitants were
projected to exceed the number of active employees by 2019 and that the Board of
Commissioners supported the IGA to sustain the County’s Fund viability. The
trustees had earlier indicated that they would approve the IGA should it be adopted by
the County Board.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the
Board ratify the action taken to approve the 2018 Intergovernmental Agreement with
Cook County to provide additional distributions to the Fund, as presented.

b. Authorization of 2018 Actuarial Experience Study
5

 Gary LeDonne, Senior Policy Advisor, stated that actuarial best practices recommend
that large public pension funds conduct an actuarial experience study every three to
five years. The Fund’s actuary conducted actuarial experience studies in advance of
the 2009 and 2013 actuarial valuations. Mr. LeDonne asked that the Board consider
retaining Conduent HR Consulting to perform an actuarial experience study in
advance of the 2017 actuarial valuations. The trustees discussed whether the actuarial
experience study should be delayed for an additional year in the event that a new
actuarial consultant was retained but noted that the core team at the current actuary
was familiar with the Fund’s data.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Wilson that the Board
approve the retention of the Fund’s current actuarial consultant, Conduent HR
Consulting to perform an Actuarial Experience Study, as presented, at a cost not to
exceed $42,000. It was further moved that Fund staff was authorized to take any
reasonable action necessary to effectuate the foregoing including, subject to legal
review, the execution and delivery of related written agreements by the Executive
Director on behalf of the Fund.

5. Benefit Matters
a. Disabled Dependent Health Benefits Coverage
The Senior Manager of Health Benefits stated that the Fund had received an
application for health benefits for an annuitant’s disabled dependent child who
attained the age of 26. She stated that UnitedHealth Care had confirmed that the adult
disabled dependent had met the criteria for coverage. It was discussed that there has
been a practice to cover an annuitant’s adult disabled dependent, but that the Fund did
not have specific guidelines on this matter. It was also discussed that staff should
develop procedures for this coverage.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board
approve coverage under the Health Plan, subject to the Fund’s processing procedures,
for an annuitant’s disabled adult dependent, as presented.

 6. Legal Matters
a. In the Matter of Michno – Hearing Officer Recommendations
Margaret M. Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, stated that the Fund had received a “Report
of Hearing Officer” that had been prepared by Retired Judge Michael C. Close in
regard to the administrative hearing and Independent Medical Evaluation (“IME”) for
Mr. Gene Michno who had applied for duty disability benefits. His attorney, Ms.
Dana Kurtz, had filed a “Motion for Leave to File a Memorandum of Exceptions to
Hearing Officer Close’s Recommended Opinion” on the morning of December 7,
2017.
It was moved by Trustee Goode and seconded by Trustee Ochalla that the secured
material regarding Mr. Michno be posted in the Resource Library of BoardEffect. It
was further moved that Mr. Michno, through his attorney Ms. Dana Kurtz, would be
allowed 60 days to prepare a memorandum of exceptions and that the Fund would
have 30 days to respond.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

b. In the Matter of Budlove/Salerno
The Legal Advisor stated that Mr. Charles Salerno and Mr. Scott Budlove have
administrative hearings pending regarding their eligibility for duty disability benefits. The
members have filed a complaint in the Northern District of Illinois claiming that they
were denied certain rights in regard to the benefits they allege they are entitled to
receive and named all current trustees, certain former trustees and Fund staff as
defendants. The Cook County State’s Attorney is representing the Fund and has asked
if the Fund may accept service on behalf of the named defendants and allow the
State’s Attorney’s Office to represent them in the pending proceeding. Because all
the trustees have entered Indemnity Agreements with the Fund, and there are
common issues related to all, it would be prudent to have common representation. It
was also discussed that Burke Burns & Pinelli be retained as additional counsel in this
matter.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee DeGraff that the Board
authorize the Fund to accept service on behalf of the named defendants, that the Cook
County State’s Attorney be authorized to enter appearances of their behalf and that
Burke Burns & Pinelli be retained as additional counsel.
Vote Result:

MOTION ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE

Sarah Boeckman of Burke Burns & Pinelli stated that there were two recently enacted
legislative matters to bring to the Board’s attention. She stated that PA 100-0542
required the Fund to obtain disclosures from its investment consultant regarding
7

 searches for investment services from entities owned by minorities and females and
required additional disclosures which were to be made by January 1, 2018, and in
subsequent years. Ms. Boeckman also stated that PA 100-0554 would require the
Board to adopt a policy about sexual harassment and that the members would need to
receive annual training on sexual harassment beginning in 2018. The trustees asked
that the legislation be posted on BoardEffect.
7. 2018 Finance Report
a. 2018 Budget Presentation
The Executive Director presented an overview of the 2018 administrative budget for
the Fund. She stated that there had been changes in staffing responsibilities and that
the Fund continued to provide services to a growing member base with fewer staff
members and with lower administrative costs than similarly situated local funds. The
Fund has continued to identify efficiencies in serving members, which include the
newly implemented procedures for scheduled appointments. While seven new
employees were added, the total staffing remained flat because the new hires were
due to staff attrition. Overall, and of particular concern and impact, is the anticipation
that in two years the annuitant population will exceed the number of active
employees. The Fund will need to efficiently utilize its resources to manage the
payment of benefits given demographic change.
Ms. Hackett noted several of the Fund’s accomplishments in 2017 including, but not
limited to, the completion of a multi-year digitization of member records, the
retention of a consultant to prepare a RFP for a new pension administration system
and the implementation of the EGWP program which reduced expenses for
prescription medications. The trustees discussed the claim that BlueCross Blue Shield
had made regarding the Fund’s obligation to pay vendor fees and other items after its
engagement as the third party administrator of the health benefits plan had ended. The
trustees asked that the budget be presented to show the budgeted amount, the actual
spend and the variance.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Kouruklis that the
Fiscal Year 2018 Administrative Budget be deferred to the January 2018 board
meeting. It was further moved that the BlueCross BlueShield demand for payment be
reviewed by outside legal counsel at a cost not exceed $5,000, without further Board
approval.

b. 2018 Education and Travel Pre-Approval

8

 It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee DeGraff, consistent
with the recommendations of the Fund staff and Fund counsel, that the expenses,
including any associated travel expenses, incurred by any Trustee or Fund staff in
attending any of the indicated educational conferences be approved provided that the
reimbursement shall be in and for amounts that are consistent with the Fund’s Travel
Expense Reimbursement Policy.

b. 2018 Proposed Election of Officers and Committee Assignments
It was moved by Trustee Fitzgerald that the Emerging Managers Sub-Committee be
merged into the Investment Committee. After discussion among the trustees, it did
not appear to be in the Fund’s interest to do so, and the motion was withdrawn.
The Board considered the election of officers pursuant to Section 9-188 of the Illinois
