Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail convened the Finance and Audit Committee meeting at 8:32 a.m.
Meeting Minutes
A motion was made by Mayor John Hunter to approve the minutes of the Finance and Audit
Committee meeting held on May 10, 2019. The motion was seconded by Mr. Michael Dever. The
motion passed by voice vote.
Public Comments
No public comments were made at this meeting.
Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci reported on the following:
•

The U.S. House approved $5 million for future Hyperloop planning oversight.

•

NOACA received an INFRA grant in the amount of $9.02 million from the United
States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for the Irishtown Bend project.

•

The NOACA Annual Meeting will be held at the Global Center for Health Innovation
on September 13, 2019.

•

ODOT is accepting applications for the Ohio Bridge Partnership Program (OBPP)
from September 1 - October 15, 2019; up to $1 million is available per project for
SFY 2022-2023.

ACTION ITEMS
NOACA SFY 2021-2024 TIP Financials
Mr. Randy Lane stated that NOACA is in the process of developing its SFY 2021-2024
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), which will contain road, bridge, public transit and
other transportation projects scheduled for implementation with federal funding during that period.
He noted that projects in the TIP are supported by federal funds from ODOT, transit agencies and
NOACA. Mr. Lane reviewed the following:
•

Draft SFY 2021-2024 TIP program

8300c
1-1

 •
•
•
•

Financial assumptions
STBG Program Summary that has a total estimated budget of $155,600,578
TA Program Summary that has a total estimated budget of $14,397,454
Statewide CMAQ Program summary that has a total estimated budget of $68,956,469

Mr. Lane mentioned that additional funding that may become available will be prioritized in
consideration of NOACA’s hierarchy of approaches.
Mr. Lane reviewed the estimated debt service in the SFY 2021-2024 TIP. He noted that by SFY
2024, the debt service will have a balance of $11,600,363. He reminded the Committee that
NOACA created a policy that limits existing and planned debt service to no more then 50%, and
for the draft SFY 2021-2024 TIP, the debt service will be as follows: STBG - $12.9 million (35%)
peak in SFY 2020 and CMAQ - $2.3 million (14%) peak in SFY 2032.
Mr. Lane stated that new project recommendations for NOACA administered funds will
be presented to the Board for approval on September 13, 2019. The final TIP, inclusive of both
NOACA and other agency funded projects will be presented to the Planning and Programming
Committee for recommendation on January 17, 2020, and then to the Board for approval on
March 13, 2020.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to recommend the SFY 2021-2024 TIP financials to the
Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mr. Dever.
Mr. Dever asked Mr. Lane to comment on the Thrive 105 Corridor improvements. Mr. Lane stated
that the Thrive 105 project was originally studied using TLCI funds from NOACA and an USDOT
TIGER Grant through the City of Cleveland. Mr. Lane said the project will look at establishing a
prioritized bus network through East 105th Street to East 93rd Street; capitalizing on Opportunity
Corridor investments; improving the multimodal transportation system; reviving the
transportation corridor; stimulating the neighborhood; and capitalizing on investments
adjacent to the street network.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Thrive 105 project is bus rapid transit (BRT) light.
Mayor Hunter asked if the Finance and Audit Committee approves the TIP financials will that
prevent sponsors from being able to make changes to their projects.
Ms. Gallucci said no. She noted that if there is an error on the project list or a project does not
need funding, it will be taken off the list and another project would be elevated on the list. She
stated that the action requested at this meeting is primarily around funding and not the projects.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Executive Committee will be informed that staff is still working on
funding for some of the projects on the list.
The Finance and Audit Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
SFY 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP) and Budget Completion Report
Ms. Daila Shimek gave an overview of NOACA’s OWP and Budget Completion Report that
includes 31 projects (completed and ongoing) and consists of 114 work products and tasks.
She stated that approximately 83% of NOACA’s budget has been expended and noted that
pending Board approval, the report will be sent to ODOT and the appropriate federal agencies
for review.

8300c
1-2

 A motion was made by Commissioner Hutson to recommend the SFY 2019 OWP and Budget
Completion Report to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Michael
Gammella. The motion passed by voice vote.
Great Lakes Hyperloop Contract Amendment
Ms. Kathy Sarli provided background on the Great Lakes Hyperloop contract with Transportation
Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS). She mentioned that the Board passed a
resolution that amended the contract for the extension of the corridor from Youngstown to
Pittsburgh. She mentioned that since the last Finance and Audit Committee meeting, NOACA
received a grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation in the amount of $100,000 that will be
used to do a more detailed analysis of the entire corridor.
Ms. Sarli stated that the budget for the Great Lakes Hyperloop contract needs to be amended
from $650,000 to $750,000; the TEMS contract needs to be amended in the amount of $84,600;
and the contract date needs to be extended to December 31, 2019.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to recommend the Great Lakes Hyperloop Contract
amendment to the Executive Committee. The motion was seconded by Mayor Gammella. The
motion passed by voice vote.
Mayor Hunter asked if NOACA’s investment is $35,393 or $84,600. Ms. Gallucci said $35,393
and noted that $84,600 is coming from the grant.
PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
State Fiscal Year 2019 Capital Programs Performance
Mr. Lane stated that NOACA receives a total of $52.3 million annually from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for its programs.
Mr. Lane reviewed the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

2019 Capital Programs Financial Summary
FHWA administered funding - a total of $73.3 million; encumbered - $63.9 million (87%);
and carry forward to SFY 2019 - $9.4 million (13%)
Carry forward history
FTA administered funding
Accomplishments (SIB / other debt service paid down - $4.7 million and projects
awarded to contract)
Capital programs performance measures

Mr. Lane stated that staff will continue to work with the sponsors to ensure projects are
programmed in SFY quarters 1-3; react to program changes in quarter 4; continue to review
project estimates at the programming level and throughout development; and identify and
advance ready projects.
Mr. Bruce Landeg asked if funds will go back to the entire NOACA region if a program comes in
under budget. Mr. Lane said the funds would come back to the NOACA program and the Board
would decide how the money would be used when recommendations are presented for the next
TIP. Mr. Lane noted that funds are not retained by the community for another project.

8300c
1-3

 Ms. Gallucci stated that staff will need to rethink NOACA’s current process. She said the way the
next TIP is developed, staff would utilize some targets by county that would allow certain projects
to get approved. She stated that if projects come in under budget, it would not be fair to make
those funds available for the entire region, so staff will need to be cognizant of what projects are
put in the TIP under that approach. She said if a project comes in under budget, another project
in that same community would move up on the list.
Reports / Updates
The financial report and Capital Programs Performance Measures Report were included in the
meeting packet.
Old Business
No old business was discussed at this meeting.
New Business
No new business was discussed at this meeting.
Adjournment
Mayor Holzheimer Gail stated that the next Finance and Audit Committee meeting will be held at
the NOACA offices on November 8, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. There being no further business, the
meeting was adjourned at 9:20 a.m.

TO:

NOACA Finance and Audit Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

PNC Bank Depository Agreement and Collateralized Line of Credit

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Director’s December 2019 agenda. Specifically, it would authorize the Executive Director to sign
a depository agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) which has committed to provide
a revolving line of credit to NOACA secured by local revenues and other charges for services pending PNC
Bank credit approval.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board approved the procurement of a revolving line of credit and an associated policy at the March 2019
Board meeting (Resolution 2019-011) following an extended Federal government shutdown (see attached
policy). According to the policy, any collateral must be approved by the Finance and Audit Committee and
the Board of Directors.
Currently, NOACA’s bank accounts are with Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens Bank”) However, Citizens Bank
was unable to offer NOACA a revolving line of credit. Consequently, NOACA issued an RFP for primary
banking services and a revolving line of credit on June 5th, 2019. The July 6th deadline was extended to July
31st for those institutions expressing interest. The RFP was advertised on the agency’s website and mailed
to Huntington National Bank, Fifth Third Bank, and PNC Bank.
The only responding bank was PNC Bank, which has provided a term sheet offering a revolving line of credit
for $750,000 secured by local revenues and other charges. PNC Bank is a local institution with an outstanding
CRA rating from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2018. The bank’s senior debt is rated as
follows:

TD Ameritrade Version
Moody’s

Superior
PNC Bank is offering an earnings credit of 1.0% to offset the cost of their services and deposit collateral
through the Ohio Pooled Collateral System in accordance with Section 135.182 of the Ohio Revised Code.
The depository agreement is attached.
4-1

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of changing bank depository accounts would be negligible monthly charges based on an
earnings credit of 1.0% and the current schedule of fees for services. The cost of the revolving line of credit
would be documentation fees of approximately $1,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will transfer its primary bank accounts to PNC Bank contingent upon
credit approval of the revolving line of credit by PNC Bank and determination of acceptable terms in the loan
agreement by NOACA’s Executive Director.
GG/bg/sm/8301c

4-2

 NOACA Revolving Line of Credit Policy
PURPOSE
• The purpose of the revolving line of credit is to provide a contingency plan in the event of an
extended federal government shutdown or other unusual or unexpected event that impairs liquidity.
• The Policy provides the Executive Director the ability to obtain the revolving line of credit based on
the acceptability of the terms.
AUTHORIZATION
• The Executive Director can authorize the opening and closing of a revolving line of credit, which
would preferably be from a commercial bank, in the amount not to exceed $1,000,000.
• If collateral is required to secure the revolving line of credit, the options for said collateral must be
approved by the Finance and Audit Committee and Board of Directors.
DRAWDOWNS
• Drawdowns can only be executed when the Agency has inadequate liquidity for operating purposes
(payroll and/or to pay vendors and contractors) where non-payment would be detrimental to the
Agency
• The amount of a drawdown must be limited to the amount required to meet the above-described
obligations.
• Drawdowns require signatures of the following individuals:
o NOACA Board President
o Executive Director and
o Comptroller
(In the event that the Executive Director or Comptroller is not available, the Director of Administrative
Services can serve as one of the signers.)
• The drawdowns can only be deposited electronically directly from the bank into the Agency’s primary
checking account.
• The drawdowns shall not exceed $100,000 per week.
REPAYMENT
• The loan must be repaid within 5 business days to the extent possible once the replacement funds
(grant or other reimbursements) have been received.
The source of repayment is the grant reimbursement in the event of a Federal government shutdown.

 DEPOSITORY AGREEMENT
(OHIO PUBLIC FUNDS)

THIS DEPOSITORY AGREEMENT is made by and between PNC BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, a national banking association under the laws of the United States, located and
doing
business
within
the
State
of
Ohio
(“Bank”)
and
________________________________________, a public body, chartered under the laws of the
State of Ohio (“Depositor”). This Depository Agreement replaces all prior depository agreements
between Bank and Depositor to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions below. The
Bank reserves the right to rescind this Agreement if the Depositor is not a public body, chartered
under the laws of the State of Ohio.
1. Depositor, by proper action of its governing body, hereby designates Bank as a public
depository for Depositor’s active, interim or inactive deposits during the period beginning on
the later of the execution dates on this Depository Agreement and continuing until the
Designation Date, defined below, as such date may be extended by the Depositor. This
Agreement shall continue in effect until all accounts are closed pursuant to the documentation
applicable to the accounts.
2. The Bank will receive funds for deposit from the Depositor and deposit said funds into the
account(s) designated by the Depositor and agreed to by Bank. The Bank will furnish to the
Depositor a monthly statement during any time that the Bank holds any active, interim or
inactive deposits, showing the activity and balance of funds on deposit in any account for which
such a statement is customarily issued.
3. The Bank is required by the laws of the State of Ohio to collateralize the uninsured public
deposits of the Depositor and has elected to do so through the Ohio Pooled Collateral System
(OPCS) as prescribed in section 135.182 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). The Bank currently
collateralizes the Depositor’s funds at one hundred and five percent. Effective on or about
December 31, 2017, the collateral floor rate will change to one hundred and two percent
(102%). The Bank hereby notifies the Depositor that it will apply for a reduced collateral floor
rate for public deposits under ORC Section 135.182(B)(1)(b) and the Treasurer will thereafter
assign a new collateral floor rate. The Depositor will be notified of any changes to the
collateral rate on its deposits on the OPCS portal. The parties acknowledge and agree that
collateral rates are negotiable, subject to the collateral floor rate established by the Treasurer.
The Bank may choose to exit the OPCS at any time upon notice to the Depositor. In the event
of such notice, the Bank will separately collateralize the deposits in accordance with the ORC.
4. The Bank shall be required to furnish collateral to cover only those deposits that are in excess
of the respective portions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other
corporation hereafter organized by the United States, the State of Ohio, or agency thereof for
the purpose of insuring deposits, as calculated for collateral purposes by the Ohio State
Treasurer.

 5. The Depositor acknowledges and agrees that the OPCS requires the Bank to report the amount
of public deposits and certain confidential information of the Depositor daily via a secure file
transfer protocol (SFTP) connection to the Treasurer’s office. The Depositor agrees that the
Bank has no responsibility for the Treasurer’s maintenance or use of this confidential
information and the Depositor releases the Bank from any or all claims related thereto. The
Depositor shall be responsible for reviewing and monitoring the reports posted on the OPCS
portal, verifying the accuracy of the reports and reporting any discrepancies to the Bank.
6. Depositor agrees to be subject to the rules governing the accounts in which the Depositor’s
active, interim and inactive deposits are deposited and to provide the Bank the names and
signatures of those persons authorized to execute drafts on and make withdrawals from the
account(s) and to provide documentation evidencing such authority as the Bank may request.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement, intending to
be bound thereby.

NOACA Finance and Audit Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Agency Procurement - NOACA Signal Timing & Optimization Program FY2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Directors’ December 2019 agenda. Specifically, it would award a contract to Albeck Gerken
Inc., Transportation Engineers for NOACA’s Signal Timing & Optimization Program in the not to exceed
amount of $439,438.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Today, there are more than 272,000 traffic signals in the United States. They play an important role in the
transportation network and are a source of significant frustration for the public when not operated efficiently.
As the era of freeway building draws to a close, urban arterials are being called upon to carry more users
than ever before at a time when the users of these facilities are growing more complex (older drivers, more
distractions, larger vehicles, etc.) and the demand for such use continues to outpace transportation supply.
Traffic signal timing efficiency degrades over time as volume patterns and magnitude change, development
occurs, or infrastructure changes. Outdated or poor traffic signal timing accounts for a significant portion of
traffic delay on urban arterials, and traffic signal optimization is one of the most cost effective ways to
reduce emissions, improve mobility, reduce delays and improve corridor safety.
NOACA’s approach to address the issues related to inefficient traffic signal timing was to develop a Signal
Timing Optimization Program (STOP), and in June 2016, the Board of Directors adopted resolution 2016-015,
which approved a consultant firm to develop a pilot STOP project for two corridors.
STOP projects in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 have been successfully implemented. The STOP
for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 proposes to continue retiming regionally-significant corridors to provide
substantial benefits.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on September 9, 2019 with proposals due on October 8,
2019; six proposals were received. Vendors were scored on three criteria: project approach, experience and
qualifications. After evaluating the proposals, the NOACA review team determined that the firm with the
highest scores was Albeck Gerken, Inc.
As for all of the recommended corridors, staff developed recommendations for project corridors utilizing a
transportation operations and emissions reduction framework and criteria. The criteria, as well as the
potential corridors were presented to the Safety and Operations Council, the Air Quality Subcommittee and
the Transportation Subcommittee for information and input.

4-7

 The FY2020-FY2021 STOP project consists of Part I and Part II with Part II being “if authorized”.
Part I consists of two corridors:
•
•

Bagley Road (from Lindbergh Rd. to Pearl Rd. 3.56 miles, 25 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Berea and Middleburgh Heights.
Ridge Road (from Pearl Rd. to Denison Ave., 3.47 miles, 20 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Parma, Brooklyn, and Cleveland.

Part II, if authorized, will consist of two corridors/grid of similar length and number of intersections, with the
scope to be developed by NOACA, to begin after Part I has been finalized.
NOACA will administer and manage the STOP program, but the projects will not be implemented without
the approval of the agencies that own, operate and/or maintain the project signals. NOACA will work closely
with the project sponsors and consultants to successfully complete the STOP projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Part I of the proposed contract will be executed for one year commencing on or around January 2020 and
ending on or around March 2021; at a cost not to exceed $439,438. $440,000 was budgeted in the FY2020
OWP for a consultant. Part II, if authorized, will also take place over approximately one year after Part I is
finalized at a cost negotiated by NOACA. This project is funded through NOACA’s CMAQ funds.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, staff will work with the local communities involved and the consultant team to
implement the signal timing optimization program.

RE:

Agency Procurement – NOACA Net Zero Cool Project

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Directors’ December 2019 agenda. Specifically, it would award a contract to F. Buddie
Contracting, Ltd. for NOACA’s Net Zero Cool Project (Design Build) in an amount not to exceed $888,000,
which reflects current estimates of total project costs, pending appropriate funding.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) supports the strategic implementation and long-term
maintenance of green infrastructure projects. NEORSD funds green infrastructure projects within the
combined sewer area through its Green Infrastructure Grants (GIG) Program. Green infrastructure protects,
preserves, enhances, and restores natural hydrologic function. Such stormwater control measures (SCMs),
increase resiliency of infrastructure; reduce stress on wet weather drainage and collection systems; and
support healthy environments and strong communities.
The GIG Program is open to member communities, governmental entities, non-profit organizations 501(c)(3),
or businesses working in partnership with their community. These entities can propose water resource
projects that keep stormwater out of the combined sewer system and reduce capacity overflow problems..
The objectives and outcomes for Net Zero Cool are embodied in its name. “Net Zero” refers to NOACA’s
ambition to capture stormwater runoff from its impervious surface area and eliminate its contribution to the
combined wastewater/stormwater conveyance system. “Cool” refers to NOACA’s ambition to showcase its
green infrastructure elements with eye-catching, water-themed design; mural and green wall on the sides of
the building; educational placards along the sidewalk, adjacent to a proposed bioretention system and outdoor
classroom space on the green roof for lectures, tours and public meetings. Net Zero Cool would make NOACA
a true vanguard for NEORSD-funded green infrastructure implementation; a marquee to illuminate the
tremendous benefits of green infrastructure in Downtown Cleveland.
On September 6, NOACA submitted its proposal for “Net Zero Cool,” a three-phase, comprehensive suite of
measures to reduce stormwater runoff from its 100% impervious downtown Cleveland site and mitigate
runoff’s harmful impacts on the Frontal Lake Erie-Doan Brook Watershed.

4-9

 Project phases submitted to NEORSD include (with engineer’s estimates of build costs):
PHASE I (BUILDING) ($360,000)
Project A (One-story extensive green roof system with usable outdoor space accessible via second floor) $210,000
Project B (Roof water collection with bioretention) - $150,000
PHASE II (PARKING LOT) ($350,000)
Project A (Parking lot porous paving/center drive aisle) – $140,000
Project B (Carport structures with extensive green roof) - $210,000
PHASE III (WALLS: “THE RIBBON THAT WRAPS THE PACKAGE”) ($95,000)
Project A (One-story building extensive green wall system) - $35,000
Project B (Three-story building mural) - $60,000
The total project cost is estimated at $900,000. In addition to the $805,000 of estimated build costs outlined
above, NOACA estimates $83,000 in design costs and has already spent $12,000 on a design/engineering
team to explore opportunities through site visits, preliminary design proposals and stormwater modeling.
NOACA committed to a 20% match in its application to NEORSD, or $180,000, while NOACA requested
$720,000 in funding from NEORSD.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to hire a design-build firm, conditional on NEORSD (and
any potential future) funding, on September 21st, 2019. Proposals were due on October 21st, 2019; NOACA
received two proposals. Proposal were evaluated on their qualifications and their technical proposals. After
evaluation, the firm with the highest scores was F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd.
ABOUT THE VENDOR
F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd. is a certified CSB (Cleveland Small Business) and a Cuyahoga County SBE (Small
Business Enterprise) located in the City of Cleveland. They have over 55 years in general contracting
experience. Their design team consists of Osborn Engineering; headquartered in Cleveland and MKSK;
headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
TIMING
NOACA submitted a three phase grant application on September 6th, 2019. The NEORSD will announce
GIG awards in November and funded projects will begin January 1, 2020. Pending the GIG award amount,
NOACA may pursue other funding for the potentially unfunded portions of this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract will be executed for one year commencing on or around January 2020 and ending
on or around March 2021; at an amount currently estimated not to exceed $888,000. This action would also
amend the NOACA Budget and OWP as appropriate, pending NEORSD award and other potential funding.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, staff will work with the NEORSD, potential future funders involved, and the design
build team to design and build all or parts of the NOACA Net Cool Zero Project.

RE:

Project Funding Requests – LAK – Stevens Boulevard, Village of Lakeline

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement
on the Board of Director’s December 2019 agenda. Specifically, it would recommend additional
funding for the City of Eastlake’s Stevens Boulevard project to expand the project area into the adjacent
Village of Lakeline.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard Resurfacing Project is programmed in SFY 2020 of the current
2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), with a NOACA commitment of $2,022,300 of
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program funds. The current project scope and funding
commitment addresses the deficient pavement in the City of Eastlake from SR 91 to the north at the
Eastlake/Village of Lakeline corporation line. The project was identified as a need for SFY 2018-2021
TIP funding through the NOACA Transportation Asset Management (TAM) plan and tool. The tool
projects pavement deficiencies and recommends corrective work based on ODOT Pavement Condition
Ratings (PCR) for each segment of the federal-aid roadway network. Roadway segments that are less
than .5 lane miles are either filtered out or adjoined to larger adjacent segments if they are alike in both
condition and recommended corrective work.
The Village of Lakeline maintains approximately .08 miles (400 feet) of Stevens Boulevard, from the
current project limits at the Eastlake corporation line to Lakeshore Boulevard (SR 283). The PCR for
this segment is 63, matching the average PCR and recommended resurfacing of the Eastlake segment
that was prioritized for funding (see attached map). However, in development of the 2018-2021 TIP the
Lakeline segment was inadvertently filtered out for funding consideration because of its length. Rather,
the segment should have been adjoined to the Eastlake Stevens Boulevard segment and prioritized for
funding. NOACA staff recently became aware of this oversight in discussion with both the Village of
Lakeline and the City of Eastlake.

4 - 11

 As such, the Village of Lakeline is requesting consideration for a NOACA STBG program funding
commitment of $176,000 to expand the project across communities to provide maximum project
benefit. A local match of $44,000 (20%) has been committed from Lakeline for a total cost of $220,000.
Pending approval of funding, the City of Eastlake has agreed to incorporate the segment into its design
plans and its funding agreement with ODOT. The projects is currently scheduled for sale in early 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would increase the NOACA funding commitment to the City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard
project by $176,000 from $2,022,300 to $2,198,300. The increase would be funded utilizing existing
savings from STBG projects coming in under estimate. Therefore, there is no impact to other planned
and programmed TIP projects.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the TIP will be amended to incorporate the additional scope and funding for
the project.

RE:

E 66th Street Corridor Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Plan

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Directors’ December 2019 agenda. Specifically, this would add the E 66th Street Corridor
Update Project to the 2020 TLCI program and amend the fiscal year 2020 budget in the amount of
$150,000; pending Cleveland Foundation Grant award.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
In 2010, NOACA approved funding for the League Park Neighborhood District Plan, sponsored by the City
of Cleveland, through the Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) program. The study was
completed in 2012. The study established a strategy for future investment in the Hough neighborhood,
specifically the League Park District.
Since the completion of the original plan in 2012, there have been significant undertakings within and
beyond the immediate study area. In addition to investments made by the residents and community
stakeholders, several recent catalytic announcements have tipped the momentum toward the need to revisit
the plan for a comprehensive update, including:
•
•
•

the recent decision by The Cleveland Foundation to move its headquarters to E. 66th and Euclid;
the new location of the Hough Branch of the Cleveland Public Library at the corner of E. 66th and
Lexington;
the development plans for Allen Estates single and multi-family housing; and the plans for an
innovation district between Euclid and Chester along E. 66th Street.

An immediate update to the original plan, both in content and expanded geography, is needed to best guide
known and planned future investments in the corridor. The study update will address the following areas of
focus:
• Conduct new community outreach and involvement;
• Expand the original study area along E. 66th Street from Chester to Euclid;
• Integrate the updated land uses adjacent to the E. 66th Corridor study area;
• Consider the planned Cleveland Foundation headquarters, Innovation District campus plans,
proposed housing developments, and updated vacant land mapping;
4 - 15

 •
•
•

Align with existing or identified future planning efforts;
Update of infrastructure plans providing for green and complete streets to provide seamless
transportation access for all modes;
Update the implementation schedule and general cost estimates.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the project is $150,000, pending Cleveland Foundation Grant award. This action will not
impact any funding for the current TLCI solicitation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the budget will be amended and staff will work with the project sponsor to program
and develop the project.
