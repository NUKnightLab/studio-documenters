1620/1620 SSG
Curtain Wall System
See Less So You Can See More

It’s hard to say whether the beauty of the 1620/1620 SSG (structural
silicone glazed) Curtain Wall System is in the slim, sleek 2" sightline or
in the performance. Built on the strength and reliability of the flagship
1600 curtain wall platform, the 1620/1620 SSG Curtain Wall System is
an excellent choice for low- to mid-rise applications.

The 1620/1620 SSG Curtain Wall System is engineered with a thermal
break and can accommodate double pane insulating glass. Helping
architects and glazing contractors achieve even greater thermal
performance is an optional fiberglass pressure plate. Glaziers and
installers can leverage their previous knowledge of 1600 Wall
System™1 and 1600 Wall System™2 to simplify installation. With a
slimmed-down sightline and design features that have been tested
to U.S. and Canadian standards, the 1620/1620 SSG Curtain Wall
System allows you to see more.

The 1620 / 1620 SSG Curtain Wall Systems has been tested in
accordance with the following major standards for curtain walls:

Performance and Aesthetics
The 1620/1620 SSG Curtain Wall System delivers the desired narrow
sightline aesthetic of many traditional storefront products packaged
with performance levels and options expected of a curtain wall
system. The system is tested in accordance with North American
performance standards for curtain walls, including air and water
infiltration, thermal transmittance, severe wind-driven rain, acoustical,
and condensation resistance.
The stick-fabricated, pressure-glazed curtain wall system is available
as a four-sided captured system and offers a vertical SSG mullion
option. Additionally, to create flush and unbroken sightlines, the
captured and SSG options both use concealed fasteners in their
joinery construction.

framing systems and is suitable for low or high
rise buildings.
The AA ®605TE and AA ®605TE Plus Swing
Doors are available as single action open-in
or open-out swing doors and can be single
or dual colour.

Construction
The AA ®605TE and AA ®605TE Plus Swing
Doors are three chamber pressure equalised

Performance

The AA®720 FR has been tested with specialist
glazing. All glazing options are available in the
AA®720 FR Product Manual.

Kawneer’s AA®720 FR Door and Fixed Light
variants enable design flexibility when fire
protection is a requirement to building design.
They enable safe evacuation of building
occupants by offering fire and smoke
protection in escape routes. They can also be
used to prevent the spread of fire through the
building and to adjacent buildings.

Kebony® is a beautiful wood recommended by leading architects. It is sustainable, durable and requires no maintenance beyond normal
cleaning. Kebony’s performance has been proven in a variety of applications including decking and cladding.
Developed in Norway, the Kebony® technology is an environmentally friendly, patented process, which enhances the properties of
sustainable softwood with a bio-based liquid. The process permanently modifies the wood cell walls giving Kebony premium hardwood
characteristics and a rich brown color. After exposure to sun and rain the wood develops a natural silver-gray patina..
The Kebony® technology permanently transforms sustainable wood species such as pine into Kebony wood with features that are
comparable, and in some cases superior, to those of precious tropical hardwoods. This unique environmentally friendly process is also a
superior alternative to traditional wood treatment based on impregnation with biocides (wood preservatives). The company’s patentprotected production processes yield products that deliver major improvements in durability and dimensional stability, at the same time
as being highly attractive. The Kebony products are suitable for a multitude of applications and designs – encompassing both indoor and
outdoor applications.

Moire™ Fluted Channel Glass (Ultra-Brilliant Low-Iron or Regular)

Application:
Interior, Exterior

Composition:
Regular or optically-clear (low-iron) glass, including up to 40% post-consumer recycled glass

Installation:
Approx. ¼”-thick lightweight glass in channel form is relatively easy to install, especially with the smart design of Bendheim’s channel
glass wall systems. No specialized training is required. Any competent commercial glazier with curtainwall or storefront installation
experience can handle the channel glass installation. Cranes are not required, as individual glass channels are lightweight. The
channels can be glazed on site or pre-assembled at the glazier’s shop using Bendheim’s unique unitized channel glass systems.

Approx Dimensions:
Length = up to 23 ft. (7 m); glass is fabricated to specified length. Width = 10.3" (260 mm). Flange depth = 2.4" (60 mm). Thickness =
0.28" (7 mm). Maximum size depends on wind loads, glass safety option, and other factors. Custom sizes may be available, please
inquire.

Approx Weight:
Approx. 5 lbs/ft² (24.5 kg/m²) for a single layer of channel glass (single-glazed configuration)

Safety Options:
Standard, Tempered

Maintenance:
Bendheim glass is easy to maintain. We suggest cleaning with warm water and a lint free cloth (terry cloth). Conventional nonabrasive glass cleaners may also be used.

Performance Characteristics:
Visible Light Transmittance (VLT) = 77% for double-glazed, uncoated, ultra-clear (low-iron) channel glass / 72% for doubleglazed, uncoated, clear (regular) channel glass
STC Rating = STC 34 to STC 38   Note: STC 34 is based on test of Bendheim I-41 conventional interlocking double-glazed
channel glass wall system with push-in gaskets. Wet-sealed I-60 channel glass system is projected to reach STC 38.
Compare to STC 33 for a typical interior wall (1/2" drywall on each side, wood studs, no insulation) and STC 39 for a typical
insulated interior wall (1/2" drywall on each side, wood studs + fiberglass insulation)

Testing:
Bendheim tempered safety channel glass is 100% heat soak tested (test is recommended for all exterior tempered glass
applications), and Safety Glazing Council certified. It meets the requirements for ANSI Z97.1 & the Consumer Product Safety
Commission CPSC 16FR, Part 1201 – Safety Standard for Architectural Glazing Materials. Heat soak testing minimizes the risk of
spontaneous tempered glass breakage as a result of nickel sulfide inclusions.

Kebony® is a beautiful wood recommended by leading architects. It is sustainable, durable and requires no maintenance beyond normal
cleaning. Kebony’s performance has been proven in a variety of applications including decking and cladding.
Developed in Norway, the Kebony® technology is an environmentally friendly, patented process, which enhances the properties of
sustainable softwood with a bio-based liquid. The process permanently modifies the wood cell walls giving Kebony premium hardwood
characteristics and a rich brown color. After exposure to sun and rain the wood develops a natural silver-gray patina..
The Kebony® technology permanently transforms sustainable wood species such as pine into Kebony wood with features that are
comparable, and in some cases superior, to those of precious tropical hardwoods. This unique environmentally friendly process is also a
superior alternative to traditional wood treatment based on impregnation with biocides (wood preservatives). The company’s patentprotected production processes yield products that deliver major improvements in durability and dimensional stability, at the same time
as being highly attractive. The Kebony products are suitable for a multitude of applications and designs – encompassing both indoor and
outdoor applications.

Trifab™ VG (VersaGlaze™)

Trifab™ VG 450, 451 & 451T (Thermal) Framing Systems &
Trifab™ 451UT (Ultra Thermal) Framing System
Design + Performance Versatility with
Unmatched Fabrication Flexibility

Preston Pointe, Louisville, KY
Architect: Potter & Associates Architects PLLC, Louisville, KY
Glazing Contractor: Kentucky Mirror & Plate Glass Company, Louisville, KY

Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ is built on the proven and successful Trifab™
platform – with all the versatility its name implies. There are enough
framing system choices, fabrication methods, design options and
performance levels to please the most discerning building owner,
architect and installer. The Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ family’s newest

•S
  crew Spline – for economical continuous runs utilizing two
piece vertical members that provide the option to pre-assemble
units with controlled shop labor costs and smaller field crews for
handling and installation.
•S
  hear Block – for punched openings or continuous runs using
tubular moldings with shear block clips that provide tight joints for
transporting large pre-assembled multi-lite units.
•S
  tick – for fast, easy field fabrication. Field measurements and
material cuts can be done when metal is on the job.
•T
  ype B – Same fabrication benefits as shear block except head
and sill run through.
All systems can be flush glazed from either the inside or outside. The
Weatherseal option provides an alternative to SSG vertical mullions
for Trifab™ VersaGlaze™ 450/451/451T. This ABS/ASA rigid polymer
extrusion allows complete
inside glazing and creates
a flush glass appearance
on the building exterior
without the added labor
of scaffolding or swing
stages. Additionally, HighPerformance (HP) Flashing
options are engineered
Brighton Landing, Cambridge, MA
to eliminate perimeter sill

 WOOD CURTAIN WALL SYSTEM
SERIES SI5000W

Natural wood interior, durable aluminum exterior.
Wood Curtain Walls, or Timber Walls, innovatively combine the warmth and beauty of a natural wood interior with the durability and
longevity of an aluminum exterior to create the perfect solution for those seeking a high-performing, sustainable building system. This
exterior aluminum system creates a superior barrier to the elements, limiting the wood’s exposure to any type of precipitation or wind
and dependably maintaining a high level of performance through positive drainage principles. The series SI5000W Wood Curtain Walls
are pressure equilized systems; this is achieved by overlapping the horizontal profiles with the vertical profiles. The unobstructed flow
from horizontal to vertical is key to the construction of this pressure equalized curtain wall. In addition, the wood is the main component
of structural support, as it stiffens the system and carries the dead load from the glazing.

112 Edmund Place Development Concerns

JenniferMy name is Carter Bundy and I am the owner & resident of a condo at The Carlton. I have been a proud member
of the Brush Park community since 2016. Over these past few years, I have welcomed developments such as
City Modern and The Scott that have added to the neighborhood which I call home. About two weeks ago, I was
made aware of the proposed development across from The Carlton.
At first, I shared the similar excitement that these other recent Brush Park developments brought, however, after
hearing /seeing the plans (last night) for a proposed giant 7-story, mixed-use development, I had to voice my
concerns:
1. The Carlton has been in place for over 100 years, and one of the tallest building in the neighborhood (8
stories)... which adds to its charm and the residents (MY) property values.
2. Other developments, such as City Modern, have lowered most of their structures to 5 stories or less in
order to accommodate the views of the homes on Edmund Place, between John R and Brush. Let's be
good neighbors and extend these guidelines between John R and Woodward.
3. Let's be sure to honor the history that built this community. The character and charm of Brush
Park must be maintained and setting a new standard for building heights will impair the historic nature
of Brush Park.
4. Having lived in Brush Park for two years now, I can't see how office space would mesh with the
residential community that we call home. Woodward Ave is just next door if I wanted commercial office
space.
Brush Park is a very tight-knit community, which welcomes the resurgence of Detroit. I know that I am not the
only one who share these concerns. Instead of building a development without actively seeking the involvement
of your neighbors, let's work together to compromise on a solution that adds value to all residents both inside the
neighborhood and beyond.
Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, comments or concerns. I look forward to learning more and
working with you to find common ground.
Thank you.

Fwd: URGENT: New Development Concern - 112 Edmund Place
IMG_5125.jpg; IMG_0143.jpg

It has unfortunately come to my attention recently that there is a proposed development that would include 8
stories located at 112 Edmund Place.

My partner and I are owners at The Carlton, # 404. Our absolute favorite part of our
home/loft is our view of the downtown skyline - example attached with joy!
Unfortunately this new building (with 8 floors) would take away our view and prohibit any
new memories we all currently share!
This was the selling point in our decision to invest in the neighborhood of Brush Park and
in an old classic building like The Carlton. We were also reassured that this historical
neighborhood would not build over 4 floors in front of our view, all which the surrounding
streets have honored up to this point.
We welcome new developments, like City Modern for example, as they are respecting the
neighbors and history by not building over the current views the neighbors have enjoyed
for years. This is NOT the case with 112 Edmund Place.
We also stand with the below concerns sent in from our board at the Carlton and
want to reiterate them all -• Yes The Carlton is also 8 stories, but it has been in place for the better part of 100
years
• The Gilbert development, City Modern, lowered the majority of its structures to five
feet and below so as not to impair the view of those homes on Edmund Place
between John R and Brush. Why should there not be the same accommodation
for those who live between John R and Woodward?
• The character of Brush Park must be maintained and setting a new standard for
building heights will impair the historic nature of Brush Park.
• The development includes two floors of commercial office space. This is a
residential neighborhood and there is no rationale to add office space to the Brush
Park ecosystem.
What else can we do to prohibit this new 8 story development?
Thank you for your time and understanding,
Lisen Helander

Jennifer –
I am writing you in advance of the May 9th meeting of the Detroit Historical Society regarding the project at 112 Edmund Place.
I live in unit 505 at The Carlton and serve as the Chair of the Board of the Carlton Homeowners Association.
The residents of The Carlton only recently were made aware of the project. The notice of the public hearing from the Planning
Commission was not sent to every owner or resident, only to the developer. Thank you by the way for making the effort to send the
notice of your hearing to everyone. Since we were made aware our owners and residents have become active in our opposition to
the current design of this project. The City Planning Commission is holding a second public hearing on May 17 th.
We have major concerns about the extensive nature of the development, and specifically about the building at 112 Edmund Place.
We understand the need for development and applaud creative people like this development team in their effort to move Detroit
forward.
However, its essential that we respect the history of neighborhoods.
We have been told by Kimani Jeffrey from the City Planning Department that density is the number one objective in Brush Park and
that seven story buildings on north/ south streets will be the new high water mark for achieving this goal.
The 112 Edmund Place Project is 83 feet tall and over 80,000 square feet of structure. Overwhelming in height and mass.
The Carlton was built in 1924 and is eight stories. Why would anyone build an 83 foot building 180 feet away from another building
of approximately the same height?

This is density vs destiny

 The developer has been very open about their plans and we are asking for a mitigation plan to limit the impact on this area of Brush
Park and to avoid setting a new standard for the height of buildings that other developers will surely use as a template.
Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Historic Commission Public Hearing - 112 Edmund & 2827 John R
Form Based Code Slides from May '17 Presentation.pdf

Dear Jennifer Ross,
I am writing to you in reference to the PH being held this Wed at 5:35pm related to a erection of new
buildings in the Brush Park Neighborhood. I live in the Carlton Lofts and want you to know that I am directly
opposed to the size of the building being proposed for 112 Edmund. Currently the developer is asking for a
variance to build up to seven stories. This proposed building will dwarf the beautifully restored "Edmund
Place" at 104 Edmund, being that it will be more than twice as tall. Additionally this proposal will block the
downtown view for many of the tenants at the Carlton Lofts.
I am not totally opposed to this project, just the size of the building proposed for 112 Edmund. As
Dan Gilbert is doing with his City Modern Project, I feel that there needs to be some moderate stepping up
and down as the sizes of the building change. Going from a three story residential (104 Edmund) to a seven
story retail/commercial (112 Edmund) is way too drastic.
Additionally, I am told that the current code for this area is to build no higher than 4-5 stories.
Relative to the "Form Based Code" initiative that the City is Currently Working on, this proposal was
presented to the Brush Park Residents last year and that presentation also showed building in this area no
higher than 4-5 stories. In the attached PDF you will see some of the slides from that Presentation made
last year by Maurice Cox that references over and over "Complimenting the existing scale & historic
character" of the neighborhood.
Please note that the Text Boxes in RED were notes added by me.
I doubt I will be able to attend this hearing in person due to work commitments, but hope you can take
into consideration my points and opinion here.
Sincerely,
Thomas J. Toft

Please see the linked article below and the quote from Maurice Cox, which says:
Planning director Maurice Cox is a champion of high-caliber architecture and design, but he also sees his
mission as connecting directly with people living in disenfranchised and distressed neighborhoods. “My
first obligation is to make the city work for those who have stuck it out for decades,” he said.
The almost 100 year old Carlton should certainly receive more respect.
Thank you.

Detroit Historical Commission,
I am one of the investors of 74, 84 and 104 Edmund and would like to express my opinion on the proposed
project immediately adjacent to us, 112 Edmund. I was under the impression that we were supposed to
receive written correspondence in advance regarding any new project in the area. As of today, we have not
received any notification.
We purchased 74, 84 and 104 Edmund from Michael VanOverbeke last fall. I would like to go on record
stating that he was very professional and helpful from start to finish with our purchase. However, when we
inquired about his plan for the adjacent parcel, he informed us that he was a historic home specialist who
has brought several dilapidated homes "back to life" in the area. Furthermore, he stated he was looking
forward to creating a mixed use building that would blend in with the historic architecture and stay true to the
area, including the property that we were looking to purchase. Our investment group feels misled and I want
to convey our disappointment with the proposed 7-story project. We would never have purchased the
property from him if we knew that a "monstrosity" was planned on the bordering property. The renderings of
112 Edmund definitely do not blend in with our adjacent property, historic architecture or any other existing
property in the area for that matter.
Further concern is that a 7-story building / project of this magnitude will completely overshadow our building
and destroy our tenants views. Also, it appears from the photos that the least desirable "back side" of the
proposed building will face our units making them difficult to lease and make future potential condo
conversion or property sale difficult, if not impossible, thereby doing irreparable damage to our property and
investment.
Feel free to e-mail or contact me at 810-516-5858.
Thank you.

"Davidoff Mark (US - Detroit)" <mdavidoff@deloitte.com>

Hello Jennifer,
My name is Tom VanderMey and I own unit 507 at the Carlton Lofts.
I've seen the plans for the City Modern development and think it will be a valuable addition to the
neighborhood, especially given the fact that it will occupy a largely vacant city block.
However this is not the case with the proposed 7 story building at 112 Edmund.
This, in my opinion, will simply overwhelm the neighborhood historic homes, and is not consistent with the
character of Brush Park.
Also, it will negatively impact many residents of the Carlton Lofts, who currently enjoy a spectacular view of
downtown Detroit.
I urge that this project not be approved, or significantly reduced in height.
Sincerely,
Tom VanderMey

Development project @ 112 Edmund in Brush Park

Hello Jennifer
I don’t think I will be able to attend the meeting on May 9th, so I was hoping to get the opportunity
to express my thoughts:
As those who have always had our hearts in Detroit, we are pioneers. Current residents of Brush Park have blazed
a trail. We have committed ourselves to the very special historic character we found in Brush Park. We have a
great appreciation for the history of our city that is like no other. When others said the Motor City was a lost
cause, we held to our hope and invested with more than our wallets.
Recently, we came to find that there is a proposed plan for the property at 112 Edmund, which is adjacent to the
historic Julienne Moore home and across from the Carlton. The current plan clearly dwarfs the Moore home by a
design that does not belong in the neighborhood. Additionally, creating office space in the middle of a residential
neighborhood other than what is needed to support the residents, sets a poor precedent. The bulk of commercial
spaces should be kept on the perimeter of the neighborhood. There is plenty of room on Woodward, especially at
a time when so many existing buildings stand vacant and run down.
Condominium owners at the Carlton were told that the Form Based Code for the neighborhood would be based on
the existing homes. Form Based Code in Brush Park should not be based on the Carlton, which should stand
alone as our “tower.” The Carlton was renovated with large windows to showcase our unique skyline, with three
stadiums within walking and viewing distance to the tower. Carlton owners were sold on this notion.
Holding on to our neighborhood's character will set us apart from all the “big” cities, those cities that we will
never be. People who have come here from outside of Detroit, come here especially because Detroit is not like
any other city. They have discovered a soul of a people who are diverse, determined, and creative and who are
committed to finding a way to rebuild together.
And although City Modern is a beautiful modern city design, we don’t need more of City Modern within Brush
Park. It would be just as easy to fill the vacant lots with contemporary brick buildings that blend in with the
historic character of the neighborhood. It was successfully done with the design of the Kelemen project on Eliot
street, as well as the reconstruction of the Devon building on Watson. Let’s put aesthetics before greed.
With so much vacant land in other places in this city, density should not be our destiny in Brush Park.
Thank you for your time,
Margie Dunn
