RESOLUTION REQUESTING THAT THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATURE REINSTATE
FUNDING FOR THE GOODWILL FLIP THE SCRIPT PROGRAM

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens and residents through Charter-mandated
legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, In April 1921, Reverend John Martin founded Goodwill Industries of Greater
Detroit. In 1970, Goodwill Industries of Greater Detroit merged with the League
for the Handicapped. Together these two organizations could provide more services
and better serve the community; and

WHEREAS, Today, Goodwill?s team provides many quality services. Currently, they support
more than 900 local businesses each year with a reliable workforce. Goodwill
trainees receive classroom and vocational instruction. They also receive workplace
behavior coaching, ?nancial literacy, placement assistance and career support. The
end result is skilled, mature and con?dent workers; and

WHEREAS, Since 2003, the Goodwill Flip the Script Program has provided critical services,
which include education, job training and mentoring, to the residents of the city of
Detroit and Wayne County; and

WHEREAS, Many of the individuals served by the Goodwill Flip the Script Program include
returning citizens and those referred by the Michigan Department of Corrections.
Returning Citizens are one of our most important at-risk populations and it is
imperative that they are offered assistance in reintegrating into society; and

WHEREAS, Flip the Script also offers ?nancial literacy training to all citizens, via its Center for
Working Families. Financial literacy is paramount to building and sustaining
successful families. Therefore, the knowledge offered through this program is
bene?cial to the entire state of Michigan; and

WHEREAS, Moreover, programs that support these at-risk populations must be funded and
highly prioritized in our public policy. In the 2019-20 FY budget, the Michigan
State House has proposed to cut the $1.5 million in funding from the Goodwill Flip
the Script Program. Cutting aid to this program would in?ict enormous harm to the
fabric of our communities; NOW THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, The Council recommends that the State Legislature restore in full the $1.5 million
in State funding to the Goodwill Flip the Script Program; BE IT FURTHER

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be forwarded Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the
Detroit delegation in the State House, and the City of Detroit?s Lansing Lobbyist.

RE: Resolution commemorating 100 years of Women?s Right to Vote

On June 20, 2019, the Honorable Council President Pro Tempore Mary Shef?eld

requested the Legislative Policy Division to draft a resolution commemorating the 100th
anniversary of Women?s Right to Vote.

The draft resolution is attached for your review.

BY COUNCIL PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE MARY SHEFFIELD
RESOLUTION COMMEMORATING 100 YEARS OF RIGHT TO VOTE

WHEREAS, The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative functions; and

WHEREAS, Voting and access to the ballot are fundamental to a thriving, well-functioning
democracy; and

WHEREAS, In 1918 Michigan?s voters approved a state constitutional amendment by nearly 55
percent of the vote, extending suffrage to Michigan women, thereby granting them the right to
vote in statewide political elections. The National Suffrage Amendment, the 19th Amendment to
the US. Constitution, was passed by Congress on June 5, 1919. Michigan was the second state to
ratify the amendment on June 10, 1919, under Gov. Albert Sleeper; and

WHEREAS, June 10, 2019 marks the 100th year anniversary of women gaining the right to
vote. The journey for suffrage had reached every corner of our nation and was a signi?cant
milestone in our nation?s history. While all adult citizens have the right to vote, this franchise is
bestowed upon our democratic government the obligation to ensure that all aspects of the voting
process are fair, secure, and accurate; and

WHEREAS, The 100th anniversary should not welcome the broad narrative for ?women in
America.? Rather, it should bridge the start of many discussions on the historic and spiritual
importance of multicultural American suffragists; and

WHEREAS, In many ways the women seated on our City Council re?ects the spirit of
momentum and purpose that sprung directly from this 100 year old accomplishment; and NOW
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council commemorates the 100th anniversary of Women?s
Right to Vote.
