The original request for services went out for competitive bid. Motorola, Inc. was the lowest
bidder meeting all of the Cook County Sheriff's Department's qualifications. Motorola, Inc. is
the owner of the infrastructure that the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) is
seeking to purchase. The equipment provided by Motorola, Inc. is interoperable with Cook
County's existing radio system, which is currently managed by the Cook County Sheriff's
Office. The JTDC has requested capital equipment funding to purchase 187 Motorola twoway radios, which was granted at the May 18 19, 2009 Board Meeting. These radios are
critical to ensuring the safety and security of the JTDC residents and staff members.
Additionally, the JTDC has been in conversations with the Sheriff's Department regarding this
purchase. The Sheriff's Department agrees that utilizing the pricing structure under the
current contract would be the most economically feasible solution for the JTDC. By
purchasing the equipment via the existing contract, the JTDC will realize a significant costsavings while utilizing a communicative system that is serving the needs of various agencies

of hardware and equipment made under the current contract.
