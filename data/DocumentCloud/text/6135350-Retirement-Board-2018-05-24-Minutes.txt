The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

Ms. Tuczak reminded the Trustees that an Audit and Actuarial committee meeting is
scheduled for June 18, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Materials for the meeting will be forthcoming.

•

The next issue was a request from retired member, Harry Bingham. Recently, the Board
adopted a policy to allow retired members that have not selected healthcare coverage
provided by Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield and United American Life Insurance, to request a
monthly pension deduction for an alternative carrier negotiated directly by the member.
Documentation to request such deduction has been sent to retirees specifically requesting this
accommodation.
Mr. Bingham completed the documentation to establish a pension deduction for his selected
healthcare provider. However, he has requested that he also be allowed to establish a
separate and distinct deduction for healthcare insurance for his spouse, who utilizes a
different provider. Mr. Bingham indicated that approval of this second and separate
deduction would allow him an opportunity to further utilize the Public Safety Officer
healthcare deduction on his Federal tax filing.
Discussion was held concerning staff resources to process additional deduction requests for
spouses, along with other coverage-types such as prescription drugs or long-term care. The
provisions of the Pension statutes were also reviewed. The Board determined that the policy
is to be amended to allow for an additional deduction for spousal healthcare coverage.
Should the volume of such requests grow exponentially, the Executive Director is to report
back to the Board for additional resources.

•

The next item was for informational purposes; a trustee at the Firemen’s Annuity and Benefit
Fund of Chicago is soliciting, via written request, demographic information with respect to
retired staff of the Fund, along with the Laborers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and
the Municipal Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, in an effort to obtain quotes
for retiree healthcare for these retired staff as one pooled group.
