RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE FY2010 HCV ADMINISTRATIVE PLAN FOR
HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER TENANT BASED AND PROJECT BASED

To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) approve the FY2010
Administrative Plan for the Housing Choice Voucher Tenant Based and Project Based Voucher
Programs and authorize its submission to HUD.
FUNDING
N/A
EXPLANATION
Federal regulation 24 CFR 982.54 requires Public Housing Authorities (PHA) to maintain and
update the Administrative Plan for the Housing Choice Voucher Tenant Based and Project Based
Voucher Programs that outline the rules and policies necessary to administer the voucher
programs. The Administrative Plan clarifies the Chicago Housing Authority’s (CHA) Housing
Choice Voucher Tenant Based Program (HCVP) and Project Based Voucher Programs (PBV)
written policies in accordance with Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
regulations, in regards to matters some of which are covered under HUD regulations but left to
local PHA discretion; in addition, the Administrative Plan is used by the programs to ensure
proper administration of the voucher programs in accordance with the policies set forth in 24
CFR 982.54 and by this Board of Commissioners (“Board”).
The current HCV Administrative Plan received Board approval on December 15, 2008. The
purpose for this request is to revise the following activities related to HCV/PBV Program
administration: requests for reasonable accommodations, verification of disability, social security
number documentation, organization/opening/closing of the waitlist, special admissions, targeted
funding, local preferences, income verification, assets, medical expense deduction, special
inspections and re-inspections, moving process, portability, homeownership re-examinations,
payment standards, informal review/hearings, repayment agreements, and project based voucher
program.
CHA completed two public consultation processes, which combined public participants and
vouchers holders alike to voice their opinion and make comments on the proposed language
revisions to the HCV Administration Plan. The first public consultation process began on March
5, 2010 and concluded on April 3, 2010; during which time on March 22, 2010 a public
comment hearing was held. Thereafter, and prior to taking the initial proposed revisions to
CHA’s Board, additional changes to the Plan were proposed. CHA placed the second iteration
of revisions out for comment June 3-July 23, 2010; and a Public Hearing specifically for the
second iteration of revisions was held June 21, 2010. All responses from CHA have been

 drafted and submitted to Legal for review, then to RRC for posting. Upon approval of the Board
of Commissioners, the Administrative Plan will be implemented September 1, 2010.
Based on foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Board of Commissions to approve the FY2010
Administrative Plan for the Housing Choice Voucher Tenant Based and Project Based Voucher
Programs and authorize its submission to HUD, in substantially the form presented to the Board
and the Chief Executive Officer or his designee is authorized to approve final changes including
but not limited to, changes based on HUD requirements, or resulting from any applicable notice
and comment process. Such approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s
approval of any and all such changes.
