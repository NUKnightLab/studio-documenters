14· ·Superintendent recommended that the allegations

·2· · · · · · · · ·It will no doubt lead to more

·7· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Good evening.· I'm here
·8· ·again to talk about a troubled business we have
·9· ·in our community.· I've talked about it at this
10· ·meeting previously.· I've been told for the
11· ·past six months the police are doing a major
12· ·investigation.· I was told repeatedly, Trust
13· ·us.· We're doing something big.· This is going
14· ·to be big, Mr. Perryman.· I heard that

19· ·big bust.· They're shutting down this business.
20· ·I said, What's the next steps?· Because I know
21· ·they're going to reopen that business again.
22· ·Glen Brooks called me, Don't worry about it,
23· ·Mr. Perryman.· That building is going to be
24· ·closed a long, long time.· Two weeks later, I

·2· ·were open.· And during the two weeks they were
·3· ·closed, they were doing business out of the
·4· ·back of the store.
·5· · · · · · · · ·So it's very frustrating that I
·6· ·have to come here for something so basic to get
·7· ·some help.
·8· · · · · · · · ·So my question is for Chief

10· ·to use their authority to shut down this
11· ·troubled business.· Can you help us with this?
12· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· I know that some arrests

16· · · ·CHIEF WALLER:· Right.· We can speak after
17· ·the meeting about it.
18· · · ·MR. PERRYMAN:· Also, I would like a new
19· ·liaison to your office, because Glen Brooks is
20· ·not being responsive.· I've asked him for
21· ·information about the history of all
22· ·infractions, building and police, otherwise, he
23· ·will not give it to me.· I've asked it over two
24· ·months ago.· He's not responsive.· He is giving

10· ·he can do more good in God's children.· When he
11· ·became ill as an old man, he prayed that God

13· ·longer so he couldn't do any more harm in God's

15· · · · · · · · ·So there's many errata.· But the
16· ·big thing is that we're not trying to control
17· ·the state of mind of anyone.· We have to
18· ·control the presentation of the state of mind
19· ·of people like in the position of
20· ·Superintendent Johnson by the button pushers
21· ·and string pullers who are above the clouds.
22· ·It's their presentation and state of mind.

·3· · · · · · · · ·But I also bring a distinction.
·4· ·When I used the term world jewelry, I meant
·5· ·world Jewish supremacism.· Because no one can
·6· ·control the religion of his parents.· And Acts
·7· ·10:34, God respects the person, but he accepts
·8· ·all who fear him and do what's right.· And so
·9· ·we are in no way antipathetic to anyone who is
10· ·born into any type of family, because no one
11· ·can control that.· It's only on people's
12· ·activity where the activity comes to be seen as
13· ·being what it is, enormously destructive, and
14· ·necessary to identify the causes.· And that's a
15· ·very important point.
16· · · · · · · · ·The other thing is Superintendent
17· ·Johnson referenced that they will -- the
18· ·obligation is to try to save the soul.· That
19· ·has nothing to do with this.· He has to bear
20· ·the burden of the office.· And if he can't,
21· ·then we have to use the criminal law to get

·6· · · ·PRESIDENT FOREMAN:· That's a great
·7· ·question.· Part of what we've been doing now is
·8· ·we take the comments that are available on the
·9· ·website -- what the public doesn't get a chance
10· ·to see, there's a question, it goes to Chief
11· ·Roberts or to the Superintendent's office.· We
12· ·follow up to ensure what was done about issue
13· ·1, 2, 3 that was spoken about last month.· It's
14· ·on the website, and we're able to go back and
15· ·forth.· We're going to report on it -- here's a
16· ·great example.· Ms. Mitchell, she left.· So she
17· ·was speaking with COPA.· She's spoken with our
18· ·office.· We've been going back and forth with
19· ·her.· She doesn't have resolution, but we've
20· ·been able to make progress.· This is the reason
21· ·why we think this forum is so important,

11· · · ·MR. BIELECKI:· Good evening, members of the
12· ·Board.· Lee Bielecki, and I'm a retired Chicago

14· ·in the City of Chicago for 27 years.· I retired

·1· ·helpful.· And Officer Sebastian and Mondragon
·2· ·were also the two best officers on the midnight
·3· ·shift.· They showed compassion, dedication to
·4· ·duty and were there for fellow officers as well
·5· ·as never shying away from tough duty.· Officer
·6· ·Viramontes also displayed the same attributes.
·7· · · · · · · · ·This case has changed and
·8· ·affected so many.· Policing in Chicago has been
·9· ·altered because of it.· Policies were changed.
10· ·Community police relations are not at an
11· ·all-time high.· Officers are routinely called
12· ·out on the street because of it.
13· · · · · · · · ·I'm also sad for Laquan McDonald
14· ·as well.· A young man who never had a chance
15· ·because of his childhood.· Born to a mother who
16· ·was 15, raised by a great grandmother, abused
17· ·and a ward of the state several times.
18· · · · · · · · ·Society has to take
19· ·responsibility for that as well because there
20· ·are other Laquans out there.· Hopefully their
21· ·futures will be addressed by restoring programs
22· ·in our schools, by addressing the mental health
23· ·need in the communities, supporting parenting
