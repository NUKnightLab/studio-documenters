County to collect a mandatory fee of $5.00 by a defendant on a judgment of guilty or grant of supervision
under Section 5-9-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections; and

10

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

WHEREAS, the fee must be deposited by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County into an account
specifically for the operation and administration of a teen court, peer court, peer jury, youth court, or
other youth diversion program, monthly, less five percent, which is to be retained as fee income to the
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, a specific special revenue fund must be created so that the fees may be collected and then
disbursed for its stated purposes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
18, Article II, Sec. 18-40 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 18-40.

Peer Court Special Revenue Fund.

Beginning on or before December l , 2006, the Comptroller shall create a special revenue fund to be
entitled, " The Peer Court Special Revenue Fund." The Circuit Court Clerk of Cook County shall deposit
the fees generated from Chapter 18, Section 37, into such Fund which shall only be disbursed to

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
MIKE QUIGLEY, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
TAX INCREMENT FINANCE DISTRICT APPROVAL ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois first authorized the creation of tax increment finance (TJF) districts in
1977, to encourage development in blighted areas by using the prospect of future growth to issue bonds in
order to jumpstart infrastructure and site improvements; and
WHEREAS, for the initial 23-year lifetime of a TIF district, Cook County and other taxing bodies
receive tax revenue only from the assessed value present in the district at its creation, known as the
baseline equalized assessed value, an amount which is not adjusted for inflation; and
WHEREAS, the establishment of a TIF district in a municipality in Cook County requires the approval
of a joint review board, on which the County holds only one seat, meaning that the County alone cannot
stop the creation of a TIF district to which it is opposed; and

11

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

WHEREAS, certain other units of government which collect property taxes from the area contained
within a proposed TIF district, such as the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, are not members of
the joint review board and are therefore excluded from the decision-making process; and
WHEREAS, once a TIF district is established, the municipality in which the TIF district is located has
total control over the funds generated by the TIF district, even though said funds are generated by
diverting tax revenues that otherwise would have gone to all units of government present in the TIF
district; and
WHEREAS, this diversion of property tax revenue prevents units of government present in the TIF
district from maintaining the same tax rate and using that additional revenue for services or from lowering
tax rates while achieving the same levy; and
WHEREAS, the use of TIF districts has grown exponentially in Cook County, increasing from seven in
1984 to 144 in 1994 and to 363 in 2004; and
WHEREAS, TIF districts have a significant fiscal impact on Cook County, diverting over $49 million in
tax revenue from Cook County in 2004 that otherwise would have been available for county services or
would have allowed for a six percent cut in the property tax rate while achieving the same levy.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
14, Article I, Sec. 14- l is hereby enacted as follows:

Sec. 14-1. Approval of Proposed Tax Increment Finance (TIF) Districts.
(a) Upon receipt of any study or proposal pertaining to the creation, renewal, or extension of any
TIF district, Cook County's joint review board representative shall transmit copies of said
study or proposal to the Board for referral to the Finance Committee.
(b) The Board shall infom1 the joint review board representati ve of its position on each TIF
proposal by means of a resolution. The joint review board representative shall vote as
instructed by the Board.
(c) If the Board of Commissioners does not approve a resolution directing how the joint review
board representative shall vote on any TIF proposal prior to the meeting of the joint review
board at which such TIF proposal will be considered, the representative shall abstain from
voting.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved that the Proposed Ordinance be
referred to the Committee on Finance. (Comm. No. 282389). The motion carried unanimously.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN AMENDMENT TO SECTION 30-387 OPEN BURNING
WHEREAS, the American Lung Association assigned Cook County a failing grade for air quality in its
State of the Air 2006 report, citing dangerously high levels of both particle and ozone pollution; and
WHEREAS, approximately one million of Cook County's 5.3 million residents have been diagnosed
with asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, or other lung diseases
exacerbated by air pollution; and
WHEREAS, the open burning of domicile waste, also known as household trash, can produce
carcinogenic compounds and carbon monoxide, which, at even low levels of exposure, can cause a variety
of neurological symptoms, including headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting; and
WHEREAS, the open burning of landscape waste also produces air pollution and smoke that can make
breathing difficult for people with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, allergies, and other conditions;
and
WHEREAS, residents of unincorporated Cook County are required to contract for regular trash
collection, rendering unnecessary the practice of burning domicile waste; and
WHEREAS, all Cook County municipalities but one have already banned the open burning of leaves;
and
WHEREAS, there are alternatives to the burning of landscape waste, most notably mulching and
composting.

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION - CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
JAMES L. ELDRIDGE, JR., Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Peoples Energy Services
Corporation (PES), a subsidiary of Peoples Energy Corporation, for the purchase and delivery of
electricity to the County's facilities.
Because deregulation of electricity begins January I, 2007, all facilities over 3 MW (megawatts) must
receive power from an alternate retail electric supplier. The County also has the option of procuring
electricity through an alternate supplier for accounts less than 3 MW or directly from ComEd, whichever
is most cost effective.
To participate in the deregulated electric power market, PES will act as the exclusive agent for all matters
related to the procurement and delivery of electric power and execute all documents as may be necessary
to carry out and comply with the provi sions of the ICC' s conditions of service for public utilities serving
Cook County for customer owned electricity.

18

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) recently ruled that ComEd must continue to provide the
Government Consolidated Billing (GCB) rate to all members of the Local Government Electric Power
Alliance (Alliance), of which the County is a member. The GCB rate is currently used for all the
County's major facilities and is a considerably lower price than the spot market, saving the County
millions of dollars. ComEd is currently challenging this ruling and has received approval for a rehearing
with the ICC. The State's Attorney is closely monitoring the case. As Jong as the GCB rate exists, PES
would not be used to supply power to the County's major facilities.
Electricity will still need to be procured for the smaller accounts. The ComEd auction rate was recently
made public and is approximately I0%-50% higher than the current market price depending on the size of
the account. The County could have savings in excess of $100,000 annually if power is provided by an
alternate supplier for accounts not on the GCB rate.
Request for proposals were issued to the fourteen Illinois certified retail electric suppliers resulting in the
submission of six responses. Evaluation of the proposals was based upon overall price and margin cost,
financial stability and credit rating, experience and knowledge, ability to provide a consolidated bill, and
MBE/WBE participation.
Peoples Energy Services Corporation has been selected as the lowest cost qualified proposal based on the
Request for Proposals. PES proposes an administrative fee of $0.00045 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of
electric power above the index cost. Transmission and distribution costs would be passed through PES.
The County currently uses an average of 290,000,000 kWh's per year, of which only 12,000,000 kWh's,
or 4% are for faci lities not receiving Com Ed's GCB rate.
With approval of the service agreement herein, respectfully request that the Chief Administrative Officer,
or his designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, all documents necessary to
implement and administer the service agreement.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $0 to $391,500.00 (not to exceed $130,500.00 per year). All costs will be
charged against the annual appropriation for the utility electricity funds for each using department. (499410, 500-410, 501-410, 891-410, 893-410, 894-410, 897-410 and 898-410 Accounts). Contract period:
January 1, 200.7 through December 31 , 2009.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and future year funds.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the County Purchasing
Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried.
Commissioner Suffredin voted "no".

meeting of the CCWIB, the board approved the acceptance of the funds as well as the distribution of grant
funds to various agencies for employment and training services.
Additionally, requesting authorization to subcontract a portion of these grant funds to various agencies.
These funds will be used to provide employment and training services to eligible residents of South and
West Suburban Cook County. These funds have been authorized for job placement and training services
by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the Cook County Workforce
Investment Board. Award levels are subject to change contingent upon final fund availability, PY ' 06

2007. The balance of funds shall be used for POET Administration, One-Stop and Affiliate operating
costs.
This funding period will end June 30, 2008.

Professional Services and Managerial Services
Major Capital Equipment Request

$350,000.00
$350,000.00

On April 8, 2004, the Board of Commissioners authorized entering into a contract with NxLight
Government Solutions, Inc. (Agenda Item #24), to deliver an integrated justice solution to the Clerk's
Office that meets the requirements of the Data Exchange Pilot Project. This project is part of the work
necessary to support the various processes and data exchange of critical criminal information throughout
the Cook County Justice Enterprise.
At the time of contract award, the funding for the $350,000.00 contract was to be provided by a grant
from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). However, ICJIA has now indicated that
funds will not be approved. This contract is critical to improving the exchange of criminal information
among Coun ty agencies and the fulfillment of the overall plans envisioned by the Cook County Integrated
Justice Information Steering Committee that I chair.
The one-time source of funding for this project will be long-term capital funds appropriated within the
Clerk of the Circuit, Court Automation program. The funding source for the ongoing maintenance for
this added Criminal Systems functionality in subsequent years will be the 528-Court Automation Fund, a
Special Purpose Fund administered within the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court.

sponsored by Roberto Maldonado, County Commissioner.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County Security Police Force (" Police
Force") was established in the nineteen-seventies through Illinois State Statute enabling
legislation 55 ILCS 5/5-37011 which authorized the Cook County Board of Commissioners
to appoint security police officers to act as " conservators of the peace" ; and
WHEREAS, the purpose of establishing this Police Force was to protect the public peace by
vesting Police Force Officers with powers "to carry weapons within or upon hospital facilities
or premises"; and
WHEREAS, furthennore, the state law seeks to prevent the hiring of a Police Force Officer
who may be predisposed to abuse of power by allowing the Board to " establish reasonable
eligibility requirements for appointment.. .relating to residence, health, habits and moral
character" and by excluding anyone who is a " habitual drunkard, gambler or a person
convicted of a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude"; and
WHEREAS, numerous allegations from patients, visitors, and employees against the Police
Force recently accuse certain Police Force Officers of police brutality, allegedly committing
acts of physical and emotional abuse of power and even false arrests, and it has also been
revealed that other officers have criminal arrests in their past, all clear violations of the plain
language and spirit of the enabling legislation; and
WHEREAS, the most recent allegation occurred on September 11 of 2006, when a Police
Force Officer allegedly used excessive force on an elderly man after asking about his
ethnicity and immigration status, and subsequently charged the elderly man with battery and
resisting arrest. FBI agents are now conducting an investigation into whether there was a
potential violation of federal civil rights laws or a "color of law violation" meaning a sworn
law enforcement officer overstepped his authorized powers; and
WHEREAS, although the Police Force has the " power to make arrests or cause to be
arrested, with or without process, any person who breaks the peace, or may be found
violating any State statutes or city or county ordinances within or upon such facilities or
premises," an alleged victim of Police Force abuse must file a formal complaint internally
either through the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County Patient Relations Department
or through the Cook County Inspector General ' s Office which, according to the alleged
victims, have failed to initiate any investigation; and
WHEREAS, the Police Force is budgeted in 2006 for a total of 77 employees (71 sworn and
6 civilian) at a cost of nearly $3 million; and
WHEREAS, the Police Force's function established over thirty years ago allegedly has not
fulfilled its stated purpose as "conservators of peace" and has instead, led to an atmosphere of
hostility, distrust, and brutality that is a clear detriment to the mission of John H. Stroger, Jr.
Hospital of Cook County, that of saving the lives and souls of people who suffer from
physical and emotional injury.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a hearing will---9e was held in the baw
ERfereemeRt aRd CorreetioRs Committee aRd the Stroger aRd Cermak Hospitals
S1:1beommittee Finance Committee to discuss the most efficient and cost effective method of

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the recommendation of the State's Attorney to
undertake an independent, systemic review of the perfonnance of the Police Force include:
I) an analysis of the current Police Force management structure; 2) a cost-benefit analysis
that demonstrates economic effect of utilizing private security under contract rather than
existing employees; and 3) critical review of the current training and certification process for
all security officers be done by a reviewer appointed by the President of the Cook County
Board.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 10/04/06.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved approval of the proposed
resolution (Communication Number 282089), for discussion purposes.
Chairman Daley stated that an opinion from the State's Attorney's Office was issued at his request.
Chairman Daley has shared this opinion with the members of the Finance Committee. Chairman Daley
further stated that it should be the policy of the Board that when an opinion is requested by a
commissioner, that opinion should be presented to all of the commissioners.
Patrick T. Driscoll , Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated that any
commissioner who requests an opinion can state in the body of the request letter that all commissioners
should receive a copy of the opinion. Mr. Driscoll further stated that it is also the right of the
commissioner to distribute any opinion he or she receives to other commissioners.
Commissioner Maldonado stated, regarding the Stroger Hospital of Cook County Police Department that
only two people can drop charges against any civilian taken into custody by the Stroger Hospital Police
Department: the police officer who leveled the charges, and the State's Attorney's Office once the case
proceeds to court. The only way a person who has been arrested can file a complaint against a security
police officer is through the Office of Patient Services Coordinator. This office serves as a clearinghouse
for all types of complaints relating to hospital personnel. Commissioner Maldonado related how one
victim filed charges with the Office of Patient Services Coordinator, and never once during the
investigation was she contacted for input.
Mr. Driscoll stated that the Police union' s collective bargaining rights need to be reviewed.
Commissioner Collins inquired how many years remain under the union contract with the Stroger
Hospital Police Department.
Mr. Driscoll replied that the contract is in negotiations to be extended.

68

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Mark Kilgallon, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources, stated that the contract is almost complete for the
Stroger Hospital Police Department. He further stated that, under the contract, the Board has the
authority to disband the Stroger Hospital Police Department.
Commissioner Collins stated that she is not convinced that abuse would stop as a result of privatizing the
Stroger Hospital Police Department.
Mr. Driscoll stated that before final action is taken to disband the Stroger Hospital Police Department,
notice must be given to the union. Then the Board would need to ascertain what the union ' s position
would be if the Board were to move forward with disbandment. At this moment, however, it would be
premature to dissolve the Stroger Hospital Police Department.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she doesn't believe that privatizing the Stroger Hospital Police
Department would solve the problem. However, the following measures would help: make sure the
applicants do not have criminal records, screen all applicants by a psychiatrist, provide strict training, and
implement harsh repercussions for abuse.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to amend the eighth
paragraph by adding the word "allegedly", as follows: WHEREAS, the Police Force's function
established over thirty years ago allegedly has not fulfilled its stated purpose as "conservators of
peace" and has instead, led to an atmosphere of hostility, distrust, and brutality that is a clear
detriment to the mission of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, that of saving the lives
and souls of people who suffer from physical and emotional injury. The motion to amend carried.
Commissioners Butler and Peraica voted no.
Commissioner Sims stated that there is a strong need for trained, anned protection at Stroger Hospital of
Cook County.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that a staff review of the Stroger Hospital Police Department should be
undertaken, including a review of how it is administered. Commissioner Silvestri inquired as to the
accuracy of the committees, namely Law Enforcement and Corrections and Stroger and Cennak Hospitals
Subcommittee, referenced in the ninth paragraph.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to amend the ninth
paragraph by deleting the words "Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee and the Stroger
and Cermak Hospitals Subcommittee" and replacing with "Finance Committee", as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a hearing will be held in the Law Enfcneement anEI
Coneetions Committee and the Stroger anEI Cermak Hospitals Subeommittee Finance Committee
to discuss the most efficient and cost effective method of replacing the Hospital Police Force with an
alternative security unit; and. The motion to amend carried.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the Board needs to investigate the management structure of the Stroger
Hospital Police Department. The Stroger Hospital Police Department should report to the County Board,
the President's Office, or the Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee. The Stroger Hospital Police
Department should be subject to ongoing criminal background checks.
Commissioner Gonnan stated her concern that from the recent cases that have come to light, it appears
that there is a systemic problem within the Stroger Hospital Police Department.
Commissioner Claypool stated that he believes these abuses are one facet of a larger problem, namely the
managerial incompetence of the Bureau of Health Services.

69

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Commissioner Suffredin offered the following clarification that the Stroger Hospital Police Department is
not trained by the Cook County Sheriffs Office, as was previously stated in error.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to amend the proposed
resolution (Communication Number 282089) by amending the last two paragraphs of the
resolution, as follows:
"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a hearing will be held in the baw
Enforeeffient ancl Gorreetions Goffifflittee ancl the Stroger ancl Ceffilak Hosf)itals
St1beoffiffiittee Finance Committee to discuss the most efficient and cost effective method

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the recommendation of the State's Attorney to
undertake an independent, systemic review of the performance of the Police Force
include: 1) An analysis of the current Police Force management structure; 2) A
cost-benefit analysis that demonstrates economic effect of utilizing private security
under contract rather than existing employees; and 3) Critical review of the current
training and certification process for all security officers be done by a reviewer
appointed by the President of the Cook County Board."
The motion to amend carried. Commissioners Butler and Peraica voted no.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to who conducts investigations of the Stroger Hospital Police
Department.
Johnny C. Brown, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County, replied that there are
several levels of investigation that take place. The Stroger Hospital Police Department itself has an
investigator, similar to an internal affairs operation. We investigate reports from the administrator
responsible for a particular department. Cases can also be investigated by the Office of the Inspector
General of Cook County.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Mr. Brown provide to the Committee infonnation regarding
how often the Office of the Inspector General of Cook County is brought in for investigations.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to how long an investigation of a police officer takes.
Mr. Brown replied that the length of the investigation depends on the severity of the accusations.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Dr. Bradley Langer, Acting Medical Director, Stroger Hospital of Cook
County, to comment on the frequency of complaints against the Stroger Hospital Police Department. Dr.
Langer replied that the complaints are sporadic. They are not frequent, but a number of complaints have
been raised over the years.

75

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Commissioner Suffredin replied that the funds will be new money available to the County Board to fund
the Clerk of the Circuit Court's budget. The $5 fee should generate approximately $2 million per year.
The General Assembly provided the authority to levy this fee. Similar fees have been implemented to
fund the budgets of both the mental health courts and the teen courts.
Commissioners Butler and Collins voiced concern regarding the practice of earmarking funds for
particular departments at the expense of the others.
Commissioner Suffredin emphasized that this is not a contingency fund for the Clerk of the Circuit Court
but, rather, these funds would be subject to the County Board's appropriations and would be utili zed in
the budget.
Commissioner Hansen voiced concern that this fee might be unconstitutional.
Commissioner Suffredin clarified that there have been cases where a fee was unconstitutional, but in
those cases the use of the fee was not in direct relation to the court system.
Commissioner Peraica questioned the fa irness of this tax, given the existing fines.

Thursday, October 12, 2006, at the hour of 10:05 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,

281385

OFFICE OF THE STATE' S ATTORNEY, by Adrienne D. Mebane, Chief of Staff,
transmitting a Communication, dated August 15, 2006:
requesting pennission to establish a budget for the State' s Attorney's Bad Check Diversion
Program in the amount of $68,080.00. Pursuant to Public Act 93-0394, the State's Attorney
is authorized to divert from prosecution, on condition of making full restitution and
completing an educational program, persons charged with deceptive practices for writing bad
checks. This program is funded by an administrative fee collected from the offenders, and
will be renewed annually subject to fees collected.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/07/06.

80

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

At Commissioner Peraica's request, Kelly Cassidy, Director of Programs and Development, State's
Attorney' s Office, offered the following explanation of the Bad Check Diversion Program. This program
is an initiative of the Illinois General Assembly and is being implemented by jurisdictions throughout the
State. It was brought to the Assembly by retail merchants who were finding statewide that State's
Attorney's Offices did not have adequate resources to address chronic bad check writers. This program
was created in 1993; Cook County is not the first jurisdiction to implement the program. It is selffinancing and would not cost the County anything; it might generate some revenue. The funds are used
strictly to support the program. It is similar to drug school, in that people who write bad checks make
restitution and go through a program wherein they learn financial skills and obtain resources to help them
stop writing bad checks.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this program is for first-time offenders.
Ms. Cassidy replied that yes, this program is primarily for first-time offenders and not for chronic
offenders.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this program would be run through a vendor.
Ms. Cassidy replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the amount of the fee being collected.
Ms. Cassidy did not have this figure ready.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether $68,000 would come from existing budget funds.
Ms. Cassidy replied in the negative, and clarified that this money would be incoming revenue from the
vendor for the County's portion of the administrative portion of the fees collected from the vendor. This
money would also cover the cost of prosecution of people who fail out of the program.
Commissioner Collins stated that she believes that the state is passing off its responsibility for bad check
writers onto the County. She stated that this tax falls disproportionately on the poor.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether this program is part of the State's Attorney's Office.
Ms. Cassidy replied in the affirmative. She stated that this program saves money because it avoids the
cost of prosecution.
Commissioner Murphy inquired whether the fee can be waived for the indigent while still allowing them
into the program.
Ms. Cassidy stated that she would look into this matter and get back to the Commissioners.
Commissioner Butler inquired how the estimated revenue amount of $68,000 was detennined.
Ms. Cassidy replied that the State's Attorney' s Office considered the interest level of offenders in Cook
County. The office also examined revenue generated by other jurisdictions. There has been substantial
interest, and the revenue could be much higher.
Commissioner Butler inquired where any additional revenue (above the $68,000) is being budgeted. Ms.
Cassidy replied that additional revenue would remain in this fund. This fund would, however, be a lineitem within the State's Attorney's Office' s budget under the authority of the County Board. It would not
be a special fund. It could offset other funds in the State's Attorney' s Office's budget.

81

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Commissioner Butler inquired as to who would be paying the vendor.
Ms. Cassidy replied that the offenders would pay the vendor directly.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that this is new income and the County Board has appropriation authority
over these funds.

CALLING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A FEDERAL MONITOR TO OVERSEE
COOK COUNTY HIRING PRACTICES (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by Anthony J. Peraica, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A FEDERAL MONITOR
TO OVERSEE COOK COUNTY HIRING PRACTICES
WHEREAS, the Shakman consent decree was approved by the United States District Court
in 1994; and
WHEREAS, this federal court order forbids the City of Chicago, the County of Cook, and
other local governments from hiring or firing individuals for non-exempt positions based on
political considerations; and
WHEREAS, in recent months it has become abundantly clear that the County of Cook has
failed to comply with the Shakman consent decree; and
WHEREAS, during a supposed "hiring freeze", the County of Cook hired 1300 new
employees during a six-month period; and
WHEREAS, there have been revelations of politically connected persons receiving high
paying County jobs and having test scores altered so they can receive these jobs; and
WHEREAS, the mission of Cook County Government should be honest and efficient
provision of service to the public.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners
of Cook County, Illinois do hereby call for the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee
the hiring of Cook County employees, in order to provide more transparent government and
ensure compliance with the Shakman consent decree; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners do hereby
urge the Cook County State's Attorney' s Office not to oppose the appointment and retention
of a federal monitor to oversee county hiring practices.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/07/06.
Commissioner Peraica stated that by court order, the Shakman case has been continued for status until
November 16, 2006. A meeting is scheduled for October 16, between the State' s Attorney's Office and
Mr. Shakman and his plaintiffs' attorneys, on the motion to hold the County in contempt of court, and
also on the County's motion to vacate the 1994 Decree. Meaningful negotiations are currently taking
place.

A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO SECTION 10-18 OF THE CONTRACT AND
PURCHASING ORDINANCE OF COOK COUNTY (PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AMENDMENT). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance Amendment sponsored by Earlean
Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE
CONTRACTING AND PURCHASING ORDINANCE
OF COOK COUNTY
Section 10-18.
The purchase of and contracts for supplies, material, equipment, and contractual services and
all sales of personal property, which has become obsolete or unusable shall be based on
competitive bids. Upon seeking permission to advertise for bids the Purchasing Agent must
submit all bid specifications, in their entirety, to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
for their review. If the amount involved is estimated to exceed $25,000.00, sealed bids shall
be solicited by public notice inserted at least once in a newspaper of county-wide circulation
and at least five calendar days before the final date of submitting bids. Such notices shall
include a general description of the commodities or contractual services to be purchased or
personal property to be sold and shall state when all blanks and specifications may be
obtained and the time and place for the opening bids. The County Purchasing Agent may
also solicit sealed bids by sending requests by mail to prospective suppliers and by posting
notices on a public bulletin board in his office. Purchases, excluding professional services,
having a cost of $750.00 or less may be made with "petty cash" in the open market. All
purchases greater than $750.00 and less than $25,000.00 may be made in the open market
without publication in a newspaper as above provided but whenever practical shall be based
on at least three competitive bids. No purchases, orders or contracts of $25,000.00 or more
shall be made unless authorized by the Board of Commissioners. All sales of obsolete or
unusable material shall be made to the highest responsible bidder. Whenever the Board of
Standardization hereinafter provided for shall have prescribed standard specifications, bids on
purchases of supplies, materials, and equipment shall be based on such standard
specifications. All purchases, orders, or contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible
bidder, taking into consideration the qualities of the articles supplied, their confonnity with
the specifications, their suitability to the requirement of the County and the delivery tenns. In
the detennination of the award to the lowest responsible bidder, nothing herein shall be
interpreted to precluded an award to a bidder other than the lowest actual bidder if such an
award is made in furtherance of affinnative action polices adopted by the County Purchasing
Agent for the promotion of nondiscriminatory hiring practices and equal employment
opportunity. Provided, however, that the award of all contracts shall be responsible and
reasonable. Any bid may be rejected and new bids may be solicited if the public interest is
served thereby. Each bid, with the name of the bidder, shall be entered on the record, which
record with the successful bid indicated thereon shall, after the award of the purchase or order
or contract, be open to public inspection. A copy of all contracts shall be filed with the
County Comptroller and with the County Purchasing Agent.

*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/07/06.

83

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Commissioner Collins stated that the Board needs to receive all of the bid specifications in advance. This
amendment would help ensure fairness in the bidding process. Bids that do not include comprehensive
calculations should be disqualified. Commissioner Collins stated there would be no fiscal impact to this
ordinance, and if there was, she would pay for it out of her own personal resources.
Commissioner Hansen stated that two factors that should be considered regarding this matter are the cost
and time delay associated with providing bid specifications to additional parties.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved to defer consideration of the
proposed ordinance amendment (Communication Number 281407). The motion to defer carried.

AN ORDINANCE REGARDING PASSAGE OF AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION AND
SPENDING PLAN THAT INCLUDES TAX INCREASES AFTER JAN UARY I ST OF
EACH BUDGET YEAR (PROPOSED ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance
sponsored by Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Larry Suffredin,
President Bobbie L. Steele, Mike Quigley. Forrest Claypool, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman
and Gregg Goslin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

AN ORDINANCE REGARDING PASSAGE OF AN ANNUAL APPROPRIATION
AND SPENDING PLAN THAT INCLUDES
TAXINCREASESAFTERJANUARYlST
OF EACH BUDGET YEAR
WHEREAS, Cook County government appropriates nearly $3 billion in an annual
appropriation and spending plan; and
WHEREAS, such spending plan includes appropriations for all county bureaus, agencies and
departments, including those bureaus, agencies and departments under the authority of other
county elected officials; and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners is legally obligated
to submit a proposed appropriation and spending plan to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners for their review, amendment and adoption; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners are required to adopt a balanced budget no later
than March 3 1st of that budget year; and
WHEREAS, such spending plan is affected by revenues generated by taxes, fees and other
sources, and impacts the residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon the administration to submit such appropriation as soon as
possible, and incumbent upon the Board of Commissioners to review, amend and adopt such
appropriation in a timely manner; and
WHEREAS, it is more difficult to avoid tax increases or inordinate budget reductions if the
statutory deadline for passage of the appropriation is upon the Board of Commissioners; and

84

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006
WHEREAS, the most important duty of the Board of Commissioners is to protect the public
interest by approving an appropriation and spending plan in an orderly and timely fashion;
and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly has recognized the importance of passing their budget in
a timely manner, with the requirement of a greater vote needed to pass tax increases after a
specified date; and
WHEREAS, if approved, this amendment would establish a more difficult process to
approve tax increases or drastic budget reductions after the specified date.
THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED it shall be ordained that the Cook County Tax
Approval shall be established as follows:
Any tax increase of any kind proposed as part of any annual appropriation and spending plan,
to be adopted by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, after January 1st of any budget
year, shall require a greater majority of commissioners, sixty percent (60%) or 11 members,
for passage, through March M-stlst, the final date authorized by state statute for the passage
of a balanced budget.
Effective Date. This Ordinance shall be effective on July I, 2007.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance as Amended on 09/19/06.
Commissioner Silvestri provided the following clarification that the proposed ordinance would motivate
the administration to bring budget proposals to the Board and the public earlier. The ordinance would
also put a greater burden on the passage of taxes as the deadline for budget approval arrives. The
ordinance would be effective for next year' s budget.
Commissioner Silvestri clarified the date in the fourth Whereas clause to reflect the correct date of March
I st instead of March 31st, as shown in the final paragraph of the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that perhaps through reviewing the 1985 Illinois Supreme Court decision
regarding vetoes, a Home Rule Ordinance could be created, especially since there are now single-member
districts.
Commissioners Claypool, Gorman and Goslin were added as Co-Sponsors.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to defer consideration of the
proposed ordinance (Communication Number 281764). The motion to defer carried.
Commissioner Maldonado moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Hansen. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Section I. Effective Date: This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon adoption.

*Referred to the Labor Subcommittee on 09/19/06.
Commissioner Gonnan inquired as to what prompted the creation of this item.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that there has been a series of bills in Springfield that the County has
been involved in relating to attempts by labor organizations to expand the number of lawyer groups such
as State's Attorneys and others that might come under the State Public Labor Relations Act. After much
discussion with the appropriate unions, we came to the conclusion that their real goal was to solidify the
bargaining position for the group they already represent, which is the assistant public defenders. The
public defenders' salaries have risen higher than those of many of the County's other lawyers, for
example those of the Public Guardian ' s Office, the State's Attorney's Office and other lawyers working
for the County. By adopting this item we are continuing the labor relations and collective bargaining that
we have already established for the assistant public defenders. We also will be establishing the floor as to
what the salaries should be for attorneys in other offices. That will open up discussion when we are
working on the budget to ensure there is parity in compensation among all the people who provide legal
services for the County as career attorneys.
Commissioner Gonnan inquired as to the bargaining unit for the assistant public defenders.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that AFSCME is the assistant public defenders' union.
Commissioner Peraica asked Commissioner Suffredin to clarify the Illinois Supreme Court decision that
determined that assistant state' s attorneys have no right to organize.
Commissioner Suffredin replied that it was not a decision, but rather it was dictum that deals with this
issue. State's attorneys in Will County are unionized. The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that state's
attorneys were not included and they had indices of being managerial personnel because of the decisions
that they are able to make on behalf of the State's Attorney. But the Court did not come to the conclusion
that state' s attorneys could not unionize. The decision asserted that state's attorneys are not covered by
the State Public Labor Relations Act. What is being done here by Home Rule is taking all of the actions
of the County Board and putting them into an ordinance so that people will understand what it is that has
been agreed to for the assistant public defenders.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether there is a representative of AFSCME or the Public Defender's
Office present to comment on the proposed Ordinance.
Ray Harris, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, Council 31, AFSCME, replied that AFSCME has
represented the Public Defender's Office for twenty years. The main interest is to codify the current
relationship with Cook County Board and the Cook County Board President. The proposed Ordinance
continues the twenty year status as the sole bargaining representative for the 450 assistant public
defenders. A lso, the Public Defender, Edward Burnett, has stated on the record that he is wholeheartedly
in favor of this Ordinance.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what type of agreement AFSCME has with the County securing its
position as the sole collective bargaining unit of the assistant public defenders.

135

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006

Mr. Harris replied that the State Public Labor Relations Act passed in 1983 delineated the Legislature's
intentions regarding public employees. A series of Illinois Supreme Court decisions ruled that certain
attorneys, such as the assistant state's attorneys and city corporation counsels, were no longer covered
under the State Public Labor Relations Act. AFSCME went to President Stroger, concerned about the
Supreme Court's decisions, and President Stroger provided a written agreement recognizing AFSCME as
the sole bargaining unit for the assistant public defenders for the duration of his term in office.
Commissioner Hansen requested clarification from the State's Attorney's Office.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, replied that the basis upon
which the Illinois Supreme Court asserted that the assistant state's attorneys were not covered under the
State Public Labor Relations Act is that state' s attorneys stand in the stead of the actual State's Attorney,
and have managerial duties and capacities that entail exercising significant discretion.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether this was true of assistant public defenders as well.
Mr. Driscoll replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether there is a prohibition given by the Illinois Supreme Court as to the
ability of the State's Attorney's Office or the Public Defender's Office to unionize.
Mr. Driscoll replied that there is no prohibition relating to assistant public defenders, and that he is unsure
regarding the State's Attorney's Office.
Commissioner Hansen voiced concern that this proposal might fonnalize the already existing disparity in
pay between the attorneys employed by the Public Defender' s Office and those employed in the County
elsewhere.
Mr. Driscoll replied that the Ordinance only defines collective bargaining; it does not set pay levels.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the termination date of the assistant public defender' s collective
bargaining agreement.
Mr. Harris replied that two months ago a three-year agreement was reached between the County and the
assistant public defenders.
Chainnan Murphy stated that the purpose of this codification is to further the process of obtaining pay
parity for all of the other attorneys employed by the County.
Commissioner Butler inquired why the assistant state's attorneys could not be included in this proposed
Ordinance.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that unionizing the State's Attorney ' s Office is a separate issue; the goal
of this Ordinance is to codify a pay scale that can then be referred to during the budget process to obtain
pay parity for other attorneys employed by the County.
Commissioner Gorman voiced concern that th is Ordinance might be tying the County's hands.
Mr. Driscoll replied that the Ordinance does not set any pay scale.

136

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the assistant state' s attorneys could be included in this collective
bargaining, and pay the " Fair Share." (When a union organizes a work place everyone benefits, not just
the union members. A " Fair Share" is the fee, which is typically less than union dues that the non-union
members pay as a result ofreceiving the benefits the union achieved.)
Mr. Harris replied that AFSCME Council 31 does not have the authority to represent the assistant state's
attorneys.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that the reason the assistant state' s attorneys are not unionized is because
the fonner State's Attorney, Jack O'Malley, opposed their unionization and won in the Illinois Supreme
Court.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of
Communication Number 281772. The motion carried.
Commissioner Hansen voted present.

Assistant Public Defender Collective Bargaining.

Section I. Short Title: This article shall be known as the Cook County Assistant Public Defender

Cook County employees who are subject to collective bargaining.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 17, 2006
Section 3. Right to Collective Bargaining: Cook County through a resolution adopted on May
24, 1984 detennined that Assistant Public Defenders are entitled to the right to collective bargaining.
Cook County Assistant Public Defenders have collectively bargained agreements on a regular basis since
1985, and those agreements have been approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The most
recent agreement was reached in June of 2006, and the economic terms were approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on July 12, 2006. Cook County shall preserve and continue in effect the
right of Cook County Assistant Public Defenders to engage in collective bargaining. Assistant Public
Defenders shall continue to have the same collective bargaining rights as are enjoyed by other Cook
County employees who are subject to collective bargaining. Assistant Public Defenders shall continue to
have the right to bargain collectively through their representative on questions of wages, hours and other
conditions of employment and the right to engage in other concerted activities for the purposes of
collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, free from interference, restraint or coercion.
Section 4: Management Rights: The County shall not be required to bargain with the
representative of Assistant Public Defenders over matters of inherent managerial policy, which shall
include such areas of discretion or policy as the functions of the County, standards of services, its overall
budget, the organizational structure and selection of new employees, examination techniques and
direction of employees. The County, however, shall be required to bargain collectively with regard to
policy matters directly affecting wages, hours and tenns and conditions of employment as well as the
impact thereon upon request by the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders.
Section 5: Collective Bargaining Defined:
For the purposes of this Article, "to bargain
collectively" means the performance of the mutual obligation of the County or its designated
representative and the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders to meet at reasonable times,
including meetings in advance of the budget making process, and to negotiate in good faith with respect
to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, not excluded by Section 4 of this Article, or the
negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder and the execution of a written contract
incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either the County or the representative of the
Assistant Public Defenders, but such obligation does not compel either the County or the representative of
the Assistant Public Defenders to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession. "To bargain
collectively" shall also include negotiations as to the tenns of a collective bargaining agreement.
Collective bargaining agreements between Cook County and the organization representing
Assistant Public Defenders may include a provision requiring Assistant Public Defenders covered by the
agreement who are not members of the organization to pay their proportionate share of the costs of the
collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and
conditions of employment, not to exceed the amount of dues uniformly required of members. The
organization shall certify to the County the amount constituting each nonmember Assistant Public
Defender's proportionate share which shall not exceed dues uniformly required of members. In such
case, the proportionate share payment shall be deducted by the County from the earnings of the
nonmember Assistant Public Defender and paid to the organization representing the Assistant Public
Defenders.
Section 6: Grievance Procedure: The collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the
County and the representative of Assistant Public Defenders shall contain a grievance resolution
procedure which shall provide for final and binding arbitration of disputes concerning the administration
or interpretation of the agreement unless mutually agreed otherwise. Any agreement containing a final
and binding arbitration provision shall also contain a provision prohibiting strikes for the duration of the
agreement. The grievance and arbitration provisions of any collective bargaining agreement shall be
subject to the Illinois "Uniform Arbitration Act". The costs of such arbitration shall be borne equally by
the County and the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders.

discourage membership in or other support for the representative of the Assistant Public Defenders; (3)

WHEREAS, in April 2006, Pope Benedict XVI signed the decree acknowledging the second miracle

WHEREAS, being canonized as a saint is the highest honor the Catholic Church bestows upon an
individual and Saint Mother Theodore now becomes a model of holiness, virtue, love and faith for all
time. Mother Theodore is only the eighth person who ministered in the U.S. to receive this honor.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board commemorate the
canonization of Mother Theodore Guerin and offer thanks for her lifetime of good works.
