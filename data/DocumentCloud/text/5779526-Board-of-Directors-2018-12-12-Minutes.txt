Ms. Kanalos presented the terms for the engagement of environmental firms for the Industrial
Land Assembly Project.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit administration has requested the assistance of the City
of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities
aimed at establishing market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract
manufacturing and logistics companies (the “Land Assembly Project”). On October 24, 2018
(DBRA 18-10-262-01) and November 7, 2018 (DBRA 18-10-262-02) the Board approved certain
initial steps in connection with the Land Assembly Project, including the allocation and acceptance
of a total of $10 Million in initial funds for the Land Assembly Project, which funds were expected
to be reimbursed by the City.
In connection with the Land Assembly Project, the DBRA has solicited quotes from select
environmental firms to perform environmental due diligence activities. From these requested
quotes, DBRA staff have selected AKT Peerless, DLZ and SME as qualified, responsive firms.

Land Assembly Project: Support and Approval of MDEQ Brownfield Redevelopment Grant
Application
Ms. Kanalos presented the Land Assembly Project: Support and Approval of MDEQ Brownfield
Redevelopment Grant Application to the DBRA Board.
The City Administration approached the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (the
“MDEQ”) regarding funding support for the environmental remediation and cleanup of parcels for
the Land Assembly Project. The MDEQ has indicated its interest in providing a $2,000,000.00
Brownfield Redevelopment Program Grant to support the City and DBRA’s efforts as parcels are
acquired.
The $2,000,000.00 is to be provided by the MDEQ over two State fiscal years: the current fiscal
year (10/1/18 to 9/30/19) and the following fiscal year (10/1/19 to 9/30/20). Detroit Brownfield
Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) staff and environmental consultants believe that

 $2,000,000.00 will be able to be used for environmental cleanup and remediation at Land
Assembly Project parcels.
Staff is asking the Board for support and authorization to submit a grant application to the MDEQ
for up to $2,000,000.00 in funds from the State of Michigan for an environmental cleanup grant
through its existing Brownfield Grant & Loan Program and to accept the funds if they are awarded.
No local match is required as part of this grant application.
A resolution supporting the submission of the Land Assembly Project Grant Application to the
MDEQ and acceptance of grant funds, if awarded, was attached for Board review and approval.
Ms. McClain asked if the grant could potentially be less than the $2 million that is being applied
for. Ms. Kanalos said that the grant funds would be for cleanup costs up to $2 million over two
fiscal years.
Ms. Wilkins called for approval of the Land Assembly Project: Support and Approval of MDEQ
Brownfield Redevelopment Grant Application. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. George, seconded by Ms. Washington, DBRA Resolution Code 1812-262-05 was unanimously approved.
AMC Site-14250 Plymouth Road – 2nd Expansion of Scope: Environmental Assessment/
Second Party Review & Geotechnical Site Assessment Services Contract
Ms. Kanalos presented the AMC Site-14250 Plymouth Road – 2nd Expansion of Scope:
Environmental Assessment/ Second Party Review & Geotechnical Site Assessment Services
Contract to the DBRA Board.
OVERVIEW
On behalf of the City of Detroit, the DBRA is evaluating the former AMC Site located at 14250
Plymouth Road for Environmental and Geotechnical Due Diligence in connection with the DDOT
and Wayne County Land Bank swap agreement and for attracting industrial facility developments
to the Project.
PROJECT SCOPE
On December 20, 2017 the DBRA conducted an initial solicitation for the submission of
competitive proposals for the provision of Site Assessment Services associated with the DBRA’s
Pre-development Site Preparation Activities of the AMC via a Request for Proposals.
The DBRA approved a contract with Testing Engineers & Consultants, Inc (TEC) on January 19,
2018 in the amount of $136,000.00 which also included a 20% contingency and was largely due
to the unknown contamination at the site, to provide the following services on the site:
•
•
•
•
•

Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment
Stock piled (non-native) soil, testing & characterizing soils for contaminants
Gridding sampling, testing & characterizing of native ground soils for contaminants
Geotechnical investigation
Hazardous material survey of existing facilities

EXPANSION OF SCOPE

 Due to the complexities of the site, including the significant costs associated with assessing and
disposing of the soil stockpiles, and as a follow up to TEC’s Evaluation, the City requested a
second party assessment. This second party review included the assessment of TEC’s report as
it relates to sufficiency and identification of data gaps from the soil stockpile samples and
geotechnical investigation. In addition, the City expanded the project area to include assessments
of property adjacent to the east and west of the site. Soil & Materials Engineers, Inc. (SME) was
approved by the Board at the October 10, 2018 DBRA meeting as the second party contractor to
perform the services associated with the expanded scope of services due to their multidisciplinary
project team approach and responsiveness to the expanded scope of services at the AMC Site.
SECOND EXPANSION OF SCOPE
SME’s work so far has resulted in significant costs savings totaling millions of dollars for the
calculated volume, methodology and scope for handling the significant soil piles on the site. As
a result of the significant cost savings developed, DBRA staff would like to engage SME for
additional services to further refine, and hopefully further reduce, proposed remediation and
demolition costs for the AMC Site.
Additionally, the City elected to take title to the AMC Site from the Wayne County Land Bank on
November 30, 2018. SME’s second expanded scope of services will also include required
services to complete environmental due diligence reports, such as an updated Phase 1 ESA, and
Baseline Environmental Assessment (“BEA”), to shield the City from liability for prior
contamination on the site.
Finally, the DBRA was able to gain interest from the from the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for up to $250,000.00 in grant funds to remove underground
storage tanks (UST) identified on the site. A separate resolution will be presented for the funds.
This resolution includes approving SME to perform consulting services for the MDEQ grant and
the UST removal.

Description

A resolution approving and authorizing the DBRA to enter into an expanded contract with SME
for the above described services was attached for Board review and consideration.

 Mr. George asked If the City of Detroit has taken title of the property. Mr. Scott confirmed that the
City of Detroit has taken title of the property and that the City of Detroit Building, Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department is working with the Detroit Brownfield
Redevelopment Authority and consultants to get supplemental data needed.
Ms. Wilkins called for approval of the AMC Site-14250 Plymouth Road – 2nd Expansion of Scope:
Environmental Assessment/ Second Party Review & Geotechnical Site Assessment Services
Contract. The Board took the following action:

Environmental Quality Brownfield Redevelopment Grant Application
Ms. Kanalos presented the AMC Site 14250 Plymouth Road: Support and Approval of a Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality Brownfield Redevelopment Grant Application to the DBRA
Board.
The Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) approached the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality (the “MDEQ”) regarding funding support for the remediation
and cleanup of AMC Site at 14250 Plymouth Road. After reviewing the data and studies produced
for the site to date, the MDEQ has proposed providing a grant of up to $250,000.00 to fund
Underground Storage Tank (UST) removal at the AMC Site.
Reports completed for the site indicate that at least six USTs are present on the site. DBRA staff
and environmental consultants believe that $250,000.00 will likely cover the costs for the removal
and remediation of the USTs at the AMC Site. It is anticipated that the DBRA will procure a
contractor to perform the UST removal and remediation after an environmental consultant
completes their investigative work and develops a project scope for the project. The selected
contractor will be presented to the Board for contract approval
Staff is asking the Board for support and authorization to submit a grant application to the MDEQ
for up to $250,000.00 in funds from the State of Michigan for an environmental cleanup grant
through its existing Brownfield Grant & Loan Program and to accept the funds if they are awarded.
