CHAIRMAN’S COMMENTS Chairman Jaffe announced that the Board and staff were present to announce the 3 finalists for
the 10th License. He thanked the staff and Credit Suisse for all their hard work. The process was
a difficult one which entailed a lot of hard work, but the Board and staff have come together for
the Board to vote and move ahead.
The Chairman introduced Chief Counsel Mike Fries who is the project manager. Mr. Fries made
the introductions into the process.
The Board received 7 applications on October 14, 2008. In the 30 days that have elapsed since

the character, reputation, experience and financial integrity of the applicants and
of any other separate person that either controls or is controlled by the applicant;
the proposed facilities;
the highest prospective total revenue to be derived by the State;
minority ownership of the applicant and the affirmative action plan of the
applicant;
financial ability of applicant to maintain appropriate insurance;
capitalization of the applicant to maintain the license;
extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets other standards for the issuance of
an owners license which the Board may adopt by Rule (No such Rule has been
adopted); and
the amount of the bid.
the effect on the economically depressed areas of the State;
to applicants presenting plans which provide for significant economic
development over a large geographic area; and
to applicants who currently operate non-gambling riverboats in Illinois.

No one should assume that by naming 3 finalists, the Board has tacitly approved any ownership
group, any person associated with an ownership group or any entity that controls, directly or
indirectly, the location or property on which the gaming facility will be located.
The Board will continue to investigate the character, reputation and integrity of the 3 finalists
and all persons and entities associated with their proposed gaming operations. The public should
be reminded that an extensive due diligence investigation will be conducted before the license is
actually awarded.
On Tuesday, November 25, 2008, the 3 finalists will make presentations to the Board in an Open
Meeting. The public is welcome and encouraged to attend. The presentations will be at 9 a.m.,
10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Each applicant will be limited to a one hour presentation followed by a
half hour for questions. In December the Board will hold an Open Meeting at which any
member of the public may address the Board regarding the 3 finalists and their proposed gaming
operations. Comments will be limited to 5 minutes and should be limited to an applicant or
location. Requests to be placed on that Agenda should be addressed in writing to Monica
Thomas.
Member Winkler moved for the Board members to individually vote on each application for
selection as the 3 finalists for the 10th Owner’s License. Member Gardner seconded the motion.

 Member Winkler stated that he voted yes for Calumet City; the Southern suburbs have a real
need for what a casino could do there. Calumet City being so close to Indiana, having a casino
in that area would bring back some of the revenue that Indiana has gained from us in the past.
Employment is a real issue in the Southern suburbs. Calumet City is the strongest of the four
applicants in southern suburban area.
Member Moore stated his comments in reference to Calumet City. The shared taxes and the
income would greatly enhance the area.

IDENTIFICATION OF 3 FINALISTS
Midwest Gaming & Entertainment, LLC – Des Plaines
Trilliant Gaming Illinois - Rosemont

Member Gardner complimented Members Winkler and Moore regarding their comments. He
was swayed by the ultimate outcome of the state taxes generated and the revenue sharing
proposed by Des Plaines and Rosemont to be shared with the financially depressed suburbs of
Cook County.
Chairman Jaffe stated that the process was a very complicated one. The three chosen were
chosen because the Board felt they offered the most probable revenue for the State of Illinois.
