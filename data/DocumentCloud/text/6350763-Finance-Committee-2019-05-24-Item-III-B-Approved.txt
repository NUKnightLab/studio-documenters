Re: 12-Month Purchase of Reinsurance for CountyCare Health Plan 

On April 26, 2019, the Cook County Health Board of Directors approved a request for payment for
reinsurance for the CountyCare Health Plan. After further review and negotiations. amendments
are needed for that request as indicated below, and are being presented for the Board?s

consideration.

Since the inception of CountyCare, Cook County Health (CCH) has purchased reinsurance to
offset the risk of its high-cost members. Initially, reinsurance was focused only on members who
received transplant services. Beginning in 2015, general stop-loss reinsurance was secured with a
threshold of $750,000 per member. Claims costs incurred in excess of that amount are reimbursed
to CCH. Coverage is priced on a PMPM basis by population type FHP, SPD, ACA Adults).

The CCH policy is issued under a County-wide insurance brokerage contract with Alliance
Insurance Services, managed by the County?s Office of Risk Management.

CCH recommends entering a stop-loss policy coverage for twelve months, through December 31,
2019. Based on the bids submitted, and pricing and risk analysis, the recommended policy would
increase the per member reinsurance deductible from $750,000 to $479997099 $2,000,000.

Terms will include:

$470907990 $2,000,000 per member deductible

90% reinsurance once deductible is met; $2 million maximum benefit

Costs are calculated at 100% of Medicaid for non-CCH providers and at 29% of charges
(comparable to standard Medicaid rates) for services provided at CCH

- Blood factor products, blood derivatives and anti-inhibitor coagulant complex excluded for
certain members

This memo requests the Board?s approval of payment not to exceed $1,092,000 for the
purchase of re-insurance as described above for CountyCare members. The coverage will be
provided by Sequoia, as placed by Alliance Insurance Services, the County?s insurance broker.
