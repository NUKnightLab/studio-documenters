Put Illinois to Work is a program created by utilizing state funds and federal stimulus dollars,
and will be administered through Heartland Human Care Services. Through the Program, youth
ages 18-21, non-custodial parents and single parents with children (i.e. TANF eligible adults)
will be placed in temporary, subsidized positions and will learn valuable and transferable skills
enhancing their long-term employment prospects. Employment opportunities will be available
in a variety of fields and will last up to six (6) months. The Put Illinois to Work program is
currently scheduled to end on September 30, 2010, however there is a possibility that the federal
legislation underlying this program will be amended and the end date will be extended.
Employment opportunities will be created through collaboration between CHA, CHA case
management and workforce development service providers and community partners. HHCS, as
the primary grantee, will be the employer of record responsible for processing accurate and
timely payroll for the participants, while CHA will act as program manager.
CHA is requesting authorization from the Board to receive up to $1,400,000 from HHCS,
however it is anticipated that CHA may not receive this entire funding amount. The funding
received will depend on negotiations with the grantee and the number of residents placed in
employment through the Program.
Based upon the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the
Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, to accept the award and execute a sub-grantee
agreement with Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. in an amount not-to-exceed $1,400,000,
increase the FY2010 comprehensive budget by an amount not-to-exceed $1,400,000 and amend
contracts with case management agencies and transitional job providers in an aggregate amount,
not-to-exceed $1,400,000 to provide up-to 2,000 CHA youth ages 18-21, non-custodial parents,
and single parents with children (i.e. TANF eligible adults) with employment opportunities
through the Put Illinois to Work Program.
