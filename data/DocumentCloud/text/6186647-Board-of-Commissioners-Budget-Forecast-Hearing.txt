 2020 GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND EXPENDITURE FORECAST
The outlook for FY2020 includes a General Fund deficit projected at $11.9 million.

PROPERTY TAX

The FY2020 outlook includes a projected
shortfall of $11.9 million in the General
Fund; with revenues $4.7 million above
the FY2019 adopted budget and
expenses $16.6 million above FY2019.

The preliminary estimate for the Property
Tax Levy to the General Fund in FY2020 is
$216.5 million. The Tax Increment Financing
Surplus to the General Fund is projected at

FY2020 REVENUE FORECAST

$8 million for the purposes of preliminary
forecasting. The County’s base property
tax levy remains flat, as there has been no
adjustment to account for inflation since 1996.

General Fund - FY2020 Forecast

The preliminary estimate for General Fund
revenues in FY2020 is $1,872.1 million.
This represents an increase of $4.7 million,
or 0.3 % compared to FY2019 budgeted
revenues. This figure assumes an operating
tax allocation to the Health Enterprise Fund
of $102.0 million which essentially covers
expenses related to non-fee generating
programs in public health and correctional
health. It includes a $21.1 million increase in
County Sales Tax due to a growing economy.

 NON-PROPERTY TAXES

GENERAL FUND FEES

The preliminary estimate for revenues for
Non-Property Taxes for FY2020 is $1,355.8
million. This is $7.2 million more than
prior year budgeted revenues. This modest
increase is driven by growth in County
Sales Tax revenue due to a robust economy
and an estimated increase in the Gambling
Machine Tax revenue ($3.3M) from recently
passed state legislation expanding casino
gambling. Absent the growth in County Sales
Tax revenue, Non-Property Taxes would be
declining compared to prior year budgeted
revenues by nearly $17 million or 1.2%.
A number of Non-Property Tax revenue
sources are declining. County Use Tax and
Non-Retailer Use Tax revenues are projecting
a decline of $1.5 million and $1.75 million
respectively as vehicle sales are expected
to moderate in the upcoming year.

The County imposes various General Fund
fees for services it performs. The fees charged
by various County departments include: fees
for vital records, real estate transactions,
court case filings, and delinquent taxes.
The preliminary estimate for General Fund
Fees in FY2020 is $200.9 million, comparable to FY2019 budgeted revenues.

INVESTMENT INCOME AND
MISCELLANEOUS REVENUES

INTERGOVERNMENTAL REVENUES

The County is projecting $2.1 million in
investment income FY2020, just above
the FY2019 budgeted revenues of $1.8
million. Investment Income is the interest
garnered on County fund cash balances.

Revenue from intergovernmental sources is
granted by other governmental units such
as the State of Illinois and the Cook County
Forest Preserve District. The preliminary
estimate for Intergovernmental Revenues for
FY2020 is $56 million, $3.1 million higher than
FY2019 budgeted revenues. This projection
reflects a higher reimbursement rate for

The preliminary estimate for Miscellaneous
Revenues for FY2020 is $32.7 million,
which includes $6.6 million in estimated
revenue from a new Cannabis and Sports
Betting Taxes as recently approved by
the Illinois General Assembly. These two
new tax sources will be categorized as
Non-Property Taxes upon final approval.

 FY2020 EXPENDITURE FORECAST
FY2020 General Fund expenditures are
projected to increase by $16.6 million or 0.9%
over the FY2019 appropriation. This increase
is driven by an overall increase of 3% in
personnel expenditures ($38.2M) due of Board
approved wage increases. FY2020 represents
the last year of the current collective bargaining agreements. This agreement includes
a 2% mid-year Cost of Living Allowance
in FY2020, but freezes step increases to
maintain wage growth at inflationary levels.
Another key component of the personnel
related expense increase is rising employee
health benefit costs ($11.7M) which are
expected to rise at a rate above medical
inflation. The County makes available both an
HMO and a PPO medical plan. The majority
of employees chose the HMO, but the PPO
plan still covers 18,800 members (employees
and dependents). Cook County has seen an
on-going shift from HMO enrollment to the
more costly PPO plan. The County covers
nearly twice the number of members in
the HMO than in the PPO, yet on a monthly
basis the cost of the plans is nearly equal.
HMO membership declined 6.9%, while PPO
membership increased 1.9% in the same

2 0 2 0

period. In FY2020, the cost of the HMO plan
is expected to rise by 5.9%, while the PPO
plan is projected to increase by 8%. The
County will be reviewing its cost sharing
model to be more in line with best practices.
Non-personnel spending is forecasted
to decrease by 3.5% below FY2019
appropriations driven by an effort to align
requested funding with budgeting best

practices; using zero based budgeting
principles and historical spending trends.

PENSION
This projected operating deficit also reflects
an appropriation of $340 million in FY2020 for
supplemental pension contributions continuing the County’s path towards addressing the
outstanding unfunded pension liability at the

 County Employee’s and Officer’s Annuity and
Benefit Fund of Cook County (the “Retirement
Fund”) and fulfilling the commitment of
the Board of Commissioners when they
raised the Home Rule Sales Tax in 2015.
In 2016, the County began making supplemental payments to the Retirement Fund to
help shore up unfunded pension liabilities.
In 2018 the Pension Fund conducted an
experience study, based on which it adopted
a new set of assumptions impacting its
outstanding liabilities. These assumptions
helped the Fund reduced its overall liabilities,
resulting in a decline in the actuarially
required contribution to be made by the
County under its Intergovernmental agreement with the Fund. Despite that decline
in the actuarially required contribution, the
County established a Pension Stabilization
account in the Annuity and Benefit Fund, in
line with its long-term goal of continued

2 0 2 0

commitment to address the Pension
Fund’s liabilities. The account will receive
$30 million in FY2019 revenues to help
further offset unfunded liabilities of the
Pension Fund. At the end of FY2019, the
County would have made over $1.3 billion
in supplemental pension payments to
address the Pension Fund’s liabilities.
The FY2020 preliminary forecast continues
to incorporate a supplemental appropriation
to the Pension Fund. The FY2020 payment
amount is projected at $340 million. These
payments were set at the lowest possible
level to allow the Board of Commissioners to
pay down the unfunded pension liabilities
by 2049 and limit the projected growth rate
of future payments to 2% or less or less.

DEBT SERVICE
The County has undertaken a long-term plan
to manage its debt service in a manner which
will target the rate at which debt service
will grow in future years at no more than 2

C O O K

C O U N T Y

P R E L I M I N A R Y

F O R E C A S T

percent annually. Even with this long-term
plan, achieved through strategic refinancing,
and a commitment to continuing to limit the
issuance of debt, debt service will continue
to rise through 2026 before leveling off at
approximately $335 million; based on a
significant legacy debt service burden and
the need to invest in County facilities and
technology infrastructure. In FY2020, the
amount of property tax allocated to support
debt service is projected at $260 million.

STATE IMPACT
At the end of May, the State of Illinois enacted
several revenue generating measures:
legalizing recreational marijuana, expanding
casino gambling and allowing wagering on
sporting events. The County will continue to
review these legislative actions to determine
the full impact on FY2020 and future County
budgets. Preliminary estimates include a
conservative projection of $9.75 million
in revenue for the upcoming budget.

 HEALTH ENTERPRISE FUND

HEALTH ENTERPRISE FUND REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
For FY2019, the Health Fund is projecting to end the year with an unfavorable variance of $103.1 million. Revenues are
projecting $195.3 million or 7.3% below the adopted budget and expenses $92.2 million or 3.4% below the adopted budget.
For FY2020, the Health Fund forecasts a budget gap of $6.8 million; with revenues $149.6 million or 5.6% below

 PROJECTED 2019 YEAR-END HEALTH FUND REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
Cook County’s Health Fund is projected to end FY2019 with a $103.1 million shortfall.
In the Health Enterprise Fund, Cook County
Health (CCH) is projecting a deficit of $103.1
million. This unfavorable variance is driven by
revenue performing under budget. Managed
Care (CountyCare) revenue is projected to
come in $183.9 million below budget due to
lower than budgeted member enrollment and
fewer in system claims. While CCH year-end
revenue is projected to be a total of $195.3
million under budget, expenditures are also
projected to be $92.2 million below the
adopted budget. A mid-year corrective action
plan includes a spending holdback equal to
the revenue shortfall to ensure expenditures
stay within the appropriated budget.

The total budgeted revenue for FY2019 is
$2,690.5 million for the Health Enterprise
Fund. The projected year-end revenues of
$2,495.2 million are less than budgeted revenues by $195.3 million, or 7.3%. The projected
shortfall in revenue is attributed to lower

than anticipated membership enrollment in
CountyCare, which is allocated and collects
reimbursements on a per member per month
basis. The average number of members per
month projected for FY2019 was budgeted at
345,000.

 However, the average number of members per

As a whole. the State of Illinois is experiencing
a decline in Medicaid enrollment. According
to publicly-available State data, across Cook
County, Medicaid enrollment has decreased
by 16% in the past year due to a backlog in
Medicaid application and redetermination
processing from 2018. The FY2019 year-end
shortfall is directly attributed to the lower
