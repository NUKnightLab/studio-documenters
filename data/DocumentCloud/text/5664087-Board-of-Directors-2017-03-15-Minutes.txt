Project Introduction
Palace Sports and Entertainment, LLC (“PSE”) and Henry Ford Health System (“HFHS”) are the
project developers (the “Developers”) for the Plan which entails the construction of a corporate
headquarters and practice facility for the Detroit Pistons National Basketball Association team.
The facility is expected to include approximately 128,000 square feet of office space, locker and
training rooms and a practice facility, all within a single facility (the “Pistons Facility”). The Pistons

 Facility is expected to include ground-floor retail or commercial space for uses that may include
a team store, restaurant and/or bank.
The Plan also includes an approximately 25,000 square foot sports medicine and medical office
building to be constructed, owned and operated by HFHS. The Pistons Facility and the HFHS
Facility will be joined by an approximately 400 space above-grade parking structure. It is
estimated that 120 temporary construction jobs will be created at the overall property and 150
permanent jobs will be created in connection with the Pistons Facility.
Total investment is expected to exceed $83,000,000.00. The Developers are requesting

Project Introduction
Herman Kiefer Development, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the rehabilitation of the vacant former Herman Kiefer Health Department complex, two
vacant former Detroit Public Schools and 510 residential parcels, 503 of which will be acquired
from the Detroit Land Bank Authority and City of Detroit. In total the project includes 84.95 acres
of land and well over 500,000 square feet of existing buildings. The project proposes the reuse
of the Herman Kiefer complex buildings and the former Crosman and Hutchins schools into

 commercial uses. Residential homes will be rehabilitated to the extent possible and leased or
sold. Vacant land will be put into productive reuse.
The total investment is estimated to be approximately $143 million. The Developer is requesting
$47,767,473.00 in TIF reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of five-hundred fifteen (515) parcels largely located
west of the John C. Lodge Freeway and south of Clairmount Street. Please see Attachment A
and B of the Plan for a list and map of parcels.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized for residential or public purpose; (b) it is located within the City of
Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to
be a facility, blighted and/or adjacent to or contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to
increase the captured taxable value of that property as defined by Act 381. The three Herman
Kiefer Health Complex parcels at 1151 Taylor, 1110 Clairmount and 8700 Byron, the Hutchins
School at 1501 Hazelwood and the Crosman School at 9027 John C Lodge have all been declared
facilities pursuant to Part 201 by the MDEQ. The 510 surrounding residential parcels (see
Attachment B in the Plan) have initially been determined blighted per Act 381 via an initial
determination of blight letter from Detroit City Planning Commission staff. Documents supporting
these determinations can be found in Attachments B, G and H of the Plan.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out in four (4) phases at the Property are
considered “eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline
environmental site assessment activities, due care activities, additional response activities,
environmental insurance, demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, site preparation,
infrastructure improvements, preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan, a 15% contingency
as well as 5% simple interest after expiration of tax abatements. The eligible activities and
budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely
by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur
no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in the summer of 2017. Phases will be
completed within the following timeline from approval of the Plan: Phase I three (3) years, Phase
II five (5) years, Phase III seven (7) years, and Phase IV ten (10) years.

to Board member questions regarding dates of the previous plan approvals, details of the delay,
developer capacity to move forward with the project and project timing.
Project Background
The Amended & Restated 3800 Woodward Brownfield Redevelopment Plan (the “Plan”) was
approved by the DBRA Board of Directors on March 12, 2014 and by Detroit City Council (the
“Council”) on May 27, 2014. The Reimbursement Agreement was entered into on June 11, 2014.
Roxbury Group and Midtown Project, LLC are the developers for the Plan which is located at 3800
and 3750 Woodward Avenue. Roxbury Group is currently rehabilitating the existing “Hammer &
Nail Building” at 3800 Woodward Avenue. Midtown Project LLC (the “Developer”) will construct
a new office building and parking deck at 3750 Woodward Avenue on the existing foundations
built for the project. This state-of-the art facility will include office and medical facilities as well as
retail and restaurant space and a parking structure. Total investment is estimated to be
$73,000,000.00. The MEDC approved a Michigan Business Tax (“MBT”) credit of $10,000,000.00

 on an eligible investment of $50,755,702.00. The Developer was approved for a Tax Increment
Financing (“TIF”) reimbursement of $8,175,302.00.
Extension Request
Due to delays regarding the final design details of the building on 3750 Woodward, construction
was halted until the final design details could be confirmed. As a result of the construction delays,
the Developer will not be able to complete Eligible Activities by the June 10, 2017 deadline
provided in the Reimbursement Agreement. The Developer has indicated that design details have
been finalized for the project and that construction will restart at the site this year as soon as
weather allows.
As such, the Developer is requesting an extension to December 31, 2020 to complete eligible
activities. This date is the same deadline for the construction completion deadline for the MBT
credit, the preapproval from the State was included as an attachment to the memo.
DBRA staff recommended the approval of the extension.
A resolution granting the extension of the Amended and Restated 3800 Woodward Brownfield
Redevelopment Plan duration requirements was attached for Board review and approval.
