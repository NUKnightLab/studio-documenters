GENERAL BACKGROUND

In 2009, the CAC received a Resident Opportunity and Supportive Services (ROSS) grant
directly from HUD to engage hard-to-reach residents and encourage participation in CHA
services. Upon receipt of the grant award, the CAC hired staff to implement the scope of work

 

60 E. Van Buren Street - cnleaga, Illinois 60605-1207- (312) @3566 7M. fill-555% 

required by the grant. The outreach and engagement services provided by the CAC during this
period were executed successfully and proved bene?cial to the resident population. During the
grant period, outreach and engagement staff worked closely with Resident
Services Division to identify families who lived in the Scattered Site portfolio who were not
engaged in services.

The CAC submitted a proposal to CHA to continue the engagement services that had been
provided during term of the ROSS grant, and worked with CHA to enhance the scope of work
and metrics of the grant based on the needs of CHA. The CAC has a unique capacity to provide
these services, as the CAC outreach and engagement team is comprised fully of CHA residents,
which helps to foster trust and positive relationships with CHA families, who are reluctant to
engage in continuum of social services. The outreach service for those who are
hard to reach is important to ensure all families have an opportunity to engage in services,
particularly in light of a changing service model and reduced resources in the future.

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.

The Acting EVP of Resident Services concurs with the recommendation to enter into a contract
with the CAC to provide outreach and engagement services to CHA families.

The CEO/President recommends the approval to enter into cost-reimbursement contracts for a
one (1) year base term, with one (1) one-year option with the Central Advisory Council in an
amount not-to?exceed $298,244 to provide outreach and engagement services to more than 400
CHA families.
