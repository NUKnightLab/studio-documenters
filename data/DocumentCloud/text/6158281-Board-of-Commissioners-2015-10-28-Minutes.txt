income. Ms. Drummond also helped to ensure that the Community and Economic Development Association
supervised the funding of the Percentage of Income Payment Plan; and
WHEREAS, Lillian Drummond remains a fierce advocate for the needs of her community, whether it be
utility consumers, seniors, or youth, and through her advocacy, personifies the very best of the West Side
of Chicago.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
that Lillian Drummond is to be congratulated on the renaming of a portion of West Congress Parkway as
“Honorary Lillian Drummond Parkway,” and that the sincere appreciation of the President and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners is to be extended to Lillian Drummond for her service to the community.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING TO PRESENT A PUBLIC QUESTION VIA A COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM
ABOLISHING THE OFFICE OF THE COOK COUNTY RECORDER OF DEEDS
WHEREAS, Cook County government continues to make concerted efforts to address current and future
budgetary constraints by rightsizing governmental operations, improving efficiency and eliminating
redundancy in operations, among other measures; and
WHEREAS, the County currently has 29 separately elected officials, some of whom oversee
administrative offices; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Recorder of Deeds is tasked with keeping accurate records of land
transactions for public and private review; maintaining official records of UCC, tax liens and lien
releases; and recording and maintaining other official records; and
WHEREAS, the key functions of the Cook County Clerk include maintaining vital records and other
official records, administering elections, and maintaining County tax maps and calculating tax rates; and
WHEREAS, functions that are narrowly drawn and administrative in nature provide an excellent
opportunity for consolidation with another office; and
WHEREAS, record-keeping is an administrative function shared by both the County Clerk’s Office and
the County Recorder of Deeds, with many of the Recorder’s duties aligning with already existing
divisions under the Clerk; and
WHEREAS, only 2 of the 10 largest counties in the United States have a separately elected Recorder of
Deeds and Clerk; and
WHEREAS, it is anticipated that a merger of the Cook County Clerk and Cook County Recorder of
Deeds could save the County over $1 million dollars annually through a more efficient provision of
services while also centralizing record-keeping and improving customer service; and
WHEREAS, Article VII, Section 4(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois states, “Any office may
be created or eliminated and the terms of office and manner of selection changed by county-wide

referendum”; and
WHEREAS, 10 ILCS 5/28-8.1(a) states, “Whenever a proposition required by law to be voted upon
before its adoption, other than a constitutional amendment, is submitted to the people, it is the duty of the
Secretary of State to prepare a statement setting forth in detail Section or Sections of the law sought to be
amended by the vote, together with statements and suggestions as may be necessary for a proper
understanding of the proposition. The statements and suggestions shall be submitted to the Attorney
General for his approval”; and
WHEREAS, it is a fundamental underpinning of our great country to provide taxpayers the opportunity
to have input as to the functioning of their government and use of their tax dollars; and
WHEREAS, allowing the voters of Cook County the opportunity to determine the propriety of the
proposed consolidation via a binding referendum is an opportunity to engage residents directly in our
democratic process; and
WHEREAS, in order to consolidate and improve services by merging the functions and responsibilities
of the office of the Recorder of Deeds into the office of the Cook County Clerk, the Cook County Board
of Commissioners seeks to place a question before the electorate via a referendum on the November 8,
2016, countywide ballot seeking to eliminate the office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds and
merge its functions into those of the Cook County Clerk, as follows:
“Shall the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be eliminated and all duties and
responsibilities of the Office of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds be transferred to, and assumed
by, the Office of the Cook County Clerk by December 1, 2018.
[ ] Yes
[ ] No”
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this
Board present the aforementioned question to the electorate via a countywide referendum on the
November 8, 2016 ballot.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk notifies the Secretary of State, and the
Attorney General of this request for action.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Krzysztof Wasowicz, Village President, Village of Justice

October 28, 2015

Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Justice

Volume and Property Index Number:
084, 18-34-405-008-0000
Summary: The Village of Justice (the Village) hereby submits a No Cash Bid Request Package to
acquire the following parcel of real property located at 8801 West 84th Place, Justice, Illinois 60458 (the
Property). The Property is improved with a gasoline service station that has been abandoned and
remained unoccupied for at least two (2) years. The Village will file for tax exempt status once the
Property has been acquired. Once tax exempt status is obtained, the Village intends to demolish the
gasoline service station improvements, remediate environmental contamination, and possibly market the
same for redevelopment by a third-party. If the Property is sold and redeveloped by a third-party, it
would no longer be exempt from taxation. The Village initiates this request on its own, and there has
been no request by a third-party for the Village to acquire the Property or to convey the certificate of
purchase or the perfected tax deed(s) to said third-party purchaser.
The Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal costs and other costs
associated with acquisition of the Property. The Village will submit annually to the Cook County
Department of Economic Development "No Cash Bid Reports" on the status of each parcel for five years,
or until the intended use and development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Marilynn J. May, Village President, Village of River Grove
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request

Summary: Three (3) properties located within the Village of River Grove are currently tax-delinquent
and unoccupied, and the Village would therefore like to secure ownership of these properties through the
Cook County No Cash Bid Program and the 2015 Scavenger Sale. A list containing the volume number
and full 14-digit permanent index number (PIN) of each parcel requested is as follows. The total number
of PINs requested in the package is three (3). A statement of current and intended use for each PIN
follows, but, the Village intends on acquiring all three parcels for the development of public parking

facilities: Common Address 2620 Thatcher Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol. 067 PIN
12-26-311-010-0000 currently contains multiple unoccupied, neglected commercial structures. Vol. 067
PIN 12-26-311-012-0000 currently contains two unoccupied, neglected structures, with one improvement
being commercial and the other residential. Both parcels have not been occupied for a period in excess of
three (3) years. As mentioned above, the intended use of these parcels is the development of public
parking facilities. These two parcels are located near the business district and across from the municipal
building of the village. Currently, the business district suffers from a profound lack of parking for
owners, businesses and customers within the district. For this reason, the village plans to build a public
parking lot for village employees and the public on these parcels, which in turn would free up space in
the village’s current public parking lot immediately adjacent to the business district. This plan expands
parking available to the owners, employees and patrons of the businesses in the business district. The
village believes that by increasing public parking facilities, the commercial activity of the business
district will be enhanced and greater sales-tax revenues will be generated for both Cook County and the
Village of River Grove. Common Address 8135 West Grand Avenue, River Grove, Illinois, 60171 Vol.
067 PIN 12-26-416-010-0000. This parcel currently consists of an obsolete, neglected unoccupied
restaurant structure, and the improvement consumes the entire parcel with no on-site parking facilities.
This parcel has not been occupied for a period in excess of three (3) years. As mentioned above, the
intended use of this parcel would be the development of public parking facilities. The parcel is situated in
the middle of the Grand Avenue Business Corridor and offers a great opportunity to create additional
public parking to serve the business district. As previously stated, the village believes that by increasing
public parking facilities serving the business district, the commercial activity of the business district will
be enhanced and greater sale-tax revenues will be generated for both Cook County and the Village Rive
Grove. Next, in accordance with the county ordinance, on behalf of the Village of River Grove, I make
the following representations and affirmations in support of the Village’s Request Package: The Village
shall file for tax exempt status on each parcel because the Village intends on retaining these three parcels
for municipal use. There is neither a Third Party Request nor a Third Party Requestor with respect to
these three parcels. The Village shall retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deeds and bear all legal and
other costs associated with acquisition of these three parcels. The Village agrees to submit to the Cook
County Department of Economic Development No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel for five
(5) year or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Cook County Department of Revenue
Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: Funds will be used for equipment and computer supplies needed for the startup of the
Integrated Tax Processing System (ITPS) implementation. Additionally, the Department of Revenue
seeks to further extend exceptional taxpayer services by acquiring translation and interpretation services.
These services will allow the department contract with vendors that will translate tax notices in multiple
languages and provide interpretation support. Last, the department seeks to encumber funds for
LexisNexis Vitalcheck (the credit card processing vendor). Credit card payment processing has increased
due to a surge in taxpayers using credit cards to make payments.

To Account(s): 007-388, $15,000.00; 007-260, $20,000; 007-249, $20,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $55,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
The Integrated Tax Processing System was approved at the September 9th Board meeting. Upon
approval of the project it became apparent that additional computer operation supplies would be
necessary to start implementation of the project. The request for translation and interpretation has
increased greatly in FY 2015. It became apparent at the end of Q3 that funding was needed to secure
these services. In Q3 the department recognized that there was surge in taxpayers paying with credit. To
accommodate the increase in credit card payments the department needs to encumber funds for
LexisNexis (the credit card processing vendor.)
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The department identified areas of efficiencies and process improvements that resulted in unused funds.
The primary account used for transferring was printing.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Originally, the Non Retailer tax was mailed by CCDOR, as of 6/1 the State of Illinois entered into an
agreement with CCDOR to take over the responsibly of collecting this tax. Therefore, CCDOR tax notice
mailings and printing expenses declined greatly.

Summary: During the initial stages of the design process, it was identified that the level and scope of
the renovation would need to increase due to an increase in the quantity of staff for the Public Defender’s
office. The Public Defender’s Office previously occupied floors 7 & 8 with 218 FTE. This project will
expand their operations on the 9th floor to accommodate a total of 276 FTEs. As a result there was a
subsequent impact on building’s systems and necessitated the relocation and rework of
the M.E.P. systems and resulted in notable impacts to project’s scope and budget. This increased the
level of effort for the design team. Additionally, the architect has been tasked with providing a standard
template and performance specifications for all furniture and finishes for the CCAB/ George Leighton
Building, these templates and specifications will be utilized for future.
This contract was awarded through a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process in accordance with the
Cook County Procurement Code. RADA Architects Ltd was selected based on established evaluation
criteria.

Total Amount of Transfer: $400,000.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
Upon finalization of the County Clerk’s 2016 budget it became apparent that funds would not be
available to purchase necessary electronic pollbook equipment. The balance at that time on 9/25/15 was
$65,973.00. Thirty days prior on 8/26/15 the balance was $90,152.00.
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The electronic pollbook computer equipment will increase voter throughput in the precincts. This
the value of both decreasing paper and personnel that would otherwise be necessary. Therefore
election judge and printing funds were obvious choices.

the account that funds are transferred from.
None.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The election judge account was budgeted for an anticipated primary election size of up to 400 precincts.
In fact there were 36 precincts where a primary election was conducted. Those anticipated labor costs
never materialized. Similarly, the paper necessary to conduct a larger election weren't needed.

Summary: Please be advised that I am the Assistant Corporation Counsel for the Village of Hoffman
Estates. We are requesting that a No Cash Bid be made on behalf of Village of Hoffman Estates for the
following property. This request package contains 1 PIN. This property is the Brookside pond that currently
has no legal property owner. It is a retention pond used for Village drainage and is in Schaumburg
Township. It has been vacant since 1993, and not been maintained; it is dirty and foul smelling and is
continuing to create an erosion problem for the adjoining residential properties, with many of the trees that
surround the pond now falling into the water. The Village would like to clean and maintain the pond and
attempt to prevent further erosion onto the adjacent properties. This would be of great benefit to the
residents and the Village of Hoffman Estates. The
Village will file for a tax exempt status for this property as we will retain the property for municipal use;
there is no Third Party Request regarding the subject parcel.

Summary: The Village of Streamwood, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests that the County make a
no-cash bid for the following parcel. This Request Package contains one (1) PIN. The Property is located
at 160 Roma Jean Parkway, Streamwood, Illinois 60107. The Property is a vacant wooded lot. The Village
seeks to acquire the Property and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a future proposal by a
developer. The lots on both sides of the Property are owned by the Village of Streamwood. By acquiring
the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village will benefit by owning a single
contiguous property creating a greater number of alternatives for future development thereon.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of a certificate of
purchase for, or perfected tax deed to, the Property to such developer, organization, or private party. The
Village authorizes and directs the Village attorneys to obtain the tax deed to this property. The Village
will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village agrees to submit
an annual report on the status of this parcel for five (5) years or until development is complete, whichever
occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance, to the Cook County Bureau of
Economic Development.

Summary: The Village of Wheeling, (the “Village”) has targeted five locations within the Village for
vacant land redevelopment or for the use for municipal purposes. In the interest of utilizing these properties
for said purposes, the Village is seeking title to the following tax delinquent properties and requests that the
Cook County Board of Commissioners submit a No Cash Bid for all five properties on behalf of the Village.
This Request Package contains the five (5) PINs which are vacant parcels of abandoned land at 857, 837,
817, and 802 Colonial Drive and 896 Valley Stream Drive. The Village has determined the land to be
undevelopable, but acquiring them could help aid in the development of four parcels nearby (two Village
owned parcels on Elmhurst Road and two privately owned parcels at the west end of Colonial Drive). The
land would be used by the Village for storm water management and parking to increase the financial
feasibility of developing the four adjacent parcels that are out of the flood plain. Acquisition of the parcels
will also allow the Village to address ongoing issues of creek maintenance and public safety (the police
regularly have complaints regarding the overgrown lots). In addition, there is a good possibility of making
a connection to a park to the west. The Village does not, at the present time, have a Third Party Request
by a developer, organization or other private party, in which the Village would convey a certificate of
purchase or the perfected tax deed of the above-listed PINs to that Third Party Requestor. The Village will
file for tax exempt status as long as it retains the PINs for municipal use, maintaining that status until any
tax deed either or both properties is/are conveyed to a potential developer. The Village agrees to submit, to
the Cook County Department of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each parcel
for five years, or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No
Cash Bid Ordinance. Village of Wheeling will work to obtain the tax deeds and will bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcels.

PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Keith R. Sbiral, AICP, Village Manager, Village of Brookfield
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location:

Village of Brookfield

Volume and Property Index Number:
176, 15-34-221-004-0000; 176, 15-34-221-005-0000
Summary: The Village of Brookfield, Illinois (the “Village”), hereby requests an over-the-counter
no-cash bid for the following parcels. This Request Package contains two (2) PIN’s. The two
above-referenced parcels are collectively referred to herein as the “Property”. The Property is comprised of
two (2) adjacent parcels located at 3415 Maple Avenue, Brookfield, Illinois 60513. The Property is a
dilapidated parking lot. No structures exist on the Property. In October of 2014, by means of the Cook
County No-Cash Bid Program, the Village acquired title to the parcel immediately south of the requested
Property, which is improved with an unoccupied and dilapidated single-story commercial structure formerly
used as a bowling alley. The Village seeks to acquire and hold the Property for redevelopment pending a
future proposal by a yet-to-be-determined developer for commercial use of the Property and adjacent parcel.
Acquisition of the Property through the Cook County No-Cash Bid Program will benefit the Village by
increasing the potential for a commercial development on the Property, and the adjacent parcel owned by
the Village, by providing a larger contiguous parcel and adequate off-street parking. Commercial
development of the Property will benefit the Village by increasing the Village’s property tax base and by
offering additional employment opportunities to local residents.
If the Village is successful in acquiring the Property through the No-Cash Bid Program, it will file for tax
exempt status and will maintain the Property as tax exempt until such time as it is conveyed to a third party
for development. The Village represents that there currently exists no Third Party Request by a developer,
organization, or other private party which would result in the Village’s conveyance of certificates of
purchase for, or perfected tax deeds to, the Property to such a developer, organization, or private party.
The Village will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of these parcels. The Village
agrees to submit an annual report on the status of these parcels for five (5) years or until development is
complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County No-Cash Bid Ordinance, to the Cook
County Bureau of Economic Development, 69 West Washington Street, Suite 2900, Chicago, Illinois
60602.

It is the intention of the Village of Burnham to use all parcels for the commercial redevelopment of the
areas in which the parcels are located. The commercial redevelopment of the parcels will return the property
to a viable use beneficial to the municipality. The commercial redevelopment will also return the properties
to a tax producing status, thereby generating economic development for the municipality and other taxing
bodies. The Village of Burnham, at this time, does not have an immediate intention to convey any Tax
Certificate of Purchase from Cook County or any perfected deed to any Third Party Requestor. Also, the
Village of Burnham will accept an assignment of all Tax Certificates of Purchase from Cook County and
will undertake such legal proceedings and tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax deed and will
bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the Village of Burnham
agrees to submit, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status
of each parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the
Cook County No Cash Bid Ordinance. Finally, the Village of Burnham will file for tax exempt status on
all parcels obtained and will retain such status until such time as the parcel is conveyed.

Summary: I am delighted to submit this letter of request for the City of Harvey’s interest in Cook
County’s No Cash Bid Program to the Cook County Board of Commissioners. There are a total of 79
Parcels listed in our request and they are as follows. As indicated in Resolution 2772 and amended in
Resolution 2775, the City of Harvey requests 79 parcels of land for the redevelopment of our major
thoroughfares and Downtown Business District areas.
The City will retain legal counsel and pay all costs for tax deeds. Currently, the City has no “Third Party
Requestors.” The City will report as required to the Cook County Bureau Economic Development annually
from the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed or whichever comes
last. The City will file for tax exempt status for PINs which will be used for municipal purposes or
maintain the status until tax deed(s) are conveyed to developers. If a City of Harvey lien is cleared by the
no cash bid, the City agrees to this in that the future redevelopment is more valuable to the City than the
cost of the municipal lien. If a Cook County lien is on a parcel, the City agrees to reinstate the lien after
the tax sale for the County with an intergovernmental agreement to be recorded.
