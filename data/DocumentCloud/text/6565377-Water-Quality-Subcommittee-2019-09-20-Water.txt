 Presentation / Discussion Items
Quarterly Update: 208 Plan Development Process
Ms. Pamela Davis provided an update on the 208 Plan development process. She stated that
NOACA is a water quality management agency and is required to maintain and update the
region’s 208 Plan.
Ms. Davis stated that a working group of regional stakeholders and technical experts helped
NOACA staff develop the content for the 208 Plan. She provided an overview of the two outreach
questionnaires that were created by NOACA staff: Decision Maker Questionnaire and 208 Public
Questionnaire. Ms. Davis explained how the two questionnaires were distributed throughout the
region.
Ms. Davis stated that the next steps involve staff doing the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Compiling the responses from the Decision Maker Questionnaire
Distributing the “208 Public” Questionnaire
Planning/scheduling public outreach meetings
Summarizing input from the questionnaires
Incorporating feedback into the draft 208 Plan
Presenting a summary of questionnaire feedback and draft 208 Plan to the Water Quality
Subcommittee in September 2019

NOACA’s 208 Plan Current FPA Modification Policies
Mr. Joe MacDonald stated that NOACA is a Water Quality Management Agency and is required
to maintain and update the region’s 208 Plan. Federal wastewater permits and funding cannot
conflict.
Mr. MacDonald provided an overview of facility planning areas (FPA). He stated that FPA
boundary and prescription modifications must be approved by the NOACA Board of Director. He
mentioned that 53 FPA modifications have been approved since 2009, of which 42% were for
new development. He stated that there are currently seven (7) policies to ensure consistency
within the 208 Plan principles. The policies provide an opportunity for comment from the affected
jurisdictions within the proposed modification area and guide NOACA staff, committees and Board
of Directors.
Mr. MacDonald provided an overview of the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Criteria considered under the current policies
Impacts and planning documents not explicitly considered under the current policies
Focus Group Relevant FPA Policy recommendations
Wastewater Decision Maker Questionnaire responses related to whether a proposed FPA
modification would further increase urban sprawl
Urban Sprawl FPA Modification Policy discussion takeaways from the Policy Committee

Mr. MacDonald stated that NOACA staff will continue to review the Urban Sprawl FPA
Modification Policy issue; develop potential criteria and structure for the policy; and present
information at the Policy Committee meeting in July 2019.

8255c
1-2

 Mr. MacDonald welcomed input from the Subcommittee on the criteria NOACA could or should
utilize to evaluate urban sprawl and development impacts; provide the needed information for the
NOACA Board to determine if urban sprawl impacts are relevant; and address questions or
concerns with the policy.
Mr. Greenland commented on the need to make smart decisions as development issues occur;
the need for facilitating development; consider long-term costs as well as the initial cost; maintain
facilities long term; address various issues, such as intercommunity issues (storm or sanitary
related); and consider the lack of capacity and rectification of issues.
Mr. MacDonald mentioned that the language in the policy is very analogous to asset management
in how the region utilizes and maintains the existing infrastructure to its fullest capacity as opposed
to building new infrastructure. He noted that there are a lot of parallels between transportation
asset management and wastewater / water management infrastructure.
Ms. Sarli stated that sewer infrastructure asset management is important, should probably be
looked at next by NOACA, and should be a high priority. She said one of NOACA’s main goals
is to preserve existing infrastructure.
Mr. MacDonald stated that it comes down to cost. He noted that fewer and fewer people are
maintaining the infrastructure and if something is not done, the region is going to be in financial
dire straits and the 12-county region studied by NEOSCC is going to be in the red. He talked
about development inefficiency. He noted that it is inefficient to keep spreading out when there
are fewer people and there is excess capacity, which makes it more expensive to maintain the
infrastructure.
Mr. Klaiber expressed some concern that NOACA may be going down a trail it cannot defend.
He mentioned that in Lorain County, townships have tried to control growth through zoning and
every time an issue ends up in court, the developer prevails and ends up expanding.
In response to Mr. Klaiber’s comment, Engineer Gills said the only way to control that method is
to win more cases in court and put up enough roadblocks so the developer will walk away.
Engineer Gills noted that some developers will build anyway even if they are taken to court. He
commented that some issues can become political when trying to get communities to work
together, come to an agreement, and share facilities, which is difficult to do. He noted that
NOACA may encounter some real problems if it leans on urban sprawl as a decision maker.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the issue of sprawl surfaced with the Medina County-Wadsworth FPA
boundary modification request that was presented to the Board for approval late last year.
Ms. Gallucci provided background on the issue between the two parties and noted that some
Board members were concerned about the impact of urban sprawl and asked staff to explain why
sprawl was not included in the criteria when staff evaluates FPA boundaries. The Board
requested that sprawl be considered when staff is gathering information, so decisions regarding
the impact of an FPA boundary on urban sprawl can be made by the Board.
Ms. Lis asked if any other planning agencies are addressing the issue of sprawl. She also asked
if NOACA envisions the Board making a recommendation or making a decision.
Ms. Gallucci stated that sprawl will be one of many pieces of information the Board will consider
when recommending or not recommending an FPA boundary modification. She said she did not
8255c
1-3

 get the impression that the issue would be based on a yes or no decision and that the Policy
Committee will study the issue and make a recommendation to the full Board.
Ms. Gallucci said she did not know to what extent it would be permissible to have sprawl part of
a consideration and did not know if Ohio EPA would allow for that consideration. She noted,
however, that Ohio EPA made it clear, the consideration would be a local decision. Ohio EPA did
not indicate they would prohibit or support NOACA in its effort to include sprawl in the
consideration, but NOACA would have to present the consideration to Ohio EPA.
Mr. Akin stated that Ohio EPA gives each areawide in the state leeway on how they set up their
208 Plan. He noted that Wayne County wants to keep the rural identity in place and has very
aggressively used the 208 Plan to limit the expansion of sanitary sewers, thereby limiting urban
sprawl. He stated that when he worked at the Northeast Ohio Four County Regional Planning
and Development Organization (NEFCO) there was no thumbs up or thumbs down from Ohio
EPA with respect to policies. He noted that Ohio EPA would have to see what NOACA proposes
before sign-off. He mentioned that Wayne County has used the 208 Plan to limit urban sprawl
and Ohio EPA has enforced it by approving or denying FPA permit requests.
Mr. Akin stated that, through his research, he has not found the other areawide agencies in the
state that include urban sprawl in their criteria (or have an urban sprawl policy).
Reports / Updates
Watershed Activities Update (Roundtable Discussion)
Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD)
Mr. Greenland provided the following update:
•

NEORSD will be holding a press conference at Settlers Landing on June 22, 2019, at

8255c
1-4

 The Chagrin River Watershed Partners (CRWP), in partnership with Cuyahoga Soil and Water
Conservation District (SWCD), received a Coastal Management Assistance Grant that will be
used for Nonpoint Source Implementation Strategy Planning.
Ms. Orndorff mentioned that she is planning to do five Nonpoint Source Implementation Strategic
(NPS-IS) Plans that consist of Arcola Creek and four watersheds/subwatersheds (HUC-12) of the
Lower Grand River. She stated that work was done previously in four Lake County watersheds
that drain into Lake Erie and have been endorsed. She mentioned that stream restorations,
floodplain restorations, and green infrastructure projects are being done. Ms. Orndorff mentioned
that the five plans she is working on need to be completed by December 2019; once those plans
have been endorsed, the restoration projects can be done.
Old Business
NOACA Board Action on June 14, 2019
Mr. Akin stated that the Board approved Resolution 2019-035: Geauga County FPA – Prescription
for Wastewater Treatment Modification in Chardon Township. Mr. Akin provided background on
the FPA modification request that involves transferring 124 parcels (141 acres) and changing the
prescription from “no sewer service” to “may be sewered.”
Update on the Elyria FPA – Avon Lake / LORCO Phase I FPA Modification Request along
Grafton Road in Eaton Township
Mr. Akin stated NOACA staff met with Lorain County Administrator James Cordes and his staff to
discuss the County’s objections to the proposed FPA modification along Grafton Road in Eaton
Township. Mr. Akin conveyed that Mr. Cordes agreed to discuss a sanitary sewer flow agreement
with Lorain County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO) for the proposed FPA modification area
and other nearby areas in Eaton and Carlisle Townships. Mr. Akin said LORCO Executive
Director Gene Toy also agreed to discuss a flow agreement with Lorain County. He explained
that NOACA staff will organize a meeting between the two entities to discuss the flow
agreement.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Water Quality Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Transfer of one (1) parcel from the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake County FPA in City of Willoughby

ACTION REQUESTED
The Water Quality Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Planning and
Programming Committee for placement on the Board of Directors’ December 2019 meeting agenda.
Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (5.4 acres) from the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake
County FPA in the City of Willoughby.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ridgewood Green Subdivision is proposed at the former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of
Mentor and Willoughby. The majority of the 55.2-acre development will be within the City of Mentor and the
Lake County Facility Planning Area (FPA), but 5.4 acres will extend into the City of Willoughby and the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. Both municipalities have approved the project.
The approved subdivision plan calls for Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) to provide sewer
service. However, the portion of the development within the City of Willoughby is not within the Lake
County FPA (Attachment A). With the current FPA boundary location, LCDU future sewer connections
within the City of Willoughby are inconsistent with NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All sanitary
sewer connections must be within the FPA of the WWTP that treats the wastewater. Under the federal
Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a project that conflicts with NOACA’s
208 Plan.
The FPA boundary modification is needed so the entire subdivision can be served by gravity sewers that
will flow to the LCDU sanitary sewer line along Mentor Avenue in the City of Mentor (Attachment B). The
developer investigated the extension of the City of Willoughby sewers to serve the portion of the subdivision
within the City of Willoughby. However, the nearest sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road would require a
pump station for the homes to connect to the sewer. This option was determined not to be feasible due to
the small number of homes planned for that portion of the subdivision. The Willoughby sewer line along
Gardenside Drive to the west of the subdivision has limited capacity and the Willoughby City Engineer
recommended against adding additional flow to that sewer.
The affected jurisdictions are the City of Willoughby and Lake County. The City of Eastlake is a co-owner of
the Willoughby-Eastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) which serves the Willoughby-Eastlake
FPA. All three (3) jurisdictions submitted letters of support for the FPA modification request, which fulfills
the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.

4-1

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Reqrrestfor Faciligl Planning Area Change
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision

Dear Mr. Benin, Mayor Morley and Mayor Fiala:

Please accept this correspondence in response to a rennest to a proposed change in sewer Service for the
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision located in the City of Willoughby.

We are in receipt of the formal request from the property owner, Bedaos, LLC to each party dated

May 2019. The Lake County Board of Commissioners understands that the subdivision lies Within
Willoughby-Eastlake Facility Planning Area (FPA) for sanitary sewer service, but the Lake County Sewer
System can more economically serve the proposed subdivision. The Lake County sanitary sewer system
has the capacity for the additional flow.

Based on this understanding, the Lake County Board of Commissioners has no objection and supports
this change in service ?rst will best meet the needs of our community.

Respectfully,

ouy?ortnn OMMISSIONERS

RE: Request for Proposed Faciltiy Planning Area (FPA) Amendment
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision - Willoughby Mentor
Bedados. LLC
Letter of Support

Dear Ms. Schwickerath:

Reference is made to your letter with attachments dated 'April 24, 2019. detailing a new subdivision
located in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby and in specific, the proposed point of connection
for the new sanitary sewers to service the subdivision.

It is understood from the documents provided that of the 119 lots in the subdivision, 112 lots exist
within the Lake County Utilities Department FPA while the remaining 7 exist in the
Willoughby?Eastiake FPA. It is further understood that having considered several alternates, the
best and most effective way to service the 7 lots would be to have them connected to sewers in the
LCUD FPA. To effect the best alternative requires that the 7 lots be placed under the auspices of
the LCUD FPA.

As a community within the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA, The City of Eastlake by copy of the letter
offers its support in favor of the proposed change in FPA for the aforementioned 7 lots. Should
additional documentation or legislation related to this matter be required, please contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mayor Dennis Morley

 Staff Comments:
A new residential development, Ridgewood Greens Subdivision, is planned for the
former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby. The
majority of the development, 112 out of 119 single family lots, is within the City of
Mentor. The remaining seven (7) lots will be in the City of Willoughby. Both
municipalities have approved the subdivision.
The approved development plans show the homes served by gravity sanitary sewers
connected to the existing Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) sewer line along
Mentor Avenue. This sewer line is within the Lake County FPA. However, the portion of
the proposed subdivision within the City of Willoughby is in the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA
and not the Lake County FPA. Under the federal Clean Water Act, sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the plant that treats the sewage. Therefore, the
portion of the development within the City of Willoughby needs to be transferred into the
Lake County FPA in order to be served by LCDU sewers.
Alternative sewer plans to maintain the existing FPA boundary were considered.
However, the existing City of Willoughby sanitary sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road
is not deep enough to serve the seven (7) proposed lots within the City of Willoughby. A
pump station would be needed to connect these parcels to the sewer along Johnnycake
Ridge Road, but would not be cost effective with so few lots. The City of Willoughby
sewer line along Gardenside Drive to the west is not a viable sewer option because of
existing capacity issues, according to the Willoughby City Engineer.
The current Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) allow for sanitary
sewer connections to the proposed site, so no change is required.
The affected jurisdictions are Lake County and the City of Willoughby. Both jurisdictions
support the proposed FPA modification. The City of Eastlake co-owns the WilloughbyEastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) and is also in support of the request.
The FPA modification notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of NOACA’s Clean Water
2000 Plan (208 Plan) have been fulfilled.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the proposed FPA boundary modification between
the Lake County FPA and Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. The Lake County sanitary sewer
line along Mentor Avenue can serve the entire proposed subdivision with gravity sewers.
The nearest sanitary sewers within the City of Willoughby are either not deep enough to
provide gravity sewer service to the new lots or do not have the capacity for additional
flow from the subdivision.

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District (NEORSD) – Heights Hilltop FPA Boundary and Prescriptions Modification in
the Village of Moreland Hills

ACTION REQUESTED
The Water Quality Subcommittee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Planning and
Programming Committee for placement on the Board of Directors’ December 2019 meeting agenda.
Specifically, the item will:
•

Add four (4) parcels (6.9 acres) currently not within an FPA to the NEORSD – Heights Hilltop FPA;
and

•

Change the Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) for the parcels within the
proposed modification area to make sanitary sewer connections consistent with the Clean Water 2000
Plan (208 Plan).

BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
An area on the southeast corner of State Route 91 (Som Center Road) and Hiram Trail in the Village of
Moreland Hills has been subdivided twice since 2014 to create four (4) lots. Three (3) of the lots are along
Hiram Trail and are undeveloped residential properties. The fourth lot has an existing home that is served
by an on-site sewage treatment system. A condition of the lot splits imposed by the Village of Moreland
Hills was any new development would connect to sanitary sewers. However, NOACA’s 208 Plan shows the
four (4) lots are not currently within an FPA and have a Prescription that does not allow for sanitary sewer
connections (Attachment A). The extension of sanitary sewers to these lots is not consistent NOACA’s
current 208 Plan. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a
sanitary sewer extensions that conflicts with NOACA’s 208 Plan.
The Village of Moreland Hills requested an FPA modification to transfer the parcels into the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA and change the Prescriptions within the modification area to “sewers expected within 20
years” (Attachment B). The proposed changes would make sanitary sewer connections for all four (4)
parcels consistent with NOACA’s 208 Plan and fulfill the lot split approval condition for the three (3)
undeveloped parcels along Hiram Trail.
The affected jurisdictions are the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both support the proposed FPA
modification request which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.

4 - 13

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Facilities Planning Area (FPA) Modification Moreland Hills
Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer Extension

Dear Ms. Gallucci:

On August 7, 2019, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) received a request
seeking support for the proposed modification of the NEORSD Heights-Hilltop Facilities Planning
Area (FPA) with the addition of four (4) parcels along Hiram Trail and SOM Center Road in
Moreland Hills (see attached parcel list and map).

Based on the information submitted with the request, Moreland Hills is proposing to extend a
sanitary sewer along Hiram Trail in order to facilitate new development on three (3) of the
parcels. The area tributary to the Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer extension is already within
service area. Therefore, we concur with the proposed FPA modification.

If you have any questions or if you should need additional information, please contact Mary
Maciejowski at (216) 881-6600, ext. 6466.

Sincerely,

Mi 

Kyle Dreyfuss-We ls,

 Staff Comments:
The Village of Moreland Hills requests an FPA Boundary and Prescription modification in
order to allow four (4) parcels along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail to connect to
sanitary sewers. The area was originally a single parcel that was split into four (4)
parcels in 2014 and 2018. The three new parcels along Hiram Trail are not yet
developed. A condition of the lot split approval from the Village of Moreland Hills was
that newly constructed homes would connect to sanitary sewers. The proposed FPA
modification area is currently not within an FPA and has the Prescription of “area served
by on-site systems” which does not allow for extension of sanitary sewers.
The FPA modification area is within the sanitary sewer service agreement area between
the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both entities support the proposed transfer.
Staff Disposition:
Staff recommend approval of the proposed FPA modifications to extend the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail. The FPA Boundary and
Prescription changes will allow for sanitary sewers to serve three newly split parcels
along Hiram Trail. Both the Village and NEORSD are in support of the FPA modification.

RE:

208 Plan Stakeholder & Public Outreach Efforts

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA staff presented two draft questionnaires at the March 2019 Water Quality Subcommittee (WQS)
meeting.
NOACA staff distributed its “Questionnaire for Wastewater Decision Makers and
Representatives of Designated Management Agencies, Local Health Districts and Affected
Jurisdictions” to 96 targeted communities and designated management agencies (DMAs). On May 13,
2019, NOACA staff posted the questionnaire online and sent an email invite to targeted respondents
from the 96 communities and DMAs. In May and June, NOACA staff followed up with emails and phone
calls to community and DMA representatives that had not yet responded. On July 1, 2019, NOACA
staff closed the questionnaire; representatives from 69 of the 96 target communities completed the
questionnaire (72% response rate). The questionnaire’s raw responses and summary of the
methodology will be included in the final 208 Plan. Response highlights include:
•
•

Of the 25 respondents that initiated or led an FPA modification process through NOACA, the
majority (64%) indicated the process was somewhat or very long; and
The responses suggest that the regions’ wastewater treatment planning is driven more by
immediate needs (development or public health concerns) than by comprehensive, long-term
planning.

On August 20, NOACA staff opened the online “208 Public” Questionnaire. NOACA staff distributed
this questionnaire to 208 Plan stakeholder agencies to share with their constituents. This questionnaire
will remain open through October 31, 2019, to allow access while NOACA holds public meetings on the
208 Plan. NOACA staff has worked with local stakeholders to co-host public meetings in each of
NOACA’s five counties. NOACA has also developed a flyer (see Attachment A) to publish the meeting
dates, times and locations. The public meeting agendas include a short presentation on NOACA’s 208
planning responsibilities and local coordination efforts, followed by the presentation of chapter specific
components at six information stations staffed by NOACA and local stakeholders. Feedback from each
public meeting will be included in the final 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
5-1

 NOACA staff will host 208 Plan public meetings; manage responses from the 208 Public Questionnaire;
and summarize feedback to incorporate in the final 208 Plan. A final draft 208 Plan will be presented
to the Water Quality Subcommittee in December 2019.

NOACA Water Quality Subcommittee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 13, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Transfer of thirty-nine (39) parcels
from the Lorain County FPA to the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) –
Southwest FPA in Columbia Township

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested. This item is for information and discussion.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Lorain County Sanitary Engineer intends to provide sanitary sewers to parcels with frontage to East
River Road and Sprague Road in Columbia Township. The proposed sewer service area contains 39
parcels (121.25 acres), and NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan) shows this area currently within
the Lorain County FPA (Attachment A). The Engineer plans to direct the wastewater flow from this area to
an existing Lorain County pump station near the corner of Redfern Road and East River Road. This pump
station sends the wastewater directly to the NEORSD Southwest Interceptor sewer.
However, for the pump station to serve the proposed new service area, the parcels need to be transferred
from the Lorain County FPA to the NEORSD – Southwest FPA (Attachment B). Under the federal Clean
Water Act, all sanitary sewer connections must be within the FPA associated with the wastewater treatment
plant that will serve the area. The existing Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) allow for
the extension of sanitary sewers within this portion of Columbia Township, so no Prescription modifications
are needed.
The proposed FPA modification area includes a mix of existing residential, commercial and undeveloped
properties (Attachment C), and includes the former Riverside Golf Course. The golf course was purchased
by a developer, Riverside Trail LLC, and has an active lawsuit against Columbia Township over the current
zoning (medium density residential) for the property.
The affected jurisdictions are Lorain County, NEORSD and Columbia Township. NEORSD submitted a
letter of support (attached). The letter also states that NEORSD and Lorain County are working to finalize
updates to their existing service agreement to include the proposed FPA modification area. Columbia
Township Board of Trustees (Trustees) submitted a letter that states the township’s legal counsel advised
the Trustees not to comment due to the pending Riverside Trail LLC lawsuit (attached). The Trustees also
requested that NOACA delay consideration of the FPA modification request until the lawsuit is resolved.
Based on the letter form the Trustees, Lorain County Engineer’s Office requested that the proposed FPA
modification be placed as a future action item on the Water Quality Subcommittee agenda.

5-5

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Facilities Planning Area (FPA) Modification Columbia Township
East River Road Sewer Extension

Dear Ms. Gallucci:

On August 2, 2019, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (N EORSD) received a request for
modification of its service area within Columbia Township, for the addition of the 39 parcels on
the south side of Sprague Road and along East River Road (see attached parcel list and map).

Based on the information submitted with the request, Lorain County is seeking modification of
the Southwest Interceptor Facility Planning Area (208 Area) to add the subject
parcels and accommodate development ofthe area. The connection of the East River Sanitary
Sewers extension will be to sewers already within service area.

The NEORSD is working with Lorain County and Columbia Township to finalize service
agreement updates, contingent on approval by our Board of Trustees, and we concur with the
proposed FPA modification.

If you have any questions or if you should need additional information, please contact Mary
Maciejowski at (216) 881-6600, ext. 6466.

RE:

Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) 2020 Green Infrastructure Grant

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested. This item is for information and discussion.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (Sewer District) supports the strategic implementation and longterm maintenance of green infrastructure that protects, preserves, enhances, and restores natural hydrologic
function, including funding green infrastructure projects within the combined sewer area through the Green
Infrastructure Grants (GIG) Program. Green infrastructure refers to stormwater source control measures that
store, filter, infiltrate or evapotranspirate stormwater to increase resiliency of infrastructure by reducing stress
on wetweather drainage and collection system thereby supporting healthy environments and strong
communities.
The GIG Program for the Combined Sewer Area is open to member communities, governmental entities, nonprofit organizations 501(c)(3), or businesses working in partnership with their community in the combined
sewer area interested in implementing water resource projects that remove stormwater from the combined
sewer system and in ensuring the long-term maintenance of the green infrastructure practices.
On September 6, NOACA submitted its proposal for “Net Zero Cool,” a three-phase, comprehensive suite of
stormwater control measures (SCMs) to reduce stormwater runoff from its 100% impervious downtown
Cleveland site and mitigate runoff’s harmful impacts on the Frontal Lake Erie-Doan Brook Watershed.
The objectives and outcomes for Net Zero Cool are embodied in its name. “Net Zero” refers to NOACA’s
ambition to capture stormwater runoff from its impervious surface area and eliminate its contribution to the
combined wastewater/stormwater conveyance system. “Cool” refers to NOACA’s ambition to showcase its
green infrastructure elements with eye-catching, water-themed design; mural and green wall on the sides of
the building; educational placards along the sidewalk, adjacent to a proposed bioretention system and
outdoor classroom space on the green roof for lectures, tours and public meetings. According to the Green
Infrastructure Grants Program Story on the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District’s (NEORSD’s) website,
there were no green infrastructure grants (GIGs) awarded to organizations located in Downtown Cleveland
(inside the Innerbelt, east of the Cuyahoga River) in the years shown (2014, 2016, 2018, 2019). Net Zero
Cool would make NOACA a true vanguard for NEORSD-funded green infrastructure implementation; a
marquee to illuminate the tremendous benefits of green infrastructure in Downtown Cleveland.

5 - 13

 NOACA procured a design/engineering team to explore opportunities through site visits, preliminary design
proposals and stormwater modeling. NOACA will release an RFP to hire a design-build firm, conditional on
NEORSD funding, in mid-September. NEORSD will announce GIG awards in November and funded
projects will begin January 1, 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA may receive a GIG award from NEORSD in November; NOACA has committed a 20% match of total
project costs.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending NEORSD award of funds, NOACA staff will submit a design-build proposal and contract to the
Board for review and approval at its December meeting.

RE:

Water Quality Management Plan (208 Plan) Development Impact Policy for
Proposed Wastewater Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Requests

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
At its January 2019 meeting, the NOACA Policy Committee adopted focus areas. One of
those focus areas was to evaluate the potential inclusion of criteria that would address FPA
boundary changes requested for the purpose of new housing or commercial development.
NOACA staff presented information to the Policy Committee and Water Quality Subcommittee
(WQS) on the current 208 Plan policies that govern FPA modifications. Staff then solicited input
from both bodies on what criteria should be considered or added to the 208 Plan to evaluate
development impacts of FPA modifications. Their feedback directed staff to develop criteria
where development impacts should be a consideration in FPA modification requests, but may or
may not impact the final decision made by the NOACA Board of Directors. Furthermore, any
policy language or criteria included in the 208 Plan will need to be acceptable to Ohio EPA and
legally defensible by NOACA.
The current 208 Plan is undergoing a comprehensive update, including policies relevant to staff
review of FPA modification requests. To further inform the content of the new 208 Plan, a
questionnaire was developed to gather input from wastewater decision makers. The
wastewater decision maker questionnaire included the following question about consideration of
urban sprawl and development impacts in NOACA’s review of FPA modification requests:
Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? During NOACA staff
review of proposed Facility Planning Area (FPA) modifications, staff should
examine whether a proposed modification is primarily driven by new development
and whether that new development would further expand the development
footprint (i.e., increase urban sprawl) in Northeast Ohio.
Of the 67 respondents that answered the question, 39% somewhat or strongly agreed with the
statement, 19% somewhat or strongly disagreed with the statement and 45% were neutral.
Twenty-one (21) of the 26 respondents (81%) who somewhat or strongly agreed with the
statement were from DMAs or communities in Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties, the two most
populated counties in the NOACA region.

5 - 15

 Given the lack of objection, NOACA staff drafted the following FPA modification policy language
and criteria:
Policy Language: The NOACA Board may consider regional development impacts if the
FPA Boundary modification is primarily for new residential or commercial developments.
Development Impact Questions/Criteria:
• Is the modification request primarily for new construction (residential or commercial)?
• Is the modification request area within an U.S. Census Bureau urban area?
• Estimate the number of new homes or structures proposed for construction.
• Estimate the new sanitary sewer infrastructure proposed for constructed to serve the
request modification area (e.g. linear feet of gravity sewers, linear feet of force main
sewers, number of pump stations, etc.).
• Is the proposed sanitary sewer infrastructure expansion part of an asset management
plan?
• Is there conveyance and treatment capacity within the existing sewerage system to
accept the wastewater flow from the modification request?
NOACA staff recommend the policy language be incorporated into the new 208 Plan Policy 4-2:
Modifications to Facility Planning Area Boundaries. The Development Impact Questions/Criteria
are recommended to be added to the FPA Modification Request Packet and Guidelines. The
Packet and Guidelines outline the information that should be provided by the wastewater DMA
for an FPA modification request submitted to NOACA.
WQS input will inform members of the Policy Committee about the inclusion of development
impact policy language and criteria in NOACA’s new 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
None
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will use the input to further refine the FPA modification policies in the new 208 Plan.

RE:

Elyria FPA – Avon Lake/Lorain County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO) Phase I FPA
in Eaton Township, Lorain County Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested. This item is for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Starting in 2017, the City of Elyria and LORCO discussed modifications of the Elyria FPA and Avon
Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I) FPA boundary within Eaton Township to provide current and future sanitary
sewer services. One of the agreed-upon FPA modification areas is along the east side of Grafton Road,
south of State Route (SR) 82/Royalton Road (Attachment A). The City of Elyria requested that all or part of
15 parcels (73.5 acres) within this area be transferred from the Elyria FPA to the Phase I FPA (Attachment
B).
LORCO has an existing sewer line adjacent to or near these parcels that can provide sanitary sewer
service. Property owners along Grafton Road have asked both LORCO and the City of Elyria about
connecting to sanitary sewers. The property located at 12243 Grafton Road is awaiting approval of the FPA
modification in order to connect to LORCO’s sanitary sewers adjacent to the property. Without the FPA
modification, Lorain County Public Health (LCPH) will require the property owner to install a new on-site
discharging sewage treatment system.
On September 4, 2018, Lorain County submitted a letter of opposition to the FPA modification request
based on the County’s intentions to extend sanitary sewers along Grafton Road, south of SR 82/Royalton
Road. On September 7, 2018, NOACA staff requested additional information from Lorain County regarding
the County’s sewer plans for this area, including: a sewer extension timeframe; the location of wastewater
treatment; and other pertinent documents. On February 26, 2019, Lorain County submitted a second letter
to NOACA, which provided some of this requested information.
Since there was no consensus among the affected jurisdictions prior to the March 2019 Water Quality
Subcommittee meeting, NOACA staff proposed a revised FPA modification request that included only the
parcel at 12243 Grafton Road under orders from LCPH. The modified request would have only transferred
that specific property from the Elyria FPA to the Phase I FPA and allowed the homeowner to connect to
LORCO’s sewer line. The rest of the proposed transfer area would have remain unchanged and allowed
NOACA staff to continue to work with the affected jurisdictions to reach an agreement. The City of Elyria
5 - 17

 and LORCO approved of NOACA’s modified request. However, the Water Quality Subcommittee tabled the
request based on the County’s stated objections.
On May 16, NOACA staff met with David Covell and Jill Lis from LCPH to discuss general wastewater
issues and the specific problem at 12243 Grafton Road. They reiterated that the best solution for 12243
Grafton Road is a sanitary sewer connection. LCPH also offered assistance, if needed, to settle any FPA
boundary issue that prevents the implementation of the optimal wastewater treatment solution to resolve a
known issue.
On June 11, 2019, NOACA staff met with Lorain County Administrator Jim Cordes, Lorain County Assistant
Engineer Bob Klaiber and Lorain County’s consulting engineer Matt Witter from K.E. McCartney &
Associates to further discuss Lorain County’s FPA modification objections. Lorain County officials stated
the requested FPA modification in Eaton Township would compromise future sanitary sewer service west of
Grafton Road. If approved, the modification removes potential customers along the east side of Grafton
Road needed to help pay for a sanitary sewer extension. Lorain County also believes that LORCO’s
proposed sanitary sewer connections along the back property line for some of the parcels in the transfer
area would be difficult to maintain and service.
Mr. Cordes recognized there are sanitary sewer needs in Eaton Township. He agreed to discuss a
wastewater treatment flow agreement (flow agreement) with LORCO that would include the proposed FPA
modification area along Grafton Road. He explained that Lorain County and LORCO were already in
negotiations on a flow agreement in Columbia Township.
Lorain County committed to identify area(s) in Eaton Township to be discussed as part of a potential flow
agreement LORCO. LORCO’s Executive Director, Gene Toy, agreed to meet with Lorain County to discuss
an Eaton Township flow agreement. NOACA staff will organize the meeting and act as a mediator, if
needed.
On August 13, 2019, Mr. Klaiber requested the Eaton Township flow agreement meeting with LORCO be
delayed until after the completion of the Lorain County – LORCO flow agreement in Columbia Township.
Mr. Klaiber believed if the Columbia Township flow agreement is approved by Lorain County and LORCO, it
can be used as a template for a similar agreement in Eaton Township along Grafton Road. Mr. Toy agreed
with the delay until after the completion of the Columbia Township flow agreement negotiations.
After the completion of the Columbia Township flow agreement negotiations, NOACA staff will organize a
meeting between Lorain County and LORCO to discuss an Eaton Township flow agreement. NOACA staff
anticipates the need for additional meetings with the other affected jurisdictions after this initial meeting
between Lorain County and LORCO.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary modification to Ohio EPA.
