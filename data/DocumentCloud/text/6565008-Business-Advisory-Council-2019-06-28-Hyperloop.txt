BACKGROUND
WHAT IS HYPERLOOP?

 HYPERLOOP IS
A new mode of transport that will revolutionize travel
by connecting people and goods with unprecedented

SPEED

S A F ET Y

EFFICIENCY

 HyperloopTT
System
Hyperloop brings airplane speeds to
ground level, safely. Passengers and
cargo capsules will hover through a
network of low-pressure tubes between
cities, transforming travel time from
hours to minutes.

BACKGROUND

There has been significant worldwide research and development
regarding the development of a Hyperloop transportation system
The Hyperloop concept operates by sending specially designed "capsules"
or "pods" through a steel tube maintained at a partial vacuum
Allows for the transportation of people and freight at a fraction of the time
currently available through other transportation modes
The Hyperloop concept is being pursued by several private interests
looking to develop initial travel corridors, in coordination and cooperation
with the United States Department of Transportation

 How it works
Fully enclosed environment
protected from weather and
traffic crossing
Electromagnetic
propulsion enables
emission-free transport

Operational costs minimized
through alternative energy and
systems automation

Levitated capsule
reduces friction,
increases efficiency
