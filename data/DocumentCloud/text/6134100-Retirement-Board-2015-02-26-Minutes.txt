The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

For information purposes; Fund staff has started calculating the retros for police officers receiving
benefits that are impacted with the new salary contract, which affects members in receipt of certain
disability benefits and members who retired from July 1, 2012, through the end of 2014. Members
receiving disability will be calculated first.

•

Reporting the hiring of Holly Anderson as a Compliance Officer and Jacqueline Robinson as a
Retirement Counselor/Receptionist Team Leader. Both individuals start employment with the Fund
on Monday March 2, 2015.

•

Review of Health Care deduction for retired/retiring exempt members. In July 2014, the City
requested for retiring sergeants, lieutenants and captains that the pension fund deduct 2% of their
monthly annuity for healthcare premiums. This was negotiated in the respective contracts, and the
Benefits Management Office indicated that it would be in the best interest of the members to have
the premium deducted from their pension checks to avoid any gap in coverage. The Board agreed
to BMO’s request and the administrative procedure was implemented. Fund staff implemented the
request for any with the rank of sergeant or above retiring. It has come to staff’s attention that the
commanders and deputy chiefs, ‘exempts’ are not covered by the captain’s contract. A letter dated
February 24, 2015, from the City, Department of Finance, was distributed to all Board members.
The City is requesting the Fund continue to deduct 2% for healthcare from annuity checks of the
retired and retiring ‘exempts’. The Board agreed to implement such request.

There will be an election for two positions on the Board, the retiree representative and the police
officer, or rank equivalent thereto, representative. Previous discussions were conducted concerning
possible changes to the “Election Rules’. It was agreed that a committee of one appointed trustee
and one elected trustee review the current ‘Election Rules’ and recommend to the Board any
changes for future elections, 2016 and forward.
President Hauser appointed Trustee Hamburger and Trustee Lappe to the Election Rules review
committee.
•

Based upon the recent disability award to Kathleen Antonacci by the Board and the related
requested six month status review, authorization is requested to have the IME completed within the
next several months.
It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Avila that the Board approve an IME on Kathleen
Antonacci.

The last item involves fund policy. Greta Wilson, a disability recipient, was scheduled for an IME.
This member was already examined by the Board’s physician, which resulted in the request and
approval of an IME. Ms. Wilson has not responded to written communication directed to her,
however, the nurse manager from the managed care facility used by the Fund, spoke with her
directly and confirmed the scheduled IME. Ms. Wilson was a no-show at the IME, which incurs a
no-show fee.
After much discussion the Board directed the Executive Director in matters in which a disability recipient
fails to keep an appointment, the fees incurred will be deducted from the next disability payment provided
(1) receipt of written notice is verified; and/or (2) conversations with nurse mangers are confirmed either
written or electronically and placed in the member’s file. If the member can offer a valid reason for
missing an appointment, the fee will be refunded.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT CONCLUDED
All business concluded for this date, February 26, 2015, it was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded
by Trustee Lappe that this meeting be adjourned.
