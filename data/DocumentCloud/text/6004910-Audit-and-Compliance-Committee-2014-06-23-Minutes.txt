**Report from System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (Attachment #1)
Cathy Bodnar, System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer, presented her report containing updates
on the following subjects: Issue Breakdown by Category; Status Report – Work Plan Activities; Inpatient
DRG Project and Review; and Health Information Management Plan. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
Director Velasquez inquired regarding the information provided on reactive Compliance issues; she asked if
Ms. Bodnar could provide the total number of issues that were substantiated. Ms. Bodnar responded that she
can provide that information for this fiscal year at the next Committee meeting1.

**Report from System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (continued)
Ms. Bodnar noted that, as of July 1st, the County MCCN will be in effect. There is a lot of work needed to
be done to build a managed care compliance program; staff are actively working on this, and they are
partnering with the System’s third party administrator (TPA), IlliniCare, and their compliance officer, to
make sure that the full breadth of what is needed for the compliance program is in place on the System’s side
and on the IlliniCare/Centene side, as well. Ms. Bodnar added that, in early 2010, an Audit and Compliance
Committee Charter was developed; this Charter has not been re-evaluated since its creation. She stated that,
at the next Committee meeting, the Charter will be presented for discussion and for determination of whether
or not any additions or modifications are needed2.
Chairman Muñoz noted the importance of the understanding by CountyCare management and staff that the
compliance component resides within this Committee, and that the structure of the compliance has to be built
under Ms. Bodnar’s direct oversight; she will need to have direct oversight of this component, as she reports
to this Committee and Chair on the outcomes of her compliance activities and monitoring.
Ms. Bodnar stated that, internally, the Executive Director of Managed Care, Steven Glass, is well aware of
the relationship that Corporate Compliance has with the Board and this Committee. She stated that he is
extremely supportive, and they speak on a regular basis about compliance. Similarly, with regard to
IlliniCare, she stated that one of the things she has started to do is have regular conference calls with their
compliance officer, Jeffery Torres; she noted that she recently suggested that he attend one of the
Committee’s meetings.
With regard to the information provided on the Coding Assessment, under the Status Report of Work Plan
Activities, Director Collens asked for further information on the consequences of miscoding. John
Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer, stated that the System is paid on a per-diem basis by its largest
payer, Medicaid; in these cases, the code assigned to it does not affect the ultimate payment, but the coding,
if it is inappropriate, could affect the case if it is used to determine that services were not medically
necessary. The System could get a denial on that basis if the coding is inadequate. Under CountyCare,
during the waiver period, the System is paid on a per-member per-month basis (PMPM); that coding needs to
be accurate because that data is used to build the information for negotiation of rates. Medicare pays the
System on the basis of diagnosis-related group (DRG) assignment and that coding; if it is inaccurate, it will
produce the wrong payment. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Clinical
Integration, provided additional information. In addition to affecting the reimbursement of services, which is
important, coding accuracy is also important because it relates to external reporting, both at an institutional
level and on an individual performance level.

IV.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
With regard to the issues described in the Report relating to the CountyCare analysis and financial
reporting, Mr. Cookinham stated that, through the audit process, a lot was learned. He provided
information relating to the audit adjustment to reduce the accrued CountyCare revenue. He stated that the
System receives a payment file and some files that suggest who is eligible from the State. Staff had
originally been told that if people appear on a list in the prior month, then that was paid for in the
subsequent month. For example, when the System received $33 million in December, it was believed that
everything received on that file for November was for 2013, so the $33 million was accrued as a 2013
item. However, when the file was examined, payments for December were included in there, which
would be 2014. As the State resolves the backlog of applications that have been submitted, and the
System has greater history of these things, he believes that the System will have few problems in those
areas in the future.
Mr. Cookinham stated that, given the size of the CountyCare program and its impact on the System’s
finances, this has been an evolutionary process. A lot of improvements have been made over the last year,
and there are areas for improvement. All of the measurement tools need to be in place, and, in any
capitated program, there are also some other controls that have to be put in place. At the Finance
Committee, an initial estimate of the first six months of the operation of CountyCare in 2014 was
presented. As indicated in the Report, the plan is to provide some monthly financial information to the
Finance Committee and to the County, in terms of CountyCare operations.
Chairman Muñoz indicated that, from this Committee’s perspective, he wanted to encourage staff to work
closely with Tom Schroeder, System Director of Internal Audit, to ensure that the internal controls are
fixed and that these new procedures and database systems are aligned to track the data.
Dr. Shannon noted that he believes that the challenges outlined in the Report are going to be one shade
more complex in the current fiscal year; as the System is transitioning from its historical or legacy TPA,
and coming on board for the last five months of the current fiscal year with a new TPA, there are going to
be a lot of moving parts.
Steve Sehy, of McGladrey LLP, reviewed the CCHHS Financial Statements, for the year ended November
30, 2013. During the review, Mr. Cookinham provided additional information regarding the advance of
$30 million from the State of Illinois in 2013. This had been set up for the System to receive some funds
early from the State to help finance this process, because the State was in fact quite far behind in
processing applications. It was always planned that the advance would be returned to the State; the
System returned the $30 million in early June.
Donald Croswell, of Washington, Pittman & McKeever, LLP, reviewed the information relating to the
System contained in the Cook County Single Audit Report on Federal Awards, for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2013. The Committee discussed the information.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Chairman Muñoz, moved to receive and file the reports
contained in Section IV.A. and IV.B. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
At the June 27, 2014 CCHHS Board of Directors Meeting, the Minutes of this Audit and
Compliance Committee Meeting were approved, with the exception of the CCHHS Audited
Financial Statements documents under Section IV.A. That action relating to that item/documents
was deferred. The item/documents under Section IV.A. will be placed on the Agenda of the July
27th Board of Directors Meeting for review and discussion in a closed meeting.
