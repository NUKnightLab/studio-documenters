by this article and the obligation to pay the same is upon the user. The tax imposed by
this article shall be collected from the purchaser by the tax collector as defined by Section
74-271 and remitted to the Department as provided in this article. The tax collector shall
be liable to the County for the amount of tax that it is required to collect. Retailers shall
collect the tax from the users by adding the tax to the selling price of tangible personal
property when sold for use in the County, in the manner prescribed by this article and the
Department. The tax imposed by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct
item separate and apart from the selling price of tangible personal property. The tax
hereby imposed and not paid to a retailer pursuant to this section shall be paid to the
Department directly by any person using such property within the County pursuant to
Section 74-277. If any retailer, in collecting the amount which purports to constitute use
taxes measured by receipts from sales which are subject to tax under this article, collects
more from the purchaser than the actual use tax liability on the transaction, the purchaser
shall have a legal right to claim a refund of such amount from such retailer. However, if
such amount is not refunded to the purchaser for any reason, the retailer is liable to pay
such amount to the Department.
(b)
Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County and making
sales of tangible personal property for use in the County shall, when collecting the tax as
provided in Section 74-272 from the purchaser, give to the purchaser a receipt for such
tax in the manner and form prescribed by the Department. Such receipt shall be sufficient
to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which such receipt may refer.

Department as a retailer under Section 74-275, such purchaser or user shall, by the last
day of calendar month in which such purchase was made, file and return with the
Department and pay the tax due under this article.
(b)
When tangible personal property is purchased by a lessor, which is
subject to a lease for one year or longer, executed or in effect at the time of purchase, to
an interstate carrier for hire, where such lessor did not pay the tax imposed by this article
to the retailer at the time of purchase, such lessor shall, by the last day of the calendar

A purchaser or user who is liable to pay use tax directly to the
Department only occasionally and not on a frequent recurring basis and who is not
required to file returns with the Department as a retailer under Section 74-275 concerning
the filing of regular monthly tax returns and all provisions concerning the requirements of
registrants to post bond or other security with the Department shall apply to such
purchasers or users; except that such a purchaser or user shall not be entitled to the two
percent discount provided in Section 74-275 on any remittance, when such purchaser or
user could have paid the tax to the retail seller of the property who was a registered tax
collector for the County, instead of remitting the use tax directly to the Department.
Sec. 74-273.

Transactions not subject to tax.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, uses of tangible personal
property, as defined in Section 74-271, which are exempt under the applicable provisions

Retailer registration; security.

(a)
Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County shall apply
for registration as a tax collector with the Department no later than 30 days after
commencing such business or 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance from
which this article is derived, whichever occurs later. Application for registration shall be
made to the Department by use of the form furnished by the Department for such purpose
and shall contain such information as the Department may reasonably require.
(b)
The Department may require an applicant for registration to furnish,
within 30 days after commencing to engage in the business of selling tangible personal
property at retail, a bond from a surety company authorized to do business in the State, or
a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or certificate of deposit, conditioned
upon the applicant paying to the County all moneys becoming due under this article. The
Department shall fix the amount of any such security in each case, taking into
consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this
article. The amount of any security required by the Department shall be as such as, in the
Department's opinion, will protect the County against failure to pay the amount which
may become due from the applicant under this article. The amount of any security
required by the Department shall not exceed three times the amount of the applicant's
average monthly tax collection and remittance liability or $50,000.00, whichever amount
is lower. A retailer that fails to furnish security required by the Department in accordance
with this section shall not be permitted to register as a tax collector.

A tax collector which has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and
continuously complied with the conditions of its bond or other security under the
provisions of this article for a period of three consecutive years, shall be entitled to a
release of the bond or other security and shall be exempt from all requirements of
furnishing a bond or other security as a condition precedent to registration under this
article. Such exemption shall continue until such time as the Department shall determine
that the tax collector is delinquent in the filing of any return or is delinquent or deficient
in the paying of any tax under this article.
(d)
With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the Department
may sue in the event of a forfeiture), if a tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount
whose payment such security guarantees, the Department shall, after such liability is
admitted by the tax collector or established by the Department through issuance of a final
assessment that has become final under the law, convert or cause to be converted the
security which the tax collector has furnished, into money for the County after first giving
the tax collector ten-days' written notice by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability
or forfeit such security to the Department. If the security consists of a bank certificate of
deposit, the Department shall convert the security into money by demanding and
collecting the amount of such bank certificate of deposit from the bank which issued the
certificate. If the Department realizes more than the amount of such liability from the
security, plus the expenses incurred by the Department in converting the security into
money, the Department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such
security and the balances thereby received on behalf of the County shall be paid into the
corporate fund of the County.
(e)
A retailer maintaining a place of business in the County who fails to
register as required in this article shall be guilty of violating this article and shall be fined
$1,000.00 for each offense. Each sale at retail conducted by an unregistered retailer shall

supplying data to the Department. However, the discount herein provided shall not be
allowed for any taxes not paid when due. All such discounts shall be credited against the
tax collector's liabilities under this article. Refunds to purchasers made by the retailer
during any return period shall be allowed as a credit on the next period return filed, but
only if the retailer included the receipts from such sale in a return filed and remitted the
tax imposed by this article with respect to such receipts.
(d)
The Director may require any tax collector to prepare and file an annual
information return on the form prescribed by the Department, within 15 days after the tax
collector files its annual income tax return with the State for such fiscal year. Such annual
return to the Department shall include a statement of receipts as shown on the retailer's
State income tax return. If the total receipts of the business as reported in the State
income tax return do not agree with the receipts reported to the Department for the same
period, the retailer shall attach to its annual return a schedule showing a reconciliation of
the two amounts and state reasons for the differences. The retailer's annual return to the
Department shall also disclose such additional reasonable information as the Department
shall require to enable the Department to determine the accuracy of any periodic return
filed by such retailer as provided by this section.
(e)
Where the tax collector is a corporation, all returns filed on behalf of
such corporation shall be signed by the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer or

violation. Any person, who files a return with false or misleading information or signs or
certifies such return, shall be guilty of violating this article and shall be subject to a fine
of $1,000.00 for each such violation. The return form prescribed by the Department shall
include a statement that any person signing such return may be subject to the penalties
provided in this article.

number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The Department

used to make a use tax-free purchase when the purchaser in fact is not a purchaser for
resale, or where the purchaser has discontinued making resales of property. Except as
provided in this section, no use shall be made tax-free on grounds of the retailer's sale
being a sale for resale unless the purchaser has an active County registration number or

the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, whichever occurs later. Application
for registration shall be made to the Department by use of the form furnished by the Department for such
purpose and shall contain such information as the Department may reasonably require.

company authorized to do business in the State, or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or
certificate of deposit, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the County all moneys becoming due
under this article. The Department shall fix the amount of any such security in each case, taking into
consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The
amount of any security required by the Department shall be as such as, in the Department's opinion, will
protect the County against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this
article. The amount of any security required by the Department shall not exceed three times the amount of
the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remittance liability or $50,000.00, whichever amount is
lower. A retailer that fails to furnish security required by the Department in accordance with this section
shall not be permitted to register as a tax collector.

of three consecutive years, shall be entitled to a release of the bond or other security and shall be exempt
from all requirements of furnishing a bond or other security as a condition precedent to registration under
this article. Such exemption shall continue until such time as the Department shall determine that the tax
collector is delinquent in the filing of any return or is delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax
under this article.
(d)
With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the Department may sue in the
event of a forfeiture), if a tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security
guarantees, the Department shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the
Department through issuance of a final assessment that has become final under the law, convert or cause
to be converted the security which the tax collector has furnished, into money for the County after first
giving the tax collector ten-days' written notice by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or
forfeit such security to the Department. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the
Department shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank
certificate of deposit from the bank which issued the certificate. If the Department realizes more than the
amount of such liability from the security, plus the expenses incurred by the Department in converting the
security into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such

196

(Recessed and Reconvened February 16, 2011)
Chief Financial Officer shall determine that the proceeds of such sales are needed and on

maturities thereof at a price or prices in excess of the principal amount thereof.
Subsequent to the sale of the Note or subsequent to the sale of any portion thereof, the
Chief Financial Officer shall file in the office of the County Clerk a Note Order directed
to the Board identifying (i) the terms of the sale, (ii) the amount, if any, of the Note being

or direction by the Board.
Section 2.6.
Use of Proceeds: The proceeds of the Note shall be used to provide
funds for the payment of necessary expenses incurred for the general corporate purposes
of the County and to that end shall be set aside in the Working Cash Fund (the “Working
Cash Fund”) and shall be used to pay the general corporate expenses of the County in
accordance with customary disbursement procedures of the County. Alternatively, the
Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Note to one or more other funds
or accounts of the County now in existence. The County by its Board reserves the right,
as it becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of the
Working Cash Fund or its accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations
between expenditures and to substitute projects, in order to meet current needs of the
County; subject, however, to the provisions of the tax covenants of the County relating to
the Tax Exempt status of interest on the Note if it is issued as Tax Exempt.
Section 2.7.
General Tax Covenants: In the event that the Note is issued as Tax
Exempt, the provisions of this Section shall apply. The County covenants that it will take
no action with respect to the proceeds of the Note which would result in making the
interest payable on the Note subject to federal income taxes by reason of the Note being
classified as an “arbitrage bond” within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or
rulings or regulations promulgated thereunder.
The County also agrees and covenants with the purchaser and registered owner of
the Note from time to time outstanding that, to the extent possible under Illinois law, it
will comply with whatever federal tax law is adopted in the future which applies to the

authorized to execute such other documents, as may be necessary to implement the Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby and to effect the issuance and delivery of the Note, and execution

in accordance with customary disbursement procedures of the County. Alternatively, the Chief Financial
Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Note to one or more other funds or accounts of the County now
in existence. The County by its Board reserves the right, as it becomes necessary from time to time, to
change the purposes of expenditure of the Working Cash Fund or its accounts, to change priorities, to
revise cost allocations between expenditures and to substitute projects, in order to meet current needs of
the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the tax covenants of the County relating to the Tax
Exempt status of interest on the Note if it is issued as Tax Exempt.
Sec. 2.7.

classified as an “arbitrage bond” within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or rulings or regulations
promulgated thereunder.
The County also agrees and covenants with the purchaser and registered owner of the Note from
time to time outstanding that, to the extent possible under Illinois law, it will comply with whatever
federal tax law is adopted in the future which applies to the Note and affects the status of the interest on
the Note as Tax Exempt, if the Note is issued as Tax Exempt; that without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the County agrees: (a) through its officers, to make such further specific covenants,
representations and assurances as may be necessary or advisable; (b) to comply with all representations,
covenants and assurances contained in a certification regarding tax exemption to be prepared by counsel
approving the Note; (c) to consult with such counsel and to comply with such advice as may be given; (d)
to pay to the United States, as necessary, such sums of money representing required rebates of excess
arbitrage profits relating to the Note; (e) to file such forms, statements and supporting documents as may
be required and in a timely manner; and (f) if deemed necessary or advisable by its officers, to employ
and pay fiscal agents, financial advisors, attorneys and other persons to assist the County in such
compliance; and that the County acknowledges that, in the event of an examination by the Internal
Revenue Service of the exemption from Federal income taxation for interest paid on the Note, under
present rules, the County is treated as the “taxpayer” in such examination.

(2)

Toxicology report.

(3)

Miscellaneous Reports, including artist's drawings, but not including
police reports.

(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the
Medical Examiner, by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up
bodies from the Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return
them to the Office after determining that the family has no funds for
burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial shell and the burial
cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is
made later than 1 year of the person's death (due to a return by Funeral
Home). The Office of the Medical Examiner is charged by the Illinois
Department of Vital Records for amendments made to a death certificate
after 1 year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Funeral Homes)
to the Office of the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure
funds for burial services. This "storage fee" would replace the "return
fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it up again within 10
days. If the body is not picked up within 10 days, the body will be held
and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures
of the Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the
Office of the Medical Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes
and also encourages the funeral directors to verify that families have
funds for burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical
Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs and histology slides.

and/or any Medical Examiner investigator.

fined not more than $1,000 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139.

Annual report.

The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners an annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140.

Medical Examiner Fees Fund.

Beginning on or before March 1, 2011, the Comptroller shall create a special
revenue fund to be entitled the, “Medical Examiner Fees Fund.” The revenue collected by
the Office of the Medical Examiner from all of the various fees of the Office of the
Medical Examiner shall be placed in such special fund for the Office of the Medical
Examiner to be held by the Treasurer of the County. Such revenues collected and placed
in such special fund shall only be disbursed by appropriation of the County Board and
shall be used solely for the purchase of electronic and forensic identification equipment
or other related supplies and the operating expenses of the Medical Examiner’s Office.

Records to be kept.

(a)
The Medical Examiner shall keep full and complete records properly indexed, giving the
name, if known, of every person whose death is investigated, the place where and the date when the body
was found and the date of death, if known. In case the name of the decedent is not known, the Medical
Examiner shall prepare a description person and enter the same upon his/her records, together with all
facts and circumstances of the death which may be known, and which may later lead to the identification
of the dead person.
(b)
It shall be the duty of the Medical Examiner to keep on file in his/her office full and
complete records of all deaths coming under his/her jurisdiction, together with his/her conclusions
therein.
(c)
Upon completion of investigation and any related criminal proceeding, the official report
of the Medical Examiner's investigation shall be made available for inspection to any person with
substantial or important interest upon written request. A copy of the official report may be obtained upon
payment of the duplication fee. This shall not foreclose access to other records where appropriate.
Sec. 38-132.

Advisory committee.

the Cook County Board of Commissioners with the advice and consent of the Board of Commissioners.
Member shall include but not limited to persons representing the medical profession, funeral directors,

pay any and all expenses incurred by such investigation and the associated burial expenses. The same

Sec. 38-134.

247

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2011
(Recessed and Reconvened February 16, 2011)
All transportation costs of the body incident to the Medical Examiner's investigation shall be
recoverable from the estate of the deceased.
Sec. 38-135.
(a)

Duplication fee Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge seventy-five cents ($0.75) per page duplication fee.

(b)
The Medical Examiner shall charge autopsy protocols $10.00 plus $1.00 per page for all
pages contained in the protocol file.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-1 of
this Code.
(1)

Autopsy report .

(2)

Toxicology report.

(3)

Miscellaneous Reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

(4)

Permit to cremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing.

(5)

Return fee. The Return Fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the
Medical Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining
that the family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial
shell and the burial cost.

(6)

Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than 1
year of the person's death (due to a return by Funeral Home). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after 1 year of the death.

(7)

Storage fee. This fee covers the bodies returned (by the Funeral Homes) to the Office of
the Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services. This
"storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns a body and picks it
up again within 10 days. If the body is not picked up within 10 days, the body will be
held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures of the
Medical Examiner. This "storage fee" discourages the use of the Office of the Medical
Examiner as a storage location by funeral homes and also encourages the funeral
directors to verify that families have funds for burial prior to removing a body from the
Office of the Medical Examiner.

(8)

Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.

Sec. 38-136.

Debt due County.

All fees and expense reimbursements shall constitute a debt due the County of Cook and be paid
to the Medical Examiner who shall deposit the same with the County Treasurer on the last day of every
month.

Examiner investigator.
Sec. 38-138.

Penalty for violation.

Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this ordinance shall be fined not more than
$1,000 and imprisoned not more than six months.
Sec. 38-139.

Annual report.

The Medical Examiner shall prepare and submit to the Cook County Board of Commissioners an
annual report of the activities of his/her office.
Sec. 38-140.

Medical Examiner Fees Fund.

Beginning on or before March 1, 2011, the Comptroller shall create a special revenue fund to be
entitled the, “Medical Examiner Fees Fund.” The revenue collected by the Office of the Medical
Examiner from all of the various fees of the Office of the Medical Examiner shall be placed in such
special fund for the Office of the Medical Examiner to be held by the Treasurer of the County. Such
revenues collected and placed in such special fund shall only be disbursed by appropriation of the County
Board and shall be used solely for the purchase of electronic and forensic identification equipment or
other related supplies and the operating expenses of the Medical Examiner’s Office.
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 32 Fees,
Sec. 32-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:

COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE
REQUEST TO AMEND A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ITEM
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 6, 2011 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting that the Board of Commissioners approve as amended the following item with JP Morgan
Chase Bank, Chicago, Illinois, which was previously approved on the October 5, 2010 Board Agenda,
(New Item # 3).
The amendment is indicated by the underscored and stricken language.
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 29, 2010 from
ZAHRA ALI, Director, Department of Revenue
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to include the Department of Revenue and amend
Contract No. 05-43-197 with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., Chicago, Illinois, awarded by the Cook
County Board on September 21, 2004 and subsequently renewed on April 9, 2008 through a Request for
Proposal (RFP) process to provide lockbox services. The contract shall be amended to reflect virtual
remote deposit services and online e-payments acceptance for Bureau of Administration agencies, Office
of the Sheriff, Real Estate Management Division, Bureau of Finance, Bureau of Technology, Department
of Administrative Hearings and various County Ordinances which require the Department of Revenue to
collect payments.
Reason:

This request will provide acceleration and efficiency of the revenue collection process,
which is critical to meet both goals of following best practices and meeting industry
standards for Cook County. Lockbox service and e-payment solutions will expedite the
collection of the current paper-based payments. Currently, Department of Revenue
personnel manually process 100,000 transactions in-house. Furthermore, lockbox service
and e-payment solutions will provide a cost savings to the Department of Revenue.
Additional benefits include better payment and posting accuracy, improve cash flow by
reducing processing time, image retrieval and archiving, provide an option for electronic
connectivity for taxpayers and re-assign current compliance resources to their designated
job functions.
Funding for the lockbox is achieved through both a cost and interest accrued.
Compensating balances and the amount the County will pay has an inverse relationship.
While interest rates are at a historic low, the County will have a payment obligation,
however, when the interest market is reinvigorated and rates begin to climb, the actual
charge to the County will decrease. Based on historical analysis, it is believed that
compensating balances will fund the entire expense of this operation over time.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: Total contract cost is approximately $162,000.00 funded through both a
compensating balances and a line item allocation ,in the event compensating balances do not fund the
stated contract cost, the contract cost will be netted against collected revenue. The net cost to the County

283

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 15, 2011
(Recessed and Reconvened February 16, 2011)
will not exceed $83,000.00 for FY 2011 and FY 2012. Contract period: October 5, 2010 through
January 31, 2013. (007-244 Account). Requisition No. 0070015.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012 funds.

PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 26, 2011 from
GREG WASS, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Technology
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend Contract No. 08-45-256 with Securus
Technologies, Inc., Dallas, Texas, for the Coinless Inmate & Public Pay Telephone Equipment and
Services by adding coinless telephone equipment and services to the Juvenile Detention Center facilities,
create inmate debit accounts, and implement a simplified rate structure.
Reason:

Juvenile Facility Project – Securus will provide the equipment/Applications in connection
with the Secure Call Platform (SCP) services needed to support the required number and
type of phones and other components and storage.
Inmate Debit Accounts – Upon the successful implementation of Voice Biometrics, it is
the County’s intent to install Debit accounts. This allows the inmates to call anyone and
provides inmates the option of immediately paying for and making calls. Secure pins
will be provide for easy investigation of calls and complaints, it enhances reporting
capabilities and reduces administrative costs.
Simplified Rates – rates at Cook County today are based on AT&T rates that were
previously in place. The current structure is extremely complicated for inmates and their
families. A simplified rate plan will reduce complaints, reduce fraud, eliminates the need
to use illegal remote call forwarding services and increase County revenues by an
estimated $623,000.00 annually.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2012.
