Amended and Restated Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Redevelopment Plan: Reimbursement
Agreement
Mr. Vosburg presented the Reimbursement Agreement for the Amended and Restated Joe Louis Arena
Brownfield Redevelopment Plan to the DBRA Board.

 A Plan Amendment was requested due to increased Eligible Activities that have recently been discovered
by environmental consultants working on behalf of the City of Detroit. Abatement and Demolition activities
have increased from $3.6 million the original Plan to approximately $8.8 million in the Plan Amendment.
Engineering Services: Demo Design has increased from $790,286 to $840,286. New Eligible Costs of Due
Care Activities, Response Activities and Interest totaling approximately $2.7 million are new Eligible Cost.
In total, the Eligible Costs have increased from $5,561,009 to $14,363,147.
Project Introduction
In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the “Little Caesars Arena”, an
agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish the JLA once the Little Caesars Arena was
completed and ready for use. As of the date of this Plan, the Little Caesars Arena has been completed and
the Detroit Red Wings have vacated the JLA and relocated to the Little Caesars Arena.
The primary purpose of this Plan Amendment is to increase the amount of tax increment revenues that can
be captured for reimbursement of eligible activities. This increase is a result of additional information that
was subsequently discovered following the original Brownfield Plan approval. The capture of tax increment
revenues pursuant to the Plan Amendment is to reimburse for eligible activities in connection with the
demolition of the JLA and to prepare the Property for a future mixed-use development, which may include
residential, commercial, and/or retail space. For the purposes of this Plan, the use of the term “Developer”
shall refer to the City of Detroit. The City of Detroit is the owner of Joe Louis Arena and the Detroit Building
Authority will oversee demolition.
Total TIF reimbursement amount for the demolition and related eligible activities under this Plan is
$14,363,147.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington Boulevard. The
common address of the JLA is also known as “600 Civic Center Drive.” 25 Washington Boulevard, 29
Washington Boulevard, 31 Washington Boulevard, and 33 Washington Boulevard are properties that are
adjacent and continuous to 27 Washington Boulevard. 501 Third is also adjacent to 27 Washington
Boulevard and is the location of the Detroit People Mover – Joe Louis Arena Station Stop. The Property is
located adjacent to the Central Business District and is generally bounded by Jefferson Street to the north,
Atwater Street to the east, Detroit River to the south and Cobo Convention Center to the west.
Basis of Eligibility
The Property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the Property
was previously utilized for a public purpose; (b) it is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local
governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to be a functionally obsolete or
adjacent and contiguous as defined by Act 381.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible activities”
as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include environmental assessment activities, demolition and
abatement and brownfield plan and work plan preparation and brownfield plan implementation. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed
solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no
debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin within eighteen months and be completed within three
(3) years.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible
activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement
Agreement with the DBRA.

ADMINISTRATIVE

 Ms. Kanalos presented the Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Policy for the Detroit Brownfield
Redevelopment Authority to the DBRA Board.
Per resolution code 07-10-01-78, approved by the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the
“DBRA”) on October 11, 2007, authorization for renewal of DBRA’s insurance policies is as follows:
“Automatic annual renewal of DBRA’s Insurance Policies, including Comprehensive
General Liability, Excess Liability, Directors and Officers Liability, Automobile and Not-forProfit Organizations Crime Coverage policies. The annual renewals will be presented to
the DBRA Board for prior approval only in the event when either the limits of coverage
and/or the policy premiums are increased by more than 15 percent.”
DBRA staff has been informed that the Comprehensive General Liability (“CGL”) policy premium renewal
is expected to increase from $17,857.00 to $30,936.00. This increase is based upon DBRA receipts for
calendar year 2017, comprised of tax increment financing administrative fees and DBRA brownfield plan
processing fees, which realized a significant increase largely due to the processing fees associated with
Bedrock Transformational Brownfield Plan
A resolution authorizing the renewal of the DBRA CGL Insurance Policy was attached for the DBRA Board’s
review and approval.
Mr. George asked what the deductible is on the DBRA’s Comprehensive General Liability policy. Ms.
Kanalos stated that she did not have that information readily available, but that she would provide it to the
DBRA Board.
Mr. George asked if the DBRA has inquired with other insurance companies for Comprehensive General
Liability coverage. Ms. Kanalos stated that the DBRA uses Long Insurance Company which acts as a broker
for the DBRA.
Ms. Washington asked if the DBRA expects to see additional Transformation Brownfield Plans presented
for review and approval. Ms. Kanalos stated that there can be five Transformational Brownfield Plans in the
State of Michigan, three of which have the ability to be located in the City of Detroit, and that there can only
be Transformational Brownfield Plans approved before the end of 2022.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion accepting the Comprehensive General Liability Insurance Policy for the
Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, as presented.

conferences for Brownfields are generally eighteen months apart and the next conference has not yet been
announced.
