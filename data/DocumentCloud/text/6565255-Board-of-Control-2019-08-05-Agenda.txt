Purpose:
Travel to Boulder, Colorado to speak and attend the MetroLab Summit. Case and Cleveland State have
been asked to speak on a panel at the conference and have requested the County to participate in the
panel. The MetroLab Network is a group of more than 35 city-university partnerships focused on bringing
data, analytics, and innovation to city government. Its members include 44 cities, 5 counties, and 59
universities. The Network’s mission is to pair university researchers with city policymakers to undertake
research, development, and deployment projects that improve our infrastructure, public services, and
environmental sustainability. Cuyahoga County is a member of the MetroLab Network in partnership with
Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. Attendance at the conference will allow
for Cuyahoga County to showcase the work we are doing with Case and Cleveland State as part of the IoT
collaborative. In addition, it will allow us to learn more about what other cities and counties are doing in
the areas of data analytics, smart communities and other innovative practices. As a member of MetroLab
Network, we receive one registration to the conference for free.

not-to-exceed cost of $10,000. The anticipated start-completion dates are 06/01/2019 – 11/30/2019.
The primary goal of the project is to generate this purchase order to pay for some services rendered and
carry the MEO through November, giving us enough time to enter into a new contract or obtain a
washer and dryer and do the laundry in house.
Procurement
The procurement method for this project is a County Exemption due to recent past history and the
loss of a long time vendor.

Project Status and Planning
CR-19-46335 is set for a 6 month purchase order while other options are pursued. The MEO did not
request a longer term on the last RQ # CR-19-45995, due to the fact that the vendor was not registered
with the Inspector General and we did not want to cause any further delay with payment. The vendor
was reluctant to register but then in good faith followed through with the IG’s registration.
CR-18-44055 - The initial project was set for a 4 month period while we secured a Laundry Service
Contract, unfortunately, that did not happen due to an oversite and far too much work for one person,
plus the fact that I tend to put others needs before my own.
An RFB for CR-18-44055 was processed, however, there were no replies to the bid. The plan was to
begin the bid process again with a contract set to begin March 1, 2019 when this purchase order ends.
To prevent this from happening in the future, I am taking various steps as follows:
a. The MEO is requesting that we pay this vendor immediately.
b. The MEO will concurrently process an RFP Exemption to enter into a contract with
this vendor as I have found no other vendor interested in performing this task for
the MEO.
c. The MEO has approached the County Sheriff’s Department to discuss the inmates
performing this work, however, I was informed …”at this time due to staffing and
other circumstances the jail cannot take on new responsibilities. We can take
another look at it in the future.”
d. The MEO is also researching the possibility of purchasing a commercial washer
and dryer and doing the laundry in house.
