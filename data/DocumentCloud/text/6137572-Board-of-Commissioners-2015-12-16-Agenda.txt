PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE HANDLING OF
THE LAQUAN MCDONALD MURDER CASE BY THE COOK COUNTY STATE’S
ATTORNEY, CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY OF CHICAGO
WHEREAS, after 13 months of delay, a dashboard camera video showing the shooting of Laquan
McDonald by Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was finally released Tuesday, November 24, 2015;
and,
WHEREAS, Officer Van Dyke shot Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old African American boy, as Laquan
McDonald walked in the opposite direction; and,
WHEREAS, after this initial shooting, Officer Van Dyke continued to shoot Laquan McDonald as he
lay on the ground, shooting Laquan McDonald a total of 16 times; and,
WHEREAS, in the aftermath of Laquan McDonald’s shooting death on October 20, 2014, a 13-month
period ensued wherein the Cook County State’s Attorney did not bring charges against Officer Van
Dyke; and,
WHEREAS, during the aforementioned 13-month period, the dashboard camera video showing the
shooting of Laquan McDonald by Officer Van Dyke was concealed from public view; and,
WHEREAS, during the aforementioned 13-month period, the City of Chicago entered into a $5 million
dollar settlement with the family of Laquan McDonald; and,
WHEREAS, on November 19, 2015, despite strenuous efforts by the City of Chicago to continue to
conceal the aforementioned dashboard camera video depicting the shooting death of Laquan McDonald,
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Franklin Valderrama ordered that the video be made public; and,
WHEREAS, in the hours before the aforementioned dashboard camera video was finally released to the
public, the Cook County State’s Attorney brought first degree murder charges against Officer Van Dyke;
and,
WHEREAS, the 13-month time period between the shooting death of Laquan McDonald and the filing
of criminal charges against Officer Van Dyke has created a national uproar, and undermined local
confidence in the criminal justice system in Chicago and Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, outrage over the delay in prosecuting Officer Van Dyke has led to mass protests and
displays of civil disobedience throughout Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, there remain several critically important questions regarding the handling of the Laquan
McDonald murder case that are at present unanswered, including most fundamentally, why it took 13
months to finally charge Officer Van Dyke in connection with Laquan McDonald’s death;

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REQUESTING THE COOK COUNTY STATE’S ATTORNEY TO APPEAR BEFORE A
HEARING OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE
INVESTIGATION AND INDICTMENT IN THE LAQUAN MCDONALD CASE
WHEREAS, the aftermath of officer-involved deaths of civilians such as those of Michael Brown in
Ferguson, Freddy Gray in Baltimore, Eric Garner in New York, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Walter Scott in
North Charleston and the shooting death of Laquan McDonald here in Chicago, has brought to the
national consciousness not only the question of what constitutes justifiable force by police officers but as
importantly, the manner in which such incidents are investigated, and when warranted, prosecuted; and
WHEREAS, it is vital that there exists public confidence in all branches of the criminal justice system,
including the prosecutorial arm, and that such trust fundamentally relies upon a showing of transparency
and accountability by those criminal justice stakeholders; and
WHEREAS, it is essential that the Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney recognizes and
acknowledges the legitimate societal expectations of such stakeholders and the justifiable need for public
trust in order to have the public as a willing participant in the justice system; and
WHEREAS, since shortly after the shooting of Laquan McDonald, the State’s Attorney was in
possession of multiple video images associated with the incident yet no charges were brought until 400
days after the shooting, thereby raising myriad questions among the public concerning the overall
investigation, what steps were or were not undertaken by the State’s Attorney, the rationale for those
decisions and the reasoning underlying the coincidental timing of the indictment relative to the release of
the videos; and
WHEREAS, this is just one incident among numerous other matters that raises significant questions about
the operations of her office; and
WHEREAS, leaving such questions unanswered serves only to undermine community trust, thereby
hampering future efforts by criminal justice stakeholders to administer justice in other incidents and to have
the public as willing and trusting partners in working to prosecute other individuals responsible for the
plague of violence that exists in the City of Chicago and beyond; and

Page 8 of 47

BOARD AGENDA

December 16, 2015

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has a legitimate, shared and vested interest in
ensuring that its agencies and offices operate honestly and efficiently in order to assure the confidence of
Cook County residents in the fundamental workings of the criminal justice process; and
WHEREAS, it is in the interest of this government and the County of Cook that its residents are
receiving, and entitled to, the best possible criminal justice system and that such entitlement is premised
upon honest, accountable and transparent services by those responsible for such system.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners do hereby request that a hearing of the Criminal Justice Committee be convened as soon
as is practical to discuss the decisions and processes used to investigate and bring charges in the Laquan
McDonald case; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in order to properly and fully have such discussions, the President and
the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby request that the Cook County State’s Attorney appear
before the Criminal Justice Committee to present any statement she may choose to offer and to answer
questions from the committee members.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING ON THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY TO APPOINT A SPECIAL
STATE’S ATTORNEY TO HANDLE THE PROSECUTION OF OFFICER JASON VAN DYKE,
PURSUANT TO 55 ILCS 5/3-9008
WHEREAS, pursuant to 55 ILCS 5/3-9008, the Circuit Court or an interested party in a proceeding may
file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties; and
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 sets the proper procedure for the Circuit Court to review such petition;
and
WHEREAS, the 13-month time period between the shooting death of a 17-year-old African American,
Laquan McDonald, and the filing of criminal charges by the Cook County State’s Attorney against the
shooter, Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke has undermined local confidence in the criminal justice
system in Cook County; and,
WHEREAS, the delay in prosecuting Officer Van Dyke has placed the Cook County State’s Attorney in
the position of having to defend the impartiality of the State’s Attorney’s Office in prosecuting Officer Van
Dyke; and,
WHEREAS, with respect to the prosecution of Officer Van Dyke, the utilization of the Chicago Police
Department by the State’s Attorney for its own investigatory purposes places the Cook County State’s
Attorney in the position of prosecuting a member of a government agency that often functions as witnesses
of the State’s Attorney’s Office; and,

December 16, 2015

WHEREAS, as a result of its relationship with the Chicago Police Department as outlined in the
foregoing paragraphs, a clear conflict of interest exists for the Office of the Cook County State’s
Attorney in its prosecution of Officer Van Dyke; and,
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that this Honorable Body requests that the Circuit Court of Cook County or an interested
person immediately file a petition alleging that the State’s Attorney is unable to fulfill her duties pursuant
to Section 55 ILCS 5/3-9008 and to appoint a Special State’s Attorney to handle the prosecution of Jason

Summary: In July of 2015, the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency (“IEMA”) received a Notice of Debt Collection for Homeland Security
Grant Funds Awarded to Project Shield, totaling $1,392,750.26 from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (“FEMA”). The July FEMA correspondence indicated that various Project Shield
activities that were funded by the Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007 Homeland Security Grants were
unreasonable, unallowable and unallocable costs. Even though the findings resulted from work
performed by a previous administration, DHSEM worked with the IEMA to appeal FEMA’s findings;
however, the DHSEM was notified on 11/12/2015 by IEMA that FEMA denied the appeal and included a
final determination that grant funds were expended by Cook County in the amount of $1,392,750.26 on
ineligible costs for Project Shield and are required to be returned to FEMA.
