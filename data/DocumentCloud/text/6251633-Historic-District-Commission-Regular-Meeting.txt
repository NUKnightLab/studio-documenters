PROPOSAL
The resource at 312 W. Lafayette, known as the Detroit Free Press Building, is a steel-frame
fourteen-story office building clad in limestone (1925). The building takes up the half city block
fronting on Lafayette’s south side between Washington Boulevard and Cass Avenue extending
south to the alley. The design of the building is unusual in that the first three stories display
rectangular floor plates, while two lights courts along the building’s rear side give floors four
through six 25 E-shaped footprints. A central front tower area contains floors seven through
fourteen. The exterior design was implemented by Albert Kahn for many of his other large office
buildings such as the Fisher Building. The piers between window bays brought forward to give the
building a dramatic light and shadow play. Windows are recently-added aluminum sash units. The
two-story arched main entrance at the front of the building is flanked by two historical figures.
Medallions depicting historical newsmen decorate the building’s exterior. For many years, two red
neon signs for “The Free Press” stood on the roof of the building, but were removed in the late
1990’s. The roof is flat. Inside the first floor, the central lobby features an elaborate arched plaster
ceiling with rosette and classical details. A paneled conference room to the east is highlighted by
murals by artist Roy C. Gamble depicting the growth of the City of Detroit. Also on the first floor
inside the West Lafayette Boulevard façade are a restaurant and other retail spaces. The two
basement levels once housed the printing facilities of the newspaper. A State of Michigan historic
marker is displayed on the exterior of the building.

1

 Please note that the Commission approved an extensive rehabilitation proposal in 2017. With the
current submission the applicant proposes the following work items:
Exterior Lighting
 Exterior lights are proposed at the storefront, 2nd floor and 7th floor levels. Lights will be
centered on the columns and provide downlighting at the storefront level and up-lighting at
the 2nd and 7th floor levels. Additional lights will be located in planters in the sidewalk to
illuminate the decorative carving around the main entry arch to the building, and at the flag
poles on the 6th floor roof at the east and west corners of Lafayette. The attached drawings
show proposed lighting types and locations.
Rear Elevation
 .At the alley level, establish two loading bays with the installation of two angled walls with
roll-up garage doors. The two loading bays are placed toward the middle of the building to
minimize the visual impact from the street and are also in ideal locations based on
structural constraints. The loading dock openings themselves are not being altered, and all
existing historic fabric around the openings shall be maintained. If needed, the infill for the
loading bay enclosures could easily be removed in the future and the loading dock bays
would remain intact. The loading bays will be clad in a light-colored cementitious material
to blend with the existing building while simultaneously clearly being an addition to the
building. The garage doors will be a green color to match the windows, storefronts, and
louvers on the building, and will have a series of small windows to provide transparency.
 Three louvers will be added to the alley façade to supply fresh air and expel exhaust air.
The louvers will be installed in previously bricked-in window locations below the
bridge connecting the Detroit Free Press Building and neighboring Detroit Club

Location of new roll-up doors
2

 New Rooftop Amenities
 Establish a deck on the roof of the building’s 6th floor west wing. The deck will consist of a
raised pedestal paver roof deck with porcelain and hardwood tiles. The roof deck will be
held back from the parapets and have a guardrail surrounding the deck on all sides. The
edge of the roof deck and guardrail will be located so that it is not a visible feature from the
street.
 At the rooftop deck, install a grill enclosure, fireplace, electrical closet, sauna, spa, and
pool. The electrical closet and sauna will be built adjacent to and the same height and finish
as the stair penthouse added during the core and shell phase of the project to minimize
visual impact. The grill will be kept tight to the stair penthouse, and the fireplace will be
located adjacent to the spa, near the stair penthouse and sauna. An in-ground rooftop pool
and spa will be built into the roof deck. The pool will be approximately 24' x 14' in size and
the spa will be approximately 8' x 7'. The pool is located on the southern end of the roof
top, while the spa is located more centrally by the stair enclosure and sauna. A small
wrought iron gate between the stair enclosure and fireplace separates the pool and spa from
the rest of the roof deck. Pool and spa equipment will be housed in the existing tall corner
parapet at the south west corner of the rooftop. A small metal panel enclosure will be added
to the open corner of the tall corner parapet to enclose the equipment. The metal panel
enclosure will match the parapet in color as closely as possible so as to not be a noticeable
feature from the street. A roof will be added at the top, the highest point of which will be
level with the top of the parapet.

Location of rooftop amenities

 APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)
Proportion of Buildings' Front Façades. The proportions of individual front
façades vary greatly within the district. Buildings over ten (10) stories tall are
significantly taller than wide, and are usually located on corners of blocks or occupy
their entire block. Most other buildings in the district are also taller than wide, with
notable exceptions of several buildings facing West Fort Street, the Detroit Fire
Department Headquarters at 250 East Larned Avenue, and a few smaller buildings
on Shelby Street, which are wider than tall or proportionally neutral. The noncontributing building at 501 Woodward Avenue and the building at 611 Woodward
Avenue are significantly wider than tall. Buildings with front-facing light courts,
such as the Dime Building at 719 Griswold Street, appear to have two tall towers
projecting upward from a single, multi-story base. The façades of the Neoclassical
style First National Building at 660 Woodward Avenue follow the irregular
footprint of its site, and because of its substantial height, provide a backdrop to the
small-scaled buildings adjacent to it on Woodward Avenue. Skyscraper buildings
of the Art Deco have multiple setbacks in their wall surfaces as the buildings rise,
with faceted and decorative results. The Detroit Free Press Building at 321 West
Lafayette Street is composed of a center tower with two lower wings, neutralizing
its proportions. Tall buildings of the International style tend to rise as a single slab.
Where buildings that are individually taller than wide either share a party wall or
abut each other, they may collectively form a row that is wider than tall, particularly
on the east side of Woodward Avenue.
(2)
Proportion of Openings Within the Façades. The buildings within the Historic
Detroit Financial District are each composed of approximately thirty-five (35) to
sixty (60) per cent openings in their front façades. Shapes and sizes of openings
generally depend on the style and age of the buildings. Entrances are often centered
prominently on the front façades, with revolving doors set back in an arched,
covered area or portico. Large openings above the entrance openings, ground
floors, and mezzanine levels in the base of the buildings frequently contain
subdivided windows rising up through multiple stories. Plate glass storefront and
display windows on the ground floors of commercial buildings are commonplace.
Above the ornate bases of Neoclassical and Art Deco style buildings and simpler
Victorian buildings are rows of double-hung sash windows that are twice as tall as
wide and are often arranged in pairs or triples, sometimes divided vertically by
spandrels. Subdivided glazing is often situated within large, ornate arched, square
or rectangular openings in the attic stories. Replacement windows that are fitted to
existing openings are common in the district. Some International style buildings
with curtain wall construction feature undivided faces of fixed pane glass, or
individualized treatments, such as hexagonal shaped window glass in precast
concrete frames of 1 Woodward Avenue.
(3)
Rhythm of Solids to Voids in the Front Façade. Most buildings in the district are of
steel–frame construction, which creates a structure for which windows are inserted
in a regular arrangement of columns and rows between the base floor and the attic.
The regular rhythm of windows arranged one over the other in a grid pattern
prevails throughout the district. The base and attic stories of buildings are varied in
architectural treatment, but may feature regular rhythms of arched, square or
rectangular openings on first and attic stories. The Detroit Fire Department

Headquarters at 250 West Larned Street features double firehouse doors within
arcaded openings on its Washington Boulevard and West Larned Street façades.
The International style building at 611 Woodward Avenue features a checkerboard
pattern of window placement, while the Federal Reserve Bank Annex at 160 West
Fort Street features alternating horizontal bands of glass and marble panels
supported by a stainless steel grid above its all-glass tall first story. In general, the
district displays a variety of regularly arranged fenestration patterns.
Rhythm of Entrance and/or Porch Projections. Most primary entrances are
prominently centered on their front façades, especially on the classically derived
buildings, and are commonly recessed within single or multiple ornamental
openings. Some buildings have colonnades or monumental porticos, with their
entrances set behind. International style buildings often have entire base stories
recessed behind a colonnade of piers. The Guardian Building at 500 Griswold
Street has its main entrance at its northwest corner, and Victorian commercial
buildings along Woodward tend to have entrances to the sides of storefronts. Some
corner buildings have corner entrances. Most entrances are at grade, with the
exceptions of the buildings at 611 Woodward Avenue and the west elevation of 211
West Fort Street, which each feature a set of steps that rise with the slope of their
sites, and United States District Court at 231 West Lafayette Street, which sits on a
high basement and has steps leading to its main entrance.
Relationship of Materials. A great variety of building materials exist throughout
the district, with concentrations of finished, pressed or glazed brick, limestone,
Mankato stone, terra cotta, marble; cast and porcelain enamel and glass facing
primary façades. Base stories are commonly faced or partially faced in granite.
Materials utilized for window surrounds and frames are cast concrete, steel,
aluminum, bronze and wood. Architectural embellishments tend to be in cast and
carved stone, glazed terra cotta, Pewabic tile, and red sandstone. Common brick
appears on side elevations that were not intended to be visible. Bronze grills, metal
fire escapes, and aluminum and steel framing elements are also visible. In general,
the district is rich in its varieties and relationships of materials.
Relationship of Textures. The smooth surfaces of glazed or painted brick, glazed
terra cotta, polished marble, polished granite, and large expanses of glass contrast
with the matte finishes of limestone and unpainted brick with mortar joints. Where
the bases of buildings are rusticated, they contrast with the smoother wall surfaces
above. Repetitive pilasters and ornamental detail in masonry, terra cotta or metal,
primarily on belt courses and cornices, and the fluting of columns, contribute
significantly to textural interest. Subdivided window sashes and treatments also
contribute to textural interest, as do receding windows and wall planes, resulting in
textural effects created by light and shade. Where those International style buildings
have glass bases, a smooth, transparent textural effect results. In general, the district
is extremely rich in textural relationships.
Relationship of Colors. Major materials of light colors, such as beige, white, and
cream, dominate the district. The natural brick colors of red, orange, and buff are
also contrasted with beige or light gray trim elements and details. Painted brick,
where it exists on the east side of Woodward Avenue, is in dark red and cream.
Granite bases, where they exist, are black, red or gray. Window surrounds and
sashes are shades of green, black, cream or white. Window and curtain wall glass is
5

 (8)

either colorless or tinted in shades of light green, black or gray. Stainless steel and
aluminum are silver in tone; grills and grates are green or black. The Guardian
Building at 501 Griswold Avenue is a historic landmark featuring orange brick and
colored tile. Light poles tend to be deep green, black or gray. Fire escapes, where
they exist, are generally painted black. The original colors of any building, as
determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building and
may provide guidance for similar buildings.
Relationship of Architectural Details. The styles of the buildings comprising the
Historic Detroit Financial District range from Victorian commercial to International
style; their architectural elements and details relate to their styles. Entrance bays,
architraves, base stories, window frames, spandrels and cornices or attics are areas
of the façades where architectural detail is concentrated. The small scale Victorian
commercial buildings, concentrated on the east side of Woodward, have modified
storefronts on their first floors and have lost their cornices and window hoods,
much simplifying their original appearance. Approximately half of the buildings in
the district are derived from classical styles, with an abundance of Neoclassical
style buildings, a style well suited to judicial and financial institutions. Those
classically inspired buildings are articulated as a base (bottom), shaft (mid-section)
and attic (top). The base, often multi-storied, is heavily ornamented around the
main, entrance with columns, arches, and architectural sculpture. Several buildings
have rusticated stone bases, and some display colossal porticos. The shafts contain
regular fenestration with ornamented spandrels, and their attics, including their
cornices, are heavily ornamented. Art Deco commercial buildings are concentrated
on Griswold Avenue, and in addition to their embellished entrances, feature
setbacks at upper floor levels which are embellished, resulting in dramatic
silhouettes that are part of their design. These Art Deco buildings also exhibit
decorative tile work, mosaics, and large-scale architectural sculpture. International
style buildings of the 1950s and early 1960s are concentrated on the east side of
Woodward Avenue through to Griswold Street, and intermingled with classicallyinspired buildings on West Fort Street. They feature transparent first stories of
glass that are visible to the interior, and are set in back of piers supporting the upper
stories. Flagpole bases, lighting, and street names integrated with the larger
buildings are treated decoratively. In general, the architectural detail on buildings
in the district is very rich.

RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s recommendation that the commission issue a COA for the proposed work because it
meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation standard number 9) New
additions, exterior alterations or related new construction will not destroy historic materials,
features and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be
differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale
and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment and 10).
New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that,
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.

RE: Detroit Free Press Building - HDC Submission
Dear Ms. Ross:

Kraemer Design Group (KDG) is writing to submit information to the Detroit Historic District Commission (HDC), on
behalf of Pyramid Development, LLC regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Detroit Free Press Building
located at 321 W. Lafayette. The proposed exterior work at the Detroit Free Press Building will include a pool and
pool deck on the roof of the west tower and two parking bays on the alley façade, and exterior façade lights.
The Detroit Free Press Building is a steel framed fourteen story office building clad in limestone. It was designed by
Albert Kahn and built in 1923. The building takes up the half city block fronting on West Lafayette’s south side
between Washington Boulevard and Cass Avenue, extending south from West Lafayette to the alley that bisects the
city block. The first three stories have a rectangular footprint that fills the lot line while floors four through six are in
the shape of an “E” as two lightwells punctuate the building’s southern façade. There is a central tower that rises
from floor seven to floor fourteen. The piers between window bays and decorative plaques display Art Deco
features on an otherwise utilitarian skyscraper. The two-story arched main entrance on West Lafayette is guarded by
two historical figures. Medallions depicting historical newsmen decorate the building’s front exterior. Plaques
depicting transportation modes adorn the Washington Boulevard and Cass Avenue facades. The Detroit Free Press,
which was founded in 1831, is the oldest continually operating business in Detroit and occupied 321 West Lafayette
for 76 years before leaving the building in 2001.
The following is a detailed description of the proposed work and its historic implications:

Rooftop Pool
It is proposed that a rooftop pool and deck be added to the roof of the west wing. A raised pedestal paver roof
deck with porcelain and hardwood tiles will be installed on the roof of the 6th floor west wing. The roof deck will be
held back from the parapets and have a guardrail surrounding the deck on all sides. The edge of the roof deck and
guardrail will be located so that it is not a visible feature from the street. See attached drawings for sightline studies
of the proposed roof deck. The roof deck will contain loose seating, a grill enclosure, fireplace, electrical closet,
sauna, spa, and pool. The electrical closet and sauna will be built adjacent to and the same height and finish as the
stair penthouse added during the core and shell phase of the project to minimize visual impact. The grill will be kept
tight to the stair penthouse, and the fireplace will be located adjacent to the spa, near the stair penthouse and
sauna.
An in-ground rooftop pool and spa will be built into the roof deck. The pool will be approximately 24' x 14' in size
and the spa will be approximately 8' x 7'. The pool is located on the southern end of the roof top, while the spa is
located more centrally by the stair enclosure and sauna. A small wrought iron gate between the stair enclosure and
fireplace separates the pool and spa from the rest of the roof deck. Pool and spa equipment will be housed in the
existing tall corner parapet at the south west corner of the rooftop. A small metal panel enclosure will be added to
the open corner of the tall corner parapet to enclose the equipment. The metal panel enclosure will match the
parapet in color as closely as possible so as to not be a noticeable feature from the street. A roof will be added at
the top, the highest point of which will be level with the top of the parapet.

 Parking
An automated parking system is proposed for the lower levels of the Detroit Free Press Building. The basement and
sub-basement will house equipment and support structure for the automated parking system, car storage, and car
lifts. At the alley level, two loading bays will be built to enclose the lift that will transport cars to the lower levels.
Between the two loading bays a lounge will be constructed to provide access into the building from the loading
bays and to provide a waiting area for car retrieval. The two loading bays have been located based on the building’s
structure and to minimize the impact on the tertiary façade. The enclosures each consist of two angled walls with
roll-up garage doors that enclose a turntable.
Cars will enter the alley off Washington Boulevard and exit onto Cass Avenue. The loading bay enclosure is angled
to allow easier entry for cars and to minimize the visual impact on the façade. A turntable is provided in each
loading bay to rotate cars before relocating them to the basement and sub-basement. When the turntable is in use,
the loading bay must be fully enclosed, causing the enclosure to project past the façade by 5’-0”. The turntable
enclosures are pushed as far into the building as possible to avoid projecting beyond the façade any more than is
necessary.
The two loading bays are placed toward the middle of the building to minimize the visual impact from the street and
are also in ideal locations based on structural constraints. The neighboring parking lot also has a series of small
existing buildings that largely block the views of the new loading bay structures, as seen in the attached massing
studies. The loading dock openings themselves are not being altered, and all existing historic fabric around the
openings shall be maintained. If needed, the infill for the loading bay enclosures could easily be removed in the
future and the loading dock bays would remain intact.
The loading bays and exterior face of the lounge will be clad in a light-colored cementitious material to blend with
the existing building while simultaneously clearly being an addition to the building. The garage doors will be a
green color to match the windows, storefronts, and louvers on the building, and will have a series of small windows
to provide transparency. Three louvers will be added to the alley façade to supply fresh air and expel exhaust air.
The louvers will be installed in previously bricked-in window locations below the bridge connecting the Detroit Free
Press Building and neighboring Detroit Club.

Exterior Lighting
Exterior lights are proposed at the storefront, 2nd floor and 7th floor levels. Lights will be centered on the columns
and provide downlighting at the storefront level and up-lighting at the 2nd and 7th floor levels. Additional lights will
be located in planters in the sidewalk to illuminate the decorative carving around the main entry arch to the
building, and at the flag poles on the 6th floor roof at the east and west corners of Lafayette. The attached drawings
show proposed lighting types and locations.

Conclusion
The items listed above provide a synopsis of the proposed scope of work for the pool and parking buildouts and
exterior lighting layout. We kindly request approval of the work proposed at 321 W. Lafayette. Further detail is
provided in the attached drawings, photos, and documentation. Please contact Cassandra Talley at Kraemer Design
Group if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,

Kraemer Design Group

While Bison 2CM PaversTM are durable because of the product’s thickness and density, they can be
damaged by mishandling or careless treatment. Please note that if tools, furnishings or
equipment are forcefully dropped on the pedestal/paver system, chips, scratches, surface
damage and/or cracking and breakage can occur, especially in cold temperatures. Before,
during and after installation, always protect the installed pavers by using sheet(s) of plywood to cover the
work area and protect the pavers from chipping and breakage. Please refer to product specifications for
more information.
