units on the floors above including approximately 8 studios, 125 one-bedroom units, 38 two-bedroom units,

of the Community Benefits Ordinance (CBO) process, approximately 10% of the residential units will be

The building will also include amenities for the residents, including an over 35,000 square foot landscaped

AMC Site 14250 Plymouth Road: Funding Agreement with the City of Detroit
Mr. Vosburg presented the AMC Site 14250 Plymouth Road: Funding Agreement with the City of Detroit to
the DBRA Board.

 On January 19, 2018 the Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) board approved
performing due diligence activities on behalf of the City of Detroit at the former AMC Site at 14250 Plymouth
Road (DBRA 18-01-254-01).
The City of Detroit took title to the AMC Site on November 30, 2018. State laws require that any entity
acquiring a property with Regulated (i.e. gasoline or diesel fuel) Underground Storage Tanks (UST) that
will not be placed back into service must remove the tanks within one (1) year of taking title to the property.
On December 12, 2018 the DBRA board approved applying for and accepting a $250,000 Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality (the “MDEQ”) grant to pay to fund UST removal at the AMC Site
(DBRA 18-12-254-05). The MDEQ awarded a grant to the DBRA, however the grant award was predicated
upon the City identifying a plan to fund the remediation of the entire site as well as identifying a developer
willing to sign a development agreement to redevelop the site.
The DEGC and DBRA, working with the City, to date has been unable to identify the significant funding
needed to remediate the entire site, nor have we to date been able to identify a developer willing to execute
a development agreement for the site. As a result, the MDEQ, since renamed Environment, Great Lakes
and Energy (the “EGLE”), has stated that the grant funds are ineligible for use at the AMC Site. EGLE has
indicated that the grant funds may be available for reassignment to other eligible properties in the City of
Detroit for which a developer with firm funding commitments has been identified.
The City is still obligated to remove the six (6) USTs known to exist at the AMC Site by November 30, 2019.
Because of this obligation, the City has decided to provide $250,000 in funds from the Planning &
Development Department (the “P&DD”) to the DBRA to perform the UST removal and remediation that was
originally planned to be funded with the EGLE grant. The DBRA will procure a contractor to perform the
UST removal and remediation in accordance with the cleanup plan developed by the environmental
contractor SME and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. The selected contractor will be
presented to the Board for contract approval
Staff is asking the Board for support and authorization to accept up to $250,000in funds from the City of
Detroit Planning & Development Department to perform removal and remediation of Underground Storage
Tanks at the AMC Site on behalf of the City.
A resolution approving the Funding Agreement for the AMC Site was attached for the DBRA Board’s review
and approval.
Ms. Washington asked how many underground storage tanks are currently present on the site. Mr. Vosburg
stated that after work done by the environmental consultants there are 6 tanks confirmed on the site.
Ms. Washington asked if the $250,000 in funds from the City of Detroit will be enough to cover the cost of
removing the six tanks from the site. Mr. Vosburg stated that the $250,000 in funding should cover the cost
of removing the six tanks from the site and should there be excess funds they may be used for additional
environmental remediation.
Ms. McClain asked for clarification on the nature of the funds to be received by the DBRA from the City of
Detroit. Mr. Vosburg stated that per the funding agreement $150,000 will be provided to the DBRA from the
City of Detroit and if there are expenses above the $150,000 amount, the DBRA will provide documentation
to the City of Detroit and the City of Detroit will cover those costs in excess of $150,000 up to $250,000.
Ms. Wilkins asked how the City of Detroit acquired the site. Mr. Vosburg stated that the site was acquired
by the City of Detroit through a land swap deal.
Ms. Wilkins asked if there are harmful exposures of environmental contamination to the community from
the site. Mr. Vosburg stated that the type of contamination that is present on the site is harmful through
direct contact only and that there has been no evidence of migration found through environmental
investigations on the site. Mr. Vosburg added that the City of Detroit has made sure that the site is secure

 and barricaded from the public and that there is regular security checks to ensure that the public cannot
gain access to the site and to prevent further illegal dumping.
Ms. Wilkins stated that the DBRA should communicate to the City of Detroit that the site should be secured
to prevent access to the site by the public and have appropriate signage to inform the public that the site is
contaminated. Mr. Vosburg confirmed that there is fencing barricades on the site and that there are ‘No
Trespassing’ and ‘Do Not Enter’ signs at the site and added that there is significant vegetation on the piles
of soil which greatly reduces the potential for erosion.
Ms. McClain asked if there is time to have additional information on the site and its security and
contamination provided to the DBRA Board before action is taken on the Funding Agreement. Mr. Vosburg
stated that time is of the essence for the Funding Agreement because the City of Detroit is obligated to
remove the six underground storage tanks on the site by November 30, 2019.
Ms. Wilkins stated that she would like the tanks to be removed from the site but would like to be able to
take further action to make sure that the site is secure and to lessen the exposure to the public. She would
also like a presentation at a future board meeting about: the environmental studies performed to date, the
cleanup plan for the site, and the security measures in place to keep children and the general public out of
the site. Ms. Kanalos stated that the DBRA staff will follow up with all parties involved and provide an
update to the DBRA Board.
Mr. George asked what the amount of the grant from EGLE was. Mr. Vosburg stated that the grant amount
was $250,000.
Mr. George asked what the total estimated amount is to clean up the site. Mr. Vosburg stated that it will
cost approximately $20 million to remove the contaminated soil piles and approximately $10 million to
remediate and demolish the existing building on the site.
Ms. Kanalos stated that the agreement is attached to the resolution and asked for clarification from Ms.
McClain if she would like to see additional terms in the memorandum for future agreements presented to
the Board. Ms. McClain stated that attaching the agreement to the resolution is sufficient.
Ms. DeSantis called for a motion approving the AMC Site 14250 Plymouth Road: Funding Agreement with
the City of Detroit, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Ms. Washington, DBRA Resolution Code 19-09-254-06
was unanimously approved.

local laws, as well as relevant City executive orders.

 13.

arising out of this Agreement that occurs within three (3) years after the later of the
