Update from MedAssets on Revenue Cycle Project
and Presentation on Analysis of Eligibility Vendors

Robert Wright, Executive Project Director, and Gretchen Ryan, Project Manager from MedAssets,
presented an update on the revenue cycle project, and an analysis of eligibility vendors (Attachment #1).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information. During the discussion, Chairman Carvalho
asked what is the ideal state, with regard to goals. Ms. Ryan stated that a goal line would be included in
the next update. Additionally, she stated that while the presentation usually contains a comparison of
cash versus billed, or the incremental cash improvement against baseline, it was not included but will be
included at the next update.
The Committee discussed staffing issues. Director O’Donnell inquired with regards to the patient
accounting/billing staff issue. Ms. Ryan responded that they are in the construction phase, which is
expected to be completed by October 1st. Additionally, with regard to case management staffing gaps,
Ms. Ryan stated that they are down to “bare bones” at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County.
They are monitoring the situation, and the human resources department is engaged in recruiting. She
added that they have been experiencing difficulties recruiting for the positions.
The Committee discussed the information provided on days in accounts receivable, which indicated that
they have moved from over 1,000 days to just over 200 days. Mr. Wright explained that the decline was
more attributable to cleaning up some older files that did not belong in that category.

sure a system is in place.

Follow-up on outstanding requests for information
Project Brotherhood

Kelvin Magee, Senior Director of Finance for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented
information on Project Brotherhood (Attachment #4).
An analysis of the Woodlawn clinic, in which Project Brotherhood is based, was provided for FY2009.
Additional information was provided on grant and System funding.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information. Chairman Carvalho asked what is being
requested for funding in FY2010. Mr. Magee responded that the request for System funding for Project
Brotherhood in FY2010 will be $140,000.00.

Update on Chicago Radiation Oncology Issues

It was noted that this update was provided during the discussion of the Contracts and Procurement items.

Report on Medicare Volume Drop

Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
provided information relating to a question posed at a previous Finance Committee meeting, regarding a
drop in Medicare volume. She stated that they believe the drop in utilization is due to surgery; Dr.
Richard Keen, System Chairman of the Department of Surgery, confirmed that referrals for Medicare
surgical patients from the clinic areas are down. They will investigate further and provide an update the
next time the monthly financials are presented.
Chairman Carvalho noted that approximately six months ago, Access Community Health Network
instituted a policy with a very large co-pay for people. He speculated whether the System’s clinics had
experienced increased traffic of uninsured people who had been impacted by the Access Community
Health Network’s co-pay. Ms. Loving stated that she would look into the issue and report back with the
findings.

Update on Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County
Emergency Department Project
Kim Velasquez, Director of Budget for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided an
update on the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Emergency Department project. This project involves
utilization of additional rooms in the Emergency Department at Oak Forest Hospital. Obtaining the units
necessary to complete the project was expected to take at least three or four months. After the System
Board and County Board approved the Master Lease Agreement with Bank of America, she stated that
they were able to create a line item in the operations account and transfer funds for such purposes, which
will move things forward much sooner.
________________________________

Update on 2009 and 2010 Budget – Adoption and Implementation
Ms. Velasquez provided an update on planning for the 2010 Budget. She distributed the calendar, which
contains timetables and other information relevant to the budget planning process (Attachment #5). She
added that they had their kick-off meeting on July 15th.
Discussion took place on the possible impact to the FY2010 budget and planning process if the roll-back
of the sales tax increase remains in effect (if Cook County Board President Todd Stroger’s attempts to
veto the measure in September are unsuccessful).
Chairman Carvalho noted that normally the governing office would give direction to the departments to
come in with a budget that equals 100% ± x%.
Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau and Jeff McCutchan, Supervisor of the
Transactions and Health Law Division of the Office of the State’s Attorney, provided information on the
subject. They stated that on July 21, 2009, the County Board passed a resolution which included a
directive that going forward, the elected officials and other County entities would have to produce a
budget that is based upon actual revenues received in 2009 and then adjusted to reflect the half-percent
roll-back of the sales tax. Ms. Reidy added that this directive in the form of a resolution will most likely
be translated into some form of procedural directive from the County’s Budget Director, Takashi
Reinbold.

Review and discuss the Report of the Finance Committee

 Vendor Performance Comparison 2009

38

• While HRM’s conversion results for 2009, are 25% of net
placements and 12% of total placements these numbers still
include special project referrals as well as a significant number of
referrals for 2432’s only.
•The same applies to GLM and ESI.
•Although the numbers suggest that HRM is out performing all
other vendors currently in 2009, this is simply not the case.

• In comparison CEA works disability cases only which are by far
more difficult, they have a 48 hr accept or return window, cases
take longer to convert to Medicaid, and their referral inventory
does not include special project referrals of any type.

O&M Mentoring Program

Executive Level Commitment
Owens & Minor is committed to sourcing from small‐, woman‐, minority‐, and veteran‐owned 
businesses. Through our commitment, we invest in developing and championing processes that build 
sound infrastructure and ethical practices within a diverse group of manufacturing and service 
organizations. We believe our commitment to supplier diversity and supplier development promotes 
long‐term sustainable growth and a more reliable supply chain for our customers. 
 
At Owens & Minor, we maintain our diverse supplier base by continually reaching out to small, woman‐, 
minority‐, and veteran‐owned businesses on a proactive basis and by maintaining an active file in a 
broad range of product and service areas. Through these supplier relationships we cultivate 
collaborative engagements between our customers, our suppliers, and our company.  
 
We strive to enhance the supplier diversity process for our customers. By building strong relationships 
with a talented arsenal of more than 1000 diverse organizations that offer quality products and services 
at competitive prices, we regularly bring diverse organizations forward to our customers as a direct 
resource both inside and outside a traditional medical surgical product arena. By fostering these 
relationships across a broad range of product and service areas, we help our customers meet their 
diversity goals.  
 
Finally, we believe that diversity in our supplier base not only allows us to help our hospital 
customers meet their diversity requirements, it also helps us bring forward innovative and unique 
solutions that support our customers’ needs. Small‐, women‐, minority, and veteran‐owned 
businesses are agile businesses that create jobs in the communities we serve around the nation.  As 
such, we know that supplier diversity benefits our communities and our customers by fostering a 
healthy, competitive small business environment that serves healthcare. 

Executive Leadership
Owens & Minor’s senior leadership team has demonstrated their full support of Supplier Diversity 
development in many ways. Gil Minor, Chairman of the Board, and Craig Smith, CEO, both attend and 
participate in Owens & Minor’s Supplier Diversity Symposium which attracts dozens of diverse suppliers 
as participants each year. Mr. Minor and Mr. Smith champion our philosophy and commitment with 
other industry leaders. In fact, both of these executives have been recipients of Supplier Diversity 
Awards from VMSDC.  Further, Hugh Gouldthorpe, Senior Vice President of Quality and 
Communications, has also received several diversity awards from local and regional minority business 
councils including the Metropolitan Business League, Urban League, and National Black MBA 
Association. 
 
Perhaps the best response to this question is to share the words of our senior executives directly.  From 
the following examples, you will see that Owens & Minor’s commitment to diversity permeates the 
organization, starting from the very top.  
“We know from experience that some of the most innovative, dedicated, and dependable 
suppliers fall into the minority and woman‐owned category. As a national company, Owens & 

 59
Minor has the opportunity to reach out across the country to tap this huge resource. It’s good for 
healthcare and it’s the right thing to do.”  ‐‐ G. Gilmer Minor III, Chairman, Owens & Minor 
 “…We also believe in supporting the ideal of diversity as we conduct our daily business. We 
strive each year to increase the diversity of our supplier base, as we also work to ensure that our 
teammates reflect the diversity around us. We are proud of our achievements in this area.” ‐‐ 
Craig R. Smith, President & Chief Executive Officer 
 

 
Finally, our leadership’s commitment to Supplier Diversity is reflected also in its being an integral part of 
our work in our community and in our message to our shareholders. Examples of this include our 2007 
Annual Report and a September 2008, Richmond Times Dispatch article, “Health Care has Diverse 
Needs,” which covers their participation in a luncheon with Virginia Governor, Tim Kaine.  

Diversity Resources
Owens & Minor leadership has shown its support by creating a Director level position for a certified 
supplier diversity practitioner that is 100% dedicated to leading our Supplier Diversity initiative and 
managing the budget that is dedicated to developing Supplier Diversity over time.  
 
“As Owens & Minor’s first Director of Supplier Diversity, I can attest to the fact that I have 
enjoyed the full support of the senior management team over the last several years. I have 
enjoyed opportunities to present to the O&M Board of Directors, because it has helped me to 
know that I am working on something that our leaders feel is of the utmost importance to our 
organization’s growth.” – Angela Wilkes, Director of Diversity and Small Business Liaison Officer 

Reports/Goals
 At Owens & Minor we are committed to pursuing our supplier diversity initiative without compromising 
quality, service or costs. Our objectives are to:
 
 Establish Owens & Minor as the leader in profitable supplier diversity relationships in 
healthcare. 
 Thoroughly integrate supplier diversity into our entire product and service purchasing mix. 
 Regularly evaluate sourcing opportunities with small, minority‐, woman‐ and veteran‐owned 
businesses.  
 Cultivate relationships with innovative, diverse sourcing partners and mentor promising 
organizations to foster sustainable growth. 
 Encourage development of diverse talent pools through investment and volunteerism in the 
communities where we work everyday. 
 

Mentoring

 60
An excellent example of our work in the Supplier Diversity arena is Owens & Minor’s work within its 
Mentor‐Protégé Agreement with the Department of Defense and our engagement with MAC Medical as 
protégé and a supplier to our private label portfolio, and our engagement with Virginia State University, 
a premier Historically Black University in support of the mentor‐protégé agreement.  
Over  the  last  decade,  as  part  of  its  service  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense,  Owens  &  Minor 
created  a  successful  mentor‐protégé  relationship  with  Kerma  Medical,  a  Virginia  based,  minority‐
owned supplier. As a result of this agreement and Owens & Minor supporting KERMA, the supplier 
grew to what is now a multi‐million dollar business with more than 80 employees and two locations.  
 
Today,  Owens  &  Minor  has  an  MPP  agreement  with  MAC  Medical.  MAC  Medical  is  a  medical 
products  distribution  and  packaging  firm  located  in  Chicago,  Illinois.  MAC  has  been  identified  by 
Owens  &  Minor  as  a  value‐added  supply  chain  partner  in  the  performance  of  the  Department  of 
Defense Gen III Contract as well as commercial customers/IDNs.  MAC Medical has worked diligently 
to become a valued Owens & Minor Supplier for paper products in the execution of this contract.  
Also,  using  the  centralized  location  of  the  Chicago‐based  MAC  Medical  Warehouse,  we  have 
achieved  significant  efficiency  in  the  distribution  of  key  products  to  the  Department  of  Defense 
Medical Treatment Facilities and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers.   
As a part of the MPP agreement, Owens & Minor has also entered into its first partnership with a 
Historically  Black  College‐‐Virginia  State  University.  Virginia  State  University,  America’s  first  fully 
state supported four‐year institution of higher learning for Blacks, is a comprehensive university and 
one of two land‐grant institutions in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Located in Petersburg, Virginia 
(within  25  minutes  of  Owens  &  Minor’s  corporate  headquarters),  the  University  is  a  level  V 
institution  offering  45  baccalaureate  and  master’s  and  doctoral  degree  programs.    With  the 
assistance of VSU, Owens & Minor has provided MAC Medical with research and product strategy 
development assistance. 

What follows is reprint of a public announcement of our Mentor Protégé relationships and our 
relationship with Virginia State University that was featured in the VSU Alumni Magazine issue from the 
winter of 2007‐2008. 
 

VSU Facilitates Mentor/Protégé Partnership 
 
Virginia  State  University  (VSU)  and  Owens  &  Minor,  a  Virginia‐based,  FORTUNE  500  company 
and the nation’s leading distributor of name brand medical and surgical supplies to the acute‐
care  industry,  will  work  together  in  an  innovative  partnership  to  provide  business  mentoring 
services  to  MAC  Medical  Supply  Company,  Inc.,  a  certified,  woman‐owned  medical  supply 
manufacturer and distributor.  
 
Owens & Minor has enrolled Chicago‐based MAC Medical Supply under its U.S. Department of 
Defense  (DoD)  Mentor‐  Protégé  Program.  Under  the  three‐year  agreement,  VSU  will  serve  as 
the  Development  Assistance  Provider  to  Owens  &  Minor  and  MAC  Medical  Supply,  working 
closely with both companies.  
 
For MAC Medical Supply, VSU will identify the company’s business and market profile and will 
assist in developing business, marketing and market penetration plans. For mentoring company 

 61
Owens  &  Minor,  VSU  will  assist  in  establishing  performance  benchmarks  for  MAC  Medical 
Supply  and  will  also  monitor  progress  toward  these  benchmarks.  VSU  will  also  help  MAC 
Medical  with  the  following  additional  services:  developing  publications,  developing  and 
implementing a training  program for  MAC  Medical Supply employees, and creating a strategic 
business and marketing plan.  
 
Dr. V.K. Mummalaneni, chair of VSU’s department of marketing and management, will serve as 
project director. VSU Provost, Dr. W. Eric Thomas will serve as Principal Investigator. The DoD 
Mentor‐Protégé program was created by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1991 to encourage 
more women‐ and minority‐owned businesses to become defense department contractors and 
vendors.  DoD  prime  vendors,  including  Owens  &  Minor,  work  with  the  protégé  companies, 
nurturing  them  with  infrastructure  and  business  development,  training,  increased  sales 
opportunities and sharing of resources.   
Through skill enhancement aided by developmental assistance, this Mentor‐Protégé Agreement 
between  Owens  &  Minor  and  MAC  Medical  and  VSU  serves  to  develop  a  woman‐owned 
business  as  a  potential,  high‐quality,  direct  supplier  to  the  Department  of  Defense  as  well  as 
Owens  &  Minor’s  commercial  sector  customers.  This  mentoring  relationship  enhances  MAC 
Medical’s  ability  to  execute  consolidation  strategies  for  maximum  results  throughout  the 
Department of Defense and the healthcare industry. 
 

Training Owens & Minor’s Sales Teammates on the Value of Supplier 
Diversity 
 
  This internal, teammate education piece developed through a joint effort between Owens & Minor 
University, Owens & Minor’s Supplier Diversity Department, and Owens & Minor Marketing 
represents a high‐level brief to over 300 sales and leadership teammates across the country who 
have an ability to foster local supplier development and impact local sourcing decisions both 
internally and at our customers daily.

Best Practices

How We Measure Success in Supplier Diversity

 62

 
Owens & Minor’s senior management believes that in order for the company to achieve superior 
performance, a critical component of its business operation must be an ongoing search for the best 
possible industry practices that drive operating targets so that supplier diversity and supplier 
development can result in long‐term sustainable growth and a more reliable supply chain.   
 
To that end, the company has taken steps over the years to understand, and compare itself to, the best 
practices in the industry.  Where industry leaders and competitors are strong in given areas, efforts are 
taken by Owens & Minor department leaders to uncover why and what measures can be modified and 
incorporated into the company's business operations. Metrics have also been put in place to quantify 
the effect of installing the practices.  For example, in 2008, part of the Director of Supplier Diversity 
performance plan was to grow MediChoice expenditures with women and small businesses by 14%. 
That target was exceeded by a significant margin.  Also, feedback from our customers in meeting their 
needs is critical. 
 
 
Essential to the benchmarking process, the company's supplier diversity initiative has received 
concerted management support.  Senior management's support is properly communicated throughout 
the organization and employees (especially the sales representatives and the purchasing staff) are 
aware that there is also a definite place for employee involvement in benchmarking. The company 
believes that the best way to implement best practices smoothly is through the efforts of those closest 
to the work process. In 2007, the company implemented web technology so that when purchasing 
opportunities come up, the purchasing staff can access a database of diverse suppliers and invite them 
to participate in the bidding process. The Supplier Diversity Department has also worked with a minority 
owned EEO consulting firm to help Owens & Minor develop and map a streamlined process to 
accurately track and measure quarterly spending with diverse suppliers. 
 
Owens & Minor also hosts a benchmarking event in its one‐of‐a‐kind annual Diversity Symposium 
hosted at its Corporate Headquarters. The symposium, hosted by Owens & Minor's President and CEO, 
brings together the best and brightest in the medical industry to discuss best practices, business 
improvement and how to better create equal access to minority and women owned organizations. The 
event includes Owens & Minor's Protégé, MAC Medical, Owens & Minor sales team, its customers, 
vendors and competitors from across the country. The theme of the 2008 symposium was "Forecasting 
the Healthcare Market for Supplier Diversity: Where Is It Going and Where Do I Fit?" The Keynote 
Speaker Charles R. Morris, a business historian and author, discussed the future of healthcare from the 
operating room to the boardroom. The event created a tremendous opportunity for small businesses to 
network with key industry players.
 

In Conclusion 
Owens & Minor is committed to supplier diversity. We invest in Supplier Diversity because we believe it 
makes good business sense.  We believe our commitment to supplier diversity and supplier 
development will serve to promote long‐term sustainable growth and a more reliable supply chain for 
our customers. Further, we believe that fostering the development of a growing base of diverse 
suppliers to the healthcare industry ultimately can help lower rising healthcare costs. Entrepreneurship 

 63
and diverse viewpoints is the lifeblood of innovation.  A thriving community of diverse suppliers 
generates healthy competition and innovative delivery methods that can ultimately help drive cost out 
of the Supply Chain, and to Owens & Minor, that’s good business.

Supplier Diversity Program Portfolio

Agreements in the Supplier Diversity Program portfolio support Novation and members?
commitment to minority, women and small veteran (veteran, disabled veteran, service-disabled
veteran) business enterprises, or MWVBEs. Some of the agreements provide an alternative
offering to the low best bid award.

The contract summaries for these agreements clearly designate that the suppliers were awarded
through the program, and they also include information on whether the business participated in the
bid process and the rationale Novation used in offering the contract. Members may wish to
consider under the noted circumstances whether the contract quali?es under their competitive bid
mandates.

- Distribution Agreements

All the businesses in the groups described above meet Novation's Supplier Diversity Program
requirements, as detailed below. The Novation status may change at any time based on changes in
ownership or certi?cation expiration dates.

Requirements

To ensure the validity of each business as a MW VBE and to objectively measure its quali?cations,
Novation developed its own business de?nition and statement of business classi?cation for these
businesses in conjunction with federal regulations.

This statement of business classi?cation must be signed in order to be eligible to participate in
Novation?s Supplier Diversity Program. MWVBES must also provide Novation with a valid
certi?cation from one of the agencies listed in the business de?nition and statement of business
classi?cation document. A business will not be entered into the diversity database as approved or
active until this process is completed.

As described above, the contracted or registered businesses have represented to Novation that they
are certi?ed as MWVBES. Novation has not independently veri?ed such status and makes no
warranty or guarantee, expressed or implied, as to the completeness or accuracy of such
representation.

Memo
To: Cook County Health and Hospital System
Finance Committee
From: Bonnie "Pete" Thomas M.D., Medical Director, bonnie~w~thomasjr@yahoo.com
Marcus T. Murray, Executive Director, rnr.murray@sbcglobal.net

RE: Questions concerning Project Brotherhood Funding
We understand that questions were asked concerning some details of Project Brotherhood
funding. We will attempt to answer those questions briefly below. Please feel free to contact us
directly if you.
GRANT FUNDING: Project Brotherhood has been supported through outside grants
throughout its inception. The original support $30,000 provided by Stroger Hospital Department
of Trauma provided the needs assessment for the program in our inception. Michael Reese
Foundation supplied grants during the first two years. The major and consistent funding has been
federal dollars under Title X for Male Reproductive Health. In addition to Title X funding, we
have had in the past funding through the Illinois Department of Public Health Minority Health
Department, American Cancer Society - Illinois Chapter, AIDS Foundation of Chicago. These
grants have supported our Executive Director (Mr. Murray), a variety of part time"consu1tants"
(e.g. barbers, yoga instructors, social workers, student workers) and supply refreshments,
supplies, T-shirts and other incentives used with Barbershops, outreach programs like health
fairs, and working with students. We have periodically received grants to work directly with
neighborhood High Schools.
Today we are funded by a Minority Health (IDPH) HIV initiative of $100,000 due to end
August 30,2009 and our Title X grant of $140,000. We have provided Mr. Magee with the
budgets for these grants.
SYSTEM FUNDING:

Historical Background: Clearly with such small grants, the in kind support of the health
system has been critical. The previous senior management of ACHN was committed to
developing a network of Community Health Centers that would address the needs of the
community. An important goal of the previous leadership was to have each health center

 98
maintain extended hours and remain open two evenings a week and a half a day on Saturday.
Unfortunately budget cuts never allowed these goals to be realized. However, Woodlawn Health
Center chose to be open on Thursday evenings and devote that session to Project Brotherhood.
Present System Contributions:
Personnel Costs:
Today the regular staff assignments of clerks, nurses, and lab technicians are simply shifted to
accommodate the Project Brotherhood session. No overtime is permitted for such sessions in the
system today. The budget for Woodlawn that is printed in the budget documents is misleading. It
is not unusual for the budget to not accurately reflect who is actually working at a center. More
importantly, the most expensive personnel (physicians) are not listed if they are budgeted
elsewhere. Provider time from ACHN, Provident, and CCDPH Physicians as well as unpaid
volunteer physicians comprise the largest dollar in kind contributions. The physicians that staff
Project Brotherhood simply count this session as one of their assigned clinical responsibilities.
The Woodlawn staff is devoted to Project Brotherhood and the entire atmosphere of the center
changes on Thursday evenings.
Non-personnel Costs:
These are difficult to determine because they are not usually reported by health center. However,
Woodlawn is a city owned building and shared with a Chicago Department of Health Mental
health center; and there is no cost to the County for rent or most utilities. The County system
pays for phones used by County staff, security and cleaning for the entire building. So the
marginal cost of the program is simply the cost of security.
Utilization: The Project Brotherhood session normally sees around thirty medical patients and
another 25-30 patients for a variety of non-exam room activites per evening. The medical
utilization is easily within the range seen in the other 10 sessions a week that occur at Woodlawn
Health Center.
