CHAIRMAN BELL:

Good morning and

2

welcome.

I would like to call the meeting to

3

order.

4

we'd like to try to get through it and be

5

mindful of everyone's time and attendance today,

6

and thank you all for participating with us on

7

this Board and in this activity.

We have a pretty full agenda today and

8
9

So I think I'll just get right into
the agenda.

First we're going to have an

10

update on our articles of incorporation.

11

will be brief.

12

them know what's happened subsequent to the last

13

meeting?

14

It

David, why don't you just let

MR. NAREFSKY:

It will be brief.

The

15

articles have been filed.

16

Trust is a not-for-profit under Illinois law.

17

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Congratulations.

Great.

The

Thank you very

much for your help on that.
Update on our bylaws.

Since the

20

last meeting, the only major revision we've had

21

with the bylaws is we have documented what

22

always was this Board's intent in terms of how

23

we would cooperate with the City's Inspector

24

General so that language is now part of our

 3
1

bylaws, and so I'm going to open it up to the

2

rest of the Board to see if there are any other

3

comments because I think today we probably want

4

to put to vote whether or not we'd like to adopt

5

those bylaws as written knowing that with the

6

majority vote of this Board we can amend them as

7

necessary as we learn more as we start to

8

operate.

9
10

Any other comments on the bylaws?
MR. HOFFMAN:

I'll make a comment.

11

Mr. Chairman, as you note, there's a new section

12

in the bylaws, 9.8, titled cooperation with IGO,

13

the Inspector General's Office.

14

I think this is a great addition,

15

and I want to first commend you for the

16

leadership in pushing forward to both have the

17

language as it is and also to push it to be in

18

the bylaws.

19

We could have our intent and our

20

policy stated without anything written, we could

21

have had a separate policy or we could have had

22

the bylaws.

23

to do it, and I really appreciate your pushing

24

for its inclusion in the bylaws, and I really

To me this was the most secure way

 4
1

appreciate your pushing for this language.

2

I think it's clear that the intent

3

of the language and what it says is that the

4

programs and operations of the Trust are within

5

the jurisdiction of the Inspector General's

6

Office, and they have the ability to conduct

7

investigations, audits or reviews of what we do,

8

and we shall cooperate, which is exactly what I

9

believe was important.

I know everyone on the

10

Board believes and I know especially you,

11

Mr. Chairman, have been pushing for this.

12

So I think this is very positive.

13

I'm very pleased with the language.

14

intent is clear and to me this puts the issue to

15

rest.

16

I think the

I think that the rest of bylaws,

17

I've read them, and I think they're good.

I

18

don't really have any comments or objections.

19

You and I have talked about this, the ability --

20

our ability as a Board to amend them, to add to

21

them as we see issues since we're so new makes

22

me comfortable in reading and thinking I don't

23

know if there's something missing but if there

24

is we can deal with it later.

 5
1

So with that I have no further

2

comments and I would support our adoption of

3

them.

4
5

CHAIRMAN BELL:
the table.

Is there a second?

6

MS. FERGUSON:

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

So we have a motion on

I'll second the motion.
I'll call for the vote.

All in favor?
(A chorus of ayes.)
All opposed?
(No response.)
That's it.

Then we've adopted our

bylaws as currently written.
The next item on the agenda is the

15

election of the officers.

16

proposed that John Pope be nominated and

17

considered for Vice Chair and Diana Ferguson for

18

secretary and treasurer.

19

At our last meeting I

Not having heard from any of the

20

other Board Members of any alternatives, I would

21

like to also call for a vote there unless

22

there's other comments.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

So moved.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

Second.

 6
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

(A chorus of ayes.)

3
4
5

All in favor?

Good.

Now I can share some of this

work.
MR. HOFFMAN:

James, before we move on,

6

you and I had talked about the conflict of

7

interest policy, and I'm wondering whether

8

that -- and is that included -- I didn't want --

9

I think I saw that it was listed as an

10

attachment to the bylaws, even though it's a

11

separate document.

12

As you know, my view is that -- I

13

saw there were some changes, but I don't think

14

they addressed all the things that need to be

15

changed, and I think it needs some more work and

16

I think we have time, so my recommendation would

17

be that we pass the bylaws but --

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Dave and I had a

19

discussion this morning.

I don't think yet

20

we've worked out -- given what we talked about

21

last meeting, we've worked on all the concerns

22

around conflict of interest and we do want to

23

get our independent legal to take a look at that

24

and make sure that all the Board Members are

 7
1

covered and will know how to act accordingly to

2

make sure that we don't have a perception or any

3

real conflicts of interest.

4

So we're going to hold that open.

5

We're going to hold the conflict of interest

6

document open.

7

but with the caveat that we're going to go work

8

on the conflict of interest document, have our

9

outside legal help us to make sure that we

10

capture all the concerns and we address the

11

issues appropriately for each of the Board

12

Members.

We've accepted the basic bylaws

That's duly noted in the minutes.

13

Open Meeting Act training.

There is

14

a requirement that each of the Board Members,

15

and they just didn't single us out, this is all

16

employees and directors of the City and people

17

that are appointed by the City, have to take

18

this one hour I think it's an online course by

19

November 1.

20

So there's a document in your

21

handout that will tell you where to go and do

22

it.

23

it done by November 1st, put an hour aside and

24

just go through it because, as I understand, if

And I would advise all of us to try to get

 8
1

you walk away from it, it may seize up on you

2

and you'll have to start over so it's best to

3

get your training done all at once and get it

4

out of the way.

5

to do that.

6

So I would encourage everyone

Okay.

I think we can pass on the

7

resolution allowing telephone participation in

8

case of emergencies because that's included in

9

our bylaws.

There is a provision that Board

10

Members can attend by telephone, and I think

11

that will be adequate for those times and those

12

needs when any of the Board Members need to do

13

that so I think we can pass that.

14

Officers and directors insurance.

I

15

did get a note from Lois or was it you, Scott, I

16

can't remember, but the insurance, we need to go

17

out and procure it for our Board Members.

18

think we need to do that.

19

I

Obviously we can look at using the

20

City's resources.

They already have a broker

21

that they use.

22

reasonable.

23

within our budget constraint.

24

the numbers here somewhere.

The insurance seems to be

Something that we could deal with
I think I have

I just don't

 9
1

remember what I exactly did with them.

I think

2

the insurance brokers are USI Midwest and Arthur

3

J. Gallagher; is that correct?

4

MR. YONOVER:

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.
So we can decide to go

6

there.

7

for D and O coverage would be -- with limits of

8

5 million would be about $25,000, so something

9

that we can handle within the budget.

10

What they're saying the estimated cost

But what I'd like to do is maybe

11

have -- allow our treasurer to go out and look

12

at this and see if we can maybe pursue this and

13

then look at some other options.

14

need to get this done relatively soon in regards

15

to making sure we have adequate coverage to

16

protect us if we act in these capacities.

17

Any other thoughts or concerns?

18
19

Clearly we

(No response.)
Okay.

Diana, I'll give you this

20

e-mail and you can decide to contact them or you

21

can look at some other options but we have to

22

get that done.

23
24

Okay.

Status of applications for

our Federal Identification Number and the 501

 10
1

status.

2

David, do you have any -MR. NAREFSKY:

Well, on the first

3

point, with some documents that had been focused

4

on earlier, we have received promptly and will

5

obtain a Tax I.D. number for the Trust I'm sure

6

in the next few days.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

8

MR. NAREFSKY:

9

Good.
And activity is starting

on the -- now with the Trust being a

10

not-for-profit having bylaws, now we can move

11

forward on 501(c)(3) status as well.

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

13

ALDERMAN POPE:

The timing for the

14

Questions?

501(c)(3) again?

15

MR. NAREFSKY:

Well, the application I

16

think we can get done quite soon.

17

into how long it takes the IRS to review these,

18

and I can't really vouch for that.

19
20
21
22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Then you're

Any other questions for

David?
(No response.)
All right.

That concludes the

23

organizational matters I think we wanted to talk

24

about today, so let's move into the presentation

 11
1

by Steve Berlin.

2

Clearly this organization, this

3

group is absolutely focused on everything we do

4

that we do with the highest of ethics so we

5

thought it would be appropriate to have Steve

6

Berlin come in and give us a briefing on the

7

ethical programs that we have here in the City

8

of Chicago.

9

Steve?

MR. BERLIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10

I do have a brief power point which I can --

11

probably somebody who's more tech savvy than I,

12

and that would be Jacob.

13

this available obviously to everybody.

14

I will make copies of

Just by way of introduction, I'm

15

Steve Berlin, the Executive Director of the

16

City's Board of Ethics.

17

Many of you I know actually in various

18

capacities.

19

Some of you I know.

The Board of Ethics, just by way of

20

introduction, is a small City agency with just

21

eight full-time staff members.

22

that's appointed by the Mayor, confirmed by City

23

Council.

24

They serve without compensation.

We have a board

Currently we have six board members.
We administer

 12
1

and enforce the City's Governmental Ethics

2

Ordinance.

3

Now, I want to say that our board

4

has looked through its case law and has rendered

5

an opinion that the Members of the

6

Infrastructure Trust Board are, in fact, members

7

of a City agency for purposes of Chapter 2-156

8

and therefore are subject to the Governmental

9

Ethics Ordinance as City employed officials,

10

therefore, all of you have filed your statements

11

of financial interests and your ethics pledges

12

which are required by Mayor Emanuel.

13

the post employment ethics pledges.

14

Those are

The import of that statement is that

15

as far as conflicts of interest go, as far as

16

gifts go, the Members of the Infrastructure

17

Trust Board are subject to the Ethics Ordinance

18

as City appointed officials, so except for

19

Alderman Pope who is subject to it as an elected

20

official of the City.

21

capacities.

22

He serves in two

What that means essentially just by

23

way of -- if I can just bounce back.

We have

24

four basic functions at the Board of Ethics and

 13
1

then I'll get to substance here.

2

The first and most important is to

3

give advice and guidance.

4

as some of you know is our bread and butter

5

work.

6

advisory opinions a year.

7

confidential.

8

Advice and guidance

We issue about 6,000 formal and informal
They are all

And that means that when people

9

contact us with questions about gifts, about

10

conflicts of interest, we render the opinion,

11

whether it's telephonic or it is e-mail or it is

12

a formal written opinion that's signed by either

13

me as the Executive Director or the Chairman,

14

Miguel Ruiz, it's rendered and it's

15

confidential.

16

Confidentiality means that we don't

17

share the fact that a person has come to us for

18

an opinion or the nature of their question or

19

the nature of their opinion unless we have the

20

person's permission to do that.

21

we need a waiver from the individual who

22

requested the opinion from us before we will

23

even confirm that an opinion has rendered, and

24

to the effect that a person allows us to discuss

In other words,

 14
1

the substance of the opinion, we will.

2

very critical point about what we do.

3

That's a

Unfortunately, it's a commonly

4

misunderstood point about what we do, but it's

5

right there in the law.

6

know that when you contact me for an advisory

7

opinion, that advisory opinion is completely

8

confidential.

9

And all of you should

Also we do education.

All of the

10

members of the Infrastructure Trust Board

11

pursuant to the changes that were made to the

12

Governmental Ethics Ordinance that will become

13

effective on November 1st will be required to

14

take an annual ethics training.

15

We've had all of the City employees

16

take that training since calendar 2006, so now

17

we will be covering the additional 2,100 or so

18

appointed officials of the City.

19

separate training program for them because they

20

are subject to the ordinance in a slightly

21

different way, and that will in all likelihood

22

be on the Internet, although it's conceivable

23

that we could come out and do a face-to-face

24

training as well.

We will do a

 15
1

Third, we are a regulatory body

2

which means that we collect public disclosures.

3

Those of you who are members of the media know

4

what kind of disclosures we collect; the two

5

forms that I mentioned before, the ethics

6

pledges and the statements of financial

7

interests that are required of all City

8

appointed officials who serve on boards or

9

commissions that are not solely advisory, such

10
11

as this one, file those every year.
The last basic function that we have

12

is that to a limited degree we are an

13

enforcement agency, and our enforcement

14

authority is set forth in the Governmental

15

Ethics Ordinance.

16

We have the authority to investigate

17

and make recommendations and make determinations

18

and adjudications as to whether persons subject

19

to the Governmental Ethics Ordinance have

20

violated one or more of the provisions of that

21

ordinance, and all of our investigative work is

22

also by law confidential.

23
24

Now, one of the substantive topics
that I want to talk about first is gifts.

 16
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

2

MR. BERLIN:

3

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I have a question now.

Yes, please.
The forms that we

4

filled out earlier, we all filled out the

5

financial interest statement and the pledge.

6

Your team, your office has reviewed those?

7

MR. BERLIN:

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

Yes.
And you would let us

know if you had any issues?

10

MR. BERLIN:

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

12

of this date there are no issues?

13

MR. BERLIN:

That's correct.
So we should assume as

If you don't hear from us,

14

you can assume that there are no issues with the

15

form.

16

available on the Internet.

It's complete.

They are also made

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

MR. BERLIN:

Okay.

So all the information on

19

that form is public information.

20

days we used to ask for a home address.

21

don't do that for people who file electronically

22

so you need not worry about that.

23
24

In the old
We

But all that information is public
information.

It's kept on file or online with

 17
1

the Board of Ethics for seven years, and then

2

after seven years those forms will be destroyed

3

pursuant to our records retention schedule with

4

the local Records Commissioner of Cook County.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

To make sure, Steve, I

6

understood you correctly too that if we -- as we

7

work through our efforts here and we get to

8

different deals, if we perceive that there may

9

be one, we should come to your office and have

10
11

you evaluate that?
MR. BERLIN:

Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.

12

In fact, one of the comments that I wanted to

13

make is that I'm glad in some ways that you're

14

still working on your conflicts of interest

15

provisions because you are all subject to the

16

City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance.

17

The conflicts of interest provisions

18

and the financial interest provisions in the

19

City's Governmental Ethics Ordinance are

20

changing, and those changes will become

21

effective on November 1st.

22

So one of the things that my office

23

and I have been doing is reviewing those

24

changes, and some of them are subtle, some of

 18
1

them are complex.

2

be in everybody's interests if we had some input

3

and had the ability to make some comments on

4

your bylaws so that they will conform completely

5

to the way the law is worded and the way we have

6

and will interpret that law.

7

And I think it would probably

But I think the very important point

8

here is that if there's ever a situation where

9

any of you or anybody who is subject to the

10

ordinance believes that there's a potential

11

conflict of interest, that's the time to pick up

12

the phone.

13

If we don't have the answer, we will

14

consult with either private counsel, your

15

private counsel if we have your authority to do

16

that, the Corporation Counsel or anybody else

17

that you direct us to, either to find facts or

18

to give an opinion so that the Members of the

19

Infrastructure Trust Board are covered.

20

Our jurisdiction extends solely to

21

Chapter 2-156 of the ordinance, not to the

22

bylaws specifically, but that's why I think it

23

behooves everybody to make sure that the bylaws

24

themselves are in -- that there's no ambiguity

 19
1

and that there's no difference in standards

2

between the law that's going to become effective

3

and the bylaws themselves.

4

Now, one of the things I do want to

5

mention though is gifts.

6

did notice is that there's a potential conflict

7

of interest if somebody receives gifts of a

8

substantial nature.

9

what is substantial.

10

One of the things we

That raises the question of

The law as it's going to take effect

11

on November 1st says that gifts to City

12

officials or City employees, with some

13

exceptions, are limited to $50 so certainly one

14

could posit that $50 would be substantial.

15

There are also provisions that

16

relate to representation of third parties.

17

appointed officials are prohibited from

18

representing third parties before any City

19

agency unless the matter of the representation

20

is wholly unrelated to what they do on the board

21

on which they serve.

City

22

So what that essentially means is

23

that appointed officials of the City, such as

24

members of the Trust Board, could not either act

 20
1

as attorneys or consultants or lobbyists on

2

behalf of third parties in front of City

3

agencies unless the matters on which they were

4

representing those lobbying law consulting

5

clients was unrelated to this Board.

6

Then conflicts of interest.

7

Generally speaking, as I say, I'm glad to hear

8

that the bylaws are still a work in progress,

9

but to the extent that there might be

10

interpretations of the bylaws and possibly

11

differing interpretations of the Governmental

12

Ethics Ordinance, I think the general rule would

13

be follow which is stricter, but I think it will

14

be -- it's good timing that we have a chance to

15

review or that we have a chance to finalize the

16

bylaws at this point.

17

But just to announce that the City's

18

Governmental Ethics Ordinance does have very

19

detailed provisions on conflicts of interest,

20

when recusing is required and certain

21

transactions that might, in fact, be prohibited

22

depending on the facts, which is why we are

23

here, why our office exists.

24

One other provision that I do want

 21
1

to point out is the prohibited loans provision.

2

What it says is that any City official or City

3

employee or their spouse or their domestic

4

partner cannot have or receive loans from

5

entities or persons doing business with the City

6

unless those loans are made by lending

7

institutions, financial lending institutions in

8

the ordinary course of business.

9

So, for example, I could put a

10

mortgage on my house with the Northern Trust

11

Company, but I could not, for example, or my

12

outside business, should I have one, could not

13

have a loan with ABC construction company which

14

is not normally in the business of making loans

15

if ABC construction company has contracts with

16

the City.

17

Then the last thing I just wanted to

18

remind everybody here of is that the Members of

19

the Infrastructure Trust Board, as have other

20

appointees of Mayor Emanuel, have signed a

21

revolving door pledge.

22

pledge imposes restrictions that have now been

23

codified or will be codified as of November 1st

24

as to the activities that you can do or can't do

The revolving door

 22
1

after you would leave, for example, the

2

Infrastructure Trust Board or if I were, for

3

example, to retire from my position with the

4

Board of Ethics, certain things that I could and

5

couldn't do, certain persons or certain

6

transactions that I could and could not work on

7

for a certain period of time.

8

And the last thing I just want to

9

remind everybody here of is that the primary

10

function of the City's Board of Ethics is to

11

answer questions and render advisory opinions.

12

Not everybody has standing to ask for an

13

advisory opinion.

14

Our jurisdiction and our authority

15

to render advisory opinions is limited to City

16

officials, City employees, lobbyists,

17

contractors or their attorneys or former

18

employees.

19

falls within our jurisdiction.

20

people sitting in this room fall within our

21

jurisdiction, but many people don't, and that's

22

a commonly misunderstood point.

23
24

Everybody sitting at these tables
Many of the

But even if a person does not fall
within our jurisdiction, we will do our best to

 23
1

answer their question within the bounds of our

2

law.

3

But everybody sitting at this table

4

or these two tables should know that they

5

have -- they fall within the jurisdiction, the

6

ambit, the purview of the Board of Ethics and

7

can ask us for an official advisory opinion.

8
9

And our authority to render opinions
is set forth in law, and our authority is

10

limited to Chapter 2-156 of the Municipal Code

11

which is the City's Governmental Ethics

12

Ordinance.

13

And our mantra in the office is that

14

there really is no such thing as a stupid

15

question, so I do want to stress that to

16

everybody here.

17
18

MR. HOFFMAN:

In that spirit, can I

jump in, please?

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

MR. BERLIN:

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23
24

Absolutely.

Nice to see you.
Nice to see you too.
I think your point about

retiring is a moot point.
You started by -- a question about I

 24
1

think you said right at the beginning about

2

our -- I think you said there was an opinion

3

that the Board or that you and counsel had

4

rendered that we were a City agency.

5

MR. BERLIN:

For purposes of

6

Chapter 2-156, the Infrastructure Trust Board is

7

a City agency.

8
9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Okay.

And I assume that

that means -- that goes with the statement that

10

the Ethics Ordinance applies to us and our

11

activities and that the ethics -- the Board of

12

Ethics has jurisdiction over us.

13

MR. BERLIN:

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's correct.
Okay.

Would you say that

15

that therefore means that the Inspector

16

General's Office has jurisdiction over us in the

17

same way?

18

MR. BERLIN:

That's something that I

19

don't have the authority to answer because the

20

answer to that question, which might have been

21

address by the Corporation Counsel which I think

22

would be the appropriate body to ask that

23

question of, falls within the Inspector

24

General's enabling ordinance which is

 25
1
2

Chapter 256.
MR. HOFFMAN:

So you're saying we might

3

be, in your view we could be a City agency for

4

the Board of Ethics but not for the Inspector

5

General's Office?

6

MR. BERLIN:

I would say that -- all I

7

would say is that I would agree with the first

8

half of your question which I know that you are

9

a City agency for purposes of the Ethics

10
11

Ordinance.
As to whether you could or couldn't

12

be for purposes of other provisions of the code,

13

that I don't have the authority to answer.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

The only other question I

15

wanted to ask was if given that -- here's the

16

hypothetical that will never happen, but suppose

17

that someone believes that there has been a --

18

they want to make an allegation of unethical

19

conduct regarding the Trust staff or Board, and

20

they come to you with that, and the allegation

21

itself looks like it's something that would rise

22

to the level of misconduct and would be

23

investigated by the IG's Office.

24

something that you would in the normal course

Is that

 26
1

send over to the IG's office?

2

MR. BERLIN:

We have that authority.

3

We have the authority to involve investigative

4

agencies in our investigations.

5

investigate it ourselves if we believe that it

6

would constitute a violation of the City's

7

Governmental Ethics Ordinance.

8

discretion to involve investigating agencies or

9

to refer the matter completely to another

10

We could

We also have the

investigator agency.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

And I'll short circuit

12

this.

13

we feel comfortable that if you get any sort of

14

allegations that you decide you're not going to

15

investigate that you will refer it over to the

16

IG's Office?

17

I guess the point of the question is can

MR. BERLIN:

As a general matter where

18

possible we would.

I think it's hard to give a

19

general answer, but generally we would refer

20

complaints whenever possible to any

21

investigative agency that we believe can act on

22

it.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

MR. BERLIN:

Thank you for coming.
Good to see you.

 27
1
2

CHAIRMAN BELL:
Steve?

I just have one.

3

You mentioned several times about

4

reviewing our bylaws.

5

them?

6
7

MR. BERLIN:

10

Do you have a copy of

I have a copy that we took

off the Internet.

8
9

Any other questions of

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

That's not the

updated version or has it been updated on the
Internet?

11

MR. YONOVER:

I will get him a copy.

12

MR. BERLIN:

I don't know that it is.

13

I think it was dated the 27th of July.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

And I would be interested

15

in your review of the draft conflict of interest

16

policy.

17

thought should be changed, and you'll see when

18

you read it, is that the first part of it has a

19

definition of financial interest that is

20

included in the policy, and then later it says

21

the definition of financial interest shall be

22

the one in the Governmental Ethics Ordinance.

23
24

One of the things that I noted that I

MR. BERLIN:

Yes.

That's a good point

also because you may or may not know that the

 28
1

definition of financial interest has changed

2

substantially in the Governmental Ethics

3

Ordinance, and that new definition will take

4

effect on November 1st.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

restrictive?

7
8

It is more restrictive,

It is definitely more restrictive.

9
10

I mean, is it --

MR. BERLIN:
yes.

CHAIRMAN BELL:

MR. BERLIN:

12

CHAIRMAN BELL:

16

We

Thank you.
Okay.

Thank you,

Next we'll have an update on the
Retrofit Chicago Project.

Lois?

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

17

morning, everyone.

18

Mr. Berlin.

19

Thank you.

Steve.

14
15

Okay.

will wait to hear back from you on that.

11

13

So is it more

Good

I'm a little shorter than

This is going to be a very brief

20

update on Retrofit Chicago.

We had a fairly

21

good discussion of it at the last board meeting,

22

and this is just part of a periodic report we'll

23

be making to you on projects that we hope to

24

bring before you in the near future.

 29
1

Bottom line, the City and sister

2

agencies are working very diligently on

3

identifying the energy efficiency projects that

4

could achieve the goals that we outlined and the

5

proof points we outlined at our last meeting,

6

specifically to identify ways to do cross

7

governmental borrowing programs and financing

8

programs, to find ways of doing real risk

9

transfer, and to find more efficient capital

10

structures, and we're working very diligent on

11

on that.

12

The City has identified a citywide

13

steering group that is having biweekly meetings.

14

That includes, but is not limited to,

15

representatives of the Department of Finance,

16

Fleet and Facility Management, that is what was

17

once called General Services.

18

that manages all of our buildings and the fleet,

19

the cars and the trucks that we operate.

20

Law Department of course, the Budget Office, our

21

Chief Sustainability Officer Karen Weigert and

22

the Public Building Commission.

23
24

That is the group

The

The Public Building Commission
earlier in 2011 -- actually beginning in 2011

 30
1

and continuing to 2012 went through a public RFP

2

process to identify ESCO providers, and we are

3

working with PBC to identify ways to partner

4

with them on the use of those ESCOs.

5

An ESCO is an Energy Savings

6

Company, and they basically are -- have worked

7

with governments around the country to generate

8

those energy efficiency savings.

9

do an audit of the prior utility bills, make a

They go in and

10

recommended plan that should happen, work on the

11

implementation of that plan and then the

12

commissioning of the project and monitoring of

13

savings.

14

We hope that we can disaggregate

15

some of those services when we present the

16

Retrofit Chicago Program to you for

17

consideration in a way that can get lower costs

18

for our government and higher savings for our

19

taxpayers.

20

In addition to the citywide group

21

that we have meeting, we have departmental and

22

agency meetings periodically.

23

departments that are proposing projects are

24

Department of Water Management, FFM, that's the

The key city

 31
1

Fleet and Facilities Group which has

2

responsibility for all the building, and the

3

Department of Aviation.

4

We also are meeting with the sister

5

agencies on a periodic basis.

We've now had I

6

believe three meetings with all the sister

7

agencies where we ask their head of facilities

8

and their CFOs to get involved with coming

9

together and learning about what we're doing

10

with Retrofit Chicago, so there is no agency in

11

the City that can say they do not know what

12

Retrofit Chicago is, how to connect with it,

13

that they are all briefed on what we hope to

14

bring to the Trust so they are familiar with

15

what might happen so that we've created a very

16

solid line of communication with the sister

17

agencies.

18

levels.

So we're doing it at both of those

19

ALDERMAN POPE:

Excuse me, Lois.

20

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

21

ALDERMAN POPE:

Yes?

Would the Department of

22

Transportation also be an agency or department

23

that would be included as part of this?

24

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

We have

 32
1

briefed them.

They are not -- the projects that

2

they have are slightly delayed and so the key

3

meeting that we're having on an almost

4

day-by-day basis it feels like, Karen, doesn't

5

it, CDOT isn't always part of those, but they do

6

have some projects we're developing with them

7

and that we expect to participate as well, yes.

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

9

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

The key

10

activity we're asking of all those departments

11

and all those agencies is really to focus on the

12

information we need to do this for each of the

13

individual underlying projects and we're talking

14

about hundreds that could be considered.

15

We are looking for them to prepare

16

and deliver to our working committee the project

17

name and location, a summary of the project,

18

what exactly are you trying to do, what is the

19

payback period that you're expecting, what kind

20

of savings do you expect from those

21

improvements, what specific energy conservation

22

measures are being planned for that building now

23

and in the future and any specific notable

24

features.

 33
1

So each and every one of those

2

projects, whether it's a $20,000 project or a

3

$5 million project, we're getting them that

4

information.

5

We are also then requiring that we

6

get a cash flow analysis for the entire life of

7

the financing that might work for them so that

8

we actually have the ability to project what the

9

savings are and to verify what those savings

10
11

might be.
We are also asking for a project

12

management plan, specific design for energy

13

conservation measures, an implementation plan

14

and then a very significant plan on measuring

15

and verifying savings.

16

We're also asking for each of the

17

sister agencies or departments to think about

18

the approval processes that's we're going to go

19

through before we bring it in front of the

20

Trust, which may include a letter by that

21

department's commissioner that the project is

22

approved or potentially inducement resolutions

23

of the governing bodies to say yes, this is a

24

project that we would like the Trust to consider

 34
1
2

with us.
Last I want to go through just a few

3

process steps as we're envisioning them and as

4

we're kind of working through.

5

to be developed as a draft calendar for how

6

we're working through this, but I don't want to

7

go through all of that gory level of detail but

8

give you a high level overview of the process

9

steps we're working towards.

10

These are going

The first is to develop the project

11

review process for Retrofit Chicago which is a

12

cross agency review of each of those projects,

13

then consider working with the Trust or have the

14

Trust release RFQs for its financial partners

15

and independent financial advisors, two very,

16

very different roles.

17

The first being the type of firms

18

that could actually invest in those projects,

19

and the second, the independent financial

20

advisors as required by the Executive Order of

21

Mayor Emanuel that sets forth all of the

22

criteria by which the Trust and its Board can

23

evaluate the proposal coming forward.

24

The next step would be some type of

 35
1

an informational update to City Council and to

2

the City agency boards as appropriate, and then

3

we're working on taking the data that we're

4

getting in each of the projects and populating a

5

data room so that to the extent we've identified

6

or you have identified financial partners, we'll

7

be able to share with those potential bidders

8

what data we have on the projects.

9

We would then hope to execute any

10

necessary agreements with PBC and/or its ESCOs

11

to verify some of those savings targets and the

12

implementation plans, then develop a recommended

13

plan of finance and seek for the consideration

14

by the Trust.

15

Once we get all those points above,

16

we want to be back in front of you to say this

17

is what we have collectively put together and

18

would like you to consider.

19

That would then enter into the

20

formal review process by whatever independent

21

financial advisor to assigned to such a project,

22

and then we would go for final bids for the

23

financing and bring it back for final approval

24

of the Trust and again culminating in City

 36
1

Council approval and/or the governing bodies.

2

That in a nutshell is some of the

3

process we're seeing and envisioning for

4

Retrofit Chicago, obviously subject to

5

discussion by the Trust and input from you all

6

on how you would like it to proceed.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Lois, a question.

8

Going back to the package that's being

9

assembled, I assume both for your purposes and

10

then also to be the information you draw from in

11

the package coming to us, is there a standard

12

for that?

13

Is there -- I mean, what are you

14

using as the guideline in terms of determining

15

what we'll need and how we will go about

16

evaluating or how you will go about evaluating?

17

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

We're

18

working with two groups.

One are the ESCO

19

providers that PBC has qualified and they are in

20

the business of actually developing standardized

21

methodologies for reviewing those projects, and

22

the second is working with the engineering firms

23

that are working with Chicago Public Schools

24

that have also developed methodologies.

 37
1

So we're bringing the best practices

2

from both of those together into a template and

3

organization of information that we're working

4

with Karen Weigert, our Chief Sustainability

5

Officer, on preparing for each project.

6

ALDERMAN POPE:

Chairman?

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Yes.

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

Lois, do you foresee

9

many projects not going to the PBC?

The PBC has

10

traditionally been the clearinghouse for City

11

and sister agency projects.

12

those projects that might not go through the

13

PBC?

Any examples of

14

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

15

think that there will be projects that won't go

16

through the PBC.

17

Schools has several projects that are in process

18

today under the management of the Chicago Public

19

Schools Facilities Group and not going through

20

PBC, and they have significant energy savings

21

associated with them.

22

Yeah, I

I think that Chicago Public

We think we might able to refinance

23

them through the Trust at a more efficient way

24

than what was otherwise available to them.

So I

 38
1

think there will be projects that don't require

2

the PBC.

3

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you.

4

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

But in

5

all cases we're going to need to identify a

6

process to say here's what we spent on energy

7

before, here's what the improvements are and

8

here's how we document what savings have

9

occurred from implementation of those

10

improvements, and that savings becomes the Trust

11

estate, if you will, that funds all of the

12

financing for those improvements.

13

critical piece, whether it's done by PBC or

14

others.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

16

CHAIRMAN BELL:

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

So that's a

Mr. Chairman.
Yes.

Lois, I've got some

18

questions about -- and I think this is maybe

19

for the Board as well about what our process

20

is to agree that this should be the first

21

project.

22

It's clear to me that the City and

23

you believe that this should be the first

24

project of the Trust.

 39
1
2

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

That's

correct.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

It would be an excellent

4

project.

5

on, you may be absolutely right.

6

that -- You know, this will be our first run

7

going through this.

8
9

It's in the public interest and so
It could be

It could be we could set up the
Trust so that whatever the City comes to us with

10

we accept as the project, and then we're in

11

charge of sort of figuring out the details or we

12

could set ourselves up so that we independently

13

have to make a call about whether we agree that

14

this should be the first project.

15

I'm hoping the latter should be our

16

approach, but I don't think that's really been

17

decided.

18

should this be the first project, then I think

19

it's important that at some point, and I don't

20

want to rush this, but maybe once we get an

21

executive director on board, but at some point I

22

think we should have some sort of a

23

meeting/hearing where we not only hear from Lois

24

and the City about why this would be a good idea

If it's up to us to decide, you know,

 40
1

but make sure that there's an opportunity for

2

others in the public and otherwise experts to

3

say that they disagree.

4

Frankly I'm not, you know -- when I

5

hear you talk about all this and the planning

6

that you're doing makes perfect sense because if

7

we are going to approve this, you want the

8

planning to be in place, so I understand that.

9

But I think we have to hear from other voices

10

about whether there are potential pitfalls with

11

this as a project that we may not be able to

12

assess ourselves.

13

And I don't suggest that that's

14

today or it may not even be at the next meeting,

15

but I think at some point before we decide, I

16

want to be able to hear from those voices.

17

The second thing is that -- and I

18

say that in part because to the extent I heard

19

any commentary after the last meeting, it was

20

about, you know, wait, have you guys decided on

21

Retrofit Chicago.

22

about whether that was decided or not.

There was some confusion

23

I also heard that there were some

24

portions of City government, including sister

 41
1

agencies, that were already including expected

2

savings from an Infrastructure Trust approved

3

project under Retrofit Chicago in not only

4

budgets but in presentations to their bond

5

investors and so on, as if it was a fact.

6

You know, obviously it's not a fact.

7

It hasn't happened yet.

8

prudent of any City agencies to do so because,

9

you know, something might fall apart or we might

10

I don't think that's

disagree.

11

And the only note of caution on that

12

I think in particular is that we know from past

13

practices, and some people would say past

14

mistakes, you don't want to see government get

15

too locked -- you don't want to see a government

16

get too locked into the savings before the deal,

17

right, because then there's pressure to do the

18

deal because you've already -- you need those

19

savings.

20

So I think whatever -- to the extent

21

that you agree with that, if you can communicate

22

with both sister agencies and other parts of

23

City government that, you know, it seems like a

24

very good idea, it's going to need some flushing

 42
1

out before the Trust so the Trust can make a

2

decision, but I wouldn't sort of put it in --

3

write it in stone in terms of their budgets or

4

savings or in public presentations to bond

5

investors.

6
7

That seems like a mistake.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Can I

respond, Mr. Chairman?

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Sure.

Absolutely.

9

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

I

10

couldn't agree more.

11

and precious things about the Trust is your

12

independence so that your ability to make --

13

have an independent view of some of these things

14

is really critically important and the driving

15

force behind the creation of the Trust is to be

16

the advocate for the public in an independent

17

and honest and open way.

18

important and I share that.

19

One of the most important

So that's critically

I would also say that in the process

20

I outlined this would be -- we've been invited

21

here by the Chairman to give an update on the

22

project that we think might be coming to the

23

Trust, but it's very clear in the calendering

24

that there are several spots along the way where

 43
1

the Trust will have to decide in your decision

2

whether you want to proceed with that or not,

3

and we have to be bound by that decision.

4

There's no -- you know, we can bring

5

it back for reconsideration if the Chairman

6

permitted us to put it on the agenda, but we do

7

have several spots, and every meeting that we

8

have is a public meeting, so there's public

9

comment.

People are free to come forward at

10

each and every meeting of the Trust to provide

11

that feedback that you're looking for.

12

that's an important part of the agenda for each

13

Trust meeting that there is public comment.

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think

I think that's important.

15

You know, again, Mr. Chairman, subject to your

16

views and the rest of the Board Members on this,

17

it might be prudent at whatever is the right

18

moment in time to identify this as an agenda, a

19

specific agenda item of opinions about whether

20

Retrofit Chicago should be the Trust's first

21

project as an agenda item so that people know

22

this is my opportunity to be heard on this in

23

case I have a dissenting view.

24

You know, the presentations that you

 44
1

made have been very persuasive and, you know, to

2

me there's, from what we've heard, a tremendous

3

amount of merit to this being the first project,

4

but I think it's important to have an open mind,

5

to see what other voices say and then make a

6

decision at the appropriate time.

7

I certainly haven't heard anything

8

that you've said that's inconsistent with that.

9

I know you agree with that, but I just wanted to

10

sort of articulate that as we move forward and

11

figure out what our process is.

12

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

13

it's also incumbent on us as government

14

officials to work on these behind the scenes and

15

present things for consideration.

16

we want to expect the Trust in its infancy to

17

actually be the generator of every idea that we

18

should be looking at.

19

I think

I don't think

I think we really are, in the early

20

phases in particular, bringing ideas for

21

consideration, let you make an independent view,

22

not just the Trust but also as an independent

23

financial advisor that opines on it as well.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Thank you.

 45
1

CHAIRMAN BELL:

You know, on the

2

process, Lois, I just have a question on that.

3

Is this the process talking only about how you

4

would give it to us for consideration or is

5

there another process within the City and sister

6

agencies that actually decided who is on the

7

project itself and then are we talking about how

8

that project gets funded?

9

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Yes,

10

that's exactly what is going on.

11

we're still working on getting -- advancing

12

these particular projects, and when we package

13

them and think that there's something there for

14

consideration by the Trust, we'll be coming

15

before the Trust and asking for consideration of

16

the Trust's financing programs to benefit those

17

projects just like schools would be doing and

18

other agencies.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

So in the City

So you would envision

20

every project that came to us would be already

21

vetted with that existing process in terms of

22

meaning the City or the City agencies that they

23

believe this is a priority?

24

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Yes.

 46
1

Right.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

4

the issue that Mr. Hoffman raised about

5

including it in other budgets, what we've asked

6

of the CFOs of all the sister agencies is to

7

make their budgets permissive to include

8

projects that could be facilitated by the Trust,

9

and to the best of my knowledge in discussions

10

as recently as this week with the CF0s that is

11

what people are doing.

12

Okay.
As to

They're not saying that they're

13

counting on savings in any way, only that they

14

are making their capital plans permissive so the

15

project would be permitted to come to the Trust

16

for consideration.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

18

Any other questions?

(No response.)

19

Thank you, Lois.

20

You know, our website now is up and

21

running.

I've asked Lois to sort of walk us

22

through what it looks like and give you all some

23

idea as to how to access it.

24

in its infancy stages.

I recognize it's

 47
1

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

2

website site that -- the City of Chicago Finance

3

Department under the ordinance is permitted to

4

offer staff support to the Trust through the

5

balance of this year, so one of the projects we

6

felt was very important from a transparency

7

perspective was to get a website up so the

8

public would have an information site.

9

So the

So forgive me for not being a web

10

designer here, but I think we did a pretty gosh

11

darn good job to start.

12

on a life of its own as things go, but for an

13

organization that was born as recently as a

14

couple weeks ago, I think it's in pretty nice

15

shape.

16

It will obviously take

So when you go to

17

ChicagoInfrastructure.org, there's a home page

18

which provides background and a mission

19

statement about the Infrastructure Trust.

20

There are just a couple things along

21

the top, the Board of Directors, so your

22

accountability to the public is up there.

23

of the Board of Directors, their website --

24

excuse me, their bio and their picture is

Each

 48
1

presented so the public knows who you are and

2

has a face associated with the Trust.

3

just this amorphous group of people but actual

4

names and faces and background shared so the

5

public knows who you are.

6

advisory board, I would assume that you would

7

want to include that on the website as well.

8

The next part is the meeting tab

9

It's not

When we have an

which has schedule of meetings.

You can see our

10

meeting today is on there and you can drop down

11

and see the agenda for the meeting along with

12

the location so that people can find the

13

meeting.

14

We will also then along the top have

15

a transparency page which really has two

16

elements to it.

17

we have a court reporter taking copious minutes

18

on everything we say and do here.

19

be placed on there about the meetings, and then

20

the second part is an opportunity for public

21

input to Director Hoffman's comments.

22

The first is the documents.

So

Those would

So people would be able to go

23

online, register their name and their comments

24

and that would be referred over to a

 49
1

representative of the Trust to screen through

2

all those public comments and make sure they are

3

addressed.

4

So all of you are up online.

So if

5

you consent we can make that a public document

6

as of today if you would like it.

7

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

8

ALDERMAN POPE:

Thank you, Chairman.

9

Any comments?

Lois, I think James had asked a question, if

10

someone from the public had submitted a question

11

online regarding a proposal, John Doe says this

12

is something I think is relevant or an

13

opportunity for the Trust to consider, how do

14

you perceive that project making its way through

15

the process itself?

16

respective City agency for their consideration?

17

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

Will it get referred to the

I think

18

that once you have your staff or advisors on

19

board I think you'll come up with a process of

20

how you want that done.

21

aggregating any comments we receive and sending

22

them to your Chair to redirect through his

23

office.

24

Right now we're just

Not that we've received any yet

 50
1

because it's not public, but that's our plan.

2

sent myself a comment on there as we were

3

developing it.

4
5
6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Lois, you have a young

man next to you who I believe was -CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

7

Jacob Ringer, my chief of staff from the

8

Department of Finance.

9

I

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes,

And he was partially

10

responsible or perhaps fully responsible for --

11

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SCOTT:

12

did this on his nights and weekends.

13

web programmer, he's a finance guy so I

14

appreciate his efforts very much.

15
16

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, he

He's not a

I do too and I wanted to

say nice job.

17

MR. RINGER:

Thank you.

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Okay.

Moving onto

19

our financial reports, the first item under that

20

category is to approve the Grant Agreement.

21

The Grant Agreement is a pretty

22

comprehensive document.

Essentially this

23

document, seeing as how we would work with the

24

City once we accept the initial $200,000 grant,

 51
1

and so we think that's appropriate to have that

2

kind of agreement, but at the same time because

3

of the complexity of this document, and quite

4

frankly the language seems to be rather

5

boilerplate and this activity is not

6

boilerplate, so we're probably going to defer.

7

I think I'm going to give this to the Board to

8

decide, but I think we're going to defer

9

approving that until we have an opportunity to

10

have our outside legal counsel take a look at

11

this and make sure that it really is written in

12

a way that's consistent with the activities of

13

this Trust.

14

And so with that I will put that

15

open to our Board to see if there are any other

16

comments, but my proposal would be that we defer

17

approving the grant until our next meeting and

18

until we allow our outside legal counsel to take

19

a look and advise us.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

I agree.

I think that's

21

prudent.

I also think depending on -- we'll see

22

how the timing goes, but if our legal counsel

23

has comments or revisions, we can get those in

24

advance so we have a chance to comment back and

 52
1

forth, that would be great.

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

4

Absolutely.

I think it's a good

idea.

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

Any other comments?

(No response.)

7

Okay.

I think the same holds true

8

with the establishment of the bank account.

9

Obviously what we looked at, and Diana and I had

10

some talks and discussions around it, but now

11

that we've elected her treasurer we'll have her

12

work this, but obviously we're going to be

13

looking at how we can get a bank that sort of

14

meets some of the requirements, maybe minority

15

owned, maybe Chicago based, but someone that,

16

you know, we'll be looking at trying to make

17

sure we do business in the City itself.

18

That will be in general what the

19

framework of what Diana -- how Diana will be

20

working this, but we'll be able to get back and

21

decide that hopefully by the next meeting or

22

so.

23
24

MS. FERGUSON:

Mr. Chairman, can I come

back to the Board with some recommendations at

 53
1

the next meeting on that?

2

CHAIRMAN BELL:

3
4

Absolutely.

Any other comments by the Board on
that?

5

(No response.)

6

Okay.

Status of our staff and

7

consultant's report.

Since our last meeting, we

8

have had some pretty encouraging discussions

9

with three firms that are actually willing to

10

provide pro bono support in three critical

11

areas that I think we need up front, and so the

12

Board

13

And, by the way, all those e-mails are public

14

record if you would like to see what we did.

15

-- we have some e-mails back and forth.

The three firms are simply Chicago

16

based firms with strong reputations.

17

Stewart Spencer in our preliminary discussion

18

has --

19

MS. FERGUSON:

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

First

Spencer Stewart.
Excuse me.

Spencer

21

Stewart, thank you for correcting that.

They

22

have in our preliminary discussions agreed to do

23

on a pro bono basis our search for an executive

24

director and so obviously this is something we

 54
1

need to get kicked off, and I am going to

2

propose to the Board at the end of this

3

discussion that we vote to move forward and

4

develop a relationship with Spencer Stewart to

5

do just that.

6

The second is Public Financial

7

Management which is a financial advisor that has

8

considerable skills and capability and space for

9

working with and again we've had preliminary

10

discussions with them, and they also have agreed

11

to provide us temporarily interim financial

12

advice and support until we're able to get our

13

staffing and our executive director on board.

14

So again I'm going to ask our Board to act on

15

that.

16

And then finally we absolutely

17

needed to get some legal support in place.

18

have had preliminary discussions with Kirkland

19

Ellis, an outstanding legal firm in the Chicago

20

area and obviously broader than Chicago but

21

Chicago based, and they also have expressed an

22

interest to provide us the legal support we need

23

temporarily pro bono, and so I'm going to throw

24

this open to the Board.

We

 55
1

We've had some e-mail discussions,

2

but I want to be sure that we have an

3

opportunity clearly to restate any of the

4

positions I think we talked about in discussing

5

these three firms, so with that let me open it

6

up to the Board.

7

MR. HOFFMAN:

You know, I'm -- as you

8

know, I'm comfortable with the decisions both

9

because, number one, you know, to me it's

10

critical that we get independent advice with our

11

mission, so to me if the advice that we're going

12

to get from these firms pass that test, then I

13

think it's a good thing.

14

And then second, the fact that it's

15

pro bono means that -- you know, and clearly

16

from some very high quality places means that it

17

should be very beneficial.

18

interim basis, and if we get to the point that

19

we're -- I know you, Mr. Chairman, I believe

20

we're all in agreement that if we get to the

21

point where we're seeking to pay for

22

professional services then we'll go to some sort

23

of competitive process.

24

It's obviously on an

But I think it's a real -- I'm

 56
1

comfortable and I think it's real positive to

2

be getting the pro bono services of these

3

firms.

4

MS. FERGUSON:

I completely support the

5

notion of moving forward with these three firms.

6

They are very reputable, and in various

7

professional encounters I've had interaction

8

with each of the firms and have been very

9

pleased with their caliber of service.

10
11

So I'm

supportive of moving forward.
ALDERMAN POPE:

I too support it.

The

12

fact that they are local and have significant

13

histories in these fields, I think it will be a

14

great match for us.

15

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Motion?

16

ALDERMAN POPE:

So moved.

17

CHAIRMAN BELL:

All in favor.

18

(A chorus of ayes.)

19

Okay.

20

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Having passed that, I

21

would like to ask the Board Members to accept

22

some assignments on how we then engage them

23

because I think, you know, David, I'd like you

24

to obviously interface with the legal firm, and

 57
1

some of the things that I think we need to get

2

to them right away is our bylaws, the Grant

3

Agreement and, you know, start talking about

4

what are the rules of engagement.

5

I guess the first thing we need to

6

do is figure out how do we document what our

7

arrangement is and we probably should have some

8

discussion about that.

9

along those lines.

10

Let's start thinking

And then, Diana, if you can work

11

with Public Financial Management, I think start

12

to lay in line what we're going to need at least

13

initially.

14

And then I would propose to work

15

with Spencer Stewart on the executive director

16

and then, of course, you guys jump in anywhere

17

you want.

18

start to move this and get this foundation in

19

place so that we have the level of comfort of

20

our independence and that we're starting to get

21

some of the things that have to fundamentally

22

get done first before some package shows up on

23

our doorstep to look at that we have some legs

24

and arms in place to help us to deal with that.

I'm just thinking about how we can

 58
1
2

If that's okay with all of you, then
I propose we move on in that direction.

3

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's fine.

On the

4

executive director search, do you know if it's

5

posted?

6

CHAIRMAN BELL:

We haven't done

7

anything yet I don't think.

So we're going to

8

get with the search firm and we're going to

9

obviously -- clearly the tenants are it needs to

10

be public, it needs to be -- maybe even figure

11

out how to make sure that the search is done in

12

a way that all that are qualified are able to

13

participate and get their name into the hat, so

14

that's what I'll be working on.

15

I would think the first thing they

16

are going to do is tell us we probably need to

17

make the description a little more specific.

18

we'll have to work our way through it, and I'll

19

get back with you and work with you all to make

20

sure that what we do is consistent with what our

21

intentions are.

22

So

But I'm expecting them to help us

23

with meeting what we all feel strongly about is

24

an obligation to make sure that there's a public

 59
1

posting and that all will have a fair chance.

2

Any other questions, thoughts?

3

(No response.)

4

Okay.

Other business?

Any other

5

business -- Excuse me, I guess we got to get to

6

the Board dates.

7

for the rest of the year, September 20th,

8

October 18th and November 5th, and we left

9

December to be determined because we were

10

struggling between the 14th and the 17th.

11

I circulated a number of dates

By the way, I got input back from

12

all of you that some of these dates are good and

13

some of these dates are not.

14

change and obviously we'll have an opportunity

15

for Members to participate by telephone, and

16

that was not passed in our bylaws.

17

Now, things will

In lieu of anything better, I mean,

18

I think I would say that -- I would propose that

19

we approve these dates for the time being, and

20

if things change then we'll go through the

21

process of revising them, if necessary.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

I know -- as I said in

23

the e-mail I know I cannot make the 20th of

24

September.

I'm in an all day court related

 60
1

thing that I can't get out of.

I am free the

2

next day, but if the meeting ends up staying on

3

the 20th, I know I'm unavailable.

4

first October date?

What was the

5

MR. RAMIREZ:

18th.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

And as I said, on that

7

day I am in an all day thing in D.C.

8

two days unfortunately --

9

CHAIRMAN BELL:

10

can't attend.

11

telephone?

12

So those

Those two meetings you

You could not make even by

MR. HOFFMAN:

No.

I know for sure

13

September 20th I'm just -- I'm all day in court.

14

And the 18th is unlikely.

15

happy to do it just by phone.

16
17
18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

If I can, I would be

So what about

November 5th?
MR. HOFFMAN:

That's fine for me.

19

certainly don't want to stand in the way of

20

pushing anything back that far.

21

particular days --

22

CHAIRMAN BELL:

I

Those two

I think we probably

23

need to circulate some more dates and see if we

24

can do this between meetings via email to get

 61
1

these dates and get them posted.

2

obligation to post it because of the Public

3

Meetings Act that we show what the dates for the

4

next meetings for the year are so we need to be

5

mindful of that.

6

We have an

I just don't know what better dates

7

you're going to come up with honestly.

I don't

8

need you out of the first -- the next two

9

meetings.

That's not going to work.

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I apologize.

11

CHAIRMAN BELL:

No.

No.

I understand.

12

Jorge had issues with timing.

13

dates but he had issues with the timing.

14

don't I work with Lois' office and let's get

15

some common dates and try another series and see

16

if we can get them approved?

17

MR. HOFFMAN:

18

CHAIRMAN BELL:

19

He can do the

Okay.
Otherwise we're just

putting dates that we know we won't make.

20

Any other thoughts?

21

(No response.)

22
23
24

Why

Other business?

Not having any then let's move to
the public comments.

Were there any?

Why don't you state your name and

 62
1
2

maybe your affiliation for our minutes?
MS. MILLER:

I'm Emily Miller.

I run

3

policy for the Better Government Association.

4

First I have just wanted to say --

5

CHAIRMAN BELL:

6

MS. MILLER:

7

The Better Government

Association.

8

CHAIRMAN BELL:

9

MS. MILLER:

10
11

What was the name?

Thank you.

I've had a lot of coffee

so I apologize.
I want to say that I am encouraged

12

by the level of conversation that there is about

13

ethics and the presentation from Steve's office.

14

Obviously that's a good thing to see that

15

everybody is thinking about those things and

16

that you're taking such a long time to think

17

about the conflicts of interest, the

18

requirements that you're going to end up

19

implementing, but I do have two legal concerns

20

with the way that you are now defined under the

21

Ethics Ordinance according to Steve's office.

22

So there are two specific concerns

23

that I have.

First if the Ethics Commission

24

ends up referring a case over to the Inspector

 63
1

General's Office, if the Inspector General does

2

not have full jurisdiction as laid out in the

3

actual City ordinance, there could be some

4

issues with whether or not they're able to

5

actually pursue the thing that is referred to

6

them.

7

To be honest, I haven't seen what

8

you just approved in the bylaws in terms of

9

where the Inspector General fits in with the

10

bylaws, but if the Trust is a City agency for

11

purposes of the Ethics Commission, it seems to

12

me that it might be likely that they are also a

13

City agency when it comes to the Inspector

14

General and so then the ordinance would trump

15

whatever it is that is in the bylaws.

16

And then that concern extends also

17

to the Freedom of Information Act.

18

bylaws that I saw before anyway laid out a very

19

specific plan for Freedom of Information Act

20

requests, and when FOIA requests are denied,

21

those denials go to the City who then determines

22

whether or not those denials were legitimate.

23
24

So the

Well, if the Trust is operating as a
City agency, then that process actually is not

 64
1

the same as what the State law requires for the

2

Freedom of Information Act.

3

So under State law a person who has

4

their FOIA request denied would actually have

5

the ability to go to the Attorney General's

6

Office through the Public Access Counselor to

7

have that denial reviewed instead of it getting

8

funneled through the City.

9

So my concern is just in terms of a

10

definition of what the Trust is, if it's going

11

to be a City agency in some areas but not in

12

other areas, I'm not quite sure how that's going

13

to work out.

14

So any guidance in terms of legal

15

definitions I think would certainly be

16

appreciated from my organization's standpoint

17

but then I think probably just the public in

18

general.

19

CHAIRMAN BELL:

Well, I think you ought

20

to read the clause that we've added and see if

21

that satisfies any of your concerns, and then we

22

can go from there, work from there, but I think

23

we'll clearly take a look at this.

24

I mean, our intention is to

 65
1

cooperate fully with both the Inspector General

2

and the Freedom of Information Act.

3

intention.

4

MS. MILLER:

Right.

That's the

It's the appeals

5

process that is specifically laid out in State

6

law that's different under the bylaws than under

7

State law for the FOIA process.

8

MR. HOFFMAN:

9

First of all, you know,

Emily, it's always good to see you.

10

MS. MILLER:

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes, you too.
We hope the BGA continues

12

to, as I know you will, come in and comment.

13

It's very valuable so we appreciate it.

14

No question, the issues you're

15

hitting on were debated at great length in City

16

Council.

17

you know, did not triumph, and so to a certain

18

extent some of those decisions were made when

19

the ordinance said that we were not a public

20

body in relation to FOIA and Open Meetings Act

21

and was silent on whether the IG had full

22

jurisdiction.

23
24

The position that you're arguing for,

But then a subsequent executive
order said that the Trust should act as if FOIA

 66
1

and the Open Meetings Act applied.

2

pointing exactly to one thing that has concerned

3

some people which is that well, there's still a

4

difference and that relates to the appeals

5

process.

6

that.

7

You're

So you're right to put your finger on

And that's one of the reasons that I

8

asked Steve that question because I think that

9

it probably maybe raises an eyebrow that one

10

City agency, the Board of Ethics, has said that

11

we are, in fact, a City agency, which, if it was

12

true across the Board, would have given

13

different answers necessarily at the time of the

14

ordinance being passed.

15

So it would be strange if we were a

16

City agency for one purpose, the Board of

17

Ethic's purposes, but not for other purposes

18

like FOIA and the Open Meetings Act.

19

I forgot to say, Steve, is that

20

opinion something that we can see?

21

be great if we could get a copy of that.

22

MR. BERLIN:

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

That would

Yes.
Two things.

I think

you're right to target those issues but two

 67
1

comments.

2

Number one, with regard to the IG,

3

this Board and now with the statement in the

4

bylaws, we have been clear in our oral

5

statements and we now are clear on the record

6

that we are not going to do anything to stand in

7

the way of the IG investigating whatever they

8

want with regard to the Trust.

9

The bylaws make it clear that we

10

will be open to the IG, cooperative with the IG

11

with regard to all our operations and programs

12

and activities.

13

that.

14

So the ordinance is silent on

To the extent there is some

15

jurisdictional difference with the Board of

16

Ethics, that's a legal issue.

17

City to address.

18

the power to address.

19

That's up to the

That's not something we have

What we have the power to do is say

20

in our bylaws here's how we're going to be act

21

and it's clear that we're just going to be open.

22

With regard to the issues of FOIA,

23

Open Meetings Act, et cetera, those are not

24

things -- and the appeal process once it leaves

 68
1

our hands, those are things that unfortunately

2

need to be directed toward the City because

3

those are I think good legal questions but legal

4

questions that, you know, the governmental

5

authority, the City would need to answer.

6

I do think that the Ethics Board's

7

or staff's opinion probably creates, you know,

8

an open question in that regard since you have

9

an agency -- one agency declaring us to be a

10
11

City agency.
So my guess is this may be an

12

ongoing discussion because of the Board of

13

Ethics' decision, but I want you to know that

14

from our perspective we are doing everything

15

that we can in our power to say, you know, we're

16

open, we're transparent, we're open to the IG

17

and we want to do everything we can that's

18

within our legal authority, but to a certain

19

extent our legal authority is set by the

20

ordinance and Trust.

21

You know, other than the appeal,

22

we'll, you know -- the bylaws make it clear that

23

we will be acting just as if FOIA and the Open

24

Meetings Act apply.

We are going to be open to

 69
1

the IG.

2

We want this to be a continuing

3

discussion, so if folks see other things that

4

we should do, it's great.

5

appreciate the thought being brought forward,

6

but those are my reactions knowing these issues

7

quite well.

That's why I
