2. Bullying Prevention (BP)
ICJIA Program Supervisor Reshma Desai, referring to the memo regarding SFY19 BP
funds, said the proposed programming would address bullying prevention within
established school-based trauma-informed networks. Staff let a Notice of Funding
Opportunity (NOFO) to the recipients so that they could complete an action plan. She
said that staff recommended making the following SFY19 BP designations:
DESIGNEE

RECOMMENDED
DESIGNATION
$198,466
$193,809

Southern Illinois University
Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital
TOTAL

Mr. Buckman said that Southern Illinois University’s program intended to target
elementary, middle, or high schools and allow the school districts to select which
individual schools would participate, thus the program would serve students from
kindergarten through 12th grade. Ms. Raviv said Lurie Children’s Hospital planned to use
a similar approach for its programming.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY19 BP designations. Lt.
Col. Byrd seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.

3. Death Penalty Abolition Act (DPA)
ICJIA Criminal Justice Specialist Maureen Brennan, referring to the meeting materials
regarding SFY19 DPA Fund, said after the State of Illinois abolished the death penalty,
the legislature transferred remaining in the Capital Litigation Trust monies to the Death
Penalty Abolition (DPA) Fund, a special fund in the state treasury to be expended by the
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority. These funds shall be used for services for
families of victims of homicide or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel,
she said. She said the meeting materials contained a typographical error; $2 million, not
$2.5 million, in DPA SFY19funds were made available through a notice of funding
opportunity for services to families of homicide victims. She said that staff recommended
making the following designations using those funds:
DESIGNEE

DESIGNATION

Chicago Survivors, Inc.

Motion: Chief Perez moved to approve the recommended SFY19 DPA designations. Lt.
Col. Byrd seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Councils (IFVCC)
ICJIA Program Supervisor Mary Ratliff, referring to the memo regarding SFY19 IFVCC
funds, said that the IFVCC comprises 13 local family violence coordinating councils
throughout Illinois. She said staff recommended decreasing the existing Cra Wa La
Volunteers in Probation, Inc., designation by $10,000, as the program was experiencing
hiring difficulties prohibiting the fund expenditure. She said the $10,000 would be used
to support the annual IFVCC spring training.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended SFY19 IFVCC designation
reduction. Mr. Olson seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
5. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)
Designation Reductions
ICJIA Federal & State Grants Unit Acting Associate Director Greg Stevens, referring to
meeting materials on Federal Fiscal Years 2013 through 2017 JAG Plan Adjustments,
described $710,849 in funds recently returned to ICJIA from programs in the amounts

substance use diversion/deflection programs, multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic
trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs. He said
ICJIA had received its FFY17 JAG award and that staff recommended designating funds
to support the programs for 18 months, except where noted in the materials. The
designations would fulfill ICJIA’s three-year commitment to fund these programs, he
said.

Public Comment
Barbara Shaw, representing Chicago Survivors, said DPA legislation states that the
purpose of the DPA funds shall be used for services for families of victims of homicide
or murder and for training of law enforcement personnel and noted DPA funds are the
only state funds earmarked for this victim group. She said the NOFOs that were issued
for the remaining $6.5 million in DPA funds disproportionately favored law enforcement
training in terms of fund allocations. She requested that ICJIA reconsider more equitable
funding distribution between services for families of victims of homicide or murder and
for training of law enforcement personnel. She also requested that ICJIA reconsider
depleting the DPA funds over the next three years. She said the funds are critical to
service providers and it would be advantageous to extend the funds for a longer period.
Executive Director John Maki said the biggest concern ICJIA has with DPA funds is that
they exist at all. The DPA fund has been swept in the past, he said, and if the DPA funds
are not actively used, the pot becomes attractive to lawmakers looking for idle funds for
other programs. This puts pressure on ICJIA staff to move the funds, he said. He noted
that with the recent VOCA federal awards, ICJIA has been supporting more victim
services programs than ever before. In addition, he said, there has been a lot of
demonstrated need for law enforcement training. He said staff has made every effort to
maintain the integrity of the statutory intent of the DPA Act. He noted that the last time
ICJIA designated DPA funds, it was via a sole-source agreement with Chicago Survivors.
He said staff recommended offering DPA funding opportunities to more potential
recipients via a competitive process.
Old Business / New Business

Adjourn
Motion: Lt. Col. Byrd moved to adjourn the meeting. Sheriff Perez seconded the motion.
The motion passed by unanimous voice vote. The meeting was adjourned at 11:00 a.m.

Northern Illinois University
The proposed training will be developed by NIU’s Dr. Michelle Lilly, a licensed clinical
psychologist, an associate professor of clinical psychology, and co-director of the university’s
Trauma Services Clinic. Dr. Lilly will produce an extended version of her current PTSD, suicide,
and coping training that offers more depth in content, more opportunities for discussion among
attendees, and a half day allotted for discussion and skills development in the area of peer
support. In addition, she will vet current support services that are free to first responders,
including the CrewCare app and the First Responders Support Network.
A fully drafted training program will be distributed to the Illinois Police Pension Fund
Association and uniformed co-presenters for in-depth feedback. The team will work in an
iterative fashion until the training is deemed to fill gaps in knowledge and skills among active
duty police officers.
Training development will begin in late April 2019 and will be fully developed in the first three
weeks of May 2019. All training materials will be fully completed by May 24. Two training
sessions will be held in June 2019.
The program will initially serve law enforcement personnel in Cook County, Collar Counties,
and Northern Illinois Non-Cook, Non-Collar counties. The two-day training will be offered on
the Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL, a relatively central location for the following
counties: Cook, DuPage, Lake, Will, Kankakee, Grundy, Kendall, LaSalle, Kane, DeKalb, Lee,
Ogle, Boone, McHenry, and Winnebago.
If recommended for future fund allocation, six trainings will be offered in SFY2020 on the
following approximate schedule: August 2019, October 2019, December 2019, February 2020,
April 2020, and May 2020. The goal of the training team is to double the number of trainings in
SFY2021 and SFY2022 after demonstrating the effectiveness of the training in the award period

year 2016 and 2017 funds.
RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
A. Partnerships and Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime
At its August 18, 2017, and September 16, 2017, meetings, the Budget Committee
designated funding to four jurisdictions selected through the competitive Partnerships and
Strategies to Reduce Violent Crime Request for Proposals. The Year One designations
supported research-informed planning to identify the drivers of violent crime in each
jurisdiction through the formation of local multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) and the use
of community surveys, the Scanning, Analysis, Response and Assessment (SARA)
process, and other analytical tools.
Staff recommends the following designations to these jurisdictions. The sites will
complete the last year of implementation of the focused deterrence strategies that closely
target offenders at highest risk of reoffending, offering social supports and imposing
swift, certain, and fair sanctions for non-compliance. These designations support ongoing
research partner contracts, as well as salaries for local program coordinators and
community-based program navigators who facilitate offender call-in meetings and foster
offender participation.
The recommended designations include:

FFY17 Justice Assistance Grants: $225,000

Agency Budget:

$122,229,716

Request Type:

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1469-467

Program Description
The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office Community Justice Centers (CJC) were founded on the principle
that prosecutors have a responsibility to not only prosecute cases but to solve public safety problems, prevent
crime, and improve the quality of life for communities. The community justice centers collaborate with police,
businesses, faith-based organizations, elected officials, schools, government entities, social service agencies,
and community groups for the purposes of prevention, problem-solving, and prosecution.
Program Activities
The grant funds will support two prevention coordinators and two administrative assistants at the West and
Central CJCs. The prevention coordinators are responsible for helping the neighborhood offices facilitate crime
prevention and education programs. The coordinators work with the staff of the neighborhood offices and
community stakeholders to identify, develop, and implement programs that addressed the unique needs of each
neighborhood. The coordinators also work on countywide initiatives that targeted crime issues addressed by the
community prosecutors. The administrative assistants are responsible for the day-to-day administrative duties of
the office including supporting prosecution efforts, answering phones, working with walk-ins, assisting with
prevention and education programs, and keeping and preparing stats for progress reports.
CJC staff work with law enforcement and citizens to respond to a range of concerns that include quality of life
issues and targeted local concerns. They work to solve the cases in a way that will keep the matter from
becoming a major court concern. Each CJC utilizes steering committees that are convened to work directly with
the Office to identify community-based problems and concerns. These committees draw their membership from
the communities they serve, the Chicago Police Department, and various city agencies. The committees work to
advise the office as well as help identify and implement community-based alternative sentences when
appropriate. The CJCs are founded on the idea that prosecutor offices have a responsibility not only to prosecute
cases, but to solve public safety problems, prevent crime, and improve the quality of life for the communities
they serve.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1469-467

Program Description
The DNA & Digital Evidence Program provides cutting-edge forensic training to attorneys who represent
indigent residents of Cook County and much of northern Illinois. The current program involves targeted
forensic training designed to close the gap in forensic training for indigent defense attorneys, in addition to
consultation in cases where citizens of Cook County face criminal prosecution based on forensic evidence.
The caseload numbers indicate a growing number of indigent residents of Cook County face prosecution based
on forensic evidence. Since 2014, the number of cases involving forensic evidence has increased year-to-year,
including DNA cases, fingerprint cases, and ballistic cases, which make up the majority of the caseload.
Faulty forensic analyses by forensic examiners and/or forensic fraud has resulted in numerous wrongful
convictions. In this context, where the results of forensic analyses require careful investigation by defense
attorneys, a lack of forensically trained defense attorneys is a threat to the criminal justice system.
Program Activities
This program funds forensic training of the highest caliber within the Forensic Science Division (FSD) of the
Cook County Public Defender’s Office. Training will be provided to the division as follows:
1. Three small-group intensive forensic trainings for the eight FSD attorneys. In the 2018-2019 program,
FSD invited defense attorneys from neighboring jurisdictions to participate in this highly specialized
training, extending the program’s impact beyond Cook County.
2. A large-scale forensic conference, planned and organized by the FSD, which will provide two days of
forensic training to over 100 indigent defense attorneys from around the country.
3. FSD attorney participation in two week-long forensic training conferences. Conference participation is
essential to identifying trainers and staying at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field.
4. Training 100+ assistant public defenders in three internal sessions taught by FSD attorneys. FSD
attorneys will pass some of the targeted forensic training they received on to other indigent defense
attorneys.

5. FSD attorneys will deliver three external education sessions, including conference panel participation or
delivering training to other public defense offices. This deliverable further establishes Cook County as a
leader in the field of forensic litigation in public defense and leverages FSD attorneys’ training to a
national audience.
Goals
The goal of this program is to protect indigent residents of Illinois and the criminal justice system from the
tremendous costs (monetary and otherwise) associated with wrongful convictions based on faulty forensic
evidence. The strategy to achieve this goal includes two complementary approaches: training and consultation.
By training attorneys in cutting-edge forensic science techniques, the program will arm indigent defense
attorneys with the knowledge and resources to identify faulty forensic evidence. Through direct case
consultations involving indigent residents, these specially trained attorneys will be deployed to review pending
cases and litigate instances of faulty forensic evidence.
Priorities
To support public and appellate defenders by providing resources and training necessary to assist public and
appellate defenders in protecting the fundamental rights, liberties and due process of the accused, and to assist
public and appellate defenders in connecting defendants with community-based services when possible and
appropriate in order to reduce recidivism.
Program Funding Detail
This designation would support 12 months of funding, representing Year 2 of 3 of programming. Any future
designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to staff analysis of program performance and
will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
1. Small Group Trainings



This objective included organizing and hosting four days of intensive small group trainings for attorneys
in the Forensic Science Division.
The performance measures for this objective included the following for each of the trainings: pretests,
posttests, and training evaluations.

This objective was achieved in part. On May 3-4, 2018, seven attorneys with the Forensic Science Division
attended two days of small group training on algorithms in forensic DNA. All attendees completed pretests,
posttests, and evaluations. On June 15, 2018, seven attorneys with the Forensic Science Division attended one
day of small group training on algorithms in forensic facial recognition. All attendees completed pretests,
posttests, and evaluations. A fourth day of small group training (algorithms in forensic pattern matching) was
not achieved. The implementing agency identified a trainer for this component who initially agreed to provide
the one-day training. However, this trainer ultimately declined to provide the training, and did so at a time in the

Template Revision Date: 04/11/2018 

25

 JAG FFY16
April 18, 2019
Page 3 of 4

granting period where the implementing agency was not able to identify a substitute trainer. Therefore, the
implementing agency was only able to succeed in providing three of the four days of training planned.
Self-assessment evaluations conducted before and after the small group training showed participants reported an
increase in knowledge of advanced concepts in forensic science (e.g., probabilistic genotyping and forensic
facial comparison) by an average of nearly a level and a half (30%). Participants reported their understanding of
advanced forensic facial comparison concepts as limited (averaging 2.3 out of 5) prior to the training and rated
their knowledge between average and above average (averaging 3.6 out of 5) after the training. In the DNA
algorithm training, participants rated their understanding of concepts in probabilistic genotyping as average
(averaging 2.8 out of 5) before the training and above average to extremely knowledgeable (averaging 4.2 out
of 5) after the training. Attendees rated the trainings as very useful.
2. Large Scale Forensic Conference



This objective included organizing and hosting a two-day forensic conference for 100 indigent defense
attorneys.
The performance measure for this objective was evaluations from attendees.

This objective was achieved in part. The implementing agency organized and hosted a two-day forensic
conference, with nine speakers providing training presentations on various forensic topics. While the goal was
for 100 indigent defense attorneys to attend this training, the conference was attended by 80 attorneys. Pre- and
post-tests showed that small group training participants’ knowledge increased by an average of a level and a
half (30%), from self-assessing their understanding of advanced forensic concepts as “limited” to “average” to
“above average” after the training.
Most attendees completed evaluations for the conference, resulting in an average rating of 4.5 on a scale where
4 indicates a rating of “very good” and 5 indicates a rating of “excellent”. Attendees also provided individual
comments, indicating that attendees regarded the conference as providing very high-quality training.
3. Extended Forensic Training Conferences



This objective included attendance by six Forensic Science Division attorneys at two extended forensic
Conferences
The performance measure for this objective was evaluations from attendees.

This objective was achieved. Three Forensic Science Division attorneys attended the six-day American
Academy of Forensic Science Annual Meeting in February 2018. Each attorney attended dozens of scientific
sessions, and completed evaluations giving the training the highest rating for quality. Three other Forensic
Science Division attorneys attended the three-day Midwest Association of Forensic Science Probabilistic
Genotyping Workshop in April 2018. Evaluations were completed by all attendees and they gave the training
high scores for the quality of the training.
4. Additional Forensic Trainings



This objective is to pass on forensic competency by having attorneys in the Forensic Science Division
train an additional 100 attorneys in the litigation of forensic evidence.
The performance measure for this objective is attendance records for these additional trainings.

Template Revision Date: 04/11/2018 

26

 JAG FFY16
April 18, 2019
Page 4 of 4

This objective was achieved. Attorneys in the Forensic Science Division, due to their growing understanding of
forensic evidence litigation, are in great demand as trainers for other indigent defense attorneys. Because of this,
attorneys in the Forensic Science Division were able to provide forensic training for an additional 620 attorneys
during the grant period, including the following trainings: Reforming Forensic Science for 60 attendees in
September 2017; Forensic DNA Interpretation for 300 attendees in February 2018; Forensic DNA Sample
Collection for 30 attendees in February 2018; Forensic Cell Phone Evidence for 100 attendees in June 2018;
Forensic DNA Interpretation for 100 attendees in June 2018; Cross Examination of Forensic Examiners for 30
attendees in June 2018, and the Public Defender “Nutshell” training conference in August 2018.
5. Forensic Case Consultations & File Reviews



This objective is to pass on forensic competency to other attorneys in addition to protecting against
faulty forensic evidence in the criminal justice system.
The performance measure for this objective is to document the number of forensic consultations and file
reviews conducted by attorneys in the Forensic Science Division during the grant period.

This objective was achieved. During the grant period, attorneys with the Forensic Science Division conducted
more than 1,450 forensic consultations and file reviews in cases involving forensic evidence. During these
consultations and file reviews, attorneys with the Forensic Science Division evaluated the results of forensic
testing, and consulted with the lead attorneys for the indigent accused to explain the meaning of the forensic
evidence and consider appropriate trial strategy.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1469-467

Program Description
The Cook County Public Defender’s Office Mitigation Initiative provides counsel for its indigent clients who
are charged with crimes. One of the Office’s key duties is to provide mitigation evidence at the sentencing
hearing or mitigation information at a Supreme Court Rule 402 pre-trial conference. A 402 pre-trial conference
is a plea-bargaining meeting that includes the judge, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel. While the death
penalty is no longer a sentencing option in Illinois, a sentence of natural life imprisonment is still available for
certain defendants who have been found guilty of first-degree murder. In addition, for certain felony convictions
in Illinois, probation is an alternative to imprisonment. Presenting mitigation evidence and information is a core
responsibility for the Office.
Program Activities
This program will continue to fund two full-time experienced mitigators who provide assistance to attorneys
and clients. In addition, the office will maintain the mitigation internship program, which has allowed effective
mitigation for a higher number of clients without requiring additional funds beyond this grant.
The mitigators will conduct social history investigation in pre-trial and post-trial convictions cases. They
provide detailed information about the social, biological, and environmental forces that have shaped our clients,
relying upon interviews and record collection. A mitigator is the liaison between the defendant and the court
providing a unified narrative that attempts to explain not only the context of the crime, but also the client's
humanity, to achieve a fairer, more accurate sentence.
Based upon such social history investigation, mitigators prepare either a report or live testimony that provides
an alternative, more detailed, and more accurate narrative than the one presented by the prosecution or by the
pretrial services, and that humanizes the client. Mitigators enable the defense attorney to present the client in the
context of his/her personal history, so that prosecutors, judge, jury, and corrections officials are able to see our
client person rather than simply as a list of criminal charges, and favorable disposition by plea bargain, a lower
sentence after conviction, or needed treatment during incarceration.

Goals
The goal of the program is to provide effective representation for our clients by providing as many mitigation
reports and/or testimony as possible to the thousands of indigent Cook County residents who have been charged
with a felony.
Priorities
To support public and appellate defenders by providing resources and training necessary to assist public and
appellate defenders in protecting the fundamental rights, liberties and due process of the accused. To assist
public and appellate defenders in connecting defendants with community-based services when possible and
appropriate to reduce recidivism.

Program Description
Multi-disciplinary team collaboration is a best practice for combatting human trafficking. The Human
Trafficking Outreach Coordinator Program is a part of the larger Cook County Human Trafficking Task Force
that works to provide comprehensive services for victims and provide training to a wide variety of stakeholders.
Through a victim-centered approach, the program can flourish between partners in the investigation and
prosecution of human trafficking cases. This approach focuses on the concerns and needs of victims by working
to minimize re-victimization during the criminal justice process. The human trafficking coordinator provides
support and help to empower victims to be active participants in the process to ensure that defendants are
brought to justice. Human trafficking cases routinely take more time to prosecute than other types of cases. It is
the responsibility of the victim service provider, law enforcement agency, and other members of the task force
to provide an environment and feeling of security for the victims throughout the process.
Program Activities
This program funds one full-time human trafficking outreach coordinator responsible for providing services to
human trafficking victims as well as educational presentations and training to outside agencies. The coordinator
is the point of contact for victims in human trafficking cases as proceedings are often confusing and can last for
years. After the trial is completed, the coordinator will keep in contact with service providers caring for human
trafficking victims to monitor the victims’ well-being.
The coordinator also works as a liaison between many local law enforcement agencies and the state’s attorney’s
office, helps to identify potential human trafficking victims, and will help overcome cultural and language
barriers between victims and other members of the Human Trafficking Task Force. The trainings will enhance
the ability of those who may come into contact with traumatized human trafficking victims to be able to identify
these victims and to use a victim-centric approach in needs management.

Program Description
Winnebago County Youth Recovery Court provides mental health services to a minimum of 25 youths aged 1017 and their families each year. The youths have committed criminal offenses and have a mental illness, or a
mental illness and co-occurring substance use disorder. Unfortunately, they are underserved by private
insurance, and thus are at risk for recidivism without proper mental health care. The program focuses on filling
the gaps in judicial oversight for youth with mental illness; addressing the lack of alternative dispositions for
these youth, such as specialized intensive services for youth with mental illnesses or co-occurring disorders
involved in the juvenile justice system; screening adjudicated youth with mental health needs and co-occurring
disorders; and coordinating services to families of the youth.
Program Activities
Grant funding will provide court-supervised treatment to juveniles within the justice system who have major
mental health disorders. The program includes an outreach case manager (100% FTE), a home-based therapist
(FTE 100%), an addictions counselor (50% FTE), and a clinical program coordinator (15% FTE).
Goals:
1) Provide coordinated case management services to youth.
2) Provide mental health treatment to youth to improve overall functioning.
3) Provide substance abuse treatment to youth.
Objectives
Maintain (3) integral positions to provide services to a minimum of (25) clients per year.
Provide transportation services to (100%) of clients that demonstrate a need.
Provide education case management services to youth.

Program Description
The Crime Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Program supports a team of researchers in three centers that
identify priority criminal justice issues for the state, conduct research and analysis on these areas, and
disseminate this information to guide decision-making both locally and within the agency.
Program Activities
The program operates under three centers. The Center for Criminal Justice Data and Analytics collects, analyzes
and disseminates statistical information on a variety of topics. The Center for Justice Research and Evaluation
focuses on program assessment and evaluations and produces publications that include keys findings and
implications for policy and practice. The Center for Sponsored Research and Program Development works with
experts in the field to conduct research and program evaluation, refine program performance measures, and
identify promising practices for programs to replicate.
Goals
Four main functions of this program include conducting applied research and evaluation that examines critical
criminal justice topics; expanding the development, collection, analysis and dissemination of research and
statistical information; engaging experts in the field to inform practitioners and other partners to assist them in
their local efforts; and informing and advising on evidence-based and promising practices and identifying areas
of program development.
Priorities
This program supports the JAG priority area of Planning, Evaluation and Technology Improvement Programs.
This program clearly fits within this priority area as it focuses on providing a body of research and data that will
inform and guide funding decisions, policy decisions, and expansion of promising and evidence-based
programming.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA expects to recommend continued funding of this program as the need for the program continually grows
and expands to accommodate informed decision making and planning.

B. Lead Entities
Two years ago, ICJIA convened an ad hoc committee to review past priorities and define new
ones for the use of VOCA funds. The committee prioritized strengthening and expansion of core
services.
Funding of core services will be processed according to a lead entity policy that was established
by ICJIA in January 2017. This policy states that lead entities can be used to distribute funds to
sub-grantees to implement federal- and state-supported programs. When a lead entity is
identified by ICJIA, the entity is responsible for the fiscal oversight and quality assurance of its
sub-grants. Lead entities conduct structured monitoring and provide subject matter expertise and
technical assistance to sub-grantees. ICJIA monitors its grants to lead entities via periodic
progress reports.
The following recommended designations for three lead entity programs are consistent with the
priorities set forth by the ad hoc committee. These designations, recommended by staff pursuant
to NOFO processes, will support 12 months of continued services with opportunities for an
additional 24 months.
1. Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV): ICADV is a statewide network of
service providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering
resulting from domestic violence. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach
services, training, and other support to victims of domestic violence in general and to child
victims of domestic violence. Staff recommends designating $21.3 million in FFY17 funds to
ICADV. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
2. Services to Victims of Sexual Assault
Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA): ICASA is a statewide network of service
providers that provides direct services to victims to alleviate trauma and suffering resulting
from sexual assault. The program provides counseling, advocacy, outreach services, training,
and other support services to victims of sexual assault in general and to underserved sexual
assault victim populations. Staff recommends designating $18.3 million in FFY17 funds to
ICASA. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
3. Child Advocacy Center Services
Children’s Advocacy Centers of Illinois (CACI): CACI is a statewide association of child
advocacy centers that provides direct services to child victims to alleviate trauma and
suffering resulting from child abuse. Staff recommends designating $7.1 million in FFY17
funds to CACI. Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.
Staff also recommends designating $1.9 million in FFY16 funds each to ICADV, ICASA, and
CACI to augment their existing designations to be distributed among their partner agencies to
purchase/upgrade computers and other office equipment. This would be an effective use of
remaining unexpended FFY16 funds set to expire on September 30.

C. Trauma Recovery Center Program
The purpose of the Trauma Recovery Center (TRC) Program is to support comprehensive direct
services for historically underserved or marginalized victims of violent crime and their families
through implementation of a TRC model.
This TRC model addresses both the psychological and tangible needs of violent crime victims
and their families, particularly those in underserved groups, via coordinated and comprehensive
clinical case management, including outreach services, and the provision of trauma-informed
evidence-based mental health services.
The recommended designations will support an additional 12 months of program activity,
funding both programs through 30 of the full 36 months allowed under the NOFO. The
designations will support ongoing personnel costs, client emergency funds, local staff travel,
TRC rent, indirect costs, and computer licenses.

Program Description
The mission of the Trauma Treatment Service project funded by ICJIA is to increase access to holistic services
for children and families who have experienced trauma, including evidenced-based intervention, resource
assistance, and case management.
Program Activities
To increase capacity of clinical and case management services for children who have experienced violence and
trauma, the program continues to expand its TTS staff, including, hiring a project coordinator, a case manager, a
child life specialist, and two therapists dedicated full time to trauma treatment service, one of whom is bilingual.
The program also \is increasing training to TTS staff, and in turn, being able to provide more evidenced-based
group therapy, such as Hope and Healing, CBITS and BounceBack. In addition, the program provides CTA and
parking passes to families receiving services since these expenses continue to be a barrier to families attending
services on a consistent basis.
Goals
Goals for this project include increasing TTS’s capacity to provide therapy services to families impacted by
violence, increasing wrap-around services by providing more robust case management, and increasing the level
of trauma-informed work within the hospital.
Priorities
The program supports priorities #3 Core Services, #5 Underserved Victims, #9 Long-term Needs, and #10
Community Violence, established by the Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee in January 2017.
Funding Prospectus
ICJIA staff expects to fund this program for another 18 months. Staff will continue analyze the program to
ensure it is meeting its goals and objectives.

Priorities

Funding Prospectus
Center on Halsted has received 18 months of funding for this program. This funding opportunity is for an
additional (and final) 18 months.
Past Performance
Center on Halsted obtained most of their objectives despite the challenge of not having an anti-violence project
director for the first two months of the project. An interim director split their time between running the program
and hiring a full-time director for the program. The new director was hired in March 2018. This grantee
continues to grow the program through community awareness and training of personnel in the community (i.e.
police officer and school personnel).

Program Description
Chicago Survivors provides immediate crisis intervention to the families of Chicago homicide victims. VOCA
funding will enable Chicago Survivors to continue to provide these services and to expand its services to
children/youth. These services will fill in service gaps left by insufficient trauma-informed, culturallyappropriate counseling services for minors, long waiting lists for appropriate counseling services that do exist,
and geographic inaccessibility of counseling services which are not in the community, coupled with
unavailability of transportation funds except on a reimbursement basis.
Program Activities
Chicago Survivors provides citywide evidence-based, trauma-informed, survivor-centered crime victims’
services to surviving family members following Chicago homicides. Services include crisis intervention, six
months of field-based supportive counseling and case management, comprehensive referrals, court advocacy
and accompaniment, and a Community of Survivors for peer-based recovery and healing.
Goals
Among the range of services that will be delivered through this funding, Chicago Survivors projects 600 clients
will receive crisis intervention services, 300 will receive individual advocacy, 150 clients will receive criminal
advocacy/accompaniment, and 160 clients will receive emergency financial assistance. All clients will receive
advocacy/accompaniment to emergency medical care as needed and referrals to other victim service providers
as needed for poly-victimization.

Funding Prospectus
DeKalb County has received 18 months of funding for this program. This funding opportunity is for an
additional (and final) 18 months to support relationship-building between law enforcement, hospitals and the
community.
Past Performance
This grantee overestimated the number of referrals they would receive from their providers versus the quantity
of walk-ins. The only provider they really received any referrals, was the school district. The quantity of walkins is a reflection in the hours the grantee spent engaging in public awareness activities; which is why they
projected “N/A” for the first 18-months (actual was 172 hours). The grantee originally did not anticipate
spending time engaging in public awareness, but it definitely “paid off” for the program. The grantee did not
anticipate the number of therapy sessions that their grant would warrant (150 estimated vs. 599 actual & 500
additional). So due to these numbers they had for the first 18 months, they have estimated 950 for the second 18
months.

Funding Prospectus
East Aurora School District has received 18 months of funding for this program. This funding opportunity is for
an additional (and final) 18 months.
Past Performance
During the first grant period, East Aurora had some challenges with employee turnover. In addition, the district
did not do a good job of communicating the grant program to the entire district (all the schools), to inform the
entire staff of what the program was about; thus, the referrals were low.

Program Description
Healing Hurt People Chicago (HHPC) is a hospital-based violence intervention program serving individuals
with traumatic injuries due to community violence. The majority of HHPC clients are at high risk for ongoing
violence exposure, have injuries due to gun violence, have a history of traumatic life experiences, are males age
30 and younger, and are treated at Level 1 Trauma Centers at Stroger Hospital of Cook County and University
of Chicago Medicine.
Program Activities
HHP-C staff conduct outreach activities as they are being treated in one of the trauma centers. HHP-C
provides crisis intervention, emotional and spiritual support, psychoeducation about trauma, tools for coping
with trauma reactions, safety and needs assessments, and practical assistance such as crime victim
compensation information.
For patients and families who elect to participate in the program following hospital discharge, TIS begins to
identify initial goals for their work together through in-depth intake and assessment of family structure,
work/education history, ACEs, substance use, safety, criminal justice involvement, PTSD and depression.
HHPC provides intensive case management offering long-term, high-intensity support in the client’s
environment, working toward mutually agreed upon goals and promoting trauma recovery. ICM includes
advocacy, mentoring, peer group support, information/referral to needed services, and ongoing emotional
support within the context of a therapeutic model of care designed to address the complexities of past and
ongoing trauma exposure.
Goals
HHPC program goals are to:
1. Promote trauma recovery in order to reduce re-injury, violent retaliation, and involvement with the criminal
justice system due to community violence.
2. Increase patients’ capacity to thrive emotionally, physically, and socially and to begin to build a strong
future for themselves and their families.

Past Performance
This grantee achieved many of their goals and are working on the goal for the emergency medical care. This has
been a challenge, as many people in the deaf community do not trust the system due to lack of having someone
at the hospital to be an interpreter during an exam.

Program Description
UCAN is proposing a suite of services that are the most beneficial in facilitating the healing of those impacted
by violent crime. The program provides strategies to heal trauma and help prevent future violence, strengthen
communities, and build future leaders through individual mentoring and group mentoring, clinical case
management, and individual and family therapy.
Program Activities
All program participants will be assigned a coach who will screen and assess their needs and refer them to
services or connect them to other needed services not provided by UCAN. Since many of individuals impacted
by crime may not have previous experience with individual or family counseling, UCAN has built in a clinical
case management component to offer psychoeducation and coordinate the navigation of the behavioral
healthcare system
Goals
The goal of the program is to help youth and their parents recognize the impact of violence and trauma in order
to create safety and healing for youth, build resilience and hope, and enable youth to reach their full potential.
Priorities
The program supports priorities #3 Core Services, #5 Underserved Victims, #9 Long-term Needs, and #10
Community Violence, established by the Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee in January 2017.

Priorities
This funding addresses Priority 8 described in the Illinois Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee Research Report:
Encourage trauma-informed and trauma-focused services for victims of crime.
Research indicates that services that are sensitive to or focused on the trauma of survivors are crucial in
mitigating the risk of re-victimization. Trauma-informed services are tailored to meet the needs of crime
