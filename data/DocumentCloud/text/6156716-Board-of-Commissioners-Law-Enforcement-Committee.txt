Chairman Maldonado asked the Secretary to read the Notice.
Commissioner Butler moved Communication No. 266177 on the floor for purposes of
discussion. Seconded by Commissioner Quigley, the motion carried.
Chairman Maldonado asked Commissioner Hansen to explain the proposed ordinance.
Commissioner Hansen explained that the purpose of the amendment is to bring the ordinance into
conformity with the United States Court of Appeals in Hodgkins v. Peterson in Indiana, which sets forth
a number of desiderata which must be met in any action to find a violator of the curfew ordinance in
such violation. The ordinance removes section 18-4 and substitutes for 18-4 Defenses enforcement
and it lists a number of things which constitutes for anyone under 17 legal presence after the curfew
hour, which are described in Section 18-3. This came about by the Sheriff and the State’s Attorney
bringing to the Board’s attention the fact that the current ordinance is unenforceable because of the
U.S. Court of Appeals’ findings. There are two subsequent amendments; one is important because of
the fine involved. The City of Chicago has already approved this as a change to their earlier curfew
ordinance. The other two amendments are as follows: The penalty section calls for a fine between $5
and $100. This language should be amended to “not to exceed $500.” The second amendment takes
out a redundancy which was brought to the Board’s attention by the State’s Attorney.
Commissioner Butler voiced his dismay that the Board is asked to approve an ordinance that the state
and city approved instead of all three government agencies meeting to discuss the issue. He finds the
ordinance unenforceable as it is written and additionally he stated the amendment is unenforceable.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the amendment and ordinance should be constitutional. He stated
that it would be good to have the amendments all on one sheet next to the old text for presentation at
the next Board Meeting. He agrees with the amendments, because parents need to be responsible for
their children.
Chairman Maldonado stated that the second and third amendments came after the first; that is why
they are not all laid out together.
Commissioner Hansen agreed with Commissioner Moreno.

Commissioner Moreno and Silvestri asked to be listed as a co-sponsor.
Commissioner Butler withdrew the motion to discuss.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved the approval of
Communication No. 266177. The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted Nay.
Commissioner Moreno stated that in misdemeanor cases the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office is
used as a clerk to fill out orders assessing fines, fees and costs. This creates a burden on the State’s
Attorney’s Office and the Courts. Also, the fees escalate from several hundred to several thousand.
These fees are difficult to collect from an indigent person. He would like to have the State’s Attorney’s
Office, the Public Defender’s Office, and the Sheriff’s Office appear at the next meeting to examine this,
and to discuss where these millions of dollars are going. The inability of the indigent to pay fees will
then lead to their driving privileges being re-suspended and to having warrants issued for their arrest for
failure to pay.
Chairman Maldonado suggested that Commissioner Moreno write the Chair a letter requesting an
informational meeting with the various agencies.
Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,
Committee on Law Enforcement &
Corrections
