 Devon SSA #43 Commission Meeting
i. Snow Removal Proposal Reviews – Vendor Interviews – Steve and Derrick from
Tovar presented their updated proposal. The new proposal is for 2” – 6” and the
proposed new cost is $3,990 per occurrence, which splits the difference
between the 2” – 4” and the up to 6” proposal. Tovar can do salting without
snow removal for under 2” or for icy conditions. Steve recommends a 2” – 4”
occurrence rather than 2” – 6” per occurrence. Motion to conditionally approve
Tovar provided Tovar reduces a price between $5,000 - $6,000 per occurrence
between 2” – 4” inclusive of snow removal and deicing by Maura with a second
by Pete. APPROVED
Steve and Derrick returned to the meeting with an update on the pricing.
Motion to approve Tovar’s price reduction to $5,325 per occurrence for 2” – 4”
(of this price, $2,000 is for the salt) and for salt only occurrences, the price is
$2,275; contract for three years. Motion by Maura with a second by Pete.
