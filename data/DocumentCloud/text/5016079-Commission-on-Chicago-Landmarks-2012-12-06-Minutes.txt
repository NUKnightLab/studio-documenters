property on a corner lot.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The garage shall be set back a minimum distance of 17’ from the north
property line similar to the setback of the existing garage; or, set back further
if needed to address code requirements related to vehicle access. As proposed,
the existing historic fence and curb cut shall not be modified;
2. As proposed, the metal roof tiles shall match the size, profile, color, and matte
finish of the clay roof tiles on the house and the garage will be clad with brick
to match the brick on the house. A sample of the metal tile and the new brick
shall be provided to Historic Preservation staff for review and approval prior
to order and installation;
3. As proposed, the garage doors shall have a paneled design, and a specification
sheet or catalog cut sheet shall be submitted with the permit application;
4. The applicant shall propose a window or architectural element in the
triangular area above the center garage door in order to break up the massing
of the brick wall; and,
5. The project as proposed requires a rear yard zoning variation and/or
adjustment; the Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance or adjustment relative to the zoning code requirements.

 2.

4112 S. Ellis
(Oakland District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of a wood ramp for handicap accessibility in the front yard
of the single-family residence.

Action:

proposed ramp location and design shall be submitted with the permit
application; and,
2. As proposed, the wood ramp shall be built over a portion of the existing front
entry stairs to remain and the ramp and railings shall be stained or painted
with “Battleship Gray” color.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. A new open metal fence, 5’-tall or less, shall be incorporated around the entire

for any location where the edge of the new hard packed gravel patio does not
abut the sidewalk);
2. Signs were not reviewed under this proposal. Any new sign(s) shall meet the
Commission’s sign guidelines, standards, and criteria, and shall be reviewed
and approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to installation; and,
