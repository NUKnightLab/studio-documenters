(Item A1)
The Chicago Housing Authority is required to submit for approval by the Board, a balanced
annual Comprehensive Budget detailing each of the following: General Fund, Section 8 NonMTW, HOPE VI and Other Funding Programs, and the use for these funds. The FY2010
budgeted expenditures have been revised from $1,031,372,033 to $983,016,147, resulting in a
$48,355,886 decrease. The major changes by funding source are explained below: General
Fund. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by $61,435,450 for a fund total of
$802,662,718. The reduction is due to changes in the cash flow schedule for various
construction projects and costs savings related to ADA work, both at various sites and, less than
anticipated costs per voucher for HAP. Section 8 Non-MTW Fund. Budget remained
unchanged at $7,875,729. Hope VI. Total revenues and associated expenditures decreased by
$8,004,161 for a fund total of $41,884,424. The reduction is due to a change in the cash flow for
both Rockwell Gardens and Park Boulevard Mixed Income properties. Other Funding. The
total revenues and associated expenditures increased by $21,083,725 for a fund total of
$130,593,276. This increase is primarily due to the use of additional American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act Funds (ARRA) to fund Altgeld Phase IV and the creation of various summer
jobs through awarded grants.

RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-85
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board letter dated July 14, 2010,
entitled “APPROVAL OF THE REVISED 2010 COMPREHENSIVE
BUDGET”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners, hereby approves the attached budget amendments,
“THE FY2010 COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET AMENDMENT #2”, and finds
with respect to said Budget:
1.

that the proposed expenditures are necessary for the efficient and
economical operation of the Chicago Housing Authority for the purpose of
serving low-income families;
2

 2.

3.

THAT,

that the financial plan is reasonable in that it indicates funding sources
adequate to cover all proposed expenditures, and does not provide for use
of Federal funding in excess of that payable under the provisions of the
applicable Federal regulations; and
that all proposed rental charges and expenditures will be consistent with
provisions of law and the Annual Contributions Contract in accordance
with the Amended and Restated Moving To Work Demonstration
Agreement of the Chicago Housing Authority with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development.

the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute
and forward to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development all
necessary budget documents and supporting information when applicable.

(Item A2)
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority executed Contract
No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux, Contract No. 9049 with Holabird and Root and Contract
No. 9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation. The aggregate value of these contracts is
an amount not-to-exceed $6,000,000.00. These Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”)
task order contracts are to provide PDC services on an “as needed” basis. The PDC services
include Assessments, Design, Engineering, Construction Documents, Construction
Administration and Close-out services for a period of three (3) years beginning July 1, 2009
through June 30, 2012. The PDC services are performed as needed at Family, Senior, Scattered
Sites and Non-dwelling properties. In February 2008, a task order contract was awarded for the
performance of PDC services for the Capital Maintenance Program. The term of the agreement
with that PDC (hereinafter, the “Capital Maintenance PDC”) was from March 1, 2008 through
February 28, 2011. In September of 2009, the Capital Maintenance PDC ceased its operations in
Chicago, and the Capital Construction Department (“CCD”) resolved all open items under its
agreement. To meet the CHA’s commitments under the Voluntary Compliance Agreement and
Memorandum of Understanding (“VCA/MOU”) with the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, it was necessary for the CCD to re-assign the majority of the Capital
Maintenance PDC’s projects to Harley Ellis Devereaux, Holabird & Root and Globetrotters
Engineering Corporation (the “IDIQ PDCs”). In first quarter of 2010, $3,200,000.00 of the
aggregate value of the IDIQ PDCs’ contracts has been allocated to the projects originally
intended for the Capital Maintenance PDC. Funding for these three (3) contracts cannot continue
to be used for work expected to be performed by the Capital Maintenance PDC without having a
significant negative impact on the ability of CCD to assign other vital design work to these
firms.To compensate for this impact, it is recommended that the remaining funding from the notto-exceed amount in the Capital Maintenance PDC’s contract be reallocated to the current IDIQ
PDCs. This amount is $3,545,693.56, and it would be distributed in the same percentages used to
allocate the $6,000,000.00 among the base contracts of the IDIQ PDCs.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010-CHA-87
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated July 14, 2010,
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE AMENDMENT NO. 01 TO
CONTRACT NO. 9048 WITH HARLEY ELLIS DEVEREAUX, CONTRACT
NO. 9049 WITH HOLABIRD & ROOT, LLC AND CONTRACT NO. 9050
WITH GLOBETROTTERS ENGINEERING CORPORATION FOR PRIME
DESIGN CONSULTING SERVICES AT VARIOUS CHA DWELLING AND
NON-DWELLING PROPERTIES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to execute three (3) Amendments for Prime Design Consultant services
at various CHA Dwelling and Non-Dwelling properties. Each Amendment No. 1
will add funding for PDC services to the following contracts: (1) Contract No.
9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux in an amount not-to-exceed $1,240,992.75 –
for a new total contract value not-to-exceed $3,340,992.75; (2) Contract No. 9049
with Holabird & Root in an amount not-to-exceed $1,181,897.85 – for a new total
contract value not-to-exceed $3,181,897.85; and (3) Contract No. 9050 with
Globetrotters Engineering Corporation in an amount not-to-exceed $1,122,802.96
– for a new total contract value of $3,022,802.96. The aggregate increase to the
3

 three (3) contracts is an amount not-to-exceed $3,545,693.56. The term of the
contracts will remain unchanged.
Each Amendment is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.
Item A3)
In the summer of 2008, the Board of Commissioners authorized the CHA to enter into a security
contract for a two (2) year base period commencing on August 1, 2008 and ending on July 31,
2010 , with a one year option exercisable at the CHA’s discretion upon the expiration of the Base
Term. The security contract initially included three HCV Satellite Office locations; 1550 West
88th Street, 1749 East 75th Street, 3333 West Arthington, the CHA’s warehouse at 2325 S.
Federal, the CHA’s Family Investment Center and the CHA’s main administrative offices
located at 60 East Van Buren. During the second year of the Base Term of Contract No. 8052,
changes in security coverage became necessary at certain locations, due in part to the winding
down of the CHA’s warehouse and the extension of open hours at various HCV Satellite Office
locations. Consequently, the extended daily hours of security services resulted in costs that
exceeded the amounts originally budgeted for the Base Term of Contract No. 8052. The CHA
entered into Amendment No.1 for Contract No. 8052, adding Seventy Nine Thousand Dollars
($79,000) to the original not-to-exceed compensation to cover the additional service
requirements that resulted from increased security coverage at the HCV Satellite Office locations
and administrative office locations. The CHA will incur additional costs associated with
increased security requirements through the July 31, 2010 expiration date for Contract No. 8052
in the amount of $20,000.00, due to continued increased service levels, including augmented
service requirements attributable to the opening of the CHA’s Family Wait List and to security
services needed at the Family Investment Center. The CHA now seeks to exercise the option
reserved under the Security Services Agreement to provide services at the applicable locations
for the one (1) year term commencing on August 1, 2010. The amendment effecting the
requested authorization to exercise the Option Term will reflect updated contractual terms for the
Option Term, including modified coverage locations and areas, and modified coverage times
applicable for the Option Term and the respective locations. The locations requiring security
coverage during the Option Term include: 2750 West Roosevelt Road; 3500 S. State Street, 5 th
floor; 1749 – 51 & 1755 - 57 East 75th Street; 60 East Van Buren; and 4859 S. Wabash.
RESOLUTION NO. 2010–CHA-88
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 14, 2010,
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO AMEND CONTRACT NO. 8052 TO
EXERCISE THE OPTION YEAR EXTENDING THE SECURITY
SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH MOORE SECURITY SERVICES, INC. ”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY,
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
Designee to exercise the CHA’s one (1) year extension option under Contract No.
8052 with Moore Security Services, Inc., in a total amount not to exceed
$675,702.56, for security services at various CHA Administrative Offices and the
HCV Satellite Offices.

(Item A4)
On May 18, 2010, the CHA received official written notice of an award of $180,000 from
DCEO’s Community Gardens Program to create and implement the Community Gardens
Program at Altgeld Gardens and was required to promptly execute the grant agreement with
DCEO. Subsequently on July 6, 2010, CHA received notice that DCEO desires to increase the
grant award by $180,000 to supplement an existing Community Gardens Program at the Iron
Street location near 35th and Ashland and will be preparing an amendment to the grant
agreement. The purpose of the funding is to provide a community based summer youth
employment program that provides youth with training in agribusiness while supporting the
establishment of a local food system that will serve the needs of low-income residents within the
community areas. As part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, this grant
opportunity will create forty (40) summer positions for youth residing in Altgeld Gardens and
forty (40) summer positions for youth to work at the Iron Street location based on demonstrated
need and will also create additional supervisor and project management positions with Growing
4

 Power. TEC Services will provide intake services for all youth participants and work with the
local WIA agency, the Chicago Department of Family and Supportive Services (DFSS), to
ensure that all youth participants are WIA eligible, which is a requirement for participation.

including growing and distributing the produce to the local community. E&ES and UCAN will
recruit youth participants and document their participation in the program. U of I Extension will
provide the educational curriculum and field trips.
