Prior to renovations starting on the home, we will be hosting our Sneak-A?Peek weekend October 11-13,
2019. This event is part of our biennial fundraiser and offers the public a ?rst glance at the selected house
before interior designers start working in their assigned space. The hours for this event are 4:00 8:00 pm.
on October 10:00 am. 4:00 pm. on October and 12:00 - 4:00 pm. on October 

Due to the excitement surrounding the opening of the decorated Show House in the Spring, we anticipate
many people in attendance during these three days. Please know that we aim to be an outstanding citizen
while in your neighborhood and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. We are asking for
visitors to be mindful and respectful of private property and driveways while visiting the house and we are
working with the local police precinct to pay special attention to the neighborhood during the Sneak-A?Peek
weekend.

Renovations to the kitchen and several bathrooms will begin this Fall, and next Spring approximately 30
interior designers will redesign the other rooms in the house. The Show House will then be open for Public
Tours from May 15 June 14, 2020. More information can be found at 
house.

The Junior League of Detroit is a dynamic group of women leaders who have been making change happen
since 1914. For over 100 years, we have been striving to promote voluntarism, develop the potential of
women, and improve communities through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Since
1914 the Junior League of Detroit has competed 53 major projects in and around the City of Detroit and
awarded over $250,000 dollars in community grants. Our 2020 Designers? Show House will support the
League?s local philanthropic efforts, including our key community impact initiative 'Project which helps
create a more food secure community by providing Education, Access, and Tools to those in need.

We look fonlvard to sharing your beautiful neighborhood and homes as we highlight the best of home design
in our great city. ASPIRE DESIGN AND HOME magazine, our national media sponsor, will also showcase
Indian Village to a national audience. Please feel free to contact us should you have any questions about
Sneak?A-Peek or the Designers? Show House. Contact Sneak?A?Peek event co?chair Jade Savage at 313-
