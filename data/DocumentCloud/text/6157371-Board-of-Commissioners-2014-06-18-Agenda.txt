Summary: The JAC proposes to conduct an in-depth analysis of youth from Chicago committed to IDJJ

back orders” for drug offenses and for misdemeanor offenses. We intend to analyze the IDJJ
commitment records and any available assessment scores upon entry to IDJJ, all arrest records for the
youth committed to IDJJ, and detention history for all youth committed to IDJJ. Combined, these data
sets will provide an overview of youths’ arrest history, recidivism rates in terms of rearrests, detention
stays, new commitments to IDJJ, history of separation from family and community in detention, and
initial insight into dispositional data. The partners may also have access to data regarding services
provided to youth via JISC or DFSS providers, and YASI scores when committed to IDJJ.

To Account(s): 542-258, $800,000.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $800,000.00

in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
As per Board action in February 2014, the medical malpractice and municipal coverage was extended on

An analysis of alternative self-insurance fund accounts, in consultation with Budget department.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
As current, Legal Services, Account 263, is tracking lower than expected, 33% spent with 50% of
FY2014 completed.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Legal Services spending is tracking lower than budgeted due to the dynamic nature of claims.

BOARD AGENDA

June 18, 2014

Summary: As the design plans progressed, the project became increasingly complicated by involvement
with the Cities of Des Plaines and Park Ridge, the Township of Maine, and the Illinois Department of
Transportation. This coordination caused lengthy delays to the project due to numerous requests for
design plan changes. Further, there were many issues to resolve including utility conflicts, parking
accommodations and easements/right-of-way acquisition.
Subsequently, the project scope was expanded to extend the southern limit of the improvement from
Ballard Road to Dempster Street (0.26 miles). Further, similar improvements were added along
intersecting Ballard Road (0.32 miles) and along intersecting Emerson Street (0.13 miles). Further, a
portion of the scheduled Greenwood Avenue detour route was determined to be in too poor condition to
be safely utilized as a detour route. Thus, Greenwood Avenue was improved from Carol Street to Davis
Street (0.45 miles) by milling and resurfacing the existing pavement, including full-depth patching with
curb and gutter repairs.
Additional funding was required due to the increased length of the project (from 0.74 miles to a net
length of 1.90 miles) and expansion of the improvement scope to include reconstruction of the adjoining
sections of Ballard Road and Emerson Street, removal and replacement of the existing Potter Road
bridge over Prairie Creek which required undercutting of the existing creek bed to provide a suitable
foundation for the new box culvert, removal and replacement of existing drainage structures, removal
and replacement of the traffic signals for three intersections, water main improvements for three separate
agencies, removal of an unknown existing water main in conflict with proposed water main installation
and the compensation of premium time for the Contractor to expedite completion due to utility conflicts,
additional concrete pavement removal not originally included in the plans, additional temporary
pavement needed for winter safety, additional earth excavation needed to properly construct the new
pavement, additional trench backfill for the storm sewer, geotechnical fabric for ground stabilization to
properly prepare the sub-grade for the proposed pavement, reconstruction of intersecting streets to the
curb return, pavement markings, sidewalks, landscaping with tree plantings, detour routing including
Greenwood Avenue improvements, additional construction engineering due to the expanded project
scope and significantly higher construction costs due to the lapse in time from the 1985 Improvement
Resolution approval to the 2008 contract letting date. This project was accepted following a final
inspection on July 21, 2011 and this supplement is necessary for accounting cost closure.

Urban Development (HUD).
Agreement Number: N/A

Accounts: Not applicable
Summary: Transmitted herewith is an Amendment to the existing Joint Cooperation Agreement between
Cook County and the City of Chicago Heights related to membership in Cook County’s Urban County for
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding. The Joint Cooperation Agreement, originally
executed in 1993, typically automatically renews every three years during the triennial Urban County
requalification period that Cook County is required to undertake by HUD, the source of the DBG funding.
For this cycle, HUD is requiring that new language be added to all cooperation agreements. This
amendment adds this new required language to the existing agreement between Cook County and Chicago
Heights. The Office of the State’s Attorney has approved the Amendment as to form.

Summary: The Bureau of Technology seeks to extend the following services from Spinnaker: (a) a
payroll tax software patch through 12/31/2014; (b) maintenance services for the County’s JD Edwards
World A7.3 Payroll module through 12/31/2014; and (c) maintenance services for the County’s JD
Edwards OneWorld Financials module through 6/30/2015.
The County seeks to extend the payroll tax software patch and payroll maintenance through 12/31/2014. By
that time, the County plans to have migrated the payroll module Denovo’s current cloud-based JDE

Road in Chicago. These fibers will enable the County to take the next step in creating a high-speed 10
Gigabit broadband network connecting Oak Forest Health Clinic and Markham Courthouse to the
County’s downtown campus. In exchange, the County will pay CMS a one-time upfront fee of $40,944
and an annual maintenance fee of $7,080 in each year of the 20-year agreement. Additionally, Cook
County will pay its proportionate share of any non-routine maintenance and repair costs, along with CMS
and other entities that hold IRUs in the same fiber path.

PROPOSED INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Department: Cook County Bureau of Technology
Other Part(ies): City of Chicago and other members of the Chicago Utility Alert Network Membership
Agreement
Request: BOT respectfully requests that the County Board authorize the Bureau of Technology’s Chief
Information Officer to execute an application for Cook County to participate in the Chicago Utility Alert
Network.
Goods or Services: Membership in the Chicago Utility Alert Network (CUAN) for public notification
and alerting services for the County’s underground broadband fibers and other entities’ utility lines
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: 7/1/2014 - 6/30/2015 and annual renewals as appropriate
Fiscal Impact: $4,000.00
Accounts: 499-220
Summary: If authorized to do so, the County’s Chief Information Officer will execute an application that
will allow the County to enter into the Chicago Utility Alert Network (CUAN) Membership Agreement,
more commonly known as DIGGER. The DIGGER network is the City of Chicago’s equivalent of JULIE
(the statewide underground facility notification service). As with JULIE elsewhere in the State,
excavators and public safety officials in Chicago use DIGGER as a comprehensive record of underground
facilities in Chicago’s public way and private property. This system also notifies all members of planned
and emergency immediate excavations. Since Cook County now owns and operates underground fiber
optic cables as part of its broadband initiative, the County seeks to enter into the CUAN/DIGGER
agreement. Allowing the County’s CIO to execute the CUAN/DIGGER agreement will allow the County to
follow the State of Illinois’ model in registering governmental underground broadband fibers in Chicago.
Doing so will also enable the public to be alerted to the existence of the County’s underground fiber, will
protect the County’s investment in its broadband network, and will decrease the likelihood of accident
associated with unregistered underground cables.

Presented by: ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender of Cook County
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Public Defender
Grantee: Public Defender
Grantor: Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: To acquire three (3) social workers or social service/community outreach workers to work
with youth that are processed through the Cook County Juvenile Court system each year. Staff will target
this highly vulnerable and educationally disengaged population by assessing our client’s needs and
strengths, or advocate for services while a youth is under supervision or probation. In addition, Staff will
help gather information such as mental health history, family situation, educational engagement, current
services being received, services needed, or any other relevant information. This information along with
testimony or other documentation from the social workers would be used to support arguments regarding
programming and services verses detainment, mitigation to combat transfer to adult court, or alternative
solutions to violating a youth’s probation.
In essence, the social workers would act as advocates for the youth as they move through their
supervision, reengaging youth in school, connecting them to needed services, and finding potential
alternative placements when a youth is having a crisis at home. All of these efforts would help to keep a
youth from violating probation while also giving them the support they need to complete their
supervision and achieve positive outcomes in the future.
