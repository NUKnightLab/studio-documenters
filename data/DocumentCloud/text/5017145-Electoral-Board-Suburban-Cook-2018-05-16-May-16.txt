(codified in the Code of Federal Regulations at 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, Pub. Law No. 10-191) impose
privacy and security standards and requirements upon health plans, health care clearing houses, and health
care providers that transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with standard
transactions within the scope of HIPAA, otherwise known as Covered Entities; and
WHEREAS, Cook County (“County”), a unit of local government under the laws of the State of Illinois,
is a single legal entity which conducts both Covered Functions and non-covered Functions; and
WHEREAS, the operation of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“CCHHS”) and the County’s
patient arrestee program, self-insured health, dental, vision and pharmacy benefit plans as administered by
the Department of Risk Management are Covered Functions subject to the HIPAA Privacy and Security
Rules; and
WHEREAS, HIPAA allows a Covered Entity to designate itself as a Hybrid Entity when it performs both

89

 WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has enacted the “Illinois Enterprise Zone Act” (the “Act”), 20 ILCS 655/1

within the Village; and
WHEREAS, the Village now desires to participate in the creation of a new larger enterprise zone, to be
known as the West Regional Enterprise Zone (the “Enterprise Zone”), along with the Village of Bellwood
(“Bellwood”), the Village of Broadview (“Broadview”), the Village of Melrose Park (“Melrose Park”), and
the County of Cook (“Cook County”) (collectively, the “Participating Local Governments”); and
WHEREAS, the Enterprise Zone shall be established through adoption of ordinances by the Participating
Local Governments, by entering into an Intergovernmental Agreement relative to governance, regulatory

the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”), designation by the State, and
through compliance with the public hearing and other requirements of the Act; and
WHEREAS, the Participating Local Governments have determined that there exists an initial need to
jointly cooperate relative to establishing the Enterprise Zone, to share certain of the costs of establishing
the Enterprise Zone, and to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement relative to said start-up activities,
cooperation and cost sharing (the “Initial Intergovernmental Agreement”). Once the Enterprise Zone is
formally established by an intergovernmental agreement (the “IGA”) and certification by DCEO, and the
respective obligations of the Participating Local Governments under the Initial Intergovernmental
Agreement are satisfied, the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement will be terminated. Upon termination, the
IGA will control any further operating, procedural, and cost-sharing related to the Enterprise Zone; and
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook, a body politic and
corporate, have the authority to enter into the attached Initial Intergovernmental Agreement pursuant to
their home rule powers as provided by Article VII, Sections 6 and 10(a) of the Illinois Constitution of 1970,
the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-1-1 et seq.) and the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (5 ILCS
220/1 et seq.), and find that entering into the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement is in the best interests of
the County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby
agrees as follows:
SECTION 1: Each Whereas paragraph above is incorporated by reference into this Section 1 and made a
part hereof as material and operative provisions of this Resolution.
SECTION 2: The President and Board of Commissioners authorize the execution of the Initial
Intergovernmental Agreement relative to initial start-up activities, cooperation and cost-sharing in the
creation of the Enterprise Zone, to be substantially in the form of the draft attached hereto and made a part
hereof as Exhibit “1”. Any minor changes to the draft Agreement prior to its execution are subject to the
90

 approval of the President and Board of Commissioners. The County President and County Clerk, or their
designees, are authorized to execute the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement upon its finalization, and to
execute and deliver all other instruments and documents that are necessary in order to fulfill the obligations
under the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement. Further, the President and Board of Commissioners
designates the Bureau of Economic Development as the County’s designee on the Start-Up Committee
pursuant to Section 3.A. of the Initial Intergovernmental Agreement.

PROPOSED CHANGES TO PUBLIC FACING RULES AND REGULATIONS
Department: Human Rights and Ethics
Summary: Revision to the Procedural Rules of the Cook County Commission on Human Rights
(Approved by Cook County Commission on Human Rights at March 8, 2018 meeting)
Consistent with County Code, § 1.9, the following proposal, which was noticed and approved by the Cook
County Commission on Human Rights at its March 8, 2018 meeting will not be effective until the sooner
of May 7, 2018 or the date upon which this rule revision is received and filed by the Rules Committee of
the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
Revision 1: Document Preservation Obligation Runs to All Parties
Existing rule:
Section 420.135Maintenance of Records by Respondent
Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Respondent shall preserve all records and other
material which may be relevant to the Complaint until the matter has been closed.
Revised rule:
93

 Section 420.135Maintenance of Records by Respondent Parties
Once a Complaint has been served on a Respondent, the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) shall preserve
all records and other material which may be relevant to the Complaint or any defenses until the matter has
been closed by the Commission. Provided that a party has not previously incurred a duty to preserve
evidence through agreement, contract, statute or its own affirmative conduct, a Complainant’s
preservation obligation begins when the Complainant files the Complaint with the Commission, and a
Respondent’s preservation obligation begins when the Complaint has been served on the Respondent. A
party’s failure to meet its preservation obligations under this Rule may result in the Commission drawing
an adverse assumption about the content of the missing record or other material against the party that
failed to preserve that record or other material.

RESOLUTION
155

 Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER, COUNTY COMMISSIONER

URGING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO ENACT OPIOID PRESCRIPTION LIMITS
WHEREAS, the opioid epidemic in our country has risen to extreme levels, causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans, and billions of dollars in economic costs; and
WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016 116 people died
every day from opioid-related drug overdoses; and
WHEREAS, 42,249 people died from overdosing on opioids in that year alone; and
WHEREAS, of those deaths, 17,087 were the result of overdosing on commonly prescribed opioids; and
WHEREAS, the cost of these drugs totaled $504 billion in 2016; and
WHEREAS, most recently, the state of Florida passed a bill to combat this crisis by instituting prescription
limits on opioids and increasing funding for treatment; and
WHEREAS, Florida will be the 25th state since 2016 that has passed legislation that imposes some limits
or guidelines on opioid prescriptions, and only the 3rd to create statutory limits of three or four days for
Schedule II painkillers like OxyContin and Fentanyl; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is not one of the states with any of these imposed limits, and as a result the opioid
epidemic remains relatively unchecked; and
WHEREAS, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) now supports policies
limiting the supply of opioids for acute pain treatment; and
WHEREAS, PhRMA has concluded that too often, individuals receive a 30-day supply of opioid medicines
for minor treatments or short-term pain, and that overprescribing and dispensing can lead to patients taking
opioids longer than necessary or to excess pills falling into the wrong hands.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of this board, as public servants to the
residents of Cook County, urge the Illinois General assembly to pass comprehensive legislation to limit
prescriptions to these opioids to five days in order to combat the crisis currently affecting our communities
and state as a whole.
Approved and adopted this 16th of May 2018.

Cook County Board of Commissioners

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JESÚS G. GARCÍA, JOHN A. FRITCHEY, STANLEY MOORE AND
RICHARD R. BOYKIN, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
TO ADOPT THE GOOD FOOD PURCHASING POLICY
WHEREAS, Cook County strives to improve the health of all its residents through services and policies
that promote health and well-being; and
WHEREAS, The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) was developed in 2012 to encourage public
institutions to procure food produced through values-driven purchasing standards and to support successful
implementation through technical assistance and verification; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) recommended the creation of
sustainable local food systems in its Go To 2040 Comprehensive Regional Plan; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation, through its internal procedure reviewed,
and now recommends, the adoption of a Good Food Purchasing Policy; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation found that sustainable food is
ecologically sound, economically viable, and socially responsible; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commission on Social Innovation found that the health and well-being of
residents can be supported by the creation of a sustainable local food system; and
WHEREAS, good food is defined by GFPP as food that is healthy, local, fair, sustainable and humane,
with foods that meet the dietary guidelines for Americans, provide freedom from chronic ailment and are
delicious and safe, and where participating food suppliers are evaluated and held accountable for ensuring
fair compensation and fair treatment of their workers, and that those workers are free of exploitation, and
where Good Food is available to purchase for all income levels and high-quality food is equitable and
physically and culturally accessible to all, and where food is produced, processed, distributed, and recycled
locally using the principles of environmental stewardship (in terms of water, soil, and pesticide
management); and
WHEREAS, good food values prioritize nutrition, affordability, geography, and sustainable production
practices including sound environmental practices, fair prices for producers, safe and fair working
conditions for employees, and humane conditions for animals; and

157

 WHEREAS, good food purchasing refers to the sourcing and purchasing of foods and beverages, and food
and beverage service contracts, procured by County Departments and Agencies; and
WHEREAS, in participating in the Good Food Purchasing Program, Cook County will help support a
regional food system that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially responsible, and will have
an impact on the availability of local, sustainable food; and
WHEREAS, Cook County adopted the Social Enterprise Preference to create opportunities for businesses
that address social needs and employ people who are mentally, physically, economically or educationally
disadvantaged including people with arrest and conviction records and those facing significant employment
challenges.
WHEREAS, there is a need to preserve urban and peri-urban farm land with equitable minority community
ownership and control; and
WHEREAS, there exists in the food and composting industries limited diversity in the ownership,
production and distribution channels; and
WHEREAS, there are significant barriers to entry into the food industry at the ownership level, including
access to capital and information, expertise and relationships, resulting in a need for capacity building for
disadvantaged and under-capitalized businesses; and
WHEREAS, there are a number of tax credits available at the federal, state, county and city level to
incentivize investment in distressed communities and to hire very low- income employees, employees with
past criminal records, etc.; and
WHEREAS, it is recognized that the significant buying power of public institutions across the country can
reform the food system, create opportunities for smaller farmers and low-income entrepreneurs of color to
thrive, provide just compensation and fair treatment for food chain workers, support sustainable farming
practices, reward good environmental stewardship including limiting food waste and increasing
composting, and increase access to fresh and healthy foods.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Cook County embrace the Good Food Purchasing
Program (GFPP) as a strategy to help improve our region’s food system through the adoption and
implementation of the Good Food Purchasing Standards, which emphasize the following values:
1.

Local Economies – support small and mid-sized agricultural and food processing operations within
the local area or region.
1.A. Priority Communities- Incentivize through GFPP bonus points purchasing food produced
and/or processed for GFPP contracts from low-to-moderate income communities where at least
51% of households have incomes at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI), as defined
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Priority will be given to communities
that also have scores ranging between 30.1 and 82.7 on the University of Illinois at Chicago Great
Cities Institute’s Economic Hardship Index.

2.

Environmental Sustainability –- Support farmers employing sustainable farming practices by
using the least toxic crop protectants reducing the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers;
158

 utilizing antibiotics only when medically necessary; conserve and regenerate soil and water; protect
and enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity; and reduce on-farm energy consumption and
greenhouse gas emissions.
3.

Valued Workforce – provide safe and healthy working conditions and fair compensation for all
food chain workers and producers from production to consumption

4. Animal Welfare – provide healthy and humane care for farm animals.
5.

Nutritional – promote health and well-being by offering generous portions of vegetables, fruit, and
whole grains; reducing salt, added sugars, fats, and oils; and by eliminating artificial additives.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the following goals are also adopted and implemented as part of
Cook County’s participation in the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) to address ongoing inequities
and issues caused by unequal access to access and resources. Cook County Departments and agencies are
tasked with developing multi-year action plans that will address these inequities by pursuing one or more
of these possible strategies:


Encourage businesses to grow food organically and engage in bio-dynamic agriculture, developing
incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews and other potential supports during the contracting
period; and



Encourage prospective food vendors to invest in and hire from Priority Communities by: 1)
developing bonus scores for Requests for Proposal reviews for prospective vendors demonstrating
a track record of hiring and investing in such communities; and 2) assisting prospective vendors in
navigating tax incentives and other financial programs designed to increase investment in
disadvantaged communities; and



Encourage conveyance of publicly-owned vacant properties (land and buildings) to local minority
owned and/or controlled social enterprises and/or community land trusts for urban agriculture and
other food related enterprises in an equitable fashion by setting ownership goals for minority owned
and controlled enterprises; developing incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews; exploring
possibilities for technical assistance and financial assistance, including tax incentives; and



Encourage hiring people with arrest and conviction records by developing incentives for Requests
for Proposal reviews, exploring options for technical assistance and financial assistance, including
tax incentives; and



Engage local universities, social enterprises and small consulting firms with demonstrated expertise
in providing technical assistance to emerging and/or disadvantaged businesses; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) convene
a taskforce that includes all relevant Cook County Departments and Agencies involved in the procurement
or service contracting of foods, including but not limited to, Offices under the President, the Office of the
Chief Judge, the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, the Office of the Sheriff, the Cook County Health
and Hospital System, the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, the Center for Good Food Purchasing, and
other relevant diverse stakeholders, and
159

 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the taskforce recommend flexibility within each of these five value
categories and the following steps in support of the purchasing of Good Food and as a framework for
guiding values-driven purchasing:
1.

Communicate Good Food Purchasing Standards to appropriate suppliers, including distributors and
foodservice companies, and ask them to share data that will help the County complete a baseline
Good Food Purchasing assessment of food procurement practices within 12 months of the adoption
of this resolution.

2.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, develop and adopt an multi-year action plan
with benchmarks to measure success towards Good Food Purchasing Standards, diversity goals,
and programs to support emerging producers and suppliers from Priority Areas and diverse
communities including accountability systems with appropriate vendors/distributors to verify
sourcing commitments and assess current food procurement practices within 6 months; and

3.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, establish supply chain accountability and
traceability systems with vendors/distributors to verify sourcing commitments and assess current
food procurement practices within 6 months; and

4.

To the extent permitted by law, following the multi-year action plan, after the baseline assessment
has been completed, incorporate Good Food Purchasing Standards into new procurement requests
and contracts within 6 months; and

5. Seek resources as needed to staff and implement the Good Food Purchasing Standards; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the taskforce reports its progress to the Health and Hospital
Committee within 12 months of the adoption of this Resolution, and then report annually on implementation
progress; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the taskforce will host an annual public hearing where diverse
community stakeholders and residents can ask questions and provide feedback on implementation,
including due diligence reporting data to verify compliance, measure progress, and celebrate successes; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the taskforce will engage and encourage municipalities,
townships, schools, hospitals and other entities within Cook County to adopt the Good Food Purchasing
Policy.
Approved and adopted this 16th of May 2018.

REPORT
Department: Department of Budget and Management Services
Report Title: Performance Based Management and Budgeting Annual Report FY2017
Report Period: 12/1/2016 - 11/30/2017
Summary: This report is to comply with the amendments to Article X of the Cook County Code
(PERFORMANCE BASED MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING), approved by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on June 29, 2016. The purpose of the amendments was to enhance the
effectiveness of the annual budget process by establishing administrative units called “programs.”
Amendments to Article X also created a new process for the submission of performance data.
“Programs” were identified for the purpose of being the primary building blocks of an agency’s or
department’s budget request, making it possible to distinguish assigned employees and costs (i.e. inputs),
and the resulting program performance metrics, i.e. outputs, outcomes, and efficiency.
Performance data submission was to take the form of an Annual Report, with submittals being due within
45 days of fiscal year end, by each County Department and Agency, and as part of its annual Budget
Request, as described in Section 2-933. The President or his or her designee, the Budget Director, is to
prepare a summary report of these values to be presented to the Board. This report is submitted for said
purpose.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS HOUSE BILL 4364 TO OFFER
OPPORTUNITY FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS SERVING LIFE SENTENCES THE CHANCE
FOR PAROLE
WHEREAS, The U.S. Supreme Court ruled six years ago that sentencing schemes that require life
sentences with no hope of parole for crimes committed by juveniles violated the U.S. Constitution; and,
WHEREAS, on May 6, 2018, the Injustice Project, in partnership with the Chicago Sun-Times, published
an article stating that in Illinois more than 160 prisoners are serving life sentences for crimes they committed
as juveniles, with virtually no hope of parole or early release under current law; and,
WHEREAS, Using Illinois Department of Corrections data, Injustice Watch examined the number of
prisoners serving 50 or more years in prison who were taken into custody before their 18th birthday; and,
WHEREAS, Because Illinois almost entirely abolished parole in 1978, the 167 juvenile offenders do not
get the same chance to show rehabilitation and change that they might get in other states. The only juvenile
offenders with parole opportunities are the aging handful who were convicted before the law changed four
decades ago; and,
WHEREAS, Courts across the country varied standards on what length of a prison term can legally be
considered a life sentence, and whether and when they should be eligible for parole; and,
WHEREAS, At least 13 other states and Washington, D.C., have passed laws giving young offenders a
chance to ask for parole release or a sentence reduction after first serving as few as 12 and as many as 35
years in prison, depending on the state and severity of the crime; and,
171

 WHEREAS, The Illinois Senate Criminal Law Committee last month sent to the full Senate a bill that
would permit inmates who committed crimes before the age of 21 the periodic chance to ask for parole,
after first serving 10 years for lesser crimes and 20 years for first-degree murder or aggravated sexual
assault; and,
WHEREAS, Research indicates that incarceration has a jarring effect on life expectancy, a study by
Vanderbilt University Professor Evelyn Patterson found each year of incarceration likely reduces a
prisoner’s life expectancy by two years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners do hereby
support and encourage the General Assembly of the State of Illinois in the passage of House
