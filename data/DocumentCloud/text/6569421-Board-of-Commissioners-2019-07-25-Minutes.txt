OPPOSING THE PROPOSED RULE FROM THE UNITED STATES
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
REGARDING THE VERIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE STATUS WITHIN THE
HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 1980

7

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

July 25, 2019

WHEREAS, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is tasked with
addressing the country’s housing needs through policy and programs, improving and developing
communities, and enforcing fair housing laws; and
WHEREAS, on May 10, 2019, HUD published a proposed rule in the Federal Register of the United States
Government that would amend the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 to require
verification of eligible status for persons receiving housing assistance; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule would require the verification of the eligible immigration status of all
recipients of assistance under a covered program who are under the age of 62; and
WHEREAS, furthermore, individuals who are not in eligible immigration status may not serve as the
leaseholder, even as part of a “mixed status” family whose assistance is prorated based on the percentage
of members with eligible status; and
WHEREAS, according to the National Housing Law Project, this rule would target “mixed-status”
households, who based on their immigration status are eligible and ineligible for receiving financial
assistance from HUD but who, based on longstanding federal law, can still live together; and
WHEREAS, Section 214 of the Act currently prohibits the Secretary of HUD from making financial
assistance available to persons other than United States citizens or certain categories of eligible noncitizens
in the Department’s public and specified assisted housing programs; and
WHEREAS, HUD has indicated that this rule is needed to better align with the requirements of Section
214 which prohibits making financial assistance available to persons other than U.S. citizens, nationals, or
certain eligible categories of noncitizens; and
WHEREAS, the Pew Charitable Trusts has reported the rule would ban every member of a household from
receiving a subsidy if just one family member is ineligible, including those over 62; and
WHEREAS, by evicting mixed-status units that are already prorated, HUD has indicated in its own analysis
of the proposal that administrative costs to cover all-eligible households would rise by approximately $200
million; and
WHEREAS, HUD has stated that the increased costs would reduce the quantity and quality of assisted
housing which would include fewer households under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and decreased
quality of service and maintenance of units overall; and
WHEREAS, the #keepfamiliestogether campaign estimates that at the national level, 25,000 immigrant
families, including 55,000 children, would be harmed by the proposed rule; and
WHEREAS, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that the new documentation requirements
would primarily impact U.S. citizen tenants and applicants for HUD assistance such as people living on
low incomes, the elderly, people who have experienced homelessness, domestic violence survivors, and
people with disabilities, all who face barriers to accessing administrative records such as proof of U.S.
citizenship; and
8

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

July 25, 2019

WHEREAS, according to a 2017 analysis of 2017 HUD administrative data from the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, there are 4.5 million households throughout the country that receive financial
assistance from HUD, and 200,700 are within Illinois; and
WHEREAS, of the households receiving assistance in Illinois, 5,630 are considered “mixed status,” as
they have either eligible or non-eligible noncitizens; and
WHEREAS, the proposed rule to require verification of eligible status poses a risk to the housing stability
of thousands of Illinois households and increases the barriers faced by all persons on low incomes seeking
HUD assistance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does stand
for the right to housing for all people and opposes the proposed rule on verification of eligible status issued
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners encourages the Housing
Authority of Cook County to create a plan, if the rule is finalized, to ensure that the existing families who
receive assistance under these programs and who would have to either be evicted or separate have
alternative low-income housing options; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Cook County remains a “Fair and Equal County for Immigrants” as
defined by 07-R-240 and stands against this most recent example of the coordinated attack on immigrant
families by this administration.
Approved and adopted this 25th of July 2019.

Cook County Board of Commissioners

URGING THE ILLINOIS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO
COSPONSOR AND SUPPORT H.R. 96 (VETERAN’S DENTAL CARE)
WHEREAS, the purpose of the Veteran’s Administration (VA) is, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, “To
care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan”; and
WHEREAS, the Veterans Administration provides health care to many Veterans through its 1,250 health
care facilities, including 172 VA Medical Centers and 1,069 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity;
and
WHEREAS, after serving our Country, our Veterans have earned the very best healthcare possible,
something the Veteran’s Administrations has pledged to provide; and
WHEREAS, despite providing various types of healthcare to over 9 million Veterans, the Veteran’s Health
Administration (VHA) fails to provide dental care to most of those Veterans; and
WHEREAS, according to the VHA’s own statistics, while over 9 million Veterans are eligible for
healthcare under the VHA, only about 500,000, or 5.6%, of those are receiving dental care, as the
qualifications require a Veteran to be 100% disabled or have been a POW to receive full dental care; and
WHEREAS, while Veterans are able to purchase dental insurance through the VA Dental Insurance
Program (VADIP), it is not an affordable option, leaving Veterans with no other choice but to walk around
with rotted teeth and other signs of a lack of dental care; and
WHEREAS, dental health has been proven to affect other aspects of health including cancer, Alzheimer’s,
diabetes and more. Good dental care can prevent many of these diseases, leading the VA to save money on
treating future diseases; and
WHEREAS, according to the 2016 Oral Health in Illinois Report, in 2015, over one third of adults in
Illinois (36%) reported not having visited the dentist in the past year, with lack of insurance being one of
the barriers to dental care; and
WHEREAS, House of Representatives (H.R.) 96 introduced by United States Rep. Julia Brownley would
amend Title 38, United States Code (USC), to require the Veteran’s Administration to furnish dental care
in the same manner as any other medical service, giving more Veterans access to full dental care that they
severely need; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and members of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby recognize the right of all Veterans to have full coverage for dental care; and
165

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this text be spread upon the official proceedings of this Honorable
Body and copies of this Resolution be presented to United States Senator Dick Durbin, and United States
Representative Bobby Rush as representatives of the delegation.

WHEREAS, studies link racism to negative health outcomes; and
WHEREAS, areas falling under the public health category include healthy communities, violence

WHEREAS, Cook County is the 2nd largest County in the United States, with health disparities among its
racial populations, and
WHEREAS, racism is a social system with multiple dimensions, including individual racism and systemic
racism; and

against others based on race; and
WHEREAS, systemic racism is an institutional or structural system based on structuring opportunity and
assigning value through the social interpretation of one’s race; and
WHEREAS, systemic racism unfairly disadvantages individuals, businesses, and communities while
simultaneously depleting the strength of society through the wasteful use of human resources; and

racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, transportation, and criminal justice; and
WHEREAS, studies show African Americans have the highest death rate at every life stage; and

in the State of Illinois out of 102 counties; and
WHEREAS, Cook County must address the persistent disparities in health outcomes and the social,
economic, educational, and environmental inequities contributing to them; and
WHEREAS, Cook County will commit to achieving health equity; and
WHEREAS, while there is no epidemiologic definition of "crisis", the health impact of racism clearly rises
to the definition proposed by Galea, "[t]he problem must affect large numbers of people, it must threaten
health over the long-term, and it must require the adoption of large-scale solutions; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health will work with the newly formed Racial Equity
Leadership Council in Offices Under the President to remove health inequities for the benefit of all residents
