SIR (Standardized Infection Ratio) is a summary
measure which compares the actual number of
Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) in a facility
with the baseline data for standard population. SIR >
1.0 indicates more HAIs were observed than predicted,
conversely SIR of < 1.0 indicates that fewer HAIs were
observed than predicted.
