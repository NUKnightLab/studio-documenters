III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Chairman O’Donnell noted that an issue that has been raised regarding a number of contracts scheduled for
consideration at this meeting and discussed at many Finance Committee Meetings, relates to the System’s
inability to hire people in a timely fashion. She indicated that this is affecting many areas in the System; she
requested that the administration work with her, Board Chairman Carvalho and Human Resources Committee
Chairman Butler to work on a concrete solution to the problem.
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
consideration. She noted that there are several requests that are pending review by Contract Compliance - of
the fifteen requests presented, thirteen remain pending review by Contract Compliance. Six of the contracts
have not been completed due to the late submission by Supply Chain; she stated that she is working as quickly
as possible to review and redefine a process that will support the required due dates to allow the Compliance to
do their due diligence.
During the Committee’s review and discussion of request number 5 (request to amend and increase the
contract with Sodexo America, LLC), Ms. Besenhofer stated that part of the intent for this amendment is to
include performance indicators and measurements within the contract; these were not initially included as part
of the original contract.
Mr. Oder inquired noted that he does not have an issue with adjusting a contract after an organization gets
more experience in this type of contract, particularly when the contractor is presumably doing a good job. With
regard to the section of the amendment referring to free meals for residents, he questioned whether this is
currently an industry standard; he encouraged the administration to review this policy and the industry
standards around the country. With regard to using adjusted patient days as a measure of the inpatient food
costs, he noted that the figure for adjusted patient days includes all the revenues of outpatient services
(emergency room, clinic, pharmacy, etc.). He stated that perhaps a more accurate statistic would be to use
inpatient days and to use a partial patient day for the observation unit, depending upon how many meals on the
average tend to be served to observation patients. In addition to that, he noted that food service to family
members in the Pediatric Unit is very important, so there would probably need to be some kind of factor from
the pediatric days to account for that, because family members definitely should be encouraged, particularly at
mealtime, to be with the pediatric patient. He stated that the numbers may be absolutely on target, but it
seemed to him that perhaps a more realistic statistic could be used.
Director Michael stated that it is a little challenging to tell exactly what the improvements are expected to be;
as a Board Member, it would be helpful to know that for the additional money, what is Sodexo going to do? He
stated that from the transmittal it is not totally clear what the details are, and indicated that more information
regarding this would be very helpful. Ms. Besenhofer stated that this can be provided.
Director Butler noted that during the verbal recitation of the item, there may have been a mis-statement of the
amount of the contract amendment; for the record, the amount of the request to amend and increase the
contract is $7,564,836.00.
Board Chairman Carvalho stated that, with regard to this request, he had quite a few questions when he first
saw it. As Mr. Oder indicated, sometimes the experience over the life of a contract moves in a different
direction than what was originally planned; apparently over the life of this contract, there were some
assumptions made about staffing on the System’s part, for example, that were not fulfilled, so in some respects,
some of what might be assumed as additional costs is not exactly how the dollars are being spread out; rather,
rather some of it is to account for costs associated with the experience to date. Rather than dispute in a

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
combative way, the parties have discussed the matter and have worked it out in a more cooperative way. Some
of the cost associated with the amendment is increased cost due to new assumptions, but some of it is also to
reconcile the actual experience under the contract. The decision to rebid or reform the contract, and the strong
sense of the administration, was that the negotiations led to a price that would be a very good price; rather than
creating the disruption from terminating one contract and rebidding in the hopes of getting a better price, the
administration believes that this is a better price than that which would be resulting from a rebidding process.
The combination of the administration’s judgment that this is a good price, and their opinion that the
experience and vendor’s performance has been good - this reconciles some of those conflicts relating to the
amendment in a way that results in a conclusion that is least disruptive to the organization and still reflects a
good price for those services for the System. Based on those assurances, he stated that his initial concerns
about this were dissipated.
Director Michael stated that he has worked with Sodexo in the past; he has always been pleased with services
that they have provided and he believes that they do so at a fair price. However, as the expectations have
changed now, he thinks it would be helpful for the Board to understand what are the new expectations on the
part of both parties, so that all parties are clear regarding what to expect going forward. He noted that in the
request, it states that the amendment is to start as of January 1, 2013; he inquired whether this is retroactive
because the System has already started to incur some of these costs, and there is a need to cover that period of
time. Ms. Besenhofer responded affirmatively.
With regard to request number 7 (extend and increase contract with Suburban Primary Health Care Council –
funding for Access to Care Program), Chairman O’Donnell inquired whether the individuals served under this
Program are a population who would qualify for CountyCare. Board Chairman Carvalho responded in the
negative; he stated that an overwhelming number of the persons served under this Program would not be
eligible under the Affordable Care Act.
Director Michael noted that the previous agreement to fund expired November 30th. He indicated that in the
future it would be better to present these types of contracts earlier. Ms. Besenhofer responded that this is the
goal; as mentioned earlier in the meeting, Supply Chain will be refining the entire process and communicating
it to the end users so that all are in synch with the expectations for contractual requests.
With regard to request number 12, Director Michael noted that this is reflected as a sole source/preferred
provider contract, but no history is reflected with these products, according to the transmittal; normally when a
new product is brought in like this, one would expect to see some sort of competitive bidding process, unless
this product is only made by Medtronic. Ms. Besenhofer stated that this is a physician preference item. The
physicians have reviewed the different products available, and this is the product that they have recommended,
based on the patient outcomes; she noted that the physicians have trialed the product, and have utilized it. She
added that this item falls under the Value Analysis Program, which is under the umbrella of Supply Chain
Management. That is one of the items in which Supply Chain always tries to engage the physicians and
clinicians, when there is a preference for reasons of patient outcome or safety.
Director Michael, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 15, pending completion of review of the proposed requests by
Contract Compliance, and pending receipt of additional information regarding the
Sodexo request. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Financial Reports – March 2013 (Attachment #3)
Dorothy Loving, System Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports for the period through
March 2013. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (Attachment #4)
This item was taken out of order.
Susan Greene, System Interim Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid
Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
Ms. Greene stated that as of Wednesday, 38,051 applications have been initiated; that figure excludes the
approximate 6,000 applications that were written-off due to aging (75 days or older). On average, 515
applications are being initiated per day, and 383 per day are being submitted to the Illinois Department of
Human Services (DHS). In April, DHS has processed approximately 168 applications per day; however, in the
past week, this figure has gone up to an average of 244 applications per day. Last week, the administration
was notified that the State has agreed to increase their staffing up to 100 people; these staff will be on campus
to process the applications.
Ms. Greene clarified that there are over 40 application assisters located on the Stroger Hospital Campus.
Enrollment is done at all inpatient units, both at Stroger and Provident Hospitals and at both Emergency
Departments (EDs). The largest Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County (ACHN) clinic
is the General Medicine Clinic (GMC). GMC has approximately 20% of the volume; two enrollers have been
there basically since enrollment started. The specialty care volume is twice what the primary care volume is;
this is another reason that an office for taking applications is located on the first floor, right across from the
specialty clinics. She noted that she appreciates the fact that a more direct strategy is needed out at the ACHN
clinics; therefore, the administration is moving in the direction of training those staff to ask the four screening
questions, to more precisely identify those that may be eligible.
Ms. Greene stated that several meetings have been held with representatives from the Access to Care Program.
She believes that progress is being made towards a sort of mutual referral system, under which they will refer
to the System those persons that they think are eligible for CountyCare; likewise, if the System has people that
were denied enrollment in CountyCare and who live in the suburban area, the System would start referring
those persons to the Access to Care Program.
Ms. Greene stated that membership is doubling each month. She informed the Committee of another major
development - the State requested a change in citizenship verification. The System’s staff has been doing this,
and now the State will be doing it. As a result, the System will be able to submit more applications, because
the System staff will not be verifying citizenship. This change will probably occur in the next week or two;
however, she noted that this policy change needs to be communicated from the Illinois Department of
Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) to DHS.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
Director Michael inquired further regarding the subject; he asked whether the administration expects any
change with the timing of the verification of citizenship – will it take the State less or more time to verify? Ms.
Greene responded that the System’s cycle of time will shrink, because applications will be submitted on a
faster basis. The State has access to the Social Security Administration database, so they batch requests every
day; until they staff-up, they will probably spend more time on each application. She noted that the staffing
level increase is becoming more evident, as the number of applications processed per day is increasing. She
added that the System would like to submit 500 applications per day, and would like the State to process 500
applications per day. Representatives from the State have indicated that they will have all of the staff in place
by June 1st.
Ms. Greene stated that applications are now being taken at Cermak Health Services of Cook County, effective
April 1st; over 800 applications have been taken there so far.
Ms. Greene stated that the younger population has slightly increased; previously, 13% of members were under
the age of 35, now that figure is 21%. 55% of the members are over the age of 50, and 75% are between the
age of 35 and 64. As this is actually a Federal demonstration, she noted that the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) is very interested in the lessons being learned. One of the lessons that has been
debated extensively is that when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) rolls out, older, more stable populations will
enroll, and younger people will be more of a challenge with regards to enrollment. She stated that a lot of
analysis has been done regarding where the potential eligible people under the age of 35 are at the System they tend to be in the EDs, so the administration is working with its vendors on different strategies in
approaching and talking to this group, and encouraging them to enroll. She added that the administration is in
active discussions with HFS on how the System is going to transition beyond CountyCare and the
demonstration into either an actual health plan, or a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN) come
January 1st.
Ms. Greene stated that, beyond the subject of enrollment, care management and transition of care issues are
being identified within the System; however, she stated that there are a lot of stories of how CountyCare
members have really benefitted - the quality of the patient experience is improving, particularly because
members have access to home health as an alternative to longer lengths of stay or placement in nursing homes.
She stated that it has been a bit of a challenge to transfer patients back into Stroger Hospital, because it takes
twenty hours to get a patient from the ED to the ward. Additionally, there is some additional education that is
being provided to ED staff in response to their concerns regarding potential patient dumping - when the System
is trying to transfer a CountyCare patient from an ED outside of the System to one of the System’s hospitals,
the System staff needed to be educated that these were the System’s CountyCare patients that were being
transferred back in, and not a patient dumping situation.
The Committee discussed the methods used to identify and approach potential eligible persons for enrollment
purposes. Ms. Greene stated that, within the Cerner System, there is a flag that identifies someone as
potentially eligible for the Waiver; when that person presents (System-wide) they are given information about
how to enroll. In the actual inpatient units, staff from the System’s eligibility vendor, Chamberlin Edmonds
(CEA), go bed to bed; in the ED, when people are waiting, CEA staff go from person to person, screening them
and talking to them. Ms. Greene stated that she has been told by vendors that most people in the ED are not in
any shape to engage deeply, so often it cycles back around. Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that this ties
back to the idea of putting people in the ambulatory units or clinics, where there might be a better opportunity
for enrollment if the patient is coming in for something routine and is better able to focus.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that the Finance Committee has been typically receiving reports on enrollment
and the financial aspects related to the Waiver; he asked whether the Quality and Patient Safety Committee is
having the similar in-depth conversations about the care issues and regarding the whole implementation of the
medical home. Director Michael stated that one of the key issues that has been discussed at the last couple of
Quality and Patient Safety Committee meetings is the fact that ultimately, the System is going to have
potentially 115,000 new patients to provide high-quality care to; it is one thing to have the patients enrolled
and start the billing, but there is also going to be the expectation that those patients will get the care they need.
Going forward, a lot of attention will need to be paid to this subject. Board Chairman Carvalho noted that,
approximately two years ago, there was a program that the State started, under which a large number of people
were enrolled by default at the System; the System basically lost these patients, because the patient experience
was not ideal so people migrated out. Ms. Greene stated that the administration has been engaged in a lot of
discussions with Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief of Clinical Integration, and Cathi Braswell, Interim Chief
Operating Officer of Outpatient Services, and other leaders at ACHN; a lot of progress has been made in
thinking through and figuring out a coordinated care management strategy.
Board Chairman Carvalho indicated that there has been a subject that has been brought up in the past that has
been earmarked for future discussion; however, he would like to identify when that future date of discussion
might be. In connection with the State’s planning for the ACA, one of the things that they are starting to
wonder about more deeply is how realistic is the assumption that was made that the pool of people who are
eligible for the marketplace (health insurance exchange), the non-Medicaid population - how realistic is it to
assume that simply because they are eligible, they will start enrolling? Especially at the lower income levels,
involving people who previously may have been eligible for Medicaid and who may be familiar with the
Medicaid experience (which is, if an eligible person does not enroll but is hospitalized, the person would be
retroactively enrolled and would walk out without any co-pays or bill) - the ACA experience will be very
different from that. Under the ACA experience, a person has to enroll up-front, there is no retroactive
eligibility, the person is going get a tax credit that is going to subsidize some of the costs but not all, the person
is going to have co-pays and potentially some premium exposure. The question dovetails with what this
Board and Committee has discussed in previous conversations, regarding how to deal with the population that
is eligible but does not enroll in CountyCare, when those people come to the System for service. It was
previously determined that this subject would be reviewed in the future; he asked if a date can be set for when
the administration will present to the Board or Finance Committee what or how they think that situation should
be handled. He added that, although the subject is similar to that which was previously discussed involving
CountyCare, the difference is that the issue will not go away when CountyCare is replaced with the ACA – it
will be the same issue all over again.
Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive Officer, clarified that this would be a discussion of the policy issue. Board
Chairman Carvalho responded that this should be a discussion of what the policy should be. There are two sets
of policies one could potentially have - one would relate to the provision of services to persons in a nonemergency situation, and the other would relate to any tweaking to the CareLink Policy. He recalled that
several months ago, a representative from PricewaterhouseCoopers pointed out to the Board that if and when
the System chooses to try to collect co-pays, it is unrealistic to live with the County Ordinance that requires a
surcharge on people who pay with credit or debit card; that person suggested that the System ought to be going
to the County Board to ask for a waiver of that. If that is the case, perhaps that is something that should be
discussed and determined soon. Chairman O’Donnell recommended that this policy review and discussion
take place with the full Board, rather than with the Finance Committeei.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project / CountyCare (continued)
To distinguish between initial application and membership, Mr. Oder inquired whether there is some kind of a
percentage factor that might be applied to indicate how many actual members the System will end up with. Dr.
Raju responded that the issue is that there will be some lag time between the submission of applications by the
System and the processing and approval of the applications by the State; it is hoped that the cycle time of the
State will improve. The aim is to enroll 115,000 people by the end of the Waiver period – it is hoped that the
State will cooperate to get the applications done in a timely fashion. Dr. Raju indicated that the question is will the applicants all be members by the end of the Waiver period?
Marisa Kollias, Director of Media and Public Relations, and Fred Lebed, President and Chief Executive
Officer of The Prairie Group, provided an overview of media and outreach activities relating to CountyCare
(included in Attachment #4).
Aaron Galeener, Director of Budget, provided an overview of the financial information presented regarding
CountyCare activities (included in Attachment #4). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman O’Donnell noted that it looks like the System will have to ramp up really quickly in the coming
months; she inquired whether it is believed that those revenue targets will be met. Mr. Galeener responded that
the administration is expecting that the overall revenue goal will be met. He added that what is more difficult
to evaluate at this point due to the DHS eligibility processing time, is exactly when the timing of those
payments will occur. As alluded to earlier, the State is going to be increasing staffing for this purpose, and it is
expected that the rate of their processing will increase dramatically over the next few months, which should
help.

Members of the Board of Directors of the Cook County Health and. Hospitals System:

AFSCME Council 31, SEIU Local 73, and SEIU Doctor?s Council are eager to help the Ceck County Health and Hospitals
System enroll uninsured and underinsured patients into CountyCare. We urge the County Health system to help us help
you, by training Clerk Vs, and other titles, potentially including PCAs, CNAs, Health Advocates and Medical Assistants, as
Application Assistors.

Currently County contractors have trained significant numbers of Federally Qualified. Health Center employees as
application assistors. it is about time to train employees as application assistors too.

it is essential for Cook County Health and Hospitals System to en roll as many clients-as possible to its own patient
centered medical homes and ambulatory clinics. While application assistors are located at Stroger Hospital, Fantus,
Cer?mak, Provident and Oak Forest, they are not located at primary care clinics, in the emergency rooms or in hospital
wards.

if CCH HS employees were cross-trained as assistors, they would be able to enroll everyone who enters a facility
in CoUntyCare. Members of Cook County health system unions are also able to staff health and enrollment fairs with
health providers and trained assistors to enroll those potential patients that have not yet visited 

A strong multi?faceted outreach plan-is important because the next five months are. critical to the survival of the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System; If new patients enroll, and receive care from Cook County providers and establish
an initial relationship with that provider here, they are morelikely to choose Cook County Health and Hospitals System
as their medical home next year, and in subsequent years. But if the number of individuals enrolled into CountyCare at
sites falls short, Cook County Health and H05pitals System could face a large'f-ina and declining patient

population in 2014.

Though there are challenges, there are also enormous opportunities presented by the Affordable Care Act. Let?s seize-
this moment to work together for the sake of those who rely upon the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:

 

 
 

Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board of Directors entered into a 519.423.678.76, ?ve year, system-wide
management services contract with Sodexo in July 2011. The contract covers many aspects of operations,
including the purchase of food, management of retail ad patient food service operations, management of
environmental services and the purchase of supplies and the management of patient transportation services and the I
Morgue. Contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions. including staf?ng levels, patient census
information, cleanable square footage and revenue projections from retail food sales.

 
 
     
 
 
      
 
   
 

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:

Since the commencement of the contract, the has undergone operational changes and had re?ned its

expectations. At this point, the contract requires revision to conform the parties' current expectations and to adjust 

pricing to permit a mutually successful arrangement. Changes include adjustments to the patient day rates, i

clari?cation of capital improvements, staf?ng commitments and provisions for temporary staf?ng when these are not

achieved, and increased funding for costs relating to catering, resident meals. meals for observation patients and
pediatric inpatient related food services. It is anticipated that these changes will facilitate a good faith effort to

. achieve improvements that will be key to enhancing the patient experience. Future amendments will likely be

necessary to re?ect additional service charges and to facilitate revenue opportunities that could permit contract cost

reductions.

 
      
    
    
 
      
  

TERMS OF REQUEST:
This is a request to amend and increase the contract number H11-72-054 in the amount not to exceed -

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended March 31, 2013. This discussion focuses
on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month.
It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the 1115
Waiver. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary
medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health
Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In October,
2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook County,
allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible for
Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An 1115 Waiver allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
5
Page 47 of 105

 eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the four months with overall
revenue of $222,884 and overall expenses was $315,219.
Net Patient revenue for the four months was $126,339.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $1,579. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
General
As compared to November 30, 2012, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
March-2013 reduced by 23 to 99 days. Additionally, there was a 4 day decrease in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts fell by $1.159M (0.4%) as compared to the November-2012
balance. As compared to the previous month, this figure increased by $8.998M (3.2%)
and has declined in eleven (11) out of the last fourteen (14) months. The overall decline
6
Page 48 of 105

 in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the collection
process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement
for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claimby-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of March-2013 increased by
$0.233M (2.6%), as compared the November 30, 2012 balance and decreased by
$1.985M (18.0%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual cash
collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a permember-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of March-2013 increased by $10.640M (6.8%) as
compared to the November 30, 2012 balance. This figure also grew by $6.527M (4.1%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The increase in this number indicates less accounts had the collection process completed
than in the previous month and that fewer accounts are being removed from active
accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made
through a per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $1.859M (10.7%) by the end of
March-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2012.
7
Page 49 of 105

 This balance, as of the end of this month, was $1.265M (7.1%) larger than the previous
month’s balance. This indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed”
status, as compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of March-2013 fell by $11.799M
(8.5%) over the balance as of November 30, 2012. This figure is $2.471M (2.0%) greater
than last month’s figure.
The growth in this figure indicates that fewer Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Depreciation - $11.317M
8
Page 50 of 105

 Utilities - $2.197M
Insurance - $3.957M.

Nonoperating Revenue was $94.966M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $24.189M and property tax in the amount of $26.933M. Sales tax
revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying sales
transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax
represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the
state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the
receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 02/20/13 - 03/13/13 .
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing payments
include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental workers
hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget is spread over 12 months, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received. Meaningful Use includes
both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

Notes:
- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.

Additional Financial Reporting
 The System Board has requested that the financial reporting be

expanded
d d to provide
id comparisons
i
to budget
b d so the
h B
Boardd iis able
bl
to monitor the System performance against the planned
p
performance.
 The traditional financial reporting with the County government
has involved reporting actual collections and expenditures
against
i t appropriations.
i ti
There
Th has
h nott been
b
an emphasis
h i on a
balance sheet and a profit and loss statement.
 The System
y
has developed
p a monthly
y financial reporting
p
g
package that provides monthly financial statements and a
number of other items such as statistics, top ten DRG’s,
accounts receivable performance,
performance payer mix,
mix and a narrative.

 Additional Financial Reporting
 The System staff has made several improvements in the

financial
fi
i l reporting
i suchh as a salary
l
andd wage accruall eachh
month to try to match the use of labor to the time frame where it
was consumed.
 Since the finance department is limited to the information
available from the County information system it will be difficult
t improve
to
i
the
th accruals
l for
f expenditure
dit
information.

ti
 The finance staff will begin to reconcile cash collections to
revenue on a regular
g
basis to improve
p
the accuracy
y of financial
reporting for the System Board.

 Additional Financial Reporting
 Each month the finance staff will provide an additional

schedule
h d l that
h compares the
h original
i i l budget
b d to the
h performance
f
of the System.
 The Budget for salaries and wages will be spread to the months
on the number of days in the period. The bulk of the non labor
expenditures will follow the same pattern.
 The revenue budget will be spread either on the number of
payment weeks, the days in the period, or the estimated number
pp
of member months approved.

 Additional Financial Reporting
 The new schedule that will be developed will compare the

bbudget

d the
h S
System actuall performance
f
at a S
System llevel.

 There will need to be notes attached to this schedule that will
explain some of the more significant variances for actual
revenue and actual expenditures from budget.
 In addition to the explanations of variances plans will be
provided that will describe actions to correct reported problems.
