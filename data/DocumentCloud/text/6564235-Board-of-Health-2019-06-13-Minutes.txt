6. Policy and Legislation Mr. Kendrick reported 16 municipalities in Summit County have passed
Tobacco 21 which is halfof the 32 municipalities passed in the State of Ohio. Tobacco 21 is paused
temporarily in Summit County due to the State of Ohio including it in their budget bill. It’s passed
out of the House and is now in the Senate. The enforcement piece didn’t make it; but the senate
bill includes changing the age and includes the paraphernalia and vaping devices and languages
to supportfuture and present vaping products. Taxation will be added to the vaping products and
create a licensure for vapor retailers. SBIS4I has been introduced that would raise the national
age for tobacco and vaping to 21. Dr. DePompei asked if there is no enforcement at the state level,
can municipalities create their own rather than coming to SCPH? Mr. Kendrick advisedyes.
