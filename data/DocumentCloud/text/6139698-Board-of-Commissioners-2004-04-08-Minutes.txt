JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 8, 2004

WHEREAS, Illinois has the ninth largest prison system in the United States; and
WHEREAS, there are currently almost 44,000 individuals incarcerated by the Illinois Department of

and
WHEREAS, there are now more than 11,000 persons incarcerated in the Cook County Department of
Corrections; and
WHEREAS, the majority of individuals currently incarcerated have committed non-violent offenses; and
WHEREAS, the majority of these individuals upon release return to communities within Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, there are currently 425,000 formerly incarcerated individuals in Illinois with the majority
residing in communities within Cook County; and

WHEREAS, access to livable wage employment has proven to be a key factor in reducing the recommission of crime and the rate of recidivism; and

higher than the general population in large part due to the social stigma of being an ex-offender, unfair
employment discrimination, and the lack of access to legal employment opportunities, education and
vocational training within sectors of government and private industry due to current policies; and

opportunity for qualified individuals seeking employment.

1172

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 8, 2004

County to be issued a Certificate of Completion they must have successfully completed a Board approved
employment readiness training program, a twelve (12) month County Internship Program, and be in
receipt of documentation to that effect which is to be submitted as the primary evidence of their
employment readiness to the Review Panel for consideration of Certificate of Completion issuance. Other

education, vocational training, employment and/or volunteer experience. Participants with State issued
Certificates of Good Conduct, Certificates of Relief from Disabilities or State professional/occupational
licenses shall be afforded favorable consideration when applying for participation in the Project as well as
for employment.
Section 5-2

Ex-Offender Employment Readiness Program

As the first phase for an individual to become eligible for a Cook County issued Certificate of
Completion, s/he would need to complete a job readiness program specifically designed for former
offenders and designated by the Cook County Board of Commissioners as a qualifying training program.
Such a training program shall provide intake and screening services to identify needs of each participant
and develop a specific employability training plan. All training plans shall include core modules to
address, in a holistic approach, the special needs of former offenders seeking employment within the
County and/or with designated County contractors. The modules shall include information/education,
skill building and behavioral modification techniques in the areas of cognitive restructuring, resume
preparation, interviewing, alcohol and substance abuse prevention, anger management and conflict
resolution, and relationships in the work place.
The designated Community Based Organization providing training shall also have referral agreements in
place with educational institutions and social service agencies for participants to access supportive
services for assistance with food, clothing, housing, substance abuse counseling, GED classes, vocational
training, and family reunification services. The work readiness program shall also include an aftercare
component which will serve as an on-going support system for candidates who have successfully
completed the core training modules.
Eligibility criteria for admission to the former offender work-readiness training program shall be
established by the community based organizations that are operating such programs with the specific
inclusion of the following: Participants must be screened for motivation to participate in the program,
history of drug and alcohol use/abuse, mental health history, type of offense committed, criminal record,
current immediate support needs (housing, food, clothing, temporary emergency financial assistance,
etc.), employment history, educational background, and willingness to change their thinking and
behavior.
Section-5-3

County Internship Program

Upon successful completion of the Employment Readiness Training program, participants shall become
eligible for a twelve (12) month Internship Program. The Internship Program will have the goal of one
hundred (100) entry level positions in Cook County government that are identified as vacant in each fiscal
year budget. Participants will be paid the salary consistent with the grade level budgeted for each vacant
position as well as all county health benefits.
Participants will not be considered for positions where there is a direct relationship between the previous
criminal offense and the specific job sought, or if the employment of the participant would involve an
unreasonable risk to property or to safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public.

1173

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 8, 2004
Upon successful completion of the designated internship, participants may then petition the Review Panel
for the issuance of a Certificate of Completion. Once issued, participants may then apply for an
appropriate full time position that is available with the County and/or participating private sector
employers.

ARTICLE VI. IMPACT OF COUNTY ISSUED CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION
Section 6-1
This Section shall not affect the right of a person to collaterally attack his conviction or to
rely on it in bar of subsequent proceedings for the same offense.

(a) A Certificate of Completion does not, however, in any way prevent any judicial
proceeding, administrative, licensing, or other body, board, or authority from relying
upon the conviction specified in the Certificate of Completion as the basis for the
exercise of its discretionary power to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue or refuse to
renew any license, permit, or other authority or privilege.
(b) A Certificate of Completion shall not limit or prevent the introduction of evidence of
a prior conviction for purposes of impeachment of a witness in a judicial or other
proceeding where otherwise authorized by the applicable rules of evidence.
(c) A Certificate of Completion may not in any way prevent any judicial proceeding,
administrative, licensing, or other body, board, or authority from considering the
conviction specified in the certificate.
(d) A Certificate of Completion shall not limit or prevent the introduction of evidence of
a prior conviction for purposes of impeachment of a witness in a judicial or other
proceeding where otherwise authorized by the applicable rules of evidence.
(e) A Certificate of Completion is not to be deemed to be a pardon. Nothing contained in
this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or limit or affect the manner of applying for
pardons to the Governor, and no certificate issued under this Ordinance shall be
deemed or construed to be a Pardon.
Section 6-2

Grievance Process

It is not the intention of this Ordinance or the actions of the Review Panel or the Board of Cook County

Commissioners to replace or substitute any employee grievance process that currently exists in County
government. This Ordinance does not preclude a participant from exercising any due process rights that
may be available to them.
(a) If a participant is subject to an adverse action by their employer/supervisor and a
grievance procedure exists to address the employee's issue, the participant must
exhaust the process for redress.
(b) This ordinance does not create a separate or alternative grievance process for
participants to seek redress from an adverse action taken against them.

1174

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 8, 2004
ARTICLE VII. REVOCATION OF CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION
Section 7.1

Commissioners shall be by majority vote of the members.

who shall be accorded an
opportunity to contest the grounds of revocation prior to a decision to revoke the
Certificate of Completion.
(b) Any such person possessing a Certificate of Completion shall upon receipt of the
determination of revocation, surrender the certificate to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners or its designee.
(c) A person who knowingly uses or attempts to use a revoked Certificate of Completion
in order to obtain or to exercise any right or privilege that they would not be entitled
to obtain or to exercise without a valid Certificate of Completion is guilty of a Class
A misdemeanor.
(d) If the program participant is involuntarily terminated from their employment with
Cook County for cause, the Certificate of Completion will automatically be revoked.

ARTICLE VIII. FORMS AND FILING
Section 8-1

(a) All applications, certificates, and orders of revocation necessary for the purposes of
this Ordinance shall be upon forms prescribed under an agreement among the Review
Panel, the Clerk of the Circuit Court and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
or their designees. The forms relating to Certificates of Completion shall be
