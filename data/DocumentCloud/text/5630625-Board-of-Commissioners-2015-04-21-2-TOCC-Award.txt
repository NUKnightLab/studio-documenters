capacity from which funds may be allocated to the TOCC Contracts at the discretion of the Contracting
Officer. The total aggregate amount of the nineteen (19) contacts and the reserve capacity fund is not-toexceed $117,000,000, all of which may be allocated for Contract amendments, task orders, and task order
modifications as may be appropriate for TOCC Program expenditures without any further Board action.
The Capital Construction Department will provide quarterly updates to the Board regarding the status and
performance of the TOCC Program.
Each TOCC Contract, and each Task Order issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to CHA’s compliance
requirements, including each Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE and Section 3
requirements.

CORPORATE GOAL: Ensure the Chicago Housing Authority’s portfolio is safe, decent and
sustainable.
FUNDING: General Fund
GENERAL BACKGROUND /EXPLANATION
The TOCC Program is modeled on the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”) contracts
provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Section 16.504. This type of contract allows for an
indefinite quantity of services to be supplied as needed over a fixed period of time. General Contractors,
initially chosen by the Chicago Housing Authority through a Request for Proposal, are issued task order
contracts, and pursuant thereto are awarded task orders through competitive bidding amongst themselves
as projects occur.
Since 2007, the Capital Construction Department (“CCD”) has successfully utilized IDIQ programs for
projects valued up to $3,000,000, and task order contracts throughout the Rehabilitation, Scattered Sites
and Capital Maintenance programs. TOCC Task Orders also allow CCD to react more efficiently to
maintenance and repair needs in the developments for projects valued up to $3,000,000. The ability to
work with an established group of general contractors significantly reduces the time needed to move from
project design to construction, while still retaining the cost control advantages of competitive bidding.
The TOCC method offers the CHA the opportunity to maintain qualified firms under contract that will
have the opportunity to competitively bid on work as it becomes available by Request for Services
(“RFS”) Task Orders. Each General Contractor (GC) within the respective group will respond to a RFS
by a sealed Lump Sum Base Bid. The award will be made to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder.

2

 TOCC is a method that gives the CHA the ability to successfully meet its goals by providing:
 An ability to respond more quickly to smaller scale construction projects than is available using
the Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal solicitation formats.
 The flexibility of having firms under contract who can build a history of experience with our
construction projects.
 An opportunity for smaller and Section 3 firms to work with the Chicago Housing Authority, and
grow through that experience.

The CHA will assign General Contractors to one or more of the following groups based on their
proposal selection and requisite qualifications. The CHA will offer task order bidding
opportunities to each group in a manner to provide fair opportunities for GCs to bid on construction
projects. There is no limitation to the number of groups to which a vendor may be assigned, subject
to the GCs ability to secure bonding within the task order value the group represents.
Group A: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and
secure bonding for projects valued from $100,000.00 to $500,000.00; and
Group B: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and
secure bonding for projects valued over $500,000.00 to $1,500,000.00;
Group C: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and
secure bonding for projects valued over $1,500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00.
