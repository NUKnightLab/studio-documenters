HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL
ADDRESS: 11760 Kenmoor
NAME: Barbara J. Davis
Demolition Ordered: March 27, 2017

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on November 4, 2019, revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The
owner has paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the 1?t deferral request for
this property.

Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date of the City Council
decision.
2. BSEED will schedule a Progress Inspection within mtg-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation

permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspection reports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every forty-five (45) calendar
M, for the duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

0 Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
I Certi?cate of Compliance, required for a_ll rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).
5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.
6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.

At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions
of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without
further notice. In addition, pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code we will issue a Blight Violation Notice.

Any request exceeding three (3) deferrals must be made by petition to City Council through the of?ce of the City Clerk.

RE: CIOGS ORDINANCE PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS

I would like to propose the following changes to the Community Input Over Government
Surveillance (CIOGS) Ordinance:

1. The inclusion of a legal de?nition for the term surveillance that identi?es its tracking and
identi?cation components.

2. Language stating that surveillance technology (equipment, software and hardware) must
qualify as such by the legal de?nition of surveillance and strictly pertain to technology
used for surveillance activity.

3. Removal of all clauses which mandate the disclosure of the number of days and times
surveillance technology is used by the department or acquired by other entities and/or
jurisdictions.

4. Removal of the provision requiring the submission of a written report within 45 days of
the initiation of the exigent circumstances.

5. Removal of the deployment speci?cation which requires that departments disclose the
factors that determine surveillance technology placement strategies.

6. Removal of the provision mandating the City Council to conduct a public hearing for
each surveillance technology procured by a City department.

7. All clauses requiring that the police department provide a copy of the non-disclosure
agreement should be amended to protect circumstances where the providing of such will
compromise con?dentiality.

8. Replacement of the phrase ?whichever is sooner? with ?whichever is greater? where it
pertains to the use of approved surveillance technology in exigent circumstances.

9. All provisions directing City departments to produce con?dential writings in the event of
non?disclosure agreements should be removed. As privileged and con?dential
submissions are exclusive to the Law department, the Surveillance Technology
Speci?cation Reports may not be precluded from the public domain.

10. Sec. 17?5-454 line 6 should read as:

?Included in the annual report required under Section 7-806 of the Charter, Duties of the
Chief of Police, the Police Department must include an Annual Surveillance Technology
Procurement Report as part ofthe annual report of operations.?

Please do not hesitate to contact my of?ce if you have any questions, at 313-224-1198
