Written Testimony from Martese Chism
National Nurses Organizing Committee

Good morning Chairman, Directors. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is Martese
Chism. I have been a registered nurses Cook County Hospital for 27 years. I have worked as a Med/Surg
nurse, a charge nurse, a dialysis nurse, and now finally I am a Case Manager. I am also the chief union
steward and I serve on the NNOC Board of Directors.

You would think that case management would be like heaven after so many years of direct patient care.
No more lifting, less exposure to infectious diseases, fewer weekends. But actually, this last year case
management has been the worst place to work.

Why? First We have two administrators with zero case manager experience and who does not have
the basic competency to do our work. They do not serve as resources to staff, because they do not have
the skills. Instead - they spend their time analyzing productivity numbers and denying requests for
overtime when our assignments reach 30 to 50 patients.

Our inpatient case management workloads are completely unreasonable. We have done a survey of
Chicago area tertiary hospital case managers. Expecting a case manager in this setting to complete 25
MCGs per day is unattainable. Not to mention that we don?t have 8 hours to do it. We spend more than
four hours a day in meetings and rounding with physicians. We don?t object to that - but we cannot
meet a heavy caseload when we have limited time to do MCGs.

We have been talking with our Executive about this for months. We met with Doug Elwell in November
2018 and he made a number of written commitments to us to address our concerns - and none of those
commitments have been followed through. We have met with the President's Office, and with senior
administration. Nothing has changed. Everyday we come to work in a fearful hostile working
environment. We are the inpatient case managers who brought in the 2018 revenue to make the Cook
County Health and Hospital system self? sufficient.

I am here today to demand that you all take action today to address these issues. We are requesting a
meeting with the Board to hear our concerns.

BOYCOTT THE MARRIOTT

 

MEDICAL DISTRICT HOTEI

Housekeeping and food beverage workers voted overwhelmingly to join
UNITE HERE Local 1 in May 2018 and the hotel has since refused to
negotiate a fair contract. 

On November 28, 2018, workers went on strike for one day to protest the
Marriott Medical District?s refusal to bargain. Employees are overworked,
underpaid, and have earned the right to negotiate a fair contract.

claims for anomalies. The result of this activity is apparent in the metrics above.
*2 The Overpayments Identified column indicates the total amount paid to the provider for the identified inaccurate codes. These amounts
may be offset if a provider elects to bill a corrected claim.
Example: The highest level clinic visit is billed to the health plan, reimbursement is $48, the medical record is reviewed and the
documentation validates a lower level. The “Overpayment Identified” is $48, however the provider may rebill a lower level and
expect corresponding reimbursement of $28.35. This category does not account for the net recovery of $19.65.

Re: Analytic Solutions Network, LLC Data Services Agreement

Cook County Health hereby advises the CCH Board of its intent to enter into a data services
agreement with Analytic Solutions Network, LLC for trauma data sharing in support of our prior
hospital participation agreement with the American College of Surgeons. This contract with ASN is
necessary in order for the John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County to obtain certi?cation as a veri?ed
Level 1 Trauma Center. Although this is a zero dollar contract for CCH, we are bringing this contract to
your attention due to requirement of a mutual indemni?cation clause that would make each party
responsible for the impact of its own privacy and intellectual property violations

REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Employee Recognition

Alice Cameron, Esther Joo, Freddie Shufford, Jacqueline Boone and Mildred Williamson Congratulations to the Ruth
M. Rothstein CORE Center team who received an award from the AIDS Foundation of Chicago at their annual meeting
for 20 years of partnership and setting the pace to advance health equity and justice in Illinois. The CORE Center was
established as a partnership between Cook County Health and Rush University Medical Center two decades ago. Since it
opened its doors in 1998, the CORE Center has remained one of the largest providers of care in the US.

Congratulations to this year?s Doctor of the Year, Dr. Irene Aluen Metzner. Dr. Aluen Metzner is a member of Cook-
County Health?s divisions of general internal medicine and postgraduate medicine in the department of medicine. In
addition to being a remarkable clinician, has been a tireless advocate for our patients and residents throughout her 14
years here. She has been involved with quality improvement efforts and has always demonstrated excellence in teaching

and patient care.

Dr. Aluen Metzner works at Logan Square and is also the director of our primary care residency program, overseeing the
work and curriculum of 12 residents. She is a member of various task groups, even those outside the scope of her
practice, to ensure Cook County Health patients are receiving the highest level of care throUghout-the organization. Dr.
Aluen Metzner has also worked to improve the lives of her colleagues. She spearheaded the physician wellness
committee and co-leads the Schwartz Rounds, which provides staff with an opportunity to focus on the human

dimension of medicine.

Even with everything she has accomplished as a physician, she would say her proudest accomplishment is being
a mother to her 12-year-old daughter, Christie, who she admires more than anyone else.

Legislative Update

State

Federal

More than 6,600 bills and resolutions have'been filed in the House and Senate. The deadline for substantive bills
to move out of committee is March 29.

Governor Pritzker has named RobErt Muriel as the Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance (DOI).
Director Muriel is a civil and commercial lawyer with more than 20 years of experience. He was formerly
President of the Hispanic Lawyers Association of Illinois and has served on the Board of Directors for the AIDS
Legal Council of Chicago and Almost Home Kids. His appointment recruires Senate confirmation.

The Governor unveiled his proposal for a fair tax system. Illinois currently imposes a 4.95% flat income tax rate.

Governor Pritzker?s plan proposes dropping the personal tax rate for the first $10,000 of income for single and
joint filers to 4.75%; income above $10,000 to $100,000 would be taxed at income above $100,000 to
$250,000 would be taxed at 4.95%; income above $250,000 to $500,000 would be taxed at 7.75%; income
above $500,000 to would be taxed at 7.85%; and those earning more than would be taxed at 7.95%.

The legislature is expected to debate this proposal through the remainder of the spring session. The earliest a
graduated income tax could take effect would be in 2021.

Earlier this month, the House and Senate passed H3345, which seeks to increases the age to purchase tobacco,
e-cigarettes, and other nicotine products from 18 to 21 years of age. The House passed the bill by a vote of 82-
31?0 with 5 members not voting, and the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 39-16-1. Representative Camille
Lilly (D-Oak Park) served as the chief sponsor in the House and Senator Julie Morrison (D-Deerfield) served as
the chief sponsor in the Senate. The bill now .heads to-the Governor?s desk. If he signs it, the law would take
effect July 1, 2019. Earlier this year, Tobacco 21 was passed by the Cook County Board of Commissioners

covering unincorporated Cook County.

Congress emerged from the shut-down crisis in mid-February-and over the past four weeks has begun to take up
its legislative and oversight responsibilities, although with a sense of urgency since everything is starting about
six weeks later than normal. The President?s budget was released on March 11, marking the official beginning of
the budget and appropriations process. The outlook for passing all twelve bills before the end of the fiscal year
September 30, is clouded by the fact that Congress has yet to agree to a deal to lift the statutory discretionary
spending caps, avoid sequestration and proceed with the appropriations process. Additionally, the debt ceiling
expired on March 2, though the US. Department of the Treasury can continue to meet obligations using
?extraordinary measures? until late September or early October 2019. All point to major negotiations in

September.

Budget and Appropriations - The White House submitted the President?s FY 2020 budget request to Congress
on March 11. In addition to proposing sweeping cuts to health programs in the US. Department of Health and

Human Services, it made the following proposals:

Repeal and Replace: The budget calls for Congress to pass legislation similar to the September 2017
Graham?Cassidy bill, which would repeal the ACA Medicaid expansion, make states choose a Medicaid
per capita cap or a Medicaid block grant, and replace the expansion and the ACA subsidies with grants

to states to support state-based coverage programs.

Page 78 of 177

Medicaid DSH cuts: The budget calls for legislation to extend the Medicaid DSH cuts, arguing that
legislation like Graham?Cassidy would provide states with grants to extend coverage to those formerly
covered under the ACA.

Initiative: The budget proposes $120 million for the Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA) to deliver additional care and treatment for people living with HIV through the
Ryan White Program and to expand prevention and treatment through the Health Centers
program. The domestic increases are offset by steep cuts to international spending.
0 $140 million in new funding for CDC to improve diagnosis and testing/connect patients to
treatment, provide to at risk individuals
$70 million in new funding for Ryan White Program
$50 million in funding for the HRSA to expand services in community health center
0 $25 million in new funding for Indian Health Service (U.S. Department of the Interior) for HIV
screening, Hep prevention

While a divided Congress will not advance the President's "repeal and replace? agenda and there is bipartisan
interest in funding public health programs at levels higher than proposed in the budget, the budget is an
important statement of policy objectives and an indication of what the Administration would aim to do if it had
the votes in Congress.

House and Senate committees are currently holding hearings to question Administration of?cials on the details
of their agencies? budget requests and collecting input from constituents and stakeholders. If a deal to lift the
budget caps does not come together soon, the appropriations subcommittees will begin to work with this yea r? 
appropriated amounts as a baseline.

1? Medicaid - The Administration continues to work to bend Medicaid consistent with longstanding conservative
proposals. On March 15, CMS approved Ohio?s request for an 1115 waiver to impose work requirements on
non-elderly adults, the latest in a string of approvals, even while the earlier Arkansas and Kentucky waivers are
being actively litigated. In addition, published reports continue to emerge of CMS working quietly with
conservative-led states to propose a waiver to convert their Medicaid programs to a block grant or a per capita
capped system. When and if any of those waivers are granted, they will certainly be challenged in court as
exceeding the Administration's waiver authority and running counter to the purposes of the Medicaid program.

On March 15, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment Advisory Committee (MACPAC) released its March 2019 report to
Congress. MACPAC recommends easing the scheduled statutory cuts to Medicaid DSH by (1) phasing in the cuts
over a longer period of time, (2) applying the cuts to states with unspent DSH allotments first and (3) reforming
the DSH allocation methodology to gradually align DSH allocations to reflect the non-elderly low income
population in a state. Congress is under no obligation to accept MACPAC recommendations, but they are
generally influential. Current conversations on the Hill suggest that a DSH cut delay could move in the late
summer or early fall as part of a larger health extenders package, perhaps in conjunction with other health
related legislation, like a bill to address prescription drug costs.

0 Gun Control On February 27 the House passed HR. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which would set
up new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties. It would prohibit a
transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession
of the firearm to conduct a background check. Senate leadership will not take up the bill.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for at both the State and Federal level.

Multi-Specialty Practice Groups
On the rise nationally-why?
1. Better communication among your physicians. Seeing aligned doctors promotes collaboration and ensures more
efficient care. Medical groups utilize a common EHRs that facilitate sharing of information. Improved communication helps
improve outcomes.
2. Access to new treatments and technology. Not only will do MSPGs provide access to additional physicians and
experts, but increased access to new treatments and technologies as well. Integrated medical groups combine the assets of a
particular health care organization.

3. Coordinated care. Integrated medical groups employ physicians who practice in hospital and ambulatory settings,
mitigating potential disruption in care when being admitted or discharged. Working as a team improves efficiency and
quality.
4. Higher standards of quality monitoring. Integrated medical groups have more resources to devote to monitoring
and improving the care provided.

5. Additional clinical resources. As part of a broader health system, physicians in an integrated group can draw on a
wider array of clinical services. These may include things like home care, diabetes education, smoking cessation, cardiac
rehabilitation, and others. It's no longer just visiting your doctor when you are sick.
