Report from System Chief Medical Officer
Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Medical Officer for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, presented his report
to the Committee. During his presentation, he noted that there are two standards by which everything will
follow. First, there will be a high-quality, patient-centric, fiscally responsible methodology of care. Secondly,
they will engage in a System-wide level of accountability, which is based on clear organizational structure and
metrics-driven objectives.
Chairman Ansell noted that at the February or March meeting, he would like to see a presentation on the plan to
implement the 2010 Quality Plan and Organizational Structure. The Plan and Structure was approved at the

 Reducing Mortality in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock – An Initial Success Story
Submitted by:
John Bailitz, MD
Department of Emergency Medicine
Renaud Guerret, MD
Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care

Date: 12/2009

At Cook County, we are very proud of the outstanding patient care we provide to our patients
with advanced HIV and cancer despite sometimes limited institutional resources. Often times,
these patients present to the Emergency Department with life threatening infections as an
unavoidable consequence of their underlying disease. In 2008, leadership from the Department
of Emergency Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care, Infectious Disease, and Quality
Improvement formed a Sepsis working group in an effort to continue to improve patient care for
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
Together we created an institution specific severe sepsis and septic shock bundle based on
recommendations from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. Next we created novel
educational programs for the staff of the Department of Emergency Medicine as well as
Pulmonary and Critical Care. In the Spring of 2009, all physician staff participated in a severe
sepsis and septic shock simulation lab session in the Department of Emergency Medicine
simulation center. With over 200 nurses in the department of Emergency Medicine, twelve 30
minute case based presentations were provided to with local nursing leadership to educate staff
on different shifts.
In May of 2009, we officially began utilizing our Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock bundle. In an
effort to measure the effectiveness of these efforts, we examined cases from four months preeducational intervention and the initial four months post-educational intervention. This initial
report was reviewed by the Department of Emergency Medicine at the November faculty and
resident meeting and provided to all involved departments.

The early data examining
compliance with 6 hour bundle goals
and effect on mortality and length of
stay are encouraging. Quarterly
updates will continue to be provided
to all departments involved in an
effort to continually work together to
improve care. We are currently
examining compliance with more
recent 6 hour goals, 24 hour goals,

 illness severity scores, source identification and appropriateness of antimicrobial treatment, and
length of stay as a marker of the economic impact of this educational program. The project has
been approved by the IRB. A study description and clinical pathway are attached.
