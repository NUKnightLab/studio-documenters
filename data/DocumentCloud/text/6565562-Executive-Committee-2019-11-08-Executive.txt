Executive Director’s Report
Ms. Grace Gallucci reported on the following:
•

The U.S. House approved $5 million for future Hyperloop planning oversight.

•

NOACA received an INFRA grant in the amount of $9.02 million from the
United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) for the Irishtown Bend
project.

Innovation on September 13, 2019.

•

ODOT is accepting applications for its Ohio Bridge Partnership Program
(OBPP) from September 1 - October 15, 2019; up to $1 million is available
per project for SFY 2022-2023.

Commissioner Lennon stated that the agenda items have been vetted by other
committees. He informed members that a single action would be taken to move all the
items to the September Board agenda if there was no motion to separate and vote on one
or more of them.
SFY 2019 Overall Work Program and Budget Completion Report
NOACA completed 31 projects that include a total of 114 work products and tasks.
Commissioner Lennon asked Ms. Gallucci to provide an example of a product or task.
Ms. Gallucci used the Hyperloop as an example to explain how staff looks at completed

8309c
1-1

 elements of a project at the work product and task levels and measures which projects
have not been completed. She noted that sometimes the output of a task will not be
delivered until the end of the project.
Ms. Gallucci stated that approximately 83% of the budget has been expended and
$606,000 in unspent Consolidated Planning Grant (CPG) funds will be carried forward for
FY 2020 projects and completion of FY 2019-encumbered contracts.
Commissioner Lennon asked if the Irishtown Bend project is included in NOACA’s budget.
Ms. Gallucci said no, but noted that the project is included in NOACA’s advocacy work.
Commissioner Lennon asked if the I-480 bridge would be included in NOACA’s planning
work. Ms. Gallucci said NOACA’s operating budget includes planning projects.
Great Lakes Hyperloop Contract and Budget Amendment
The budget for the Hyperloop needs to be amended from $650,000 to $750,000; the
contract for Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the Great
Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study needs to be amended in the amount of $84,600; and
the contract term needs to be extended to December 31, 2019.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the previous contract amendments for the study and noted that
NOACA received a grant in the amount of $100,000 from the Richard King Mellon
Foundation that will be used for a more detailed analysis of the entire corridor.
Mr. Mike Foley asked if the work done by TEMS will provide a big picture of the routes for
freight and passenger travel. Ms. Gallucci stated that the feasibility study looks primarily
at the Cleveland to Chicago route, marketing analysis and financial analysis. She
discussed potential Hyperloop routes and noted that NOACA will be doing the outreach
piece of the study.
Commissioner Lennon asked how much money NOACA has committed to the feasibility
study. Ms. Gallucci said NOACA has committed $100,000 of its own funds and raised
$650,000 from other sources.
Commissioner Hamercheck thanked NOACA staff for taking the Hyperloop technology
seriously. Ms. Gallucci thanked the Board for supporting her idea.
Commissioner Lennon stated that funding should also come from the private sector.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA has a public-private partnership with HTT, which has
committed $600,000 of the $1.2 million contract. Ms. Gallucci noted that public sector
funds were used to pay for the initial route planning, regulations, safety, and right of way
issues and private sector funds will be used for the operations, maintenance, and building
of the Hyperloop. She stated that NOACA and HTT are working on completing the
financials for the feasibility study which will be presented to Wall Street.
Project Planning Reviews (PPRs) / Intergovernmental Review and Consultation
(IGRC); 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020
The PPRs for the 1st quarter SFY 2020 include the following projects:

8309c
1-2

 o
o

CUY IR 480 06.47/VAR Paint PID 22131 (Bridge painting on IR-480 and SR10 in
Fairview Park and Cleveland)
Laketran bus replacement

No NOACA funds will be used for the above-referenced projects.
Plan and TIP Amendments; 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020
The amendments consist of the above-referenced projects.
SFY 2021-2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA Funding
The SFY 2021-2024 TIP contains road, bridge, public transit and other transportation
projects scheduled for implementation; and includes projects supported by federal funds
through ODOT, transit agencies and NOACA. Approximately 700 projects have been
identified through NOACA’s comprehensive planning process and more than $1 billion is
needed for implementation, which far exceeds the $119 million that is available.
Commissioner Lennon asked if NOACA will receive any funding from the state gas tax.
Ms. Gallucci said no.
Ms. Gallucci stated that any changes made to the project list will be presented to the
Board. She talked about project recommendations; assumptions; recommendations
guided by urbanized area population percentages; projects eligible in both urbanized and
rural areas; and the impact of recommended projects.
Commissioner Hamercheck asked if there is anything NOACA can do to get more money
for this region.
Ms. Gallucci stated that 90% of the federal funds go to ODOT, so the objective should be
to go after those funds. She said the new administration has given her hope things will be
looked at through a different lens. Ms. Gallucci talked about MPOs and other local
government agencies not getting their fair share of gas tax funding. She stated that MPOs
need to be more aggressive at pursuing additional funding and there needs to be more
support by the legislative delegation.
Commissioner Lennon asked if Geauga County is being held back because it does not
have a big urbanized area. Ms. Gallucci stated that Geauga County would receive more
money if its urbanized area grew, but would receive less money for the rural population.
Commissioner Lennon asked how much is Geauga County paying in federal gas tax.
Ms. Gallucci said $16 million. Commissioner Lennon asked if Geauga County could
expect to receive $1.6 million a year. Ms. Gallucci said Geauga County could expect to
receive $1.6 million every 4 years.
Ms. Gallucci talked about the benefits of using vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for the gas
tax formula.
Commissioner Hamercheck asked what the Committee can do to help NOACA get more
funding for the region. Ms. Gallucci stated that staff needs to provide Board members with
specific information on actions so they can work with their local, state, and federal
delegations to keep pressing the point that the region needs more money and everyone
needs to be on the same page. She stated that since ODOT has a huge pot of safety

8309c
1-3

 money, NOACA created a Safety and Operations unit that focuses on planning of safety
projects and could help communities get money for their safety plans.
Mr. Foley commented on the importance of understanding state and federal opportunities.
Commissioner Lundy commented on getting more money for the region and using a new
gas tax formula.
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) Program Recommendations
NOACA received 10 CMAQ applications requesting more than $31.4 million categorized
as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Transit vehicle replacements - $20.4 million
Bicycle facilities - $4.3 million
Alternative vehicles charging stations - $3.0 million
Transit enhancements - $1.6 million
Intersection improvements - $1.4 million
Traffic signal improvements - $0.7 million

Seven projects are being recommended for funding, while three projects are not because
they did not meet the criteria and/or score well.
Commissioner Lundy asked if staff met with the sponsors who will not receive funding to
explain why their projects did not score well. Ms. Gallucci said yes.
Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update
NOACA has been requested to focus on the following regional studies for the SFY 2020
TLCI round:
•
•
•

Downtown Cleveland Transportation Connectivity Study
Regional Metroparks Trails/Transportation Connections Study
Regional Lakefront Transportation Connections Study

NOACA staff is proposing to accept only TLCI implementation applications this round.
Mr. Foley said the three plans referenced above make a lot of sense, especially the
Lakefront Transportation Connections Study because it can attract others outside of this
region.
Commissioner Lundy talked about how the Regional Transit Connectivity Study is very
important to Lorain County. He said there needs to be a more regional approach to
transportation.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that staff will have a kickoff meeting with the consultant next week
to discuss the Regional Transit Study.
A motion was made by Mr. Foley to place the above-referenced items on the September
Board agenda. The motion was seconded by Commissioner Lundy. The motion passed
by voice vote.

 PRESENTATION / DISCUSSION ITEMS
No items were presented at this meeting.
Old Business
No old business was discussed at this meeting.
New Business
Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (OTIC) Membership
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Governance Committee recommended that OTIC become an
ex-officio member of the NOACA Board. She talked about the advantages of having OTIC
on the Board.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy to recommend that OTIC be made an exofficio member of the NOACA Board. The motion was seconded by Commissioner
Hamercheck. The motion passed by voice vote.
The Executive Committee talked about how important NOACA is to the region.
NOACA Board Membership
Ms. Gallucci stated that the Governance Committee discussed the 2020 Census and the
NOACA Board membership amendment that was sent out to the five counties for
ratification a couple of years ago, but was not approved. She said the Governance
Committee came up with a semi-new approach with some actions to place before the
Board.
Ms. Stacy Bauer stated that the Governance Committee recommended the following:
1. Add two seats to the Board
2. Issue representation by population with automatic adjustments based on the
census
3. Provide a minimum of three seats per the Code of Regulation
Ms. Bauer stated that the three above-referenced items would not go into effect until after
the next census.
A motion was made by Mr. Foley to place the above-referenced recommendations on the
September Board agenda. The motion was seconded by Commissioner Lundy.
Commissioner Lennon stated that there should be a review of the three recommendations
before the Committee votes on them. He expressed some concern that counties may lose
the ability to veto the ratification process. Ms. Bauer said the ability to veto is not included
in the recommendations.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the recommendations center around the census, so Cleveland
may or may not get two more seats. She said the census would be used to appropriately
designate Board seats.
Commissioner Lennon asked if the recommendations would take place after the census.
Ms. Gallucci said yes.

8309c
1-5

 Commissioner Lennon asked if the recommendations have anything to do with the bylaws.
Ms. Bauer said changes would be made to Article IV, not to the ratification process.
Ms. Gallucci stated that the formula would be added for the census and would include the
following: two additional seats to allow for the appropriation of the population; a minimum
of three seats; and the formula for the allocation.
Commissioner Lundy asked if there is a cap on the number of Board seats. Ms. Bauer
said the seats will increase from 44 to 46. Ms. Gallucci stated that there are two seats
currently missing from the Board because of the population in the region.
The Executive Committee discussed the number of seats Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County have on the NOACA Board.
Commissioner Lennon asked if the change in Board seats would affect the dues.
Ms. Gallucci said no since the dues are based on population.
Ms. Gallucci mentioned that Cuyahoga County has 24 Board seats and 3 of them are
regional.
The Executive Committee voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Adjournment
Commissioner Lennon announced that the next Executive Committee meeting will be held
at the NOACA offices on November 8, 2019 at 11:30 a.m. There being no further
business, the meeting was adjourned at 1:15 p.m.

TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

NOACA 2020 Legislative Agenda

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for
placement on the Board of Directors’ December agenda. Specifically, the item recommends the
2020 NOACA Legislative Agenda for adoption.
The External Affairs Committee supports this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The NOACA Legislative Agenda is comprised of a platform of basic principals and specific
priorities for advocacy efforts in Washington D.C. and Columbus. The 2019 NOACA Legislative
Agenda was approved by the NOACA Board in December 2018. Similarly, the 2020 Legislative
Agenda will be used to inform audiences of the values and priorities of the NOACA region as they
relate to state and federal policy.
The basic principles in the Legislative Agenda do not change much from year to year, as they are
statements that reflect the core policy ideas of the Agency and are representative of fundamental
NOACA values articulated in the NOACA Regional Strategic Plan. Language representing
specific priorities included in the Legislative Agenda are subject to change more often, as the
intent is to identify specific state and federal policies currently under consideration. At this time,
the 2020 Legislative Agenda remains identical to the 2019 one.
However, the Committee may wish to give consideration to articulating additional actions that
address policy concerns highlighted in the current Legislative Agenda. The individual activities
would require significant planning and coordination to achieve, either through legislative or
administrative means. To this end, NOACA will engage the Committee in a discussion regarding
potential advocacy initiatives to augment our 2020 Legislative Agenda. For your reference, a
copy of the 2019 Legislative Agenda is attached.

4-3

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the Legislative Agenda will guide NOACA advocacy efforts during calendar
year 2020.

 ABOUT NOACA
The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) is the federally designated metropolitan
planning organization for Northeast Ohio responsible for transportation and environmental planning. NOACA
prepares the region’s long-range transportation plan and short-range transportation improvement program,
which prioritizes and schedules federally funded transportation projects for the region. NOACA works with the
Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT), project sponsors and other stakeholders to help address
Northeast Ohio’s transportation, air quality, and water quality needs.
Funding for NOACA’s transportation and environmental planning programs are derived from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), ODOT, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) and annual dues paid by local governments throughout the region.

ABOUT OUR AGENDA

DRAFT

2020
FEDERAL & STATE
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA

The Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) Board of Directors and staff are proud to
present the 2019 Federal and State Legislative Agenda.
Transportation infrastructure empowers Ohioans to reach jobs, access healthcare, education, recreational
opportunities and see family and friends. Ideally, each of these destinations should be accessible by multiple
modes. Furthermore, the optimal alignment of infrastructure and economic activity is the foundation of regional
competitiveness. Uncertain funding impacts project delivery, increases congestion, jeopardizes safety, and
reduces economic throughput.
The basis for these requests is NOACA’s Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP), AIM Forward 2040. AIM
Forward 2040 directs investment of all forms of transportation over the next 20 years. With the year 2040 as
the planning horizon, NOACA will invest approximately $15.8 billion in the region’s transportation over the life
of the plan.
The NOACA Vision Statement is a fundamental touchstone that will be applied to regional programs, priorities,
and projects. It is critical that we develop relationships with our delegation and stakeholders. We look forward
to working with you and greatly appreciate your support.

The contents do not necessarily reflect official views or policies of the U.S. Department of Transportation or the Ohio Department of Transportation. This
document does not constitute a standard or regulation.

The Legislative Agenda represents consensus-driven principles that have been approved by
NOACA's 45-member Board of Directors in Northeast Ohio. It is intended to guide policy analysis
and advocacy on infrastructure issues. While NOACA's principles endure, the national
conversation and agenda on transportation infrastructure will change. In this way, NOACA can
assist public officials by advocating emerging issues with a non-partisan view.

 FEDERAL PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Strengthen the MPO’s
local control of core
transportation
programs

This would include the Surface Transportation Program, Congestion
Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Program, and the Transportation
Alternatives Program. Directly allocating funding to MPOs and local
communities would create a more predictable revenue stream for
locally implemented priorities of air quality, improvement in mobility,
and investments in economic growth. Direct allocation would also
facilitate the ability of local communities to precisely define their funding
priorities such as funding for multimodal transportation strategies and
funding for transit.

PRIORITY 2
Promote asset
management as a
funding priority

PRIORITY 3
Incorporate safety,
sustainability,
multimodalism in
planning & funding

NOACA advocates that Congress should both revise the federal
funding formula to create a more equitable distribution of funds to local
communities and strengthen and expand local control to metropolitan
planning organizations by allocating more money directly to
regional/local authorities for core planning programs.

NOACA advocates that Congress should recognize the preservation of
transportation assets as an equal or greater economic priority as
compared to the development of new infrastructure. Regional
authorities similar to NOACA allocate as much as 90 percent of
available funding toward asset preservation. U.S. DOT has already
recognized this priority by mandating asset management programming
at the state level. NOACA advocates that the Congress should create
funding streams for asset management implementation – for transit,
road and bridge – at the regional/local level.

STATE PRIORITIES

PRIORITY 1
Improve the region’s
rate of return from
state allocated funds
to meet
regional asset
management needs

PRIORITY 2
Advocate for the
inclusion of multimodal
transportation within
state programs &
funding

NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly review and amend
the state funding formula such that the NOACA region would receive an
equitable amount of State gas tax dollars as compared to what is
contributed by gas tax payers from the NOACA region.
The NOACA Board advocates a redress of this condition through the
creation of State programs that would allocate more funding to priorities
that are the sole responsibility of MPOs and local communities.
Formation of new programs or supplementing existing programs that
contribute funding to local and regional planning priorities such as asset
management programs would help create a more equitable rate of
return.
NOACA advocates that the Ohio General Assembly provide sufficient
funding for both capital and operating costs to support the development
and preservation of non-automobile transportation, particularly public
transit.
The Ohio Department of Transportation performed a comprehensive
assessment of current needs and long-term demands for transit in the
state. NOACA supports the findings and recommendations of the ODOT
study, which includes funding to bring Ohio’s public transportation
network into a state of good repair; and doubling statewide investment in
public transit, with the State of Ohio investing 10 percent of the
operating and capital costs of the needed service.

NOACA advocates that Congress should include safety, sustainability
and multimodalism as specific priorities within state and local MPO
planning requirements.
A specific focus should be to include public transit and hyperloop
funding programs.

WORKING TO ACHIEVE NOACA'S VISION:
NOACA will STRENGTHEN regional cohesion, PRESERVE existing infrastructure, and
BUILD a sustainable multimodal transportation system to SUPPORT economic
development and ENHANCE quality of life in Northeast Ohio.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

PNC Bank Depository Agreement and Collateralized Line of Credit

ACTION REQUESTED

The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of
Directors’ agenda. Specifically, it would authorize the Executive Director to sign a depository agreement

with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC Bank”) which has committed to provide a revolving line of credit
to NOACA secured by local revenues and other charges for services pending PNC Bank credit approval.
The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of November 8, 2019.

BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board approved the procurement of a revolving line of credit and an associated policy at the March 2019
Board meeting (Resolution 2019-011) following an extended Federal government shutdown (see attached
policy). According to the policy, any collateral must be approved by the Finance and Audit Committee and
the Board of Directors.
Currently, NOACA’s bank accounts are with Citizens Bank, N.A. (“Citizens Bank”) However, Citizens Bank
was unable to offer NOACA a revolving line of credit. Consequently, NOACA issued an RFP for primary
banking services and a revolving line of credit on June 6, 2019. The July 6th deadline was extended to July
31st for those institutions expressing interest. The RFP was advertised on the agency’s website and mailed
to Huntington National Bank, Fifth Third Bank, and PNC Bank.
The only responding bank was PNC Bank, which has provided a term sheet offering a revolving line of credit
for $750,000 secured by local revenues and other charges. PNC Bank is a local institution with an outstanding
CRA rating from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2018. The bank’s senior debt is rated as
follows:

4-7

 PNC Bank is offering an earnings credit of 1.0% to offset the cost of their services and deposit collateral
through the Ohio Pooled Collateral System in accordance with Section 135.182 of the Ohio Revised Code.
The depository agreement is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of changing bank depository accounts would be negligible monthly charges based on an
earnings credit of 1.0% and the current schedule of fees for services. The cost of the revolving line of credit
would be documentation fees of approximately $1,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will transfer its primary bank accounts to PNC Bank contingent upon
credit approval of the revolving line of credit by PNC Bank and determination of acceptable terms in the loan

 DEPOSITORY AGREEMENT
(OHIO PUBLIC FUNDS)

THIS DEPOSITORY AGREEMENT is made by and between PNC BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION, a national banking association under the laws of the United States, located and
doing
business
within
the
State
of
Ohio
(“Bank”)
and
________________________________________, a public body, chartered under the laws of the
State of Ohio (“Depositor”). This Depository Agreement replaces all prior depository agreements
between Bank and Depositor to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions below. The
Bank reserves the right to rescind this Agreement if the Depositor is not a public body, chartered
under the laws of the State of Ohio.
1. Depositor, by proper action of its governing body, hereby designates Bank as a public
depository for Depositor’s active, interim or inactive deposits during the period beginning on
the later of the execution dates on this Depository Agreement and continuing until the
Designation Date, defined below, as such date may be extended by the Depositor. This
Agreement shall continue in effect until all accounts are closed pursuant to the documentation
applicable to the accounts.
2. The Bank will receive funds for deposit from the Depositor and deposit said funds into the
account(s) designated by the Depositor and agreed to by Bank. The Bank will furnish to the
Depositor a monthly statement during any time that the Bank holds any active, interim or
inactive deposits, showing the activity and balance of funds on deposit in any account for which
such a statement is customarily issued.
3. The Bank is required by the laws of the State of Ohio to collateralize the uninsured public
deposits of the Depositor and has elected to do so through the Ohio Pooled Collateral System
(OPCS) as prescribed in section 135.182 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC). The Bank currently
collateralizes the Depositor’s funds at one hundred and five percent. Effective on or about
December 31, 2017, the collateral floor rate will change to one hundred and two percent
(102%). The Bank hereby notifies the Depositor that it will apply for a reduced collateral floor
rate for public deposits under ORC Section 135.182(B)(1)(b) and the Treasurer will thereafter
assign a new collateral floor rate. The Depositor will be notified of any changes to the
collateral rate on its deposits on the OPCS portal. The parties acknowledge and agree that
collateral rates are negotiable, subject to the collateral floor rate established by the Treasurer.
The Bank may choose to exit the OPCS at any time upon notice to the Depositor. In the event
of such notice, the Bank will separately collateralize the deposits in accordance with the ORC.
4. The Bank shall be required to furnish collateral to cover only those deposits that are in excess
of the respective portions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other
corporation hereafter organized by the United States, the State of Ohio, or agency thereof for
the purpose of insuring deposits, as calculated for collateral purposes by the Ohio State
Treasurer.

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Agency Procurement - NOACA Signal Timing & Optimization Program (STOP) FY2020

ACTION REQUESTED

The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of
Directors’ agenda. Specifically, it would award a contract to Albeck Gerken Inc., Transportation Engineers

for NOACA’s Signal Timing & Optimization Program in the not to exceed amount of $439,438.

The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of November 8, 2019.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
Today, there are more than 272,000 traffic signals in the United States. They play an important role in the
transportation network and are a source of significant frustration for the public when not operated efficiently.
As the era of freeway building draws to a close, urban arterials are being called upon to carry more users
than ever before at a time when the users of these facilities are growing more complex (older drivers, more
distractions, larger vehicles, etc.) and the demand for such use continues to outpace transportation supply.
Traffic signal timing efficiency degrades over time as volume patterns and magnitude change, development
occurs, or infrastructure changes. Outdated or poor traffic signal timing accounts for a significant portion of
traffic delay on urban arterials, and traffic signal optimization is one of the most cost effective ways to
reduce emissions, improve mobility, reduce delays and improve corridor safety.
NOACA’s approach to address the issues related to inefficient traffic signal timing was to develop a Signal
Timing Optimization Program (STOP), and in June 2016, the Board of Directors adopted resolution 2016-015,
which approved a consultant firm to develop a pilot STOP project for two corridors.
STOP projects in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 have been successfully implemented. The STOP
for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 proposes to continue retiming regionally-significant corridors to provide
substantial benefits.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) on September 9, 2019 with proposals due on October 8,
2019; six proposals were received. Vendors were scored on three criteria: project approach, experience and
qualifications. After evaluating the proposals, the NOACA review team determined that the firm with the
highest scores was Albeck Gerken, Inc.
As for all of the recommended corridors, staff developed recommendations for project corridors utilizing a
transportation operations and emissions reduction framework and criteria. The criteria, as well as the
potential corridors were presented to the Safety and Operations Council, the Air Quality Subcommittee and
the Transportation Subcommittee for information and input.
4 - 13

 The FY2020-FY2021 STOP project consists of Part I and Part II with Part II being “if authorized”.
Part I consists of two corridors:
•
•

Bagley Road (from Lindbergh Rd. to Pearl Rd. 3.56 miles, 25 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Berea and Middleburgh Heights.
Ridge Road (from Pearl Rd. to Denison Ave., 3.47 miles, 20 signalized intersections) in the cities of
Parma, Brooklyn, and Cleveland.

Part II, if authorized, will consist of a two corridors/grid of similar length and number of intersections, with
the scope to be developed by NOACA, to begin after Part I has been finalized.
NOACA will administer and manage the STOP program, but the projects will not be implemented without
the approval of the agencies that own, operate and/or maintain the project signals. NOACA will work closely
with the project sponsors and consultants to successfully complete the STOP projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Part I of the proposed contract will be executed for one year commencing on or around January 2020 and
ending on or around March 2021; at a cost not to exceed $439,438. $440,000 was budgeted in the FY2020
OWP for a consultant. Part II, if authorized, will also take place over approximately one year after Part I is
finalized at a cost negotiated by NOACA. This project is funded through NOACA’s CMAQ funds.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, staff will work with the local communities involved and the consultant team to
implement the signal timing optimization program.

RE:

Agency Procurement – NOACA Net Zero Cool Project

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider recommending this item to the Executive Committee for placement on
the Board of Directors’ December 2019 agenda. Specifically, it would award a contract to F. Buddie
Contracting, Ltd. for NOACA’s Net Zero Cool Project (Design Build) in an amount not to exceed $888,000,
which reflects current estimates of total project costs, pending appropriate funding.
The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of November 8, 2019.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) supports the strategic implementation and long-term
maintenance of green infrastructure projects. NEORSD funds green infrastructure projects within the
combined sewer area through its Green Infrastructure Grants (GIG) Program. Green infrastructure protects,
preserves, enhances, and restores natural hydrologic function. Such stormwater control measures (SCMs),
increase resiliency of infrastructure; reduce stress on wet weather drainage and collection systems; and
support healthy environments and strong communities.
The GIG Program is open to member communities, governmental entities, non-profit organizations 501(c)(3),
or businesses working in partnership with their community. These entities can propose water resource
projects that keep stormwater out of the combined sewer system and reduce capacity overflow problems..
The objectives and outcomes for Net Zero Cool are embodied in its name. “Net Zero” refers to NOACA’s
ambition to capture stormwater runoff from its impervious surface area and eliminate its contribution to the
combined wastewater/stormwater conveyance system. “Cool” refers to NOACA’s ambition to showcase its
green infrastructure elements with eye-catching, water-themed design; mural and green wall on the sides of
the building; educational placards along the sidewalk, adjacent to a proposed bioretention system and outdoor
classroom space on the green roof for lectures, tours and public meetings. Net Zero Cool would make NOACA
a true vanguard for NEORSD-funded green infrastructure implementation; a marquee to illuminate the
tremendous benefits of green infrastructure in Downtown Cleveland.
On September 6, NOACA submitted its proposal for “Net Zero Cool,” a three-phase, comprehensive suite of
measures to reduce stormwater runoff from its 100% impervious downtown Cleveland site and mitigate
runoff’s harmful impacts on the Frontal Lake Erie-Doan Brook Watershed.

4 - 15

 Project phases submitted to NEORSD include (with engineer’s estimates of build costs):
PHASE I (BUILDING) ($360,000)
Project A (One-story extensive green roof system with usable outdoor space accessible via second floor) $210,000
Project B (Roof water collection with bioretention) - $150,000
PHASE II (PARKING LOT) ($350,000)
Project A (Parking lot porous paving/center drive aisle) – $140,000
Project B (Carport structures with extensive green roof) - $210,000
PHASE III (WALLS: “THE RIBBON THAT WRAPS THE PACKAGE”) ($95,000)
Project A (One-story building extensive green wall system) - $35,000
Project B (Three-story building mural) - $60,000
The total project cost is estimated at $900,000. In addition to the $805,000 of estimated build costs outlined
above, NOACA estimates $83,000 in design costs and has already spent $12,000 on a design/engineering
team to explore opportunities through site visits, preliminary design proposals and stormwater modeling.
NOACA committed to a 20% match in its application to NEORSD, or $180,000, while NOACA requested
$720,000 in funding from NEORSD.
NOACA released a Request for Proposals (RFP) to hire a design-build firm, conditional on NEORSD (and
any potential future) funding, on September 21st, 2019. Proposals were due on October 21st, 2019; NOACA
received two proposals. Proposal were evaluated on their qualifications and their technical proposals. After
evaluation, the firm with the highest scores was F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd.
ABOUT THE VENDOR
F. Buddie Contracting, Ltd. is a certified CSB (Cleveland Small Business) and a Cuyahoga County SBE (Small
Business Enterprise) located in the City of Cleveland. They have over 55 years in general contracting
experience. Their design team consists of Osborn Engineering; headquartered in Cleveland and MKSK;
headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.
TIMING
NOACA submitted three phase grant application on September 6th, 2019. The NEORSD will announce GIG
awards in November and funded projects will begin January 1, 2020. Pending the GIG award amount, NOACA
may pursue other funding for the potentially unfunded portions of this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Proposed contract will be executed for one year commencing on or around January 2020 and ending on or
around March 2021; at an amount currently estimated not to exceed $888,000. This action would also amend
the NOACA Budget and OWP as appropriate, pending NEORSD award and other potential funding.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, staff will work with the NEORSD, potential future funders involved, and the design
build team to design and build all or parts of the NOACA Net Cool Zero Project.

Project Funding Requests – LAK – Stevens Boulevard, Village of Lakeline

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’
agenda. Specifically, it would recommend additional funding for the City of Eastlake’s Stevens
Boulevard project to expand the project area into the adjacent Village of Lakeline.
The Finance and Audit Committee will consider this item for action on the morning of November 8,
2019.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
The City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard Resurfacing Project is programmed in SFY 2020 of the current
2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), with a NOACA commitment of $2,022,300 of
Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) program funds. The current project scope and funding
commitment addresses the deficient pavement in the City of Eastlake from SR 91 to the north at the
Eastlake/Village of Lakeline corporation line. The project was identified as a need for SFY 2018-2021
TIP funding through the NOACA Transportation Asset Management (TAM) plan and tool. The tool
projects pavement deficiencies and recommends corrective work based on ODOT Pavement Condition
Ratings (PCR) for each segment of the federal-aid roadway network. Roadway segments that are less
than .5 lane miles are either filtered out or adjoined to larger adjacent segments if they are alike in both
condition and recommended corrective work.
The Village of Lakeline maintains approximately .08 miles (400 feet) of Stevens Boulevard, from the
current project limits at the Eastlake corporation line to Lakeshore Boulevard (SR 283). The PCR for
this segment is 63, matching the average PCR and recommended resurfacing of the Eastlake segment
that was prioritized for funding (see attached map). However, in development of the 2018-2021 TIP the
Lakeline segment was inadvertently filtered out for funding consideration because of its length. Rather,
the segment should have been adjoined to the Eastlake Stevens Boulevard segment and prioritized for

4 - 17

 funding. NOACA staff recently became aware of this oversight in discussion with both the Village of
Lakeline and the City of Eastlake.
As such, the Village of Lakeline is requesting consideration for a NOACA STBG program funding
commitment of $176,000 to expand the project across communities to provide maximum project
benefit. A local match of $44,000 (20%) has been committed from Lakeline for a total cost of $220,000.
Pending approval of funding, the City of Eastlake has agreed to incorporate the segment into its design
plans and its funding agreement with ODOT. The projects is currently scheduled for sale in early 2020.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The request would increase the NOACA funding commitment to the City of Eastlake Stevens Boulevard
project by $176,000 from $2,022,300 to $2,198,300. The increase would be funded utilizing existing
savings from STBG projects coming in under estimate. Therefore, there is no impact to other planned
and programmed TIP projects.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the TIP will be amended to incorporate the additional scope and funding for
the project.

E 66th Street Corridor Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Plan

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’
agenda. Specifically, this would add the E 66th Street Corridor Update Project to the 2020 TLCI program
and amend the fiscal year 2020 budget in the amount of $150,000; pending Cleveland Foundation Grant
award.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
In 2010, NOACA approved funding for the League Park Neighborhood District Plan, sponsored by the City
of Cleveland, through the Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) program. The study was
completed in 2012. The study established a strategy for future investment in the Hough neighborhood,
specifically the League Park District.
Since the completion of the original plan in 2012, there have been significant undertakings within and
beyond the immediate study area. In addition to investments made by the residents and community
stakeholders, several recent catalytic announcements have tipped the momentum toward the need to revisit
the plan for a comprehensive update, including:
•
•
•

the recent decision by The Cleveland Foundation to move its headquarters to E. 66th and Euclid;
the new location of the Hough Branch of the Cleveland Public Library at the corner of E. 66th and
Lexington;
the development plans for Allen Estates single and multi-family housing; and the plans for an
innovation district between Euclid and Chester along E. 66th Street.

An immediate update to the original plan, both in content and expanded geography, is needed to best guide
known and planned future investments in the corridor. The study update will address the following areas of
focus:
• Conduct new community outreach and involvement;
• Expand the original study area along E. 66th Street from Chester to Euclid;
• Integrate the updated land uses adjacent to the E. 66th Corridor study area;
4 - 21

 •
•
•
•

Consider the planned Cleveland Foundation headquarters, Innovation District campus plans,
proposed housing developments, and updated vacant land mapping;
Align with existing or identified future planning efforts;
Update of infrastructure plans providing for green and complete streets to provide seamless
transportation access for all modes;
Update the implementation schedule and general cost estimates.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the project is $150,000, pending Cleveland Foundation Grant award. This action will not
impact any funding for the current TLCI solicitation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the budget will be amended and staff will work with the project sponsor to program
and develop the project.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Reviews – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’ agenda.
Specifically, the item proposes that the projects have completed the Project Planning Review (PPR) process.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee support this recommendation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff, Board (including committees, subcommittees, councils,
which provide intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC)) and public involvement. The end product
of PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The second quarter PPR covers roadway and transit projects sponsored by the City of Brecksville, the Ohio
Department of Transportation and GCRTA.
Detailed information about the projects can be found at:
•
•

Roadway Projects in Cuyahoga County
RTA Fiscal Year 2020 Capital Grant Program

As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
4 - 27

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Plan and TIP Amendments – 2nd Quarter State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of
Directors’ agenda. Specifically, this item directs that NOACA’s long-range transportation plan
(Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018 – 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
be amended to include the proposed projects as indicated.
The Transportation Subcommittee and Planning and Programming Committee support this
recommendation.
BACKGROUND
The proposed amendments to the Transportation Plan (Plan) and the state fiscal year (SFY) 2018
– 2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) are being processed through project planning
review (PPR). The projects include roadway and transit projects sponsored by the City of
Brecksville, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and GCRTA.
The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by ODOT, which was processed
through project planning review (Resolution 2018-038) and amended to the TIP (Resolution
2018-039), in December 2018. The project (CUY SR 176 - 10.13: PID No. 101941) involves
improvements at the SR-176 and IR-480 interchange, in Cleveland and Brooklyn Heights. The
project’s construction cost was originally estimated at $12,000,000. The sponsor reports that
the construction cost estimate has increased 23 percent ($2,713,000) to $14,713,000, which
requires amendment of the project in the TIP.
NOACA’s Regional Transportation Investment Policy states that projects already on the TIP
that request a significant change of scope or cost (greater than 20 percent) must go through
PPR again. However, project sponsors may appeal this 20 percent requirement if it can be
shown that the cost increases were a result of an increase in material costs or inflation.
The project’s revised construction cost is the result of an increase in material costs attributable
to more complicated maintenance of traffic and more extensive undercut, which affects the
underdrain system. The costs associated with these activities and materials is consistent with
NOACA policy.
4 - 29

 The proposed amendments also include a project sponsored by Laketran processed through
project planning review (Resolution 2019-014) and amended to the TIP (Resolution 2019-015).
The project (LAK WICKLIFFE PARK & RIDE LOT RECONSTRUCTION: PID No. 108885)
involves reconstruction of the park and ride lot in Wickliffe to accommodate electric charging
infrastructure. The cost of the reconstruction of the park and ride lot site was originally estimated
at $750,000. The estimated cost is being revised to $2,350,699 to reflect the construction of a
facility with an indoor passenger waiting area and a gear room to house the fast charge charging
infrastructure and the creation of three individual loading zones, providing equal access to the
passenger waiting area. The project will be funded with $1,880,559 in Section 5307 funding.
Laketran will provide the remaining $470,140. The increase is over the maximum allowable
threshold for a project this size.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the proposed projects being amended to the Plan and TIP is $240 million. Funding
for these projects is committed and/or planned from a variety of federal, state, and local sources.
Federal funding is provided by the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit
Administration and administered through the Ohio Department of Transportation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the amendments will be incorporated into the NOACA Plan and/or
statewide TIP amendment in January 2020.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Functional Classification Amendment Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of
Directors’ agenda. Specifically, this action would recommend approval of the functional
classification amendments.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Transportation Subcommittee support this
action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ohio Department of Transportation has requested the following functional classification
amendments:
•
•
•
•

Remove E 30th, from I-77 WB exit ramp to Broadway; Broadway (SR 14), from E 30th to
E 14th; and E14th Street, from Broadway to Orange Ave., from the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Add Prospect Ave., from the I-90 WB exit ramp to Tower City to the I-90 WB Intermodal
Connector OH 56T (Tower City).
Revise 500 feet of E14th Street, from Broadway Ave. to Orange Ave., from a principal
arterial to a major collector.
Add 210 feet of SR 87 – Shaker Boulevard in both directions to Connector OH 82T from
the RTA station at approximately E 130th Street to the east leg of the Shaker Square
Loop (CR 62) which will also join with Connector OH 84T.

Functional Classification is the grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on
the type of highway service they provide. Streets and highways are part of an interconnected
network, and each one plays a role in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways provide either traffic mobility or land access and can be ranked in terms of the
proportion of service they perform.
4 - 41

 In June 2014 the NOACA Board of Directors approved Resolution Number 2014-025, which
created a NOACA functional classification policy for the review of proposed functional
classification revisions. The policy requires all proposed functional classification revisions to be
evaluated thoroughly prior to making a recommendation to the Ohio Department of
Transportation. Evaluation is based on guidelines suggested by the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) with some criteria
refined to reflect local conditions. Criteria evaluated includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Lane widths
Shoulder widths
Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT)
Access
Speed limit
Parallel spacing of routes
Area type
Percentage of mileage by functional classification (by region, by county)
Functional classification density analysis

Based on the NOACA Functional Classification Amendment Policy, Staff recommends the
proposed ODOT amendments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact, but approval of the functional classification recommendations could add
additional mileage to the federal-aid network.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, these recommendations will be forwarded to ODOT and FHWA for
further review and implementation.

RE:

Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals With Disabilities (Section 5310)
Program Funding Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’
agenda. Specifically this action, would recommend approval of the SFY20 Enhanced Mobility for Seniors
and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program Project Recommendations.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Transportation Subcommittee support this action.
BACKGROUND
The Enhanced Mobility for Seniors and Individuals with Disabilities (Section 5310) Program addresses the
special transportation needs of seniors and individuals with disabilities. NOACA seeks to eliminate barriers
and improve transportation options in Northeast Ohio for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and
people of low income through the coordination of resources and efforts of public transit operators, human
service agencies, and other transportation providers. Furthermore, NOACA will encourage the efficient and
effective use of resources by eliminating gaps and redundancies in transportation services.
The total amount apportioned to the region for federal fiscal year 2019 was $ 1,809,255, of which $ 180,925
(10%) will be retained by NOACA for program planning and administration. The remaining $ 1,628,330 is
available to be programmed for new projects. NOACA has designated at least 60% of funding for transit
agency project proposals and up to 40% for non-profits, for-profits, and government agencies awarded
through a competitive application process. There are also carryover funds from previous years totaling
$ 53,424 which will be applied to this program of projects. The total funding available to be programmed for
new projects this year is $1,681,754. Capital projects are funded at 80% with a 20% local match from
awardees. Transit agencies are eligible for operations funding at 50% federal funding with a 50% local
match.

 NOACA accepted project proposals and applications from July 3, 2019 to August 7, 2019. NOACA received
two transit project proposals requesting $2,300,582 and 21 competitive applications from municipalities,
non-profits, for-profits, and social service agencies requesting $1,520,371. Project proposals and
applications have been evaluated against program eligibility and prioritization criteria contained in the
Program Management Plan. Project recommendations are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $ 1,809,255 in FTA funds available to the Cleveland Urbanized Area from Federal Fiscal Year 2019.
$ 180,925 will be used by NOACA for program administration. There is an additional $53,424 in carryover
funds from previous years to be added to the available funding, totaling $1,681,754.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will manage the SFY 2020 program to ensure the expenditure of all
available funding during the fiscal year, including the advancement of additional projects as approved by the
Board should funding become available.

TO:

NOACA Executive Committee

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

November 1, 2019

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Transfer of one (1) parcel from the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake County FPA in City of Willoughby

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’ agenda.
Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (5.4 acres) from the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA to the Lake
County FPA in the City of Willoughby.
The Planning and Programming Committee recommends this action, and the Water Quality Subcommittee
unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum to take official action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Ridgewood Green Subdivision is proposed at the former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of
Mentor and Willoughby. The majority of the 55.2-acre development will be within the City of Mentor and the
Lake County Facility Planning Area (FPA), but 5.4 acres will extend into the City of Willoughby and the
Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. Both municipalities have approved the project.
The approved subdivision plan calls for Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) to provide sewer
service. However, the portion of the development within the City of Willoughby is not within the Lake
County FPA (Attachment A). With the current FPA boundary location, LCDU future sewer connections
within the City of Willoughby are inconsistent with NOACA’s Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All sanitary
sewer connections must be within the FPA of the WWTP that treats the wastewater. Under the federal
Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a project that conflicts with NOACA’s
208 Plan.
The FPA boundary modification is needed so the entire subdivision can be served by gravity sewers that
will flow to the LCDU sanitary sewer line along Mentor Avenue in the City of Mentor (Attachment B). The
developer investigated the extension of the City of Willoughby sewers to serve the portion of the subdivision
within the City of Willoughby. However, the nearest sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road would require a
pump station for the homes to connect to the sewer. This option was determined not to be feasible due to
the small number of homes planned for that portion of the subdivision. The Willoughby sewer line along
Gardenside Drive to the west of the subdivision has limited capacity and the Willoughby City Engineer
recommended against adding additional flow to that sewer.

4 - 47

 The affected jurisdictions are the City of Willoughby and Lake County. The City of Eastlake is a co-owner of
the Willoughby-Eastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) which serves the Willoughby-Eastlake
FPA. All three (3) jurisdictions submitted letters of support for the FPA modification request, which fulfills
the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

RE: Request for Facility Planning Area Change
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision

Dear Mr. Berzin, Mayor Morley and Commissoners:

Please accept this correspondence in response to a request to a proposed change in sewer
service for the Ridgewood Greens Subdivision located in the City of Willoughby.

I am in receipt of the formal request from the property owner, Bedaos LLC, to each party,
dated May 21, 2019. The City of Willoughby understands that the Subdivision lies within Willoughby-
Eastlake Facility Planning Area (FPA) for sanitary sewer service, but the Lake County Sewer System
can more economically serve the proposed Subdivision. The Lake County sanitary sewer system has
the capacity for the additional ?ow.

Based on this understanding, the City of Willoughby has no objection and supports this
change in service that will best meet the needs of our community.

Very truly yours,

RE: Request for Proposed Faciltiy Planning Area (FPA) Amendment
Ridgewood Greens Subdivision - Willoughby Mentor
Bedados. LLC
Letter of Support

Dear Ms. Schwickerath:

Reference is made to your letter with attachments dated 'April 24, 2019. detailing a new subdivision
located in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby and in specific, the proposed point of connection
for the new sanitary sewers to service the subdivision.

It is understood from the documents provided that of the 119 lots in the subdivision, 112 lots exist
within the Lake County Utilities Department FPA while the remaining 7 exist in the
Willoughby?Eastiake FPA. It is further understood that having considered several alternates, the
best and most effective way to service the 7 lots would be to have them connected to sewers in the
LCUD FPA. To effect the best alternative requires that the 7 lots be placed under the auspices of
the LCUD FPA.

As a community within the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA, The City of Eastlake by copy of the letter
offers its support in favor of the proposed change in FPA for the aforementioned 7 lots. Should
additional documentation or legislation related to this matter be required, please contact me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mayor Dennis Morley

 Staff Comments:
A new residential development, Ridgewood Greens Subdivision, is planned for the
former Johnnycake Ridge Golf Course in the Cities of Mentor and Willoughby. The
majority of the development, 112 out of 119 single family lots, is within the City of
Mentor. The remaining seven (7) lots will be in the City of Willoughby. Both
municipalities have approved the subdivision.
The approved development plans show the homes served by gravity sanitary sewers
connected to the existing Lake County Department of Utilities (LCDU) sewer line along
Mentor Avenue. This sewer line is within the Lake County FPA. However, the portion of
the proposed subdivision within the City of Willoughby is in the Willoughby-Eastlake FPA
and not the Lake County FPA. Under the federal Clean Water Act, sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the plant that treats the sewage. Therefore, the
portion of the development within the City of Willoughby needs to be transferred into the
Lake County FPA in order to be served by LCDU sewers.
Alternative sewer plans to maintain the existing FPA boundary were considered.
However, the existing City of Willoughby sanitary sewer along Johnnycake Ridge Road
is not deep enough to serve the seven (7) proposed lots within the City of Willoughby. A
pump station would be needed to connect these parcels to the sewer along Johnnycake
Ridge Road, but would not be cost effective with so few lots. The City of Willoughby
sewer line along Gardenside Drive to the west is not a viable sewer option because of
existing capacity issues, according to the Willoughby City Engineer.
The current Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) allow for sanitary
sewer connections to the proposed site, so no change is required.
The affected jurisdictions are Lake County and the City of Willoughby. Both jurisdictions
support the proposed FPA modification. The City of Eastlake co-owns the WilloughbyEastlake Water Pollution Control Center (WPCC) and is also in support of the request.
The FPA modification notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of NOACA’s Clean Water
2000 Plan (208 Plan) have been fulfilled.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the proposed FPA boundary modification between
the Lake County FPA and Willoughby-Eastlake FPA. The Lake County sanitary sewer
line along Mentor Avenue can serve the entire proposed subdivision with gravity sewers.
The nearest sanitary sewers within the City of Willoughby are either not deep enough to
provide gravity sewer service to the new lots or do not have the capacity for additional
flow from the subdivision.

RE:

Facility Planning Area (FPA) Modification Request: Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District (NEORSD) – Heights Hilltop FPA Boundary and Prescriptions Modification in
the Village of Moreland Hills

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’ agenda.
Specifically, the item will:
•

Add four (4) parcels (6.9 acres) currently not within an FPA to the NEORSD – Heights Hilltop FPA;
and

•

Change the Prescriptions for Wastewater Treatment (Prescriptions) for the parcels within the
proposed modification area to make sanitary sewer connections consistent with the Clean Water 2000
Plan (208 Plan).

The Planning and Programming Committee recommended this action, and the Water Quality Subcommittee
unanimously voted to support this recommendation, but lacked a quorum to take official action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
An area on the southeast corner of State Route 91 (Som Center Road) and Hiram Trail in the Village of
Moreland Hills has been subdivided twice since 2014 to create four (4) lots. Three (3) of the lots are along
Hiram Trail and are undeveloped residential properties. The fourth lot has an existing home that is served
by an on-site sewage treatment system. A condition of the lot splits imposed by the Village of Moreland
Hills was any new development would connect to sanitary sewers. However, NOACA’s 208 Plan shows the
four (4) lots are not currently within an FPA and have a Prescription that does not allow for sanitary sewer
connections (Attachment A). The extension of sanitary sewers to these lots is not consistent NOACA’s
current 208 Plan. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Ohio EPA cannot issue a Permit-to-Install (PTI) for a
sanitary sewer extensions that conflicts with NOACA’s 208 Plan.
The Village of Moreland Hills requested an FPA modification to transfer the parcels into the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA and change the Prescriptions within the modification area to “sewers expected within 20
years” (Attachment B). The proposed changes would make sanitary sewer connections for all four (4)
parcels consistent with NOACA’s 208 Plan and fulfill the lot split approval condition for the three (3)
undeveloped parcels along Hiram Trail.
The affected jurisdictions are the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both support the proposed FPA
modification request which fulfills the notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan.
4 - 59

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

Re: Facilities Planning Area (FPA) Modification Moreland Hills
Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer Extension

Dear Ms. Gallucci:

On August 7, 2019, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD) received a request
seeking support for the proposed modification of the NEORSD Heights-Hilltop Facilities Planning
Area (FPA) with the addition of four (4) parcels along Hiram Trail and SOM Center Road in
Moreland Hills (see attached parcel list and map).

Based on the information submitted with the request, Moreland Hills is proposing to extend a
sanitary sewer along Hiram Trail in order to facilitate new development on three (3) of the
parcels. The area tributary to the Hiram Trail Sanitary Sewer extension is already within
service area. Therefore, we concur with the proposed FPA modification.

If you have any questions or if you should need additional information, please contact Mary
Maciejowski at (216) 881-6600, ext. 6466.

Sincerely,

@m?t

Kyle Dreyfuss-We ls,

 Staff Comments:
The Village of Moreland Hills requests an FPA Boundary and Prescription modification in
order to allow four (4) parcels along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail to connect to
sanitary sewers. The area was originally a single parcel that was split into four (4)
parcels in 2014 and 2018. The three new parcels along Hiram Trail are not yet
developed. A condition of the lot split approval from the Village of Moreland Hills was
that newly constructed homes would connect to sanitary sewers. The proposed FPA
modification area is currently not within an FPA and has the Prescription of “area served
by on-site systems” which does not allow for extension of sanitary sewers.
The FPA modification area is within the sanitary sewer service agreement area between
the Village of Moreland Hills and NEORSD. Both entities support the proposed transfer.
Staff Disposition:
Staff recommend approval of the proposed FPA modifications to extend the NEORSD –
Heights Hilltop FPA along State Route 91 and Hiram Trail. The FPA Boundary and
Prescription changes will allow for sanitary sewers to serve three newly split parcels
along Hiram Trail. Both the Village and NEORSD are in support of the FPA modification.

RE:

Safety Performance Target Setting for CY 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Committee is asked to consider placement of this item on the December 2019 Board of Directors’ agenda.
Specifically this action updates safety performance targets approved by the Board of Directors (Resolution
2019-022) for the current 2018-2021 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) and the AIM Forward 2040
Long Range Transportation Plan.
The Policy Committee and Transportation Subcommittee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND
Safety Performance Management (Safety PM) is part of the overall Transportation Performance
Management (TPM) program, which FHWA defines as a strategic approach that uses system information to
make investment and policy decision to achieve national performance goals. It establishes safety
performance measure requirements for the purpose of carrying out the State’s Highway Safety
Improvement Plan (HSIP) and to assess fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads.
The federal Safety PM Final Rule established five performance measures as the five-year rolling averages
to include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Number of Fatalities
Rate of Fatalities per 100 million Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
Number of Serious Injuries
Rate of Serious Injuries per 100 million VMT
Number of Non-motorized Fatalities and Non-motorized Serious Injuries

The Safety PM Final Rule also establishes the process for State Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to establish and report their safety targets.
State DOT’s are required to adopted targets annually. MPOs are required to establish targets within of 180
days and shall represent the anticipated outcomes for the same calendar year as the State DOT target (23
U.S.C. 134(h)(2)). MPO targets can be established through one of two options:

4 - 67

 1. Agree to plan and program projects so that they contribute toward the accomplishment of the State
DOT safety target for a safety performance measure, or
2. Commit to a quantifiable target for a safety performance measure for the metropolitan planning area.
NOACA adopted ODOT’s calendar year 2018 target of a 1% reduction for each of the five performance
measures consistent with the first option above. For calendar year 2018, NOACA’s 1-year performance in
each of the 5 performance measures is presented in the table below. It can be seen that fatalities, serious
injuries, and non-motorized fatalities all declined versus the previous three years, reversing the prior trend
of increasing FSI’s since 2014.

Fatalities

Within the NOACA region, frequency targets for Fatalities and Non-Motorized FSI’s were not met, in spite of
significant reductions in fatalities and serious injuries in 2018. This is because the targets are established
and reported using 5-year rolling averages, not annual crash frequencies, and the frequencies included in
the rolling averages for 2018 were greater than the ones replaced from 2013. The rate-based target for
fatalities was also not met, largely for the same reason.
ODOT has established a 2% reduction for each of the five performance areas for calendar year 2020, an
increase from 1% versus last year. A rate of 2% reflects a more aggressive approach toward reducing
4 - 68

 crashes that reflects the 2% reductions recommended for emphasis areas in NOACA’s SAVE Plan. Staff
recommends that NOACA adopt ODOT’s target of a 2% reduction for calendar year 2020 to support state
targets for safety performance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the AIM Forward 2040 plan and current FY 2018-2021 TIP will be amended to
reflect the 2020 adopted safety targets. Staff will support these targets by working to implement the
recommendations and strategies outlined in “SAVE: NOACA’s Regional Safety Action Plan.”
