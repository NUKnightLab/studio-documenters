Calculation and authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
and submit the Performance Funding System Calculation and all necessary related

(Item No. A2)
The Authority’s business activity requires a thorough review process to monitor the effectiveness
of its policies and practices. The internal audit function is a critical element for establishing the
controls and fiscal discipline necessary to facilitate the Authority’s change in business focus, and
4

 to address economic inefficiencies that may not have been examined. After the appropriate
advertisement and solicitation for proposals, the evaluation committee determined that KPMG,
LLP was the best candidate to meet the requirements for internal auditing services at the CHA.

whether the Authority’s financial data and reports are reliable, that internal control structures are in
place, that proper policy and procedures are followed, and that there is compliance with the terms
and conditions of grant awards, the Authority issued a RFP for auditing services. Of the 5
responses received, the evaluation committee determined that Deloitte & Touche, LLP, one of the
largest professional service firms focusing on providing high-quality professional services and
commitment to various levels of government, was the best candidate for providing the services
needed for the required annual audit.

Ward North America, Inc., the third party administrator for liability claims under the Private
Manager Insurance Program, has provided quality service to the Authority during the two year
contract period (April 1, 1999 to April 1, 2001). The resolution for Item A4 approves the one-year

in an amount not to exceed $196,000, subject to approval by HUD.

(Item No. A5)
In past policy years the Authority has experienced an increase in insurance premium rates, due to
loss payments and reserving practices for catastrophic losses, insurer bankruptcies and fluctuations
5

 in the stock market, along with CHA’s claim activity. In an effort to ensure a comfort level with
insurance carriers and maintain affordable premiums, CHA’s Broker of Record placed an
advertisement soliciting bids for insurance coverage. Based on the results of the solicitation, it is
