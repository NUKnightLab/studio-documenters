Transformational Brownfield Plan Introduction
Senate Bills 111-115, signed by Governor Snyder on June 6, 2017, allow for the approval of
Transformational Brownfield Plans (“TBPs”), which are defined as plans that will have a
“transformational impact on local economic development and community revitalization based on
the extent of brownfield redevelopment and growth in population, commercial activity, and
employment that will result from the Plan.”
Per Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (“Act 381”), TBPs must be a mixed-use
development and, with respect to TBPs in Detroit, with certain exceptions, must have a minimum
level of capital investment of $500M or more. This investment can be one project or a series of

 developments on eligible property that are a “related program of investment.” In addition to the
capture of property tax increment revenues, TBPs allow for the capture of construction period tax
revenues, state income tax revenues, and withholding tax revenues (together with property tax
increment revenues, “TIF”) as well as certain sales and use tax exemptions. Eligible activities
under TBPs are expanded to include the “construction, restoration, alteration, renovation or
improvement of buildings.”
A proposed TBP for the Hudson’s Block, Monroe Blocks, One Campus Martius Expansion, and
Book Building and Book Tower Redevelopment Projects (the “Plan”) is being submitted for review
and consideration and will be described by project.

HUDSON SITE
Project Introduction
Rosko Development Company LLC, an affiliate of Bedrock Management Services LLC, or its
affiliate will be the developer of the project (the “Developer”) for this component of the Plan which
entails the planned redevelopment of the Hudson’s Site to create a world-class mixed-use
development with extensive public and civic space. This development is anticipated to include
the tallest tower in the City that will rise an estimated 800 feet next to a mid-rise podium, which
will be separated by landscaped public space.
The planned structure on the Hudson’s Site will be approximately 1.3 million gross square feet
(“GSF”) and is anticipated to consist of approximately 103,000 GSF of retail and food and
beverage space, including a street level market; 118,000 GSF of event and conference space;
305,000 GSF of office space; approximately 330 residential units occupying 425,000 GSF;
89,000 GSF of programmed civic and public space; 74,000 GSF of terrace and landscaped
space; and a 23,000 GSF public skydeck atop the tower. The planned redevelopment of the
Hudson’s Site also includes modernized below-grade parking with at least 700 parking spaces.
It is currently estimated that this project will create or support 1,633 permanent jobs and the
spillover effects from visitors and tourists are expected to create another 900 jobs.

$188.7M in TIF reimbursement for this component of the Plan.

$5,022,552 in TIF reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists an 8-acre parcel being created out of the
combination of approximately 70 former parcels on the current City-owned Forest Park located at
the southwest corner of Dequindre and East Canfield in the Forest Park neighborhood. Please
see Attachment A and B of the Plan for a map of the parcels.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because (a) the
property was previously utilized for residential or public purpose; (b) it is located within the City of
Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property is determined to
be blighted and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of that property as defined by
Act 381. The parcel is in the process of being determined blighted per Act 381 via a pending
initial determination of blight letter from Detroit City Planning Commission staff. The property
meets the definition of blighted because it has substantial subsurface demolition debris buried on
the site to that the property is unfit for its intended use.
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered “eligible
activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include site assessment and baseline
environmental site assessment activities, due care activities, infrastructure improvements, site
preparation, preparation of a brownfield plan and work plan, a 15% contingency. The eligible
activities and budgeted costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be
financed solely by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible
activities and will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in the winter of 2017
or spring of 2018 and be completed within 1 year.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment revenue
generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the
eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan pursuant to the terms of a
Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
