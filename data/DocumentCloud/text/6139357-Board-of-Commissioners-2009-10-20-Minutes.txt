VILLAGE OF HOFFMAN ESTATES
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

VOLUME

07-08-300-059-0000

187

This request package contains one (1) Property Index Number (PIN). This property is the
Brookside pond that currently has no legal property owner. It is a retention pond used for
Village drainage and is in Schaumburg Township. It is not being maintained and is dirty
and foul smelling and is creating an erosion problem for adjoining properties. The Village
would like to clean and maintain the pond and attempt to prevent further erosion onto the
adjacent properties. This would be of great benefit to the residents and Village of
Hoffman Estates. The Village will file for a tax exempt status for this property as we will
retain the property for municipal use.
Additionally, the Village will retain legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal
and other costs associated with the acquisition of this parcel. The Village also agrees to
submit, to the Cook County Office of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on
the status of this parcel for five years, as required by the Cook County No Cash Bid
Ordinance.
_________________________
Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to discharge Communication No. 301819

EDWIN REYES, TIMOTHY O. SCHNEIDER, PETER M. SILVESTRI,
ROBERT B. STEELE and LARRY SUFFREDIN, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Jail and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center (JTDC) are experiencing
an increased population of pregnant and addicted girls; and
WHEREAS, with the growing number of incarcerated women who are pregnant, it is important to
recognize that failing to provide quality pre-natal care poses a serious threat to the unborn child as well as
the mother; and
WHEREAS, the vast majority of prisons and detention centers provide little or no prenatal care and
insufficient staff training regarding the needs of pregnant women; and
WHEREAS, detention conditions such as overcrowding, poor nutrition, and exposure to contagious
diseases present a considerable danger to the health of the fetus; and
WHEREAS, studies have shown pregnancies of incarcerated women are more likely to end in
miscarriage than non-incarcerated pregnant women; and
WHEREAS, it has been proven that early intervention with this population gives unborn children a
higher chance of being born drug free and minimizes the risk of potential mental and physical defects;
and
WHEREAS, the cost of providing essential quality pre-natal care is cost prohibitive and poses a
tremendous financial burden on the tax-payers of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the cost for providing the same services outside of our correctional institutions qualifies for
reimbursement from federal, state and local government.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners find alternative placements for pregnant women and girls who commit minor crimes,
such alternatives should include but not be limited to, electronic monitoring, day/evening reporting
centers and house arrest and special housing and support systems; and

3128

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 20, 2009
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners establish a
collaborative contract with the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, state agencies and private agencies to ensure adequate support to
achieve the purpose of this Resolution and care for this population, utilize capital improvement dollars
and other available resources to ensure that the best interest of the child is met and women are given
access to treatment in a timely manner to prevent damage to the unborn child.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the current income tax system in Illinois is not fair to those who make $20,000 a year or
less and who pay a greater percentage of their income to taxes than those who make over $20,000 and
those who make $50,000 pay a greater portion of their income than those who make $75,000 a year and
as the income increases the percentage of income paid to taxes decreases in Illinois; and
WHEREAS, if the Illinois General Assembly is going to increase income taxes it affords an opportunity
to correct the equity problem among different income brackets; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has abdicated its constitutional and legislative responsibilities to fund
education at 51 percent of the cost; and
WHEREAS, the over reliance on property taxes to fund education poses undue hardship on property
owners and especially those seniors who have to rely on a fixed income; and
WHEREAS, income tax coupled with a reduction of property taxes for education would be a more
reliable way to fund education.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the Governor, and the leaders of the House and Senate to seriously consider
revising the income tax structure to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of income tax; and

3129

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 20, 2009

AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE ILLINOIS VIDEO GAMING ACT
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois’ Video Gaming Act (230 ILCS 40/1 et seq.; PA 10 960034) became law July 13, 2009 and allows licensed retail establishments to conduct video
gambling; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that some Illinois local jurisdictions would desire to opt out of
video gambling, Section 27 of the Video Gaming Act permits counties and municipalities to
prohibit video gaming by ordinance within their respective corporate limits or unincorporated
areas; and
WHEREAS, states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina have abandoned
experiments with the legalization of video poker because of regulatory difficulties,
corruption, and the high social costs associated with this form of gambling; and
WHEREAS, electronic gaming is designed to entice people to play longer, faster, and at
higher rates of wagering, according to a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
and

3177

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 20, 2009
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County Board
President agree that legalized video poker would present a variety of adverse impacts on
residents of Cook County including the potential for corruption, increasing the costs of law
enforcement, regulatory difficulties, and high social costs; and
WHEREAS, the legalization of video poker within Cook County is not consistent with our
desire to maintain a family friendly environment for citizens and their children; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the Cook County Board
President call on every municipality within Cook County to join the County in prohibiting
video gaming.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners,

Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 58-161.

of the device, mechanism or implement, is used in playing games which includes, but which
is not limited to pinball or any game which is a form of pinball, or any game which is a form
of poker, keno, bingo or any variation of a slot machine, and shall include those devices,
mechanisms or implements having a video display which are intended to be played. Gaming
device shall also include any device authorized by the Illinois Video Gaming Act, 230 ILCS
40/1 et seq.
Place of public resort means any premises wherein any service or merchandise is
offered for sale to the public or where gaming devices are used, kept, owned, played or
operated, or any premises used as a clubhouse or clubrooms, or any premises which are
licensed by Cook County to engage in business, including businesses licensed to serve and/or
sell alcoholic beverages. Place of public resort shall also include any place authorized by the
Illinois Video Gaming Act, 230 ILCS 40/1 et seq., to conduct video gaming.
(b)
Owning, operating, etc., in place of public resort. It shall be unlawful for any
person, to keep, own, play, use or operate, or cause to be kept, owned, played, used, or
operated, in any place of public resort within the unincorporated area of the County, any
gambling device, where the player, by playing the game, is entitled to accumulate points or
replays for receipt of reward, money, or any other item of value. Such gaming devices shall
not be prohibited where the player is rewarded only with additional opportunities to play.
This section shall not be deemed to prohibit any games of chance or skill which were
expressly authorized by State law on or before April 1, 1994. However, this section does
prohibit any video gaming authorized by 230 ILCS 40/1 et seq. and video gaming licenses
authorized by 230 ILCS 40/1 et seq. shall not be valid within the unincorporated areas of

COOK COUNTY COMPTROLLER (APPOINTMENT). Transmitting a Communication,
dated September 10, 2009 from Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of
Commissioners:
Pursuant to § 2-411 of the Cook County Code, I hereby appoint Ms. CONSTANCE M.
KRAVITZ to the position of Comptroller, effective immediately.
Ms. Kravitz is a Certified Public Accountant with 19 years of government accounting and
auditing experience, both in the private and public sectors. Ms. Kravitz has held significant
and key accounting and auditing positions with several sister agencies, including St. Clair
County where she held the titles of Finance Director and Deputy Clerk, the City of Chicago
where she served as the Assistant Comptroller, and the Chicago Park District where she
served as the Comptroller.
With respect to Ms. Kravitz’ private sector experience in government accounting and
auditing, Ms. Kravitz worked as a Senior Auditor for both RSM McGladrey, Inc., an
accounting firm with over 120 offices nationwide, and the global accounting firm of Deloitte
& Touche, LLC.
Ms. Kravitz’ strong background in government accounting and auditing, both in the private
and public sectors, will make her an asset to the Bureau of Finance as the Comptroller.
I submit this communication for your approval.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental & Veterans Relations on
09/16/09.

Commissioner Daley asked Ms. Kravitz to provide a brief summary of the changes she would like to
implement were she to become the Cook County Comptroller.
Ms. Kravitz replied that what might be useful is a tracking system for invoices, as well as vendor
education concerning invoices.
Commissioner Daley suggested that the trial balance process be updated; currently the trial balances
arrive a few months behind schedule.
Mrs. Kravitz concurred.
Chairman Suffredin inquired whether Ms. Kravitz perceives any possible conflicts with the current
accounting firms with whom the County is working, based upon the subpoenas they have received. He
further inquired whether that would cause any delays in the processing of the records and reports the
County will need.
Ms. Kravitz replied in the negative. She stated that she has investigated these accusations very
thoroughly and she does not foresee any issues pertaining to issuing financial statements on time.
Chairman Suffredin inquired whether the issuance of these subpoenas by a prosecutor’s office will cause
any potential conflict with the accounting firms being able to work with individuals within the County’s
Finance Department.
Ms. Kravitz replied in the negative.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 20, 2009
Chairman Suffredin inquired how quickly Ms. Kravitz expects to be able to streamline and computerize
the trial balances, to achieve transparent and ease of search.

overall this would take five or six months.

PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER

VOLUME
216

The Village of East Hazel Crest has identified this parcel as a potential site for commercial
redevelopment and public roadway expansion. This parcel is immediately adjacent to a TIF
district within the Village of East Hazel Crest that is scheduled for development. The
development is contingent upon approval from IDOT of a traffic signal at the intersection of
174th Street and Halsted Street. IDOT requires that the roadway in the vicinity of the traffic
light be widened which requires additional right-of-way. This parcel would be necessary if
the Village of East Hazel Crest is to meet that requirement. East Hazel Crest is a small land
locked community with a small business base. This particular TIF is the only area of
opportunity for economic development; therefore the installation of traffic signal is crucial to
our economic expansion; which means that in order to make it happen we need additional
right-or-way. This parcel will satisfy the right-of-way requirement.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the portion of
the property that will be used for public roadway and until a developer is located for any
remainder.
There is no third party request, proposal or agreement by a developer, organization or other
private party for this no-cash bid request.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner, O’Donnell,
Marovich & Lapp, LTD, attorneys for the Village, to obtain the tax deed and the Village will
bear all legal and other costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will also annually report to the Cook County Office of
Economic Development informing and updating the County as to the status of the parcel of
property for five years or until the intended development is completed, whichever comes last.

VILLAGE OF GLENWOOD (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication
from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request from
Kerry Durkin, Village President, Village of Glenwood.
Re:

No Cash Bid Request Package for the Village of Glenwood.

Please accept this letter as the Village of Glenwood’s application to participate in the Cook
County No Cash Bid Program for the 2009 County Scavenger Sale for the parcel of property
identified below:
VILLAGE OF GLENWOOD
PROPERTY INDEX NUMBER
32-09-201-023-0000

VOLUME
011

This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
I believe that utilization of the County’s No Cash Bid Program is the only means by which
this property can be returned to the tax rolls. The above identified property consists of an
industrial building that is located within the Village of Glenwood’s industrial park. The
building on this property has been vacant for several years, is run down and is in need of
environmental remediation. Other efforts to use the County’s tax sale procedure to transfer
this property to a user that will actually occupy the property, pay taxes and create jobs have
failed. This property was previously sold for delinquent taxes for the year 2002 and prior
years (Certificate of Purchase No. 02-0000194). However, after the tax purchaser determined
that the property was in need of environmental remediation, this sale was vacated by a Court
order dated January 23, 2008. Submitted under Tab 1 is a copy of the January 23, 2008 court
order that vacated the tax sale of this property because the property contained “hazardous
materials requiring removal under the Illinois EPA and the U.S. EPA.”
Property taxes have not been paid on this property for many years. The title work enclosed
with this package reflects that the taxes due for the first and second installments for the 2006
and 2007 taxes have not been paid. The first installment for the 2008 taxes also remains
unpaid. In addition, the submitted January 23, 2008 court order vacating the 2002 tax sale as
a sale in error obligates the County to reimburse the prior tax purchaser all the taxes that it
has paid. It is therefore appears that this property has not contributed property tax revenue
since at least 2002.

This request package is for the one (1) Property Index Number (PIN) described above.
The above property is a small, vacant, unimproved 20 foot by 65 foot parcel of property that
is located in area that was previously subdivided in the early 1970’s but never built. In total,
the area where this parcel is located includes 163 unimproved lots. All these unimproved 163
lots make up a rectangular area of approximately 615 feet by 1,295 feet (18.28 acres). This
area is located adjacent to and east of railroad tracks. In the mid 1990’s the Village acquired
title to all but 6 of the lots in this area through tax deeds that were recorded as document
numbers 94-471283 and 95-146723. The single lot that is the subject of this application is
surrounded on all sides by other lots that were acquired by the Village of Glenwood in the
mid 1990’s. This single lot is not improved and is not served by any roads or utilities.
Property taxes have not been paid on the subject property for many years. The title work
enclosed with this package reflects that the taxes have not been paid for this parcel since
1987.
