Joint Committee Recommendation/Discussion Item
A. Discussion of Nurse Registry and Overtime Use
(Joint discussion to be held with Human Resources Committee)
Note: Due to timing issues, a joint discussion between the Human Resources and Finance Committees could
not take place; discussion of this item took place at the end of this meeting, following the discussion and
consideration of the other items on the agenda.
Jeanene Johnson, System Director of Performance Improvement, provided a presentation on labor performance
monitoring (Attachment #1). During the presentation, Chairman Carvalho noted that of the key findings
presented by Ms. Johnson, many of the issues cited would be solvable by changing the union contracts.
The following individuals presented an overview of the Overtime Review and Performance Improvement Plan
(Attachment #2): Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Chief Operating Officer; and Roz Lennon, System Chief
Clinical Officer. Gina Goodson-Allen, System Director of Recruitment and Talent Management, provided
additional information regarding recruitment efforts. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
At approximately 12:40 P.M., Director Golden assumed the Chair. The Committee continued to receive
information. It was noted that this presentation would also be made at the Board Meeting on April 29th.

IV. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, March 25, 2011
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Golden, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of March 25, 2011.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #3)
This item was considered concurrently with Item IV(C) Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items.
Nita Stith, Interim Deputy Director of Supply Chain, presented the requests for the Committee’s consideration.
She noted that request number 14 contains an error; at this time, it is currently pending review by Contract
Compliance (transmittal erroneously indicates that review by Contract Compliance is not applicable). She
noted that terms and conditions of the contracts are still being finalized for request numbers 7, 14 and 16;
however, the fiscal impact will not change for these requests.
Additional information was provided on the requests by the following individuals: William T. Foley, Chief
Executive Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System; LaVerne Hall, Director of the Cook
County Office of Contract Compliance; Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer; Jackie Edwards, of
PricewaterhouseCoopers; and Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Chief Operating Officer.
During the discussion of request number 7, Ms. Hall provided additional information regarding the review by
Contract Compliance. She stated that Aramark has identified ten vendors that they anticipate utilizing over the
course of the contract; she added that Contract Compliance will need a letter of intent from Aramark, which
will detail how they will utilize the vendors. Once Contract Compliance looked at Aramark’s strategy, those
ten vendors represented approximately 15% of the overall spend, which is short of the goal. Aramark has been
asked to give the Office of Contract Compliance some idea of other areas in which they can achieve the goal
level of participation. Director Muñoz stated that the System Board’s intent is for the larger firms that get the
larger contracts to partner with minority firms for technical work, not just labor work; this experience will
allow minority firms to be competitive in bidding for future contracts. Ms. Hall stated that the 15%
participation currently represented is direct technical participation; other auxiliary areas will represent the 10%
participation in order to reach the goal. Director Muñoz inquired regarding the subject of mentoring. Ms. Hall
stated that she will do a capacity building initiative with Aramark. As part of the development of the strategy,
a local Cook County minority business can be identified, that Aramark can mentor. Contract Compliance can
track how Aramark has built the capacity of that firm over the course of the contract; these efforts can be
reported back to the Committee on a regular basis.

IV. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Mr. Ayres provided additional information regarding request number 16. He stated that this contract will
enable the System to do the physician billing project; it includes the final charge-capture bill preparation,
coding, submission to third party payers, credit posting and follow-up services. He stated that, initially, these
bills will go to all third-party payers, Medicare (outside of Stroger Hospital) and any self-pay patient that is
deemed to pay a portion of their bill based on the CareLink charity service program. Over the next year, it will
expand to include Medicare at Stroger Hospital; he noted that the contractual relationship will need to be rearranged in order for this to happen. Following this, a review of Medicaid programs and the System’s
relationship with them will take place, to determine whether or not the System wants to change to direct billing
for physician services. Further discussion took place on the fixed/contingency fee spread, and whether the
System can build up the capacity internally. Mr. Ayres stated that the pricing compared favorably to the other
responders to the request for proposals. With regard to whether the System can build up the capacity
internally, Mr. Ayres stated that this is dependent on all of the other areas working better; however, he stated
that, as these services requires a great attention to detail at a very granular level, he would not recommend
having these services provided internally.
With regard to request number 15, Mr. Foley provided an overview of the three components related to the
request. Chairman Carvalho noted that it is not unusual to have management supply contracts, for the
provision of key management positions within the organization.
At this time, Chairman Carvalho asked Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, to introduce Dr.
Claudia Fegan. Dr. Mason introduced Dr. Fegan, Associate Chief Medical Officer of ACHN, and announced
that she will be assuming the position of Interim Chief Medical Officer when Dr. Mason assumes the position
of Interim Chief Executive Officer on May 7th. Director Butler requested that Dr. Fegan’s biography be shared
with the Board of Commissioners of Cook County.
Chairman Carvalho noted that he will be abstaining on request numbers 2, 3 and 4. Pursuant to Open Meetings
Act requirements in relation to five-member bodies, which require three affirmative votes on matters by those
members present, these three requests will be presented directly to the System Board for consideration at the
April 29, 2011 Board Meeting, as they will not receive three affirmative votes from those three members
present.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of request numbers 1
through 20, with the exception of request numbers 2, 3 and 4, which will be presented
directly to the Board of Directors for approval, under the Contracts and Procurement
Items and Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
Note: Request number 7 was withdrawn from consideration at the CCHHS Board
of Directors Meeting on April 29, 2011.
C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #4)
This item was considered concurrently with Item IV(B).

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Contract Compliance Update (Attachment #6)
Ms. Hall provided an update regarding Contract Compliance. During the update, she introduced the Deputy
Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance, Paulette Brooks; she indicated that either she or
Ms. Brooks will plan to regularly attend the Finance Committee meetings in the future.
During the discussion of the information provided in the update, Ms. Hall stated that an annual report will be
provided regarding the ongoing review by Contract Compliance of minority and women-owned business
enterprise (MBE/WBE) participation goals met during contract terms; she added that vendors report to the
Office of Contract Compliance on this subject monthly.
Director Golden inquired whether a vendor’s prior contract performance with Cook County, with regard to
MBE/WBE participation, is considered as part of the review of a proposed contract. Ms. Hall stated that this is
not currently reviewed; however, she stated that this can be included in the future as part of the evaluation.
Daniel Howard, System Chief Information Officer, provided additional information regarding the MBE/WBE
participation on the contract with ACS Healthcare. He noted that RL Canning, a MBE/WBE firm, provides
staffing and comprises 37% of the MBE/WBE participation; this amounts to approximately $7.3 million of the
total contract amount.
During the update, the subject of waivers and sole-source contracts was discussed. Chairman Carvalho
requested that more information be provided when a waiver is issued. With regard to sole-source contracts, Ms.
Stith indicated that this is a subject of ongoing review and discussion. She noted that there has been a decrease
in sole-source contracts; she added that there is a more extensive evaluation of the clinical need when a solesource contract is proposed, especially those that are based upon physician preference.
Chairman Carvalho noted that, pursuant to the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy,
all ex-parte communications with regard to inquiries relating to contracts, are required to be logged by the
System’s Supply Chain Management. He inquired whether the County’s Office of Contract Compliance
maintains any similar type logs of contact. Ms. Hall responded that her office has begun logging this type of
contact. She added that, in assisting vendors to identify potential MBE/WBE firms with which the vendor can
partner, no fewer than three referrals are provided.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Presentation of Lawson Financial Statements through February 2011 (Attachment #7)
Chairman Carvalho introduced and welcomed Tariq Malhance, Cook County’s Chief Financial Officer, and
Greg Wass, Cook County’s Chief Information Officer, who were present.
Chairman Carvalho noted at approximately 11:20 A.M. that a quorum was lost; he stated that the Committee
would continue to receive information but would not take action on any remaining items.
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Lawson Financial Statements through February
2011. The Committee discussed the financial statements; further discussion took place on System’s challenges
associated with its multi-year effort to get better financial statement information and to get the enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system in place. Information was provided by Mr. Ayres describing the challenges
relating to the System’s efforts to implement an ERP system.
Mr. Wass provided an update on the County’s activities relating to the review and selection of an ERP system.
He stated that work on this subject started immediately with the new administration; this is a matter of priority
for the administration. He stated that a request for information (RFI) was issued; twenty-one responses were
received. He noted that one of the questions posed in the RFI related to the System’s partial implementation of
the Lawson System; responses to this question were varied. Following the evaluation of the information
received in the responses, a request for proposals is expected to be issued in the next few months, with the
expectation that the project will start by the end of the calendar year. Additionally, Mr. Wass noted that there
are short-term issues that will need to be addressed.

C. Report of Open Market Purchases (Attachment #8)
Ms. Stith presented the Report of Open Market Purchases.
D. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #9)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, the Committee received information on the emergency purchases that have been made.
Also in accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board
Chairman Batts on this matter.

VI. Report from System Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #10)
A. FY2011 Budget Update
Mr. Ayres provided an update on the following subjects: Inpatient Monthly Take Rate; Inpatient Third-Party
Liability (TPL) Rate; Approved Accounts – March; Emergency Department Approved Accounts; Approved
Accounts – Pre- and Post-Expansion; Application Throughput and Inventory Analysis; KPI: Approved
Account Aging; Cook County Approved Inventory; KPI: Remit Dollars; CCHHS Patient Cash Summary;
CCHHS Medicare Cash Deposits; Transformation Benefits Dashboard; Interim Resource and Staff

VI. Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
With regard to the Intergovernmental Agreement with the State regarding the staffing of positions to process
the System’s eligibility applications, Mr. Ayres stated that the State has not yet begun to address the backlog of
inventory; the State’s efforts are primarily to keep up with the applications received. When the State is able to
put the additional resources in place as a result of the Intergovernmental Agreement, the backlog will begin to
reduce. Board Chairman Batts noted that it was his understanding that, under federal law, if a claim is over
twelve months old, it expires. In response, Mr. Ayres stated that the State has approved going back to the prior
months; however, the System will need to submit manual, not electronic, claims. He added that manual claims
are costlier to process.
With regard to the information provided on Interim Resource and Staff Augmentation, Mr. Ayres noted that
this is the commitment that PwC and the subcontractors have made to the System over the last six months;
these are the individuals who should have rolled off three months ago or who have been added subsequently
because the System has not been able to accomplish its goals. The challenge now is to address the problem.
He stated that the System is three months past the point where these individuals should have been gone; PwC is
paying for these resources and trying to figure out how to recoup their component cost when the use of these
resources over an extended period was never really included in the original agreement. Internal discussions
with PwC will need to take place regarding how many of these resources need to be kept for now, and at what
rate. Next month, Mr. Ayres expects to return to the Committee with a recommendation regarding this matter.
Chairman Carvalho recommended that Mr. Ayres provide this information to the Board, along with the
information regarding the Transformation Benefits Dashboard, at the April 29th Board Meeting.
During the presentation of his report, Mr. Ayres stated that he predicts the net revenue shortfall to be between
$40 and 60 million; the next steps are to create the solution to the challenge, as there is a budget balance
requirement. As a result, additional cost reductions or reductions in service mix or program offerings will need
to be discussed.
The Committee discussed the subject of outplacement of coding services; Mr. Ayres stated that plan anticipates
the outplacement to occur in approximately five months. He added that discussions with the unions are
expected to take place to see whether the current internal coders can meet some industry standards with regard
to productivity and quality; if some agreement on this can be reached, the System may reconsider the
outplacement plans. The intent is to move as many resources into an outsourced vendor. Chairman Carvalho
noted that the current productivity level of System coders, compared to national standards, is approximately
50%. John Morales, Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided
additional information on the subject. He indicated that the System has invested in the training and education
of the coders to attain certification; two of approximately forty coders have become certified as a result of this
investment, bringing the total number of certified System coders to eight. Following discussion, Mr. Ayres
stated that he will provide an analysis of the matter.

 Key Findings
 Overtime is heavily utilized to accommodate for:
 long standing vacancies due limited ability to hire during displacement
period
 FMLA/LOA usage
 high usage of non-productive time
 inflexibility with scheduling
 unmanaged overtime
 Excessive reliance on overtime across all pay periods; averaging 484.29
overtime FTEs per pay period
 Limited staff reductions from pay period 1 to pay period 7; most individuals
affected in displacement process moved into vacant positions
 Pay period 2 & 5 showed significant use of overtime to accommodate for
vacation, holidays and blizzard
 FTE per AOB measure is only a directional indicator of opportunity

 FTE per AOB
Definition- measures the number of full-time employees per each
occupied acute bed; this indicator measures staffing levels in
relationship to hospital inpatient and outpatient activity
Interpretation- A high value indicates many employees per bed. A
low value indicates a few employees per bed. Very high values may
indicate low volume and a potential opportunity to evaluate staff
productivity. Very low values may indicate high volume or a high
level of staff productivity.
Formula- FTE per AOB = Total FTE / Adjusted Occupied Bed (AOB)
AOB = Adjusted Patient Days / Days in Period
Adjusted Patient Days = Patient Days / IP%
IP% = Inpatient Revenue / Total Revenue
Page 18 of 180

10

 FTE per AOB- Methodology
890 Bureau Allocation- assigned 890 departments to operating
units based upon utilization (e.g. human resources, risk
management, lab, administration)
SNF and Rehab – excluded both revenue and expense associated
with measurement
Physicians and Mid-Level Providers– excluded both revenue and
expense associated with physicians and mid-level providers
ACHN and Specialty Clinics– excluded both revenue and expense
of all within measure

Page 19 of 180

11

 FTE per AOB- Limitations
Contract Labor Inclusion- currently awaiting contract labor policy
adoption that will require electronic recording of contract labor
productive hours
Revenue – not capturing all charges penalizes this measurement
Data Capture Timing – revenue captured is one month in arrears;
FTE data is current pay period
Case Mix Index (CMI) Adjusted – calculation is not currently
adjusted for case mix

 Resources Needed  for Recruiting and Retention to Address 
Challenges and Sustain Improvements:
Challenges We Face:
Challenges We Face:

Resources Needed To Address Challenges: 
Needed To Address Challenges:

BRAND ‐ Candidates withdrawing from consideration because of
perception of instability due to negative press such as: Nursing Layoffs ,
Snow Bonus Controversy, Ceasing of Ambulance Runs at Provident
Hospital, Vision 2015 impact on services throughout CCHHS, Cook
Countyy Budget
g Cuts, Furlough
g Days,
y Leadership
p Turnover

FUNDING: In order to take control of CCHHS’ image in the marketplace and
proactively tell a more positive story we are working to create a stronger
partnership with CCHHS’ Public Relations Team. In addition, we are working to
establish a relationship with a recruitment advertising and communications firm
that will create marketingg materials for external recruitingg and assist with
establishing our digital footprint in the market place.

COMPENSATION‐ Philosophy to offer at or below the 50th percentile
limits CCHHS's ability to attract top qualified candidates for critical fill
roles. The maximum increase of 10% for current employees creates
compression, and fairness issues when external candidates come in at
higher salary than incumbents.

FUNDING: The 10% increase is consistent with sound compensation practices
however, the majority of our employees are functioning in roles that pays well
below 50% of the market. Additional incentives such as a sign on bonus or
retention bonus to attract and retain top industry talent and/or a Pay for
Performance compensation structure will help attract and retain talent while
meeting key operational goals..

TECHNOLOGY ‐ The lack of technology is limiting the ability to manage
position control accurately, which makes the recruitment cycle
inefficient. Our ability to manage requisitions, the volume of candidate
activity is strained and often untimely given the technological
inadequacies.

TALEO: To reduce manual steps, the number of people who touch the process,
processing time, and allow for a more refined candidate pool; this will enable
automated tracking and reporting to manage hiring manager and candidate
communication to mitigate “black
black hole effect
effect”.
HRIS SYSTEM: Interface between budget and HR, provide accurate
compensation and workforce profile data , proactively address compression and
equity based on up to date and reliable information.
ONLINE SKILLS ASSESSMENT: To evaluate candidate skills or competencies.

Q
QUALITY
CANDIDATES‐ Candidates have learned to work around the
pre‐screening questions in order to qualify for the position. Time is
spent validating applicant submissions and phone interviewing
unqualified candidates who have “gamed“ the system. Our average
ratio of eligible applicants to number of submissions is 20% per job.

FUNDING: To subscribe to selected p
professional p
publications and obtain
institutional memberships to professional associations in order to gain access to
member only Job Boards to access higher quality candidates who may not go to
CCHHS website to find posted jobs.

TIME TO FILL ‐ Technology and current process requirements hinders
the Talent Management Team’s ability to expediently fill positions.

FUNDING: Training for hiring managers on Taleo and computer literacy in order
to increase their accountability/efficiency in process.

RELATIONSHIPS‐ Internal and external relationships (ex: stakeholders,
unions) need to be developed and/or strengthened. Hiring managers
have become less available or less willing to participate as interviewers
due to the large number of hours required and competing priorities.

STAFFING: Labor/Management Committee for Staffing, Recruitment and
Retention with representatives from Unions, staff and management to improve
relationships and ownership in recruiting and retention process and reduce
vacancy rates.

NON-COMPETITIVE SELECTION METHODOLOGY: [SOLE SOURCE]
N/A
PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
Previous service was supported by multiple numbers of suppliers across CCHHS with non co-terminus contract
periods. Each agreement varied in service level delivery and satisfaction.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
The proposed contract is the result of an extensive and highly competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process
involving five different vendors. Vendor presentations and proposals Were reviewed by a Selection Committee
consisting of 15 multi-disciplinary members who evaluated the submissions based on a criteria matrix which included
each providers current capabilities and ability to support Key Performance Indicators as expected under the new
contract service levels. The team narrowed its selection to Aramark Healthcare based on the lowest pricing structure
and service level commitment of any of the other vendors, it was determined that Ararmark Healthcare submitted the
most comprehensive RFP. Based on these factors the selection committee voted unanimously to recommend the
future contract to be awarded to Aramark Healthcare.
The new agreement will become a CCHHS system agreement; Aramark Healthcare would continue to service
CCHHS and transition Provident Hospital, Oak Forest Hospital, and Cermak Health Services into the program. The
proposed agreement will build upon the already existing Medical Equipment Management program that is currently in
place. It will provide Clinical Engineering services across CCHHS. The program will continue to be centralized at
Stroger Hospital. Aramark Healthcare has also built a detailed transition plan for the additional facilities to yield a
seamless transition of service.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
This contract provides all computer equipment needed for Cook County Health and Hospitals System. The
amendment and increase is needed due to end user devices that require replacement to support the increased
demands of throughput. Included in this amendment will be upgrades to servers and end user devices that have
reached their lifespan and no longer support the current application demands. The increase in end user utilization
frequently causes slow response times and reduced productivity. Current utilization has 1, 700 to 1,800 users
accessing the current system with degradation experience experienced during peak shift times. This increase
includes server hardware, additional storage for clinical systems, and end user devices (computers, printers, laptops
and monitors).

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
In May 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners renamed the Cook County
Health Facilities as the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS).
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the CCHHS with an overview of the financial activities and financial
activities for the month ended January 31, 2011. This discussion focuses on the
significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH); Oak
Forest Hospital (OFH); Provident Hospital (PHCC); the Department of Public Health
(DPH); the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN); the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS); and Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide
primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their
ability to pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and
policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
SUMMARY OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The Cook County Health and Hospital Systems continues to undertake significant
restructuring with a focus on operational efficiency so that the system can better fulfill its
mission of serving the health care needs of the region. Effective in July, 2010 CCBHHS
engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers as its revenue cycle vendor to re-engineer the
revenue cycle process and to improve efficiencies within the expenditure process.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the two months with overall
revenue of $225,235 and overall expenses was $180,991.
Net Patient revenue for the two months was $170,688.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $585. Other revenue consists primarily of parking and cafeteria
revenue.

 Accounts Receivable - January 2011
Accounts Receivable at the end of January was 17.8 million dollars higher than at the end
of December 2010. This was an increase of 3.5% and was due to a number of factors.
The System implemented a new single platform patient accounting system in December.
Most of the billing from the new system was delayed until January to insure that bills
were correct prior to sending them to the third party payers. There continued to be billing
from the three legacy systems in December and there were additional collections from
those legacy system billings. The delay in the billing was partially responsible for the
increase in outstanding accounts receivable.
In addition to the billing delays that were associated with the implementation of the new
single platform patient accounting system charges for patient services were increased at
the beginning of the new fiscal year. This was done to bring amounts charged up to
charge levels at other area facilities. Increasing charges will increase the gross dollars of
accounts receivable outstanding after the price increase.
There are also some seasonal issues that tend to impact the collection of healthcare
receivables that are the result of the holidays in December. The two holidays reduce the
amount of hospital and intermediary staff time that is available to process the receivables
through the system.
At the end of November the System had approximately 239 days of revenue outstanding.
At the end of December the System had an estimated 230 days of revenue outstanding
and by the end of January the days of revenue outstanding were down to 208 days of
revenue outstanding. This was a favorable trend, but outstanding accounts receivable
were still in excess of industry standards.

Operating Expenses at the end of two months was $180,991 broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $104,895
Benefits - $23,862
Supplies - $20,043
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $16,523
Depreciation - $6,048
Utilities - $699
Insurance - $8,921
Nonoperating Revenue was $53,962. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $28,927 and property tax in the amount of $13,658.

 Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
In May 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners renamed the Cook County
Health Facilities as the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS).
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the CCHHS with an overview of the financial activities and financial
activities for the month ended February 28, 2011. This discussion focuses on the
significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current month. It
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of the
CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH); Oak
Forest Hospital (OFH); Provident Hospital (PHCC); the Department of Public Health
(DPH); the Ambulatory and Community Health Nethreerk (ACHN); the Bureau of
Health Services (BHS); and Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities
provide primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard
to their ability to pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning,
and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
SUMMARY OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The Cook County Health and Hospital Systems continues to undertake significant
restructuring with a focus on operational efficiency so that the system can better fulfill its
mission of serving the health care needs of the region. Effective in July, 2010 CCBHHS
engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers as its revenue cycle vendor to re-engineer the
revenue cycle process and to improve efficiencies within the expenditure process.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the three months with overall
revenue of $314,023 and overall expenses was $257,953.
Net Patient revenue for the three months was $239,216.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $809. Other revenue consists primarily of parking and cafeteria
revenue.

 Accounts receivable increased by the end of February from the levels at the end of
January by 18.5 million dollars or 3.5%. The February level of unbilled inpatient claims
declined by over 3 million dollars from month end January. The billed inpatient claims
increased by 12.4 million dollars. Some of the increase in billed accounts receivable
maybe the result of the delays in December and January associated with the
implementation of the single platform patient accounting system. The combination of a
reduction in unbilled claims and an increase in the billed claims should result in a lower
outstanding inpatient receivable in the coming months.
Outpatient accounts receivable had a slightly different pattern from that of inpatient in
February as compared to January. There was an increase in unbilled outpatient accounts
of 1.2 million dollars or approximately 4%. The billed outpatient accounts receivable
increased by 8.5 million dollars or 5.6%. Some of the dollars of the increase are the
result of the charge increase that was implemented at the beginning of the new fiscal
year.
February accounts receivable in general increased from the level at the end of January.
At the end of February there were 220 days of revenue outstanding. This is an increase
of 12 days or 5.8% of out standing days of revenue from the level at the end of January.
The level of outstanding accounts receivable is higher than it should be as compared to
other facilities. Some of the outstanding accounts receivable may be the result of
unprocessed claims for Medicaid coverage and an additional backlog of unpaid Medicaid
claims. The System is taking steps to address these two problems with the goal of
bringing outstanding accounts receivable down to industry standards.
Operating Expenses at the end of three months was $257,953 broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $144,230
Benefits - $34,222
Supplies - $29,206
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $26,386
Depreciation - $9,101
Utilities - $1,428
Insurance - $13,381
Nonoperating Revenue was $73,998. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $43,402 and property tax in the amount of $13,658.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Page 136 of 180

 This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

BRIEFING NOTE
Development of Extramural Funding:
Proposal to Establish a Centralized Sponsored Programs Administration at CCHHS
Background
CCHHS currently participates in externally funded programs totalling $50 million a year to provide clinical
care and undertake clinical research at CCHHS facilities. These programs enable CCHHS to deliver care
beyond what is reimbursed by other sources. For example; HIV/AIDS care at CORE Center, public health
programs and cutting edge novel therapeutics and diagnostic procedures.
CCHHS does not provide centralized financial oversight, development or support for extramural sponsored
programs. The vast majority of these functions are currently provided by an outside organization, the
Hektoen Institute of Medical Research. Although the relationship with Hektoen is long-standing, it does not
represent the most advantageous or effective model for CCHHS to expand and strengthen its sponsored
programs. Rather, CCHHS would be better served by pursuing internal capabilities to make grant
applications, monitor performance and issue reports to support individual clinicians who wish to be involved
in clinical research.
CCHHS needs to supplement the efforts of its highly effective Institutional Review Board which monitors
human subject protection, by providing strong central oversight of the grants that are being operated at
CCHHS.
As part of the transformation project started in the second half of 2010 a workgroup was established
comprising several senior clinical faculty and administrators. Their charge was to look at the way
extramurally sponsored programs are currently conducted at CCHHS and to make recommendations for
improvements.
Infrastructure Enhancement for Targeted Funding Opportunity
The workgroup examined the current internal and outsourced infrastructure of the administration of
extramural sponsored programs. The workgroup determined that while Hektoen provided meaningful
benefits that reduce certain administrative burdens, as an independent entity Hektoen does not adequately
promote CCHHS's objectives of establishing greater financial responsibility, regulatory compliance and
accountability and of fostering aligned growth.
The workgroup conducted an analysis of current grant availability and discovered that, from the main
federal sources alone, there were over 1,300 active RFAs (Request For Applications) on offer, of which at
least one-third were appropriate for consideration by CCHHS. This list was refined further by consideration
of CCHHS's current strengths and centers of excellence.
The result was a targeted list of 100 grant opportunities worth over $200 million in total over the lifetime of
the awards equating to $50 million a year in additional funding to CCHHS. Since conducting that analysis
several more highly relevant RFAs have been published and a number of RFAs have expired and been
reissued. The availability of suitable grants does not appear to be limiting the growth of CCHHS's portfolio
of sponsored programs.
Proposed Future Operating Model
The workgroup proposes a future operating model that would facilitate the pursuit of targeted grants and
ease their operation once awarded, without impinging on the current processes that are succeeding and
without being burdensome to faculty.
The future operating model adds two new management entities to forge a strong collaboration between the
administrative and clinical professionals at CCHHS that will be focused on acquiring and operating new
sponsored grants.
1) Sponsored Programs Committee: SPC will include clinical faculty and senior administrators. The
mission of this Committee is to identify, encourage, and actively support extramurally funded
Page 179 of 180

 projects, to foster collaboration, and to ensure alignment of activities with the mission and values of
CCHHS.

/

2) Extramural Funding Administration: EFA will provide day to day financial and operating
management of sponsored programs conducted at CCHHS. The EFA will report to the CFO and will
be led by a three person team with the following primary functions;
•

Manage internal and outsourced grant accounting and administration.

•

Work with external fiscal agents and collaborators on pre-award and post-award responsibilities.

•

Assist investigators in writing non-technical portions of grants

•

Develop and maintain a repository of needed demographic data on CCHHS facilities I patients,
proformas and precedent documents to facilitate grant writing.

•

Develop budgets for protocols/programs.

•

Streamline and track internal approvals.

•

Facilitate the operation of institutional research policies such as protected time and distribution of
Indirect Costs recovered from sponsors.
These additional resources will be funded from incremental indirect cost recoveries generated from more
efficient revenue capture on existing grants and the increased volume of extramural sponsorship.
In support of these new procedural elements new policies will be established and existing policies relating
to research at CCHHS will be reviewed and updated if necessary.
Collaborations

The workgroup also identified the need for an improved framework for collaboration with academic
institutions locally, regionally and nationally. CCHHS already participates in a number of national
cooperative research programs and this is a trend that is actively encouraged by grant sponsoring
institutions. CCHHS is exploring the expansion of a number of our existing collaborations.
Fiduciary Agents

As CCHHS develops its infrastructure it will still need to continue using third party fiscal agents to assist in
carrying out extramural sponsored programs. However, improved CCHHS infrastructure will allow us to
ensure greater qualification, transparency and control of external fiscal agents. To this end we anticipate
issuing a Request For Information/Qualifications to identify multiple entities to fulfil these critical functions.
Next Steps
The workgroup is working with legal and financial representatives to finalize the operational details in order
to proceed with:
i.
Implementing the physician workgroup recommendations to permit the pursuit and operation of a
significantly increased level of sponsored funding.

ii.

Seeking new improved relationships with fiscal agents to secure managerial and financial
efficiencies in the operation of sponsored programs.
