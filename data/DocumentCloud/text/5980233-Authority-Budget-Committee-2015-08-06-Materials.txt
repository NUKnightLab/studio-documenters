1.

The Authority should strive to maximize the use of available

2.

The Authority's decision to award federal funds should have a
foundation in the best available research, evaluation, practice and
professional advice.

3.

The Authority's decision to award federal funds should be
considerate of the balance of resources across the justice system
and its potential impact in other areas of the system.

4.

The Authority's federal funds should not result in the duplication of
efforts already in place.

5.

The Authority's federal funds cannot be used to supplant other
funds.

6.

The Authority's federal funds should be allocated (a) to areas
demonstrating need based on an analysis of the nature and extent of
the problem(s), and (b) to programs in areas where there is an
opportunity to impact the identified problem(s).

 Federal Funds Administered by the Authority
Formula Awards
Federal Formula awards are funds which the State receives a calculated share of the
total available fund. The calculation of these shares is based on different formulas
defined by the enabling legislation. Among the factors commonly used in these formulas
include state population and Part 1 violent crime statistics.
Discretionary Awards
Federal discretionary awards are targeted funds for which eligible agencies compete.
Applications for these competitive awards must identify the agencies that will receive
grant funds and provide detailed program plans and line item budgets. Grants made from
these awards are considered sole source procurements under the State of Illinois Grant
Accountability and Transparency Act.!Any modification to the budgets or program plans
requires explicit federal approval.

 Formula Funds

Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG) – Formula
Award
The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program is the primary
provider of federal criminal justice funding to state and local jurisdictions. The JAG
Program provides states and units of local governments with critical funding necessary to
support a range of program areas including law enforcement, prosecution and court
programs, prevention and education programs, corrections and community corrections,
drug treatment and enforcement, crime victim and witness initiatives, and planning,
evaluation, and technology improvement programs.
2013 – 2015 ICJIA established priorities
1. Law Enforcement:
Support programs which provide law enforcement agencies throughout the state with
the necessary means to deter, combat, and investigate crime through strategies,
staffing, training, and equipment that promotes public safety and the common good.
2. Courts, Prosecution, Defense and Community Corrections:
Support and enhance court initiatives, including specialty courts, that contribute to the
effectiveness and efficiency of the criminal justice court system in all its facets—the
judiciary, clerks, prosecution, defense, and probation.
3. Prevention and Intervention:
Support proven and innovative prevention and intervention programs for young
people at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system. These programs should
address recognized risk factors, enhance protective factors and help young people
avoid involvement with violent crime, drugs, gangs, guns and other criminal
behavior. In setting priorities for JAG funding, recognize that ICJIA’s primary source
of prevention and intervention funds is state violence prevention funding rather than
JAG.
4. State Corrections:
Support programs which allow state and local correctional facilities to apply proven
and innovative programs to assist in meeting the needs of incarcerated persons and to
maintain the safety and security of the institution, staff and inmate population.
5. Justice Information Sharing:
Support efforts to implement integrated justice information systems throughout the
state to ensure that each component of the criminal justice system has access to
timely, complete, and accurate information necessary to inform decision-making at
each stage of the criminal justice process.
6. Recidivism Reduction:

6

 Support proven and innovative programs targeted to address recognized risk factors
and augment protective factors to reduce recidivism among those already involved in
the criminal justice system, those on community supervision, or those incarcerated,
allowing them successful community reentry as law-abiding and contributing
members of society.
7. Justice Research and Evaluation:
Support research and other programs that contribute to knowledge about crime, its
causes, prevention and deterrence and about the needs of victims, offenders with
mental illness and or substance abuse issues, and other special populations to ensure
that such knowledge is made available to policy makers and practitioners.
Eligible grantees: State, county, and local agencies and, under certain limited conditions,
private non-profit organizations.
Matching funds: JAG does not require a matching funds contribution, but current
Authority policy requires a 25% cash match. The Budget Committee may approve a
matching funds hardship waiver when specifically requested.

records of protective orders, convictions for misdemeanors involving domestic violence
and stalking, records of mental health adjudications.

 Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program (PDNAT)
– Discretionary Award
The Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program (PDNAT) helps defray
the costs associated with post-conviction DNA testing of forcible rape, murder, and nonnegligent manslaughter cases in which actual innocence might be demonstrated. Funds
may be used to review such post-conviction cases and to locate and analyze biological
evidence associated with these cases.
Postconviction DNA testing has received considerable attention in recent years. Since the
advent of forensic DNA analysis, a number of people convicted of crimes have been
subsequently exonerated through DNA analysis of crime scene evidence that was not
tested at the time of trial. Additionally, newer technologies have substantially increased
the successful DNA analysis of aged, degraded, limited, or otherwise compromised
biological evidence. As a result, crime scene samples once thought to be unsuitable for
testing in the past may now yield DNA profiles. Samples that previously generated
inconclusive DNA results may now be amenable to reanalysis using newer methods.
The Authority has successfully applied for PDNAT funds on behalf of the University of
Illinois at Springfield and the Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney. Before 2014,
only State Administering Agencies were eligible to apply for SORNA funds. Grantees
now may apply directly for these discretionary funds.
Eligible grantees: State, county, local agencies private non-profit organizations.
Matching funds: No matching funds are required.
