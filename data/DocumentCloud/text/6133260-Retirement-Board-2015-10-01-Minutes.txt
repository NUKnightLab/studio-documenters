3. Trustee Matters
a. Forest Preserve Annuitant Candidate Review and Approval
Nickol R. Hackett Executive Director & CIO, stated that the Fund had received notice from
two persons who expressed an interest in being considered for appointment to the unexpired
term of the Forest Preserve District Annuitant member position which was currently vacant.
Ms. Hackett stated that immediately prior to the Board meeting one candidate withdrew her
request for consideration due to a sudden illness that arose that day and her inability to make
a presentation.
The remaining candidate, Joseph Nevius, was present and was ready to
address the Board.
Mr. Joseph Nevius addressed the Board and stated that he had been an employee of the
Forest Preserve District for nearly 38 years in various roles from landscape architect to
management. He retired in 2003 and the last position he held was as the General
Superintendent of the Forest Preserve District. Mr. Nevius stated that because of the benefits
he received as an employee, he felt a responsibility to contribute. He added that he has
been impressed with what the Board has accomplished and believes that he has the capability
to make additional contributions. Upon inquiry by the trustees, Mr. Nevius acknowledged
that his fiduciary responsibility as a trustee would extend to both the County and the Forest
Funds. He further stated that he leaves the area during winter months and is unavailable to
attend meetings in person, but could be available for remote participation via telephone.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Board
convene an Executive Session pursuant to Section 2(c)(3) of the Open Meetings Act and as is
consistent with Section 9-187(a) of the Illinois Pension Code, to discuss the appointment of
a candidate to fill the vacant Forest Preserve Annuitant position.

Seven trustees having voted “Aye”, and Trustee Richardson responding
“Present”, the MOTION WAS ADOPTED.

b. Status Report from Independent Election Administrator – Informational, no motion required
The Executive Director stated that the Independent Election Administrator (“IEA”) provided
a letter dated September 18, 2015, reporting on the status of the trustee elections scheduled
for October 28, 2015. The deadline for filing nominating petitions was September 4, 2015.
The Executive Director reported that Diahann Goode was the only candidate who filed a
nominating petition for the Office of the Cook County Employee Member Trustee. Frank
Tonovich and Patrick J. McFadden filed petitions for the office of the Cook County
Annuitant Member Trustee. Samuel Richardson, Jr. and Dennis White filed petitions for the
office of the Forest Preserve District Employee Member Trustee. No one challenged the
sufficiency of any of the nominating petitions.
4. Administrative Report
a. Cyber Insurance
The Executive Director stated that because of the increased use of electronic transmissions,
the Fund’s data was more vulnerable to compromise than in the past. In the event of a
breach, the Fund would be obligated to notify members of the occurrence and could be
further liable for damages. The current liability policies the Fund maintains only provide
minimal coverage for this possible exposure. She noted that employee benefit plans are
increasingly obtaining cyber liability insurance to cover potential exposures and that the
Fund staff had obtained a proposal for privacy and network security (cyber) insurance.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Nester that the proposal for a
Privacy and Network Security (Cyber) Liability Insurance made by Beazley Insurance Co.,
be accepted at an annual premium not to exceed $4,000 upon the terms presented. It is
further moved that the Fund’s staff and legal counsel take all action reasonably necessary to
effectuate the foregoing including the execution and delivery of related written documents on
behalf of the Fund by the Executive Director.

5. Finance Report
a. Fourth Quarter Cash Flow Report

County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County
Forest Preserve District Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County
p. 4

 Michael Maratea, Director of Finance and Administration reported on the fourth quarter cash
needs for both the County and the Forest Funds. He reported that the County Fund required
$140 million and that the Forest Fund required $4.7 million to be withdrawn to cover the
projected cash shortfalls for each of the Funds through December, 2015. The Executive
Director & CIO said that in 2015, the Fund will have liquidated more assets than it received
in contributions in order to pay benefits which will result in a more accelerated erosion of the
funded status.
The trustees asked about the status of the discussions with Cook County about a possible
Intergovernmental Agreement (“IGA”) to provide a framework through which sales tax
revenue could be transferred to the Fund. Mary Pat Burns, Fund counsel, stated that she had
responded to an IGA proposed by the County and expected to receive the County’s response
shortly. Trustee Fitzgerald stated that the IGA was not the appropriate strategy to address the
decreasing funded status. He stated that the Board should draft a letter to the County Board,
the unions, the legislature, editorial boards and the Fund’s membership seeking changes in
the Pension Code so that the County would be required to pay actuarial required
contributions and that such funding could be permitted from any source. Trustee Goode
stated that the matter could go before the Board’s Legislative Committee. Trustee
Lewandowski suggested that the Board develop a strategy for the approach, but stated that no
meeting of the Legislative Committee was scheduled to occur.
It was noted that a single payment under the proposed IGA would not change the funding
status. Mary Pat Burns acknowledged that a continued cash flow deficit will have a negative
impact on the funded liability. She further noted that the Board has a fiduciary duty to
advocate for adequate funding that could be addressed by the Legislative Committee, but that
the Fund’s current funding status, while trending downward, had not decreased to a level that
required immediate action. In response to an inquiry from Trustee Lewandowski as to when
the Fund needed to act, Ms. Burns reminded the trustees that the Illinois Supreme Court
suggested in the In Re Pension Litigation matter that it would consider a direct action by a
public pension fund against a plan sponsor for funding at the point where the pension fund
considered itself 'diminished or impaired." Ms. Burns further noted that the Court did not
address what that meant exactly.
Trustee Fitzgerald stated that the Board needed a strategy to deal with the decreasing
unfunded status apart from the IGA. He stated that the law needed to be changed to provide
for adequate funding. He also stated that a letter should be prepared for the County Board
communicating the dire nature of the economic situation of the Fund. The trustees noted that
the Fund has proposed legislation in the past which would require the County to make
actuarial required contributions sufficient to support the needs of the Fund. Mr. Fitzgerald
stated that the Fund’s legislative liaison be asked to resubmit such proposed legislation. He
added that the Board should prepare a letter to update members about the funded status and
would like such a draft to be prepared for the Board’s November meeting. The Fund staff
were directed to prepare a draft communication to stakeholder groups.
There being no further discussion, it was moved by Trustee Richardson and seconded by
Trustee Goode that the County Fund shall have authority to withdraw cash in an aggregate

 amount not to exceed $140 million to cover projected expenses through December 31, 2015,
and that the Fund staff be authorized to take all action reasonably necessary to effectuate the
foregoing.

b. Fraud Prevention Status
The Executive Director stated that the Better Government Association (“BGA”) had recently
served Freedom of Information Requests on public pension funds, including the Fund,
requesting information about the efforts made to recover overpayments and the BGA
reported their findings. The Director of Finance reviewed the status of the Fund’s efforts to
reach out to its members to verify that they were still eligible to receive annuity benefits.
Ms. Burns, Fund counsel, noted that pension funds rely upon the Social Security
Administration’s death match file to ascertain whether annuitants’ deaths have been reported,
but that the number of deaths reported to the SSA has been decreasing. The State of Illinois
has its own death reporting data, but the reports are not available to public pension funds.
The public pension funds have attempted, through the Department of Insurance, to obtain
access to that date, but those efforts have not yet been successful.
6. Legal Matters
a. In the Matter of Adusumilli – Recommendation of Hearing Officer
Margaret Fahrenbach, Legal Advisor, presented the Recommendation of the Hearing Officer
in regard to Chowdary Adusumilli’s request that he be allowed to purchase unused sick time
more than 30 days after the separated from County employment. She stated that the Hearing

 Officer found that because the member had not complied with the requirement of Section 9220 of the Pension Code, he could not purchase unused sick time.
It was moved by Trustee Lewandowski and seconded by Trustee Goode that the Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law recommended by the Hearing Officer be adopted and that the
Board reaffirm its earlier decision that Chowdary Adusumilli was not eligible to purchase
unused sick time because he had not met the requirements of Section 9-220 of the Illinois
Pension Code. It is further moved that this is a final administrative decision within the
meaning of Section 9-236 of the Illinois Pension Code.

b. Jackson v. CEAB – Status
Ms. Fahrenbach stated that the Illinois Appellate Court had affirmed a decision by the Circuit
Court holding that Mr. Lawrence Jackson was eligible for ordinary disability benefits
from the Fund while he had been employed by an Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund
(“IMRF”) employer. The Board had determined that he was not eligible for ordinary
disability benefits because of his IMRF employment and Mr. Jackson appealed. The
decision was based upon Supreme CourtRule 23 and does not have value as precedent,
except in limited circumstances.
c. Reciprocal Annuity Forfeiture
Paul Rzeszutko, Director of Benefits, stated that the Fund was recently advised by the Illinois
Municipal Retirement Fund that it had revoked the annuity benefits paid to Robert G. Healy
because he had been convicted of a felony related to his employment. Mr. Healy received
benefits from the Fund under the Reciprocal Act based upon his service with the IMRF
employer. Because he was no longer eligible for annuity benefits based upon his IMRF
service, the Fund was required to recalculate his benefits. Since Mr. Healy had only 6 years
and 7 months of County service, he was only entitled to a refund of contributions. The total
annuity benefits Mr. Healy received exceeded the contributions he paid; accordingly there is
no further refund due to him.
It was moved by Trustee McFadden and seconded by Trustee Goode, due to the
determination made by the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund (“IMRF”) that Robert G.
Healy was not eligible for annuity benefits from IMRF pursuant to Section 7-219 of the
Illinois Pension Code, that any benefits due to him from the County Fund under the
Retirement Systems Reciprocal Act, 40 ILCS 5/20-101 et seq., be adjusted as presented,
including but not limited to, the recovery of any overpayments.

by Segal Company. The 2016 health plan expenses are projected to increase by 11.1% over
