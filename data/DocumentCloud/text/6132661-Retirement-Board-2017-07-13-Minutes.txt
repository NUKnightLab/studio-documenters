The meeting was called to order. The Executive Director reviewed the voting procedures and
election timeline with the Board members present. Ms. Tuczak noted that this is a Special
Election, as Trustee Michael Lappe will be retiring, mandatory retirement, effective July 23,
2017. The Pension Statutes require that an election be held within thirty days of the vacancy.
Executive Director Tuczak informed the Board that nominating petitions have been filed by four
candidates for the Trustee member of Patrolman, Investigator or rank equivalent thereto, for the
Retirement Board of the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago.
The Election Committee members have reviewed the petitions submitted. Ms. Hylton indicated
that fifty or more signatures were verified as active police officers for each candidate. Draft
copies of the ballots were distributed for review by Board members.
With respect to the Trustee member of Patrolman, Investigator or rank equivalent thereto, based
upon the validations of the petition submissions and timing of the submissions, the Election
Committee has a proposed ballot which lists Tom Beyna first on the ballot; Kathy McCall
second on the ballot; Steve Robbins listed third; and Mike Shields listed fourth.
There were no further public comments.
It was moved by Trustee Avila and seconded by Trustee Summers, that the submitted ballot for
