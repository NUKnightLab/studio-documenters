Funding Source: Road and Bridge
Thomas Pavich and Michael Chambers, Department of Public Works, presented. Dale Miller asked if this
process will be simpler once the Enterprise Resource Planning System is fully implemented.
Trevor McAleer asked if the department would need to return for approval to increase the amount if the
threshold is met for any vendor on the approved list; asked if an exemption already exists for legal
advertisement as the Plain Dealer is listed as one of the vendors included in this process and commented
that he was not aware that a threshold was set for the Plain Dealer as they are the only option for
advertising.

Lenora Lockett clarified that the action taken by the Board for legal advertisements was an exemption
from a bidding process that capped each advertisement at $2,500.00 rather than a cumulative amount
but does not exempt approval for the purchase by the Board. Ms. Lockett elaborated on the County Code
20

 requirements as it relates to bidding and approval processes and clarified Mr. Pavich’s presentation that
most advertisements for construction projects exceed $1,000.00.
Mr. McAleer asked what the advantage to approving this request for $15,000.00 for advertising services
would be and when would a department order need to be submitted for approval; and asked if this
process satisfies the Fiscal Office requirements.
Angela Rich said her office has been working with Public Works and other agencies to permit a blanket
purchase order, per vendor where multiple, individual payments under $500.00 each can be made against
the encumbered amount of the blanket purchase order; provided clarification that the Ohio Revised Code
requires purchases over $1,000.00, per vendor, be encumbered and said that this process will comply with
those requirements. Ms. Rich cautioned that this process will be lengthy in the new Enterprise Resource
Planning System during phase 1, which encompasses requisitions and purchase orders, but will address
situations like this and believes it will be an improvement.
Nan Baker asked for clarification that items will not come to the Board of Control for approval as long as
the total amount, per vendor is not exceeded, as well as clarification on the difference between the new
and current processes.
Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Michael Chambers seconded. Item BC2019-184 was
unanimously approved.
BC2019-185
Department of Public Works, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1800188 with HNTB Ohio, Inc.

Greg Huth, Department of Development, presented. Nan Baker asked for clarification that this loan is for
renovation only and not for additional units. Trevor McAleer asked if additional HOME Loan funds remain,
and what the amount is, after approval of these 3 loans. Mr. Huth indicated that he will research and
provide a response to the Board members. Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Nan Baker
seconded. Item BC2019-189 was unanimously approved.

for advertisement of Public Notices for the period 11/16/2018 – 12/31/2018.
Funding Source: Community Development Block Grant
Greg Huth, Department of Development, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the $1,000.00 threshold for
payments to vendors is by department or the County as a whole and asked if the $1,000.00 maximum for
2019 has been reached for this vendor; Angela Rich responded by stating that the maximum cap is by
vendor, not department and that the maximum has been reached for the Plain Dealer for 2019. Mr.
McAleer asked if an exemption and encumbrance of funds will be required for any department advertising
for bids, even if they are below $500.00, since that threshold has been reached. Angela Rich stated that
is correct and that during checks runs, the Fiscal Office staff flags vouchers for vendors whose threshold
22

 has been reached and contacts the department to explain the appropriate process. Armond Budish
motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-190 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-191
Department of Information Technology, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1500238 with
Advanced Server Management Group, Inc. for professional security consulting services for the period

Funding Source: General Fund
Jeanelle Greene and Jeremy Mio, Department of Information Technology, presented. Nan Baker asked
why a new contract was not prepared, as it would be expected that services would continue past the
remaining 4 months and result in a cost increase; asked if the additional funds and services were
anticipated in 2018 and whether $50,000.00 is adequate to achieve security-related goals. Trevor McAleer
asked if the policy referred to in the department’s presentation was the Disaster Recovery Plan and
indicated that this plan was brought up during the State audits for multiple years. Mr. McAleer also asked
if the contract will provide the County with a plan that will satisfy the State Auditor’s requirements.
Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-191 was unanimously
approved.
BC2019-192

 C. – Exemptions
BC2019-200
Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department, recommending an alternative procurement process on RQ44198,
which will result in an award recommendation to Daily Legal News for legal advertisements of Notice of
Foreclosure Sale for delinquent land taxes for the period 10/1/2018 - 4/30/2023 in accordance with Ohio
Revised Code Section 2329.26.
Funding Source: General Fund
Sergeant Joe Greiner and Alison Bilak, Sheriff’s Department, presented. Nan Baker asked why a not-toexceed amount is not being requested, as there is historical data available for the cost of advertising these
notices and asked if it is unusual to not include a dollar amount for this type of request. Lenora Lockett
stated it is a preference and strongly encouraged to include an amount when the amount can be
determined so that the contracting authority understands the financial impact; said that a conservative
value can be set and if that amount is exceeded, the department would bring forth an amendment to
increase the amount, if that is the Board’s recommendation. Trevor McAleer commented that his
preference would be to post notices on-line as opposed to print, to save money, but acknowledged that
is not possible, due to Ohio Revised Code requirements. Armond Budish commented that attempts were
made in Columbus, when he served in the House of Representatives, to change this requirement, but
were unsuccessful. Dale Miller said that the contract should be required to include the dollar amount but
is not required at this stage, as this request is only for the department to conduct an alternate
procurement process. Armond Budish motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item
BC2019-200 was unanimously approved.
D. – Consent Agenda
Nan Baker referred to BC2018-209 – Proposed Purchases – CT-19-45028, Department of Public Works

Scope of Work Summary
The Department of Public Works is requesting an RFP Exemption for the Facilities Division for the attached
various vendors in said amounts (see attached list) for routine building & supply purchases, and other
misc. business needs for the period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019. This request is to
comply with a recent audit per the Fiscal Office. The resulting approval will result in the establishment of
individual encumbrance documents set up to cover routine expenses up to $1,000 per individual purchase
– the grand total of all purchases during this timeline are not to exceed the stated amounts on the
attached document. Public Works will monitor the encumbrance balances in cooperation with Fiscal
Office.
The primary goal is to obtain daily building and supply purchases that were previously purchased via the
county voucher process. The Fiscal Office has requested that these vendors be set up via an encumbrance
document. Public Works is working with OPD on advertising RFP’s for master contracts that will replace
many of these encumbrances. The master contracts should be awarded by April 1, 2019. Any amounts
not needed after the master contacts are awarded will be decertified.
Procurement
The County is continuing to use vendors that were previously used via the voucher process. The Fiscal
Office has requested that these vendors be put under an encumbered in advance.

fence was not constructible due to grade and debris.
