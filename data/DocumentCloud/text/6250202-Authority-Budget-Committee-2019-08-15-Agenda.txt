2. FFY19 Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grant Program
Introduction
Mr. Stevens introduced the FFY19 Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement Grant
Program (NFSIA) and said ICJIA staff submitted a federal application for a formuladetermined amount of $690,337. He said these funds would be available for use by
January 2020 and staff would issue a notice of funding opportunity for the funds totaling
$624,535 in the third quarter of 2019 to identify appropriate fund recipients. He said
some funds would be used to cover internal administrative costs.
Motion: Ms. Kramer moved to approve the recommended FFY19 NFSIA Notice of
Funding Opportunity. Chief Perez seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
3. FFY18 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Notice of Funding Opportunity
Ms. Hailey introduced the FFY18 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT)
Notice of Funding Opportunity. She said RSAT assists state and local governments in the
development and implementation of substance use disorder treatment programs in state
and local correctional and detention facilities. She said staff requests a designation of
$700,000 in available FFY18 RSAT funds to issue a competitive funding opportunity in
the third quarter of 2019 and that designation recommendations resulting from this
funding opportunity would be presented at the December 12, 2019, Budget Committee
meeting.
In response to a question by Ms. Kramer, Ms. Hailey said that the funding opportunity
would be open to residential treatment programs and aftercare programs.
In response to a question by Dr. Olson, Ms. Hailey said that ICJIA has had little success
in funding programs in jurisdictions outside of Cook County because RSAT requires that
inmates are held in detention facilities for at least 90 days and most local jail facilities do
not operate in a manner that supports that requirement.
Ms. Wolff suggested creating a workgroup to address shortcomings in the RSAT
legislation that make RSAT funding unattractive to local-level detention facilities.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended FFY19 RSAT Notice of
Funding Opportunity. Mr. West seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.
4. State Program Appropriations
Mr. Stevens introduced state program appropriations listed on the agenda.

Motion: Mr. Perez moved to approve the recommended designation to the Safer
Foundation. Mr. West seconded the motion.
Vote: The motion passed by unanimous voice vote, with a recusal by Mr. Kocerka due
to the Safer Foundation’s relationship with the Cook County Public Defender’s Office.
B. SFY20 Street Intervention Program/ Metropolitan Family Services
Mr. Hoffman, addressing the SFY20 Street Intervention Program (SIP)/Metropolitan

said that the MFS received an SFY20 line item appropriation of $6,094,300 to provide
street intervention services. He said that staff recommends designating $5,984,870 of the
appropriation to MFS and the balance of the appropriation would be used to cover
administrative costs. The first six months of this program will continue to support the
sites in the communities previously served by Cure Violence and the second six months
of this program will support the Communities Partnering 4 Peace (CP4P) program.
Motion: Mr. Kocerka moved to approve the recommended SFY20 SIP designation to

Program Description
Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The
behavior can be verbal, physical, or social and occurs more than once or has the potential to be repeated over
time (stopbullying.gov). In a national study, 21 percent of Illinois high school students stated they had been
bullied on school property and 17 percent stated they had been electronically bullied (Center for Disease
Control, 2017).
Bullying prevention research has shown that programs must address school climate and culture in addition to
specific bullying behaviors (Child Safety Network August 8, 2018 webinar). Evidence-informed programs
include school-wide culture components such as training, awareness, monitoring, and assessment of bullying
and consistent modeling from staff. Addressing school climate is consistent with Positive Behavior Intervention
Supports used throughout Illinois schools, Social and Emotional Learning standards adopted by the Illinois
State Board of Education (Section 15(a) of Public Act 93-0495), and general violence prevention frameworks.
These approaches are synergistic with the emerging work to develop trauma informed schools. The National
Child Traumatic Stress Network suggests that the Multi-Tiered System of Support Model is an appropriate
framework to infuse trauma-informed concepts and practices. This model also emphasizes engaging families
and incorporates the wider context including the school environment/culture and the larger community
(National Child Traumatic Stress Network, Schools Committee, 2017). Tier One is foundational and directed to
all students, teachers, and staff and creates an “environment with clear expectations for everyone, open
communication, and a collective commitment to a safe and nurturing school culture” (National Child Traumatic
Stress Network, Schools Committee, 2017). Tier Two is directed at students who are at risk and can receive
supports in small groups. Tier Three includes intensive supports for students whose behavior and experiences
require clinical interventions. All three tiers require unique training and skill development that are necessary for
complete implementation.

Past Performance
The Trauma Responsive Schools program assessment and planning period was completed on June 30, 2019.
Developed by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network’s Treatment and Services Adaptation Center for
Resilience, Hope, and Wellness in Schools and the Center for School Mental Health, the Trauma Responsive
Schools Implementation Assessment (TRS-IA) provides a comprehensive assessment in which school teams
collectively assess their school on 8 key domains. The TRS-IA toolkit assists the school teams in developing
goals and action items with a related timeline. Grantees trained and assisted 17 school teams (nine in southern
Illinois and eight in Chicago neighborhoods) in completing the assessment and developing an action plans.
Trainings included general information on trauma and specific training on the assessment tool. The schools
have completed individual action plans based on their assessments.

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal & State Grants Unit

Date:

August 18, 2019

RE:

Budget Committee update on status of JAG Planning

At the June 27, 2019 ICJIA Board meeting, the Board approved the Illinois Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Strategic Plan 2019-2024. The plan outlines five goals
that will guide the use of JAG funds for the next five years.
At the same meeting, the Board requested to review an implementation plan that will describe
how JAG funds will be programmed to achieve the five goals listed in the plan. Staff is currently
developing an implementation plan recommendation and will present it to the Budget Committee
at its October 17, 2019 meeting. The Budget Committee’s recommendations will then be
presented to the Board at its December 19, 2019 meeting for consideration.
Because we currently have active JAG-funded programs operating from our Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Drugs Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) issued in 2017 and our
Court Operations NOFO issued in 2018, designations for new programming will not be needed
until mid-2020.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

Community Violence
Illinois Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems (HEALS) is a demonstration project funded
by the Office for Victims of Crime that includes a five-year implementation period. A 15-month
planning period ending in December 2018 revealed great interest within the provider community
in cross-system collaboration and strengthening the screening, referral networks, and services
available for young victims and their families. Interviews with victims demonstrated that many
are ready to work alongside providers and practitioners to engage their communities in building
strong linkages. Staff recommends designating $800,000 in FFY17 VOCA funds to Egyptian
Health Department, which will serve as Illinois HEALS’ first demonstration site. 
Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
In keeping with the priorities identified by ICJIA’s Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee, staff
recommends designating $455,000 in FFY17 funds to the Chicago Department of Family and
Support Services to fund the Statewide Domestic Violence Hotline. Please see the attached Grant
Recommendation Report for more information.
Statewide InfoNet Data Collection Program
In keeping with the priorities identified by ICJIA’s Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee, staff
recommends designating $556,024 in FFY17 funds to ICJIA to supplement the Statewide
InfoNet Data Collection program. ICJIA developed and manages InfoNet, a web-based,
centralized statewide case management system for domestic and sexual violence centers. InfoNet
is used by over 100 Illinois victim service providers, allowing them to track individual victims
served and services provided and easily produce standardized program and funding reports.
Please see the attached Grant Recommendation Report for more information.

Lead Entity Program: Statewide Services to Victims of Sexual Assault
At its April 18, 2019, meeting, ICJIA’s Budget Committee designated $18.3 million in FFY17
VOCA funds to support the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) Lead Entity
Program. ICJIA’s Lead Entity Policy states that lead entities can be used to distribute funds to
sub-grantees to implement federal- and state-supported programs. When a lead entity is
identified by ICJIA, the lead entity is responsible for the fiscal oversight and quality assurance of
its sub-grants. Lead entities conduct structured monitoring and provide subject matter expertise
and technical assistance to sub-grantees. ICJIA monitors its grants to lead entities via periodic
progress reports.
Historically, ICJIA has awarded its entire Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Sexual
Assault Services Program (SASP) award to ICASA under a lead entity agreement. The VAWA
SASP formula grant program directs grant dollars to states to assist them in supporting rape
crisis centers and other nonprofit, non-governmental organizations that provide core services,
direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and
other nonprofit organizations play a vital role in assisting sexual assault victims through the
healing process, as well as assisting victims through the medical, criminal justice, and other
social support systems.
At one time, ICJIA could anticipate receipt of its VAWA SASP award consistently on August 1,
but in recent years the funds have been received later than that. At the same time, ICASA’s
VAWA SASP programs begin August 1. This forces ICJIA to enter into late grant agreements
with ICASA and then seek ICJIA Board approval to make retroactive payments to ICASA.
All programming under ICASA’s VAWA SASP grant constitute allowable activities under
VOCA. Staff recommends increasing the $18,300,000 VOCA FFY17 Lead Entity Program grant
to ICASA by $503,870 to cover SASP activities for one year, beginning on July 1, 2019. This
would allow staff to adjust the program start date under the VAWA SASP grant. In addition,
staff could explore new VAWA SASP programming.
3. RECOMMENDED NOTICE OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY
Transitional Housing
Staff requests designating up to $5 million in available FFY18 VOCA funds to issue a notice of
funding opportunity in the fourth quarter of 2019 for a transitional housing program. Designation
recommendations resulting from this funding opportunity will be presented at the December 12,
2019, Budget Committee meeting. Applicants will be required to clearly describe their
transitional housing models, numbers of clients to be served, referral mechanisms, eligibility
criterium, and policies and procedures. Demonstration of the applicants’ rationale for the
proposed program also will be required, as well as program descriptions including clients’
potential challenges how the program will address those challenges. The incorporation of
trauma-informed principles will be preferred. In addition, applicants will be required to
demonstrate a history of collaborative relationships with other social service agencies.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer any questions.

The Inspiring Hope Program provides crisis intervention, case management, supportive counseling, and therapy
services to child and adult victims of child abuse. The Inspiring Hope program offers crisis intervention services
on an ongoing basis. When clients are in need of crisis resources, case management staff provide these services
immediately. The services focus on identifying the most crucial emergency needs of the client and ensures the

Program Description
The Allies in Healing program will serve adult survivors of child abuse in Cook County. The program will
serve the entire city with an emphasis on marginalized communities, including Bridgeport, Little Village,
Pilsen, Brighton Park, Englewood, and Back of the Yards, and underserved populations, males, people of color,
second language learners, and victims with an undocumented immigration status. The program will aid victims
of abuse with counseling, legal advocacy, and emergency services (relocation assistance, medical attention etc.).
Program Activities
Adult survivors of childhood abuse and their family members can engage in the following services, available in
English and Spanish: crisis intervention, case management, individual counseling, family counseling, and
therapy. Trauma support groups are provided to adult survivors of childhood abuse at a substance use treatment
facility. Case management includes direct service (e.g., notifying and assisting with victim compensation
paperwork; obtaining criminal or civil protection orders; relocation services; assisting in filing for losses
covered by public and private insurance programs; accompanying victims to the hospital, assisting victims to
address life skill development that was impaired as a direct result of the victimization), advocacy (e.g.,
intervening with employers, creditors, and others on behalf of the victim), and community referrals (e.g.,
English learning programs or dental or health).
Goals
The goal of counseling and therapy services is to improve mental well-being and address the impact of
participants’ victimization. The goals of trauma support groups are to improve mental health and increase
resources for adults suffering from substance use disorders who are also victims of and/or were exposed to
violence and abuse.

This grant will support the final 12-months of a 36-month funding cycle, as outlined in the original Notice of
Funding Opportunity.
Past Performance
In Year 1, the HYFS VOCA program served 28 individuals with referral and therapy services. The program had
challenges in hiring a licensed therapist, but once a therapist was hired, the program was able to conduct more
effective outreach and develop successful community partnerships. In Year 2, service provision increased
exponentially. Staff expects the program to easily meet its goal of serving 50 clients with referrals and 100
clients with therapy services. In Year 3, the program expects to serve 117 clients with individual therapy and
referrals to other service providers.

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1564-1132

Program Description
Illinois Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems (HEALS) is a demonstration project funded by the Office for
Victims of Crime that includes a five-year implementation period. A 15-month planning period ending in
December 2018 revealed great interest within the provider community in cross-system collaboration and
strengthening the screening, referral networks, and services available for young victims and their families.
Interviews with victims demonstrated that many are ready to work alongside providers and practitioners to
engage their communities in building strong linkages.
While identification, referral, and support are core to creating strong linkages, stakeholders and victims
discussed relationships as essential for these three components to function in a meaningful way. Victims
emphasized that a meaningful response is centered in relationships founded on trust and respect. Providers
discussed how relationships with systems and agencies built upon accountability and resource sharing were
crucial to comprehensively serving clients whose needs often extended beyond their own capacity. Viewing
these essential components through the lens of relationship, strong linkages involve recognizing victimization
has occurred and assessing its impact, connecting victims to needed resources, and providing services that
meaningfully engage victims and their families.
The Illinois HEALS Action Plan provides an in depth review of the planning process and the relationally based
approach to cross system coordination, improved identification and connection to services. The first
demonstration site, Egyptian Health Department, has been selected and is recommended for funding through
this designation.
Egyptian Health Department will implement the project in partnership with other collaboratives in the fivecounty southern rural service area of Gallatin, Franklin, Saline, White and Williamson. These counties were
selected because of their involvement in existing systems of care or collaborative coalition work and their
disproportionately high needs. The Egyptian demonstration site will enhance and expand these existing
collaboratives both geographically and substantively to improve coordinated victim services for children and
families in the target area.

Program Activities
This funding will support the implement the Illinois HEALS model. At the multi-county level, the system of
care coordinator will convene representatives of existing collaborative work to identify gaps in services for
child, youth and family victims of violence. This group will develop protocols to implement better victim
screening processes and ensure cross-system collaboration. Each of the five counties will be staffed by a
resource coordinator that will convene the local providers to identify victims and coordinate their services. The
resource coordinators will assist in victim screening and provide the advocacy and support for identified
victims. Through matching funds, Egyptian Health Department’s Family Resource Developers will provide
some of those services. In addition, evidence-based therapeutic services will be provided by trained clinicians.
A service coordinator will manage the mechanics of the clinical referrals and ensure appropriate services are
provided. Finally, a volunteer coordinator will assist in the engagement of community members interested in
supporting victims in a variety of settings.
Goals
Goal 1: Build a local System of Care that meets the needs of individuals, families, and communities by
convening local coordinating bodies, securing appropriate funding, and developing policies and practices that
further the work.
Goal 2: Strengthen the abilities of systems and communities to recognize child and youth victims by fostering
community awareness and appropriate screening practices.
Goal 3: Shore up how systems and communities connect young victims and their families to appropriate
resources and services through a multidisciplinary team that supports care coordination and facilitates effective
referral processes.
Goal 4: Promote practices that engage young persons who have experienced victimization and their family
members in an array of services that are culturally specific and humble, accessible, and relevant by developing
the professional workforce and enhancing service capacity and quality.
Priorities
The 2017 Ad Hoc Victim Services Committee priorities fulfilled under this program include #1 Public
Awareness; #2 Fundamental Needs; #3 Core Services, #4 More Advocates, More Places; #6 Multiple
Victimizations; #7 Multi-disciplinary Responses; #8 Trauma-informed and focused Services; #11 Evidenceinformed practices; and #12 Facilitating Program Evaluation.

Program Description
The Domestic Violence Hotline is a 24-hour, toll-free confidential resource that serves as a clearinghouse
providing domestic violence victims with immediate information on safety planning, available options, and how
to access supportive services. Callers are given a direct three-way link to domestic violence resources, including
shelter, counseling, legal advocacy, and children’s services.
Program Activities
The City of Chicago Department of Family and Support Services contracts with the Chicago Metropolitan
Battered Women’s Network to staff the 24-hour Domestic Violence Hotline seven days per week. Trained
Victim Information and Referral Advocates (VIRA’s) assist victims, law enforcement, faith leaders, and
community stakeholders with information and referrals to supportive services. Funding for this initiative will
partially fund the following positions:





Three Supervisors for each of the shifts - one for each eight-hour shift.
Eight full-time VIRA’s.
Six part-time VIRA’s.
Three hourly VIRA’s.

Goals
The goal of the program is to provide direct services to domestic violence victims to alleviate trauma and
suffering incurred from victimization.
Priorities
Funding to support the Domestic Violence Hotline corresponds with the ICJIA-identified funding priority of
addressing fundamental needs of victims. When victims call the hotline for assistance, they are made aware of
the options available to them and are provided safety planning, referrals to shelter, counseling, legal services,
and referrals to numerous other forms of assistance and/or services. Additionally, having access to the

Language Line removes a considerable barrier by affording victims the opportunity to communicate in their
native language, which provides a measure of relief as they seek to reclaim their lives free of violence and
abuse.
Program Funding Detail
This designation would support 12 months of funding, representing Year 1 of three years of programming. Any
future designation recommendations for this program will be pursuant to staff analysis of program performance
and will depend on fund availability.
Past Performance
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently provided unparalleled assistance and support to victims of
domestic violence as well as various other stakeholders since its inception in 1998. This hotline is the only
service capable of directly linking victims to the services they seek by being a single point of access to
assistance. The ability to make one telephone call and obtain emotional support, safety planning, shelter
referrals, legal advocacy, as well as referrals to a wide array of other services is critically important for domestic
violence victims as it eliminates many of the barriers they face when seeking to free themselves and their
dependent children from violence. There is no other hotline serving the City of Chicago or the State of Illinois
with the depth of experience and quality in providing assistance, information, and referrals to service providers,
concerned family and friends, or other community stakeholders.
The Domestic Violence Hotline has consistently exceeded the goals established for the program based on the
volume of calls responded to within Chicago and throughout Illinois. Victims, concerned family and friends,
faith leaders, law enforcement, and a host of community stakeholders continue to rely on the Domestic Violence
Hotline as the single point of access for domestic violence information, assistance, and referrals to services.
During the past 12 months:

Notice of Funding Opportunity #1564-1219

Program Description
ICJIA developed and manages InfoNet, a web-based, centralized statewide case management system for
domestic and sexual violence centers. InfoNet is used by over 100 Illinois victim service providers, allowing
them to track individual victims served and services provided and easily produce standardized program and
funding reports. InfoNet data has been instrumental in enhancing services provided to victims of domestic and
sexual violence in Illinois for over 20 years. Staff recommends a designation of $556,024 in available FFY17
Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) funds to support the InfoNet System.
This grant intends to expand staffing to support InfoNet to accommodate its growth and substantially strengthen
the system as a case management tool for victim service providers. InfoNet has three distinct interfaces, tailored
for domestic violence, sexual assault, and child advocacy centers. ICJIA has initiated efforts with law
enforcement and prosecutor-based victim service providers to design a fourth InfoNet interface that meets their
case management, data tracking, and reporting needs, potentially doubling InfoNet’s user base within the next
two years. Funds will be used to increase staff resources in project management, application development,
technical and research support. This will ensure ICJIA keeps pace with the increasing number of service
providers and users needing secure access, technical support, and training. The strengthened case management
features will improve not only the providers’ ability to deliver services at the individual level, but also InfoNet’s
utility for demonstrating service impact, evaluate programming, and the impact of VOCA funding.
Application development staff will modify and build upon InfoNet’s application code with new data elements
and reporting features that facilitate case management. Research and project management staff will devote the
additional time providing user trainings and assistance about using InfoNet’s data to inform case management
and host ongoing forums with users for feedback and to evaluate project progression. Technical support staff
will ensure ICJIA can accommodate InfoNet’s growing number of users needing secure access. All staff roles
will help meet the increased training and support needs.

Program Description
The Sexual Assault Services Program (SASP) was created by the Violence Against Women and Department of
Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 (VAWA) and is the first federal funding stream solely dedicated to the
provision of direct intervention and related assistance for victims of sexual assault. Nearly half of all women
and one in five men have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetimes. Also, nearly one in five
(18.3 percent) women and one in 71 men (1.4 percent) in the U.S. have been raped at some time in their lives.
For many victims, it may take years to recover from the physical and psychological trauma caused by rape and
other forms of sexual violence. To heal from the trauma, survivors often need support from family and friends
and critical direct intervention and related assistance from victim-centered social service organizations, such as
rape crisis centers, through 24-hour sexual assault hotlines, crisis intervention, and medical and criminal justice
accompaniment.
SASP directs grant dollars to states to assist them in supporting rape crisis centers that provide core services,
direct intervention, and related assistance to victims of sexual assault. Rape crisis centers and other nonprofit
organizations, such as dual programs providing both domestic violence and sexual violence intervention
services, play vital roles in assisting sexual assault victims through the healing process, as well as assisting
victims through the medical, criminal justice, and other social support systems. Funds provided through the
SASP program are designed to supplement other funding sources directed at addressing sexual assault.
In Illinois, VAWA SASP funds are distributed to local sexual assault service providers through an interagency
agreement between ICJIA and the Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA). Under the SASP
program, ICASA will make funds available to 32-member agencies for the provision of hotline, advocacy,
counseling, and outreach services to adults and children. The funded agencies will be selected through a
competitive application process in which applicants will be evaluated based on demonstrated need in the service
area, previous and proposed performance, reasonableness of program plan, consistency of budget and program
plans and compliance with ICASA’s service standards.
