Transmitting a Communication, dated August 20, 2019 from #19?5233

JESSICA CAFFREY, Director, Department of Real Estate Management

Requesting authorization to exercise an option to purchase real estate contained in a Lease Agreement
between the County of Cook, as Tenant, and 12757 S. Western Ave., LLC, as Landlord, for property
located at 12757 S. Western Ave, Blue Island, Illinois. 

On November 14, 2018, the County of Cook entered into a 10-year lease agreement with 12757 S.
Western Ave., LLC for the building located at 12757 S. Western Avenue to operate the Oak Forest
replacement clinic. The County is the sole tenant of the 42,276 square feet of gross leasable area.

As per Article 26 of the lease, ?Option to Purchase?, the County has the option to purchase the
property after the buildout is completed and tendered over to Tenant at an agreed upon price, which
was determined by an Illinois Certi?ed Appraisal of the premises, which includes the adjacent
parking lot. The purchase by Tenant shall be contingent on an inspection of the Premises and
Building, including all Building systems, which indicates that the Building and Premises are in a
satisfactory condition that is acceptable to Tenant. The Option to Purchase shall extend for a two (2)
year period from Commencement Date of the Lease and Tenant shall deliver written notice to
Landlord of its election to exercise option.

The lease stipulates that thirty days after the issuance of the Certi?cate of Occupancy, Cook County
would be responsible for payment of annual rent, amortized buildout expenses, taxes, operating
expenses, annual rent increases equal to 2.5% of the base rent, and over a period of ten years, these
costs amount to $17,922,317.00. Upon completion of the improvements, it is estimated the County
will have paid approximately $2,179,608.00 in additional improvements.

By exercising the option, the County would avoid cost of real estate taxes which are estimated to be
$211,380.00 for the ?rst year of the lease and will relieve County of paying annual base rent and
Common Area Maintenance (CAM) to a Landlord. Per the lease the Landlord will deliver the
property in a ?Turn-Key? condition and all punch list items identi?ed by Cook County will be
completed by Landlord within thirty (30) days following substantial completion and before closing.
