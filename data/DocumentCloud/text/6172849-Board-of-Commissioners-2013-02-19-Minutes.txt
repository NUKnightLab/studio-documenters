meeting was held on Wednesday, February 13, 2013 at approximately 1:00 p.m. at the CHA
Corporate Offices. While there was a quorum for the Tenant Services Committee, the Finance
Committee did not have a quorum. Committee members were briefed on items appearing on the
agenda, however, for the record, no votes were taken. Linda Riley Mitchell, Chief Financial
4

 Officer presented the Committee with the December 2012 Treasury and Cash Flow Report and
2013 CHA Annual Cash Flow Forecast.
On behalf of the Joint Finance and Tenant Services Committee members, Commissioner Cepeda
presented an Omnibus Motion for two of the three items discussed at the Committee meeting:
(Item C1)
The CHA released a Request for Proposal in June 2012 for Disaster Recovery Site Services. The
solicitation was advertised in various newspapers and on CHA website. Of the four proposals
received, AT&T was found to be the most responsive and responsible bidder. From 2006
through 2010 the CHA had several audits and management reviews conducted that focused on
the CHA’s ability to continue operations in the event of a disaster. KPMG performed
assessments of the CHA’s business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a primary
facilities risk and vulnerability assessment. These reviews revealed many opportunities for
improvement in order for the CHA to successfully respond to an event and to provide continuity
to business operations. One significant concern noted in the CHA’s disaster recovery plan was
its backup data center’s close proximity to its primary data center. Industry best practices
recommend that a backup data center should be located a minimum of twenty-five (25) miles
from its main computing facility. Requirements for the new disaster recovery site include:
relocation of the CHA’s current backup equipment; establish a disaster recovery site twenty-five
(25) miles from headquarters; secure state-of-the-art backup recovery facility that will enable
CHA to continue business operations in the event of an emergency or extended outage; provision
of reliable power, Internet access and adequate cooling; a site that is accessible and secure with
high availability, scalability and 24/7 on-site technical support. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item C1 approves award of contract to AT&T for the disaster recover site services.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-7
WHEREAS, The Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
memorandum dated February 13, 2013 titled “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER
INTO A CONTRACT WITH AT&T TO PROVIDE DISASTER RECOVERY
CO-LOCATION SERVICES”,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or
his designee to enter into a contract with AT&T for the disaster recovery colocation services for a three (3) year base term in an amount not-to-exceed
$218,160 with two (2) one (1) year options.
These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

(Item C2)
The resolution for Item C2 ratifies the acceptance of a Grant Award from the Illinois Criminal
Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) in the amount of $282,200, increases the FY2013 Budget
by the same amount and approves sub-grant agreements with UCAN, the Chicago Police
Department, CeaseFire Chicago, Social IMPACT Research Center and Community Justice for
Youth Institute. In January 2010, the CHA was awarded a two year $250,000 award from ICJIA
to implement community based youth violence prevention through Gang Resistance Education
5

 and Training (G.R.E.A.T.) and the Youth Courts. The Altgeld-Riverside Community (ARC)
Partnership created a community partnership and increased resident awareness of violence and
burglary prevention at community schools. In 2012, CHA was invited to apply for leftover ICJIA
Grant Program funds to continue and enhance the ARC Partnership Program. On December 11,
2012, the CHA received official written notice of the award. CHA is required to provide
matching funds in the amount of $94,067.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-8
