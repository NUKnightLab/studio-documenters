 Project Introduction
Arte Express Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the rehabilitation of the vacant former Administration Building for the Packard
Motor Car Company at 1580 East Grand Boulevard into a 121,000 square foot four-story
commercial office building. Albert Kahn Associates, Inc., the original architect of the
building built in 1911, have been retained as architects for the project. The project will
involve green features such as the historic restoration of the exterior of the building to the
extent possible as well as a green roof. The developer will also be cleaning up adjacent
vacant land with green storm water features for outdoor courtyard amenities and tenant
parking.
Approximately 7 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 136 temporary construction jobs
are expected to be created as a result of the project. A significant number of indirect jobs
via building tenants are also expected to locate at the development. The total investment
is estimated to be $22.6 million. The Developer is requesting $5,391,278.00 in TIF
reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of five parcels located at 1580 E. Grand
Boulevard (the Administrative Building), as well as 2821 & 5847 Concord (outdoor
corridors within the Packard complex) and 5580 & 5590 Concord (vacant lots to be
redeveloped). The parcels are generally located on the eastside of Detroit with the
Administration building on East Grand Boulevard, east of Mt. Elliot Avenue.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial purpose; (b) it is located within
the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and (c) the Property
is determined to be functionally obsolete, blighted and/or adjacent to or contiguous to an
eligible parcel and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value of that property as
defined by Act 381. 1580 E. Grand Boulevard, the administration building, has been
certified functionally obsolete by a level 3 or level 4 assessor. 5821 & 5847 Concord have
been determined blighted per Act 381 via a determination of blight letter from Detroit City
Planning Commission staff. The parcels identified as 5580 & 5590 Concord have been
determined to be a facility pursuant to Part 201. Letters and/or reports supporting these
determinations can be found in Attachment G of the Plan
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline
environmental site assessment activities, due care and additional response activities,
demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, site preparation, infrastructure improvements,
and preparation of a brownfield plan and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted
costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely
by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and

9

 will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in fall/winter of 2016 and
complete within eighteen (18) months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.
