DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES
The developer for the City Gardens redevelopment, B-M Maplewood, LLC an Illinois limited liability
company (Developer), is a joint venture of Brinshore Holding, LLC and Michaels Development Company
1, L.P. Both development teams were selected under CHA’s Housing for Chicagoans Everywhere
program and approved as the selected developer for the Maplewood Courts site by the Board on
November 17, 2009. Developer will create an ownership entity to be the owner of the development and
to execute the ground lease.
FINANCING
The total estimated development budget for the City Gardens rental development is approximately
$28,403,417 and includes the CHA Loan of approximately $7,275,000 to be funded with a combination
of HOPE VI and CHA General Funds. In addition, approximately $1,282,891 of CHA General Funds will be
provided for site remediation. Additional project sources include approximately $750,000 of CHA
General and HOPE VI Funds for The Habitat Company Administrative fees and costs, CHA Administration,
Initial Operating Deficit Reserve, and Project Coordination/Additional Services fee.
REMEDIATION AGREEMENT
The estimated remediation costs for the City Gardens development is $1,282,891. CHA’s contractual
responsibility for remediating foreseen and unforeseen environmental conditions is capped at 200% of
this estimated total cost and equals $2,565,782. The term of the remediation contract shall commence
at closing and expire the earlier of (i) receipt of a ‘No Further Remediation’ letter from the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) or (ii) two years, subject to a one year extension at CHA’s
election. The required M/W/DBE participation commitment is 40% of the remediation cost to be
incurred. Additionally, the contractor will meet or exceed its Section 3 requirement.

developer has an interest and desire to implement its own lease forms and policy that encourages
consistent community standards for the effective management of its development.
