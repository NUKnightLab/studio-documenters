PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
INSPECTOR GENERAL
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 2, Administration, Article
IV Officers and Employees, Division 5 Inspector General, Section 2-285 - Cooperation of the Cook County
Code is hereby amended as Follows:
Sec. 2-285. Cooperation.
(a) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts, to cooperate with the OIIG in the conduct of investigations undertaken pursuant to
this division. Every County contract and every bid, proposal, application or solicitation for a County
contract and every application for certification of eligibility for a County contract or program shall contain
a statement that the person, individually and on behalf of the applicant, will abide by all provisions of this
division. It shall be unlawful for any person subject to this Section to refuse to cooperate with the
Independent Inspector General as required by this Section. The penalty for such violation shall be governed
by Section 2-291.
(b) All persons with whom the OIIG requests an interview are required to comply in a timely fashion.
Within constitutional limitations, failure by any County employee, official, agent, contractor, subcontractor,
licensee, grantee or person or business seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of
eligibility for County contracts, to cooperate with any reasonable request by the OIIG carries the threat of
sanctions and/or criminal contempt proceedings, and any other penalties the County Board has within its
scope to assess.
(c) Nothing in this compliance section may be interpreted to allow the OIIG to violate any individual's
constitutional rights, including the 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.

 (d) It is the duty of every employee, department and elected official to cooperate with the Independent
Inspector General in any investigation or hearing. Each department's premises, equipment, personnel,
books, records and papers shall be made readily available to the Independent Inspector General.
(e) If the Independent Inspector General issues a recommendation of corrective action to the head of
a County department or bureau, that department or bureau head must respond to that recommendation
within 30 days with a written response to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau of
Human Resources. This response must include either (1) a description of any corrective action the
department or bureau head has taken or (2) a request for a 30-day extension of the 30-day decision period
if additional time is needed by the department or bureau head to review the recommendation of corrective
action. If the head of that department or bureau did not take any corrective action, or took a different
corrective action than that recommended by the Independent Inspector General, the department or bureau
head must describe the different action and explain the reasons for the different action in the written
response. This response must be submitted to the Independent Inspector General and Chief of the Bureau
of Human Resources within the 30-day decision period. The Independent Inspector General may approve
a request for an extension of this 30-day decision period for a period of time not to exceed 30 days if
additional time is needed by the head of the department or bureau to review the recommendation of
corrective action. If a department, bureau, or separately elected official fails to meet the 30 day requirement
or, if approved, the 30 day extension, the department head, bureau chief or separately elected official must
appear before the next meeting of the Finance Sub-Committee on Litigation to explain the reasoning for
failing to reply. The Independent Inspector General shall notify the chair of the Litigation Sub-Committee
when there is a failure to reply.
(f) It shall be the duty of all County employees, officials, agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees,
grantees or persons or businesses seeking County contracts, grants, licenses, or certification of eligibility
for County contracts to report, directly and without undue delay, to the Independent Inspector General any
and all information concerning conduct which they know to involve corruption, allegations of political
discrimination in nonexempt positions or other criminal activity, by another County employee or official,
which concerns his or her office of employment or County related transaction. The knowing failure of any
employee to report as required above shall constitute cause for discipline up to and including termination.
For purposes of this Section, a report made to the Inspector General Hotline shall be considered a direct
report.
Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
A motion was made by Commissioner Morrison, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, to accept
