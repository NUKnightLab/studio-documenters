individuals as those ‘‘who have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for the
services furnished during the year.’’ Also, ‘‘who have health insurance (or other third party
coverage)’’ to refer broadly to individuals “who have creditable coverage consistent with the
definitions under 45 CFR parts 144 and 146, as well as individuals who have coverage based upon a
legally liable third party payer”.
Uninsured (based on the 2018 health survey interview)
1.

Number of persons under age 65 uninsured at the time of interview - 30.1 million

2.

Percent of persons under age 65 uninsured at the time of interview - 11.1%

3.

Percent of children under age 18 uninsured at the time of interview - 5.2%

4. Percent of adults aged 18-64 uninsured at the time of interview - 13.3% [1]

Underinsured Patients

Patients that have insurance, but the insurance doesn’t cover the cost of
healthcare. Commonwealth Fund further defines as, “individuals insured in
household that spent 10% or more of income on medical care (excluding
premiums) or 5% or more if income under 200% poverty”
•

CCH CareLink

contract with CCH as an in-network provider. Patients with an HMO plan contracted with CCH AND who select CCH to
serve as their Primary Care Provider, or patients with a PPO plan or traditional “fee-for-service, may apply for CareLink
and receive a discount on the out-of-pocket costs associated with these plans, including deductibles and co-insurance.
CareLink cost-sharing fees would be applicable.

balance after insurance payments

1. Process of Study

 Point in time Cohort Study of uninsured patients in the self-pay and
Charity Care category
 FY2018 cohort looking back through FY2016

 FY2016 cohort looking forward through FY2018
2. Results & Observations

 Demographics
 Location
 Utilization vs Rest of CCH
 Utilization

26

 Uninsured Analysis Methodology
1. Cohort of ALL uninsured on a certain day 11/30/2018 was identified.
2. Identified patients in cohort was queried to determine if members
were also ;
a. uninsured on 11/30/2017 and,
b. uninsured on 11/30/2016
3. Results - 22,228 patients were identified as continuously uninsured
Patients in FY2016 through FY2018

a. 6,990 were identified as Self Pay
b. 15,238 were identified as Charity Care
27

 Uninsured Analysis – Study Questions
1. Does CCH have a robust Benefits Advisory/Financial Counseling
process for connecting eligible patients to benefits?
2. How many consistently uninsured do we serve?
3. Who are the consistently uninsured, i.e. demographics?
4. Do the consistently uninsured have problems in accessing CCH
services vs the rest of CCH?
5. What are financial implications for CCH serving the continuously
uninsured?

 Self Pay Cohort – Summary of Results
Observations vs. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Key Facts
How many people are Self-Pay? - 6,990
Why do people remain Self-Pay? –

To be tested or surveyed

KFF Research Findings - In 2017, 45% of uninsured adults said that they remained uninsured because
 the cost of coverage was too high.
 many do not have access to coverage through a job

 some eligible for financial assistance under the ACA may not know they can get help,
 and undocumented immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid or Marketplace coverage.

3. Who remains in Self Pay?

Male (52%)

White (46%)

45-64 years old (47%) non Hispanic/Latino (52%)
31

 Self Pay Cohort - Summary of Results
Observations vs. Kaiser Family Foundation Key Facts
How does not having coverage affect health care access?

7% more Visits, 9% more outpatient visits, about 13% less

inpatient stays.

A. People without insurance coverage have worse access to care than people who are insured?

Not apparent in CCH population
B. Studies repeatedly demonstrate that the uninsured are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and
services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.

To be further interrogated
What are financial implications for CCH serving the continuously uninsured?

CCH FY2018 - 235K Accounts referred to collections, $296.8M and $3.7M or 1% Collected
Per KFF - The uninsured often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. In 2017, uninsured nonelderly adults were
over twice as likely as their insured counterparts to have had problems paying medical bills in the past 12 months. These bills can
quickly translate into medical debt since most of the uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.
