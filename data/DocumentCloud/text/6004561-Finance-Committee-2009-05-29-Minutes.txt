Presentation of Year-to-Date Financials through March 2009
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
presented the Year-to-Date Financials through March 2009 (Attachment #1).
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
While the Committee discussed the subject of operating revenues, it was stated that operating expenses
are under budget, based on hiring positions. Chairman Carvalho asked for the timeframe of when the
System can access the budget after its passage in order to fill positions created in the budget.
David Small, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, stated that two to
three weeks after the budget is passed, the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources accepts new
requests to hire. For Fiscal Year 2009, this occurred in mid-March.
Director O'Donnell noted that salaries and wages are down due to budget delays, not from holding down
costs.
In response to Director O'Donnell's comment, Mr. Small stated that it is a combination of two things:
first, there was $10 million that the System committed to not spend on salaries in 2009, the rest is
attributable to the delay in the hiring process.

Director O'Donnell asked what percentage of the patient service revenue is due to MedAssets' efforts.
Mr. Small stated that he has that information, and will email it to the Directors.
With regard to the information provided on System expenses per patient day, Board ChaiIman Batts
inquired whether it was known how the cost per patient day compares with national benchmarks.
Chairman Carvalho agreed that additional comparisons to other entities are needed.

In response to Chairman Carvalho's comments regarding coding issues, Mr. Small stated that at the next
Finance Committee meeting, part of MedAssets' monthly report to the Committee will be regarding
coding. Anything available prior to the meeting will be distributed to the Committee in advance.
Additionally, Chairman Carvalho requested that a sampling be done to get a handle on the case mix
index.
During the discussion of the information provided on payer mix, Director Munoz asked for dollar figures
on the amount received as a result of billing self-pay patients. Mr. Small stated that he could provide that
information for him. Chairman Carvalho noted that essentially the answer to Director Munoz' question
comes later in the process, based on the Limit of Liability policy.
Director O'Donnell noted that it is good news to see a drop of 1% in self-pay and the 1% increase in
Medicaid. She referenced the drop of 10% in Medicare, and inquired as to the reason for the decrease.
Ms. Loving responded that they are still analyzing the decrease.

Corrections were made to three contractual transmittals (request numbers 2, 21, and 27) submitted as
backup for Contracts and Procurement Approval Items.
Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System, provided
information on the items presented. At the request of Chairman Carvalho, Elizabeth Melas, Deputy
Director of the Cook County Office of Capital Planning and Policy, provided a status report on the Oak
Forest Hospital rehab work for the relocation of the Department of Public Health.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests presented for their consideration.

Director O'Donnell, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of the Contracts and
Procurement Approval Items, as amended, with the exception of request number 24, which will be
discussed in closed session. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho recused himself and voted PRESENT on request numbers 15 and 16.

Update on Contracting Issues
Ms. Duffy provided information on contracting issues. She stated that the deadline to move purchasing
in-house is August 1,2009.
In response to Mr. Foley's question regarding the System's progress on filling positions or transferring
people, Ms. Duffy stated that she is working with leadership at the County to ensure this happens.

Request for authorization to enter into a contract with
UHClNovation as the selected group purchasing organization
(GPO) for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
(Attachment #3)

Martin Grant, System-wide Director of Pharmacy for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System,
provided the Committee with information detailing the process used to select UHClNovation as the GPO
for the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (Attachment #4).
The following representatives from UHClNovation were present: Mark Jeniak, Regional Vice President
for Supply Chain, UHC; Matt Higna, Account Executive, UHC; and LaMont Robinson, Supplier
Diversity Program, Novation.
Chairman Carvalho provided information reviewing the System's history going back to the early 1990s
with regard to the consideration and utilization of GPOs. He pointed out that this has not been a rushed
issue, and the State's Attorney's Office has been actively involved. Furthermore, he stated that the
enabling Ordinance directs the System to explore the issue. The System's procurement policy and the
request for proposals embrace the MBEIWBE policy; all specific instances of procurement will require
MBElWBE participation.

 REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
MAY 29, 2009
PAGE 11

Mr. Foley stated that as Chief Executive Officer, he recommends that the Committee not defer the action
and should proceed on the matter. He added that he would like to work with Mr. Robinson, Novation's
representative for their Supplier Diversity Program, to see how the firm can assist with minority
participation.
Director Munoz stated that he will be watching closely for MBElWBE compliance under the GPO, and
that he expects them to work with local vendors to assist them in participating in the process. He asked
for an explanation of their internal processes used to bring MBEIWBE firms into the GPO.
Mr. Jeniak provided historical background on UHClNovation. He stated that one-third of their suppliers
under contract are registered as small business companies. Novation has a Supplier Diversity program
with 47 nationally-owned companies. He then introduced Mr. Robinson, from NQvation's Supplier
Diversity Program.
Mr. Robinson provided an overview of the Supplier Diversity program. He explained that the program
looks for support from the local communities. They look for small businesses who have the ability and
desire to grow. He stated that last year, members spent over $250 million with minority-, women- and
veteran-owned companies.
Chairman Carvalho asked what is the fee for businesses to participate as a supplier in the GPO.
Mr. Robinson stated that, contrary to what has been said, there is no $50,000 fee. There is a 3%
administrative fee; typically, there is an effort to negotiate that fee down to 1%.
Chairman Carvalho stated that in the System's procurement policy, there is a provision, with respect to
every pending purchase, that all ex-parte communications have to be logged. He asked whether
UHClNovation would be able to comply with this requirement, by logging any inquiries from any source
received and noting any source who inquires, including any source who states they are inquiring on behalf
of an elected official. He added that this log would need to be publicly available.
Mr. Robinson indicated that they would be able to meet this requirement.
Chairman Carvalho noted that he has a strong interest in UHClNovation complying with the County's
MBElWBE ordinance and all of the purchasing requirements. He has zero interest in the identity of the
particular sub-contractors.
Director O'Donnell stated that the System has been very thorough in the process, and the current GPO has
been proven to save money. In addition, this proposed contract is in compliance with all local ordinances,
and state and federal law. She stated that she thought they should move forward.
Director Golden mentioned that UHClNovation already has a local presence in the area with some of the
academic medical centers. She asked for information on the local numbers with regard to minority
compliance and diversity.
Mr. Robinson stated that he did not have the numbers with him, but he described a initiative that is being
created to boost awareness in the Great Lakes area; such initiatives typically bring out strong, diverse
suppliers from the area who are willing to grow.

 REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
MAY 29, 2009
PAGE 12

Director Golden stated that it would be good for Novation to come back and share with the Committee the
company's local track record with regards to diversity. Chairman Carvalho noted that the contract will
need to come back to the Committee or System Board for authorization to execute the contract. The
presentation of their local.diversity track record will provide the System with information needed for the
consideration of the contract execution.
Mr. Jeniak provided a example involving a local vendor, Progressive Industries. He stated that they are a
distributor for Novation; they do all of the medical gas business at the University of Illinois Medical
Center.
Director Ramirez requested information on the pro-active measures as an organization that have already
been taken by Novation.
Mr. Robinson stated that they have key measures of success; he identified three measures relating to
member purchases with diverse suppliers.
Chairman Carvalho stated that the County goals will guide the arrangement; this will require significant
effort on UHClNovation's part.
Board Chairman Batts inquired on the subject of tracking the amount of MBEIWBE participation. He
asked Elizabeth Reidy, Deputy Chief of the Civil Actions Bureau of the Office of the State's Attorney, to
comment on the subject.
Ms. Reidy stated that the enabling Ordinance that created the System Board specifically addressed
procurement and contracting at the System. In that Ordinance, it charges the System with the authority to
adopt policies and procedures for procurement at the System; these must be consistent with the
procurement ordinance and policies of the County. With regards to minority- and women-owned business
enterprises, the System's procurement policy has a section that states the System's commitment to the
County's policy; it is committed to the County's goal that protected class enterprises shall participate in
not less than 35% of the annual aggregate.
Chairman Batts asked Betty Hancock-Perry, Director of the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance,
to comment.
Ms. Hancock-Perry indicated that many questions that have not been answered should be answered in the
contract document that will be brought back before the Committee for execution. She referenced an
earlier statement that $250 million went to suppliers classified as small business companies. However, in
order to understand the true percentage of minority participation, the total spend must be presented. She
added that she had concerns, because questions raised have not been responded to by Novation.
Mr. Robinson indicated that in the past, there have been examples where Novation did not perform; that
issue led to the termination of an individual. They realized the need to aggressively address this issue.
Director Golden stated that the System needs to respond and share the accurate information presented at
this meeting to the Commissioners who stated their concerns in letters to the System Board. It was
determined that Mr. Foley would draft a letter for Chairman Batts to sign in this regard.
Chairman Carvalho took the opportunity to revisit and address any remaining concerns held by public
speakers who were still present, and allow any others who wished to provide public comments to address
the Committee.
