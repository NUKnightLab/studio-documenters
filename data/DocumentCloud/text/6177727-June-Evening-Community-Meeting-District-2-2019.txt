RE: RECOMMENDATION FOR DEFERRAL
ADDRESS: 9564 Beaverland
NAME: Beaverland 9564 LLC
Demolition Ordered: April 19, 2011

In response to the request for a deferral of the demolition order on the property noted above, the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) submits the following information:

A special inspection conducted on June 5, 2019 revealed that the building is secured and appears to be sound and repairable. The owner has
paid all taxes and is current. The proposed use of the property is owner?s use and occupancy. This is the deferral request for this

property.
Therefore, we respectfully recommended that the demolition order be deferred for a period of six months subject to the following
conditions:

1. A permit for rehabilitation work shall be applied for within te_n (10) business days from the date of the City Council
decision.

2. BSEED will schedule a Progress Inspection within forty-?ve (45) calendar days from the date of the rehabilitation
permit to determine whether substantial progress has been made. Thereafter, the owner must submit to BSEED
detailed inspectionreports, with photos showing evidence of the work completed, every forty-?ve (45) calendar
days, for the' duration of the rehabilitation work, to demonstrate that substantial progress has been made during
the approved time frame for rehabilitation.

3. The building shall have all imminently hazardous conditions immediately corrected, be maintained, and securely
barricaded until rehabilitation is complete. Rehabilitation work is to be completed within six (6) months, at which
time the owner will obtain one of the following from this department:

a Certi?cate of Acceptance related to building permits
0 Certi?cate of Approval as a result of a Housing Inspection
0 Certi?cate of Compliance, required for a_ll rental properties

4. The owner shall not occupy or allow occupancy of the structure without a certi?cate (as outlined above).

5. The yards shall be maintained clear of overgrown vegetation, weeds, junk and debris at all times.

6. Prior to seeking a permit extension, the owner must contact BSEED and request to extend the deferral period.

We recommend that utility disconnect actions cease to allow the progress of the rehabilitation.
At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral
have been satis?ed and that there has been substantial progress toward rehabilitation. If the building becomes open to trespass or if conditions

of the deferral are not followed, the deferral may be rescinded by the City Council at any time and we may proceed with demolition without
?nther notice. In addition, pursuant to the Property Maintenance Code we will issue a Blight Violation Notice.

Any request exceeding three (3) deferrals must be made by petition to City Council through the office of the City Clerk.

RE: Parking at St. Hedwig Park
My office has received complaints from residents who want to use St. Hedwig Park during the

spring and summer months for baseball games and other large group activities. Unfortunately,
residents have found that a lack of sufficient parking deters many residents from attending events at
the Park. Residents note that because the east side of Konkel Street near the park is designated a no

parking

zone, only about 15-20 spots are readily available for patrons to use for parking.

Please assess the area surrounding St. Hedwig Park to determine whether additional areas can be
designated for parking.

Additio
conside

nally, I request that the sidewalks around the Academy of the Americas School are
red for repairs.

Please contact my of?ce (313) 224-2450 if you have any questions.
