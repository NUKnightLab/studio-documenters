Preliminary Forecast
FISCAL YEAR

Committee on Finance of Cook County

 OVERVIEW OF FY2015 YEAR-END AND
FY2016 PRELIMINARY FORECAST
The Department of Budget and Management Services (DBMS) prepared this preliminary
forecast report in accordance with Section 2-934(c) of the Cook County Code of Ordinances.
The report presents a mid-year projection of year -end revenues and expenses for 2015, and an
initial forecast of fiscal year 2016 revenues and expenditures.

Fiscal Year 2015 Year-End
For FY2015, DBMS anticipates a budget shortfall of $33.5 million in the County’s General
Fund and $21.4 surplus in the Health Enterprise Fund, for a combined deficit of $12.1 million
in the County’s major operating funds. In the General Fund, cautionary measures to restrict
expenditures at the end of the first quarter have resulted in an expenditure projection of $1.5
million under budget despite an anticipated impact of labor agreements increasing projected
wages by $29.2 million. The shortfall is driven solely by revenue shortfalls, primarily a
decline in revenues related to the court filings. The Clerk of the Circuit Court has $13.9
million negative variance and the various fees for the Sheriff’s Office resulting in a $4.6
million negative variance. The remaining $17.0 million shortfall is attributed to Gas/Diesel
Fuel Tax audits and settlements that were budgeted but have yet to materialize and in some
instances may now go to trial versus settlement.

Fiscal Year 2016 Forecast
The FY2016 outlook includes a $198.8 million shortfall projected in the General Fund. This
projection assumes a static operating tax allocation for the Health System of $164 million, and
includes an increase in legacy debt service payments of $25 million. This projected operating
deficit does not reflect a need for increased funding for highway infrastructure of $10 million,
and an additional $270.5 million in funding for pensions that will put the County on a path to
address the outstanding unfunded pension liability in the County Employee’s Annuity and
Benefit Fund of Cook County in 30 years, creating a $479.3 million projected total deficit for
FY2016.
In the General Fund, projected expenditures of $1,533.3 million will exceed projected
revenues of $1,498.5 million with a tax allocation to the Cook County Health and Hospital
System preliminarily projected at $164.0 million, the 2015 figure. The projected shortfall is
driven by an increase in projected expenditures of $101.1 million and a decrease in expected

1

 revenues of $97.7 million. In the Health Fund, both revenues and expenditures are projected
to increase by $62.8 million.
In the General Fund, projected cost increases driving this gap are an increase in expenditures
for projected wages including the impact of labor agreements ($64.6M), employee health
benefit increases ($10.6M), spending on technology and system maintenance ($7.6M), workers
compensation increases ($2.8M), and juror fee increases based on state legislation increasing
pay for jurors ($2M). Revenue declines are driven primarily by a decrease in the property tax
available to the general fund due to the Presidential election cycle ($23.4M) and an increase in
Debt Service ($25.0M) associated with significant legacy debt obligations. A continuing
decline in Circuit Court filings results in a projected total of $22.7 million decline in projected
revenue (Clerk of the Circuit Court ($17.5M), Sheriff (S6.1M)). Additionally, the change in
the timing of the Tax Sale under state legislation results in a decrease in revenue by $16.0
million. These decreases are offset by increases in the County’s non-property taxes of $10.3
million, primarily driven by projected economic growth in Sales Tax.
The Cook County Department of Transportation is in the process of developing the first
Long Range Transportation Plan for Cook County since 1940. Through that process, we
have determined a need for increased funding to support and rebuild our infrastructure. In
2016, an additional $10 million will be allocated to funding road construction projections,
while we look forward to 2017, where we will plan to increase funding by $64.5 million from
FY2015 funding levels, and dedicate all Motor Fuel Tax revenues to Highway funding in 2017
and future years.
The County Officers’ and Employee’s Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County continues
to face an annual actuarial funding gap of $449 million annually. The County has put
forward a comprehensive pension reform legislative package, but to date the State has not
adopted such measures. While the County will continue to advocate for equitable and
constitutionally sound pension reform, the FY2016 preliminary forecast incorporates a
fiscally responsible, alternative payment schedule that requires $270.5 million additional
funding in 2016, $340.7 million in additional funding in 2017 and 2% growth in payments
thereafter. These payments were set at the lowest possible level to pay down unfunded
pension liabilities by 2046, and limit the projected growth rate of future payments to 2% or
less.

Public Forum
A public hearing and online forum will be held on the preliminary budget on July 30, 2015 at
6:00 p.m. in the Cook County Board Room to obtain constituent feedback on budget
priorities. The Department of Budget and Management Services will work closely with
residents, elected officials, and County departments to review potential efficiencies and cost
savings opportunities that will allow for the presentation of a balanced budget
recommendation to the Board of Commissioners in October.

 PROJECTED 2015 YEAR-END REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES
Cook County’s General Fund is projected to end FY2015 with a $33.5 million shortfall, while
the Health Fund is projecting a $21.4 million surplus, for a combined deficit of $12.1 million
in the County’s major operating funds.

2015 Year-End Revenue Projection
General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues support the County’s general operating
funds and finance the Corporate, Public Safety and Health Enterprise funds and activities.
The total projected combined revenue for FY2015 year-end is $2,951 million, which
represents a 0.6 percent, or $16.5 million decrease from budgeted revenues.
General Fund
The total budgeted revenue for FY2015 is $1,432 million for the General Fund. The projected
year-end revenues of $1,397 million are lower than budgeted revenues by $35 million, or 2.4
percent. The projected decrease in revenues is mainly attributed to some projected one-time
revenues related to enforcement actions and settlements that are held in litigation and a
reduction in court case filings.
Health Enterprise Fund
The total budgeted revenue for FY2015 is $1,536 million for the Health Enterprise Fund. The
projected year-end revenues of $1,554 million are higher than budgeted revenues by $18.5
million, or 1.2 percent. The projected increase in revenues is mainly attributed to the
increased number of insured patients receiving services at CCHHS.
The County’s General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues are comprised of Property
Tax, Non-Property Taxes, Fees, Intergovernmental Revenues, Other Financing Sources and
Miscellaneous Revenue sources such as rental income from leasing space and energy efficiency
rebates.
Property Tax
The projected year-end Property Tax collection to the General and Health Enterprise Funds
for FY2015 remains at the budgeted amount of $351.1 million.
Non-Property Taxes
Several of the Non-Property Taxes are on track to meet or exceed the FY2015 budgeted
amounts. The projected year-end revenues of $816.7 million exceed budgeted revenues by
$4.8 million, or 0.6 percent. The County Use Tax projected year-end revenue for FY2015 is

4

 $77.9 million, representing a 6.1 percent, or $4.4 million increase from the budget due to
improved vehicle sales. A revenue source that has underperformed is the Other Tobacco
Products Tax as alternative products such as e-cigarettes have gained market share. Other
Tobacco Products Tax revenues in FY2015 are projected to be $6.2 million, representing a
24.0 percent, or $1.9 million decrease from the FY2015 budget.
General Fund Fees
The County General Fund receives various fees for certain services that departments within
the Fund perform. The fees charged by various County departments include fees for real
estate transactions, court case filings, permits, and licenses. General Fund fees are anticipated
to be $242.2 million for year-end FY2015. This represents a 7.2 percent, or $18.7 million
decrease in comparison to the FY2015 budget. The reduction is primarily due to a decrease in
court case filings.
County Health and Hospital System Fees
The Health Enterprise Fund receives fees from patient fees and supplemental payments for
care provided at County Hospitals. In addition, the Cook County Health and Hospital
System (CCHHS) operates a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN). MCCN
receives a fixed per member per month reimbursement for each of its 183,000 members.
CCHHS is projected to end FY2015 with fees totaling $1.39 billion, a 1.35 percent, or $18.5
million increase to the FY2015 budget. Some of these increased fees are, however, offset by
increased external network providers and pharmaceutical costs. The increased 2015 revenues
are mainly attributed to the increased number of insured patients receiving services at
CCHHS and the stabilization of Medicaid Fee-for-Service patients who have not yet
transferred to a Managed Care program.
Intergovernmental Revenues
The projected year-end Intergovernmental Revenues for FY2015 is $41.4 million, this
represents a $0.7 million, or 1.8 percent increase from the budgeted amount. The slight
increase in expected revenues is due to an increased subsidy from the State toward juvenile
detention officers.
Miscellaneous Revenues
The County is projecting to receive Miscellaneous Revenues totaling $28.6 million in FY2015;
this represents a $17.8 million, or 38.4 percent decrease from the FY2015 budget. The
decrease is driven by projected one-time revenues related to enforcement actions and
settlements that are held in litigation.

5

 Other Financing Sources
Other Financing Sources entails the Public Safety allocation of the Motor Fuel Tax as well as
Indirect Costs charged to Grants and Special Purpose Funds. The projected year-end Other
Financing Sources revenues for FY2015 are $75.3 million, this represents a $3.9 million, or 4.9
percent decrease from the budgeted amount. The slight decrease in expected revenues is due
to lower than expected indirect costs charged to Grants.

2015 Year-End Expenditure Estimate
Year-end expenditures in the General Fund are projected to have a $1.5 million positive
variance. Cautionary measures, including a 1% holdback to the appropriation on personnel
accounts and an additional 2% appropriation holdback on non-personnel accounts have
driven this favorable variance. Expenditures in the second half of the year are anticipated to
be impacted by labor agreements increasing wages and retroactive payments estimated at $29.2
million. Also contributing are increased employee benefit costs ($5.0M) over budget,
predominantly driven by the high growth rate in specialty pharmacy costs. These increases
are partially offset by lower than anticipated ($6.9M) correctional officer overtime associated
with the decreasing jail population and Sheriff’s office management initiatives.
The Health Fund is expected to spend about $3.0 million less than the 2015 appropriation. In
the Health Fund, $21.3 million savings in the personnel accounts during the first half of the
year will be offset by the impact of labor agreements and $16.8 million over budget in
overtime accounts. The Health Fund is also projecting to be $3.0 million under budget in the
cost of health benefits.
The tables on the following pages detail the 2015 revenue projections and expenditure
estimates by department.

 2016 PRELIMINARY FORECAST
The outlook for FY2016 includes a $198.8 shortfall projected in the General Fund, which
includes an increase in legacy debt service payments of $25 million. This projected operating
deficit does not reflect a need for increased funding for highway infrastructure of $10 million,
and an additional $270.5 million in funding for pensions that will put the County on a path to
address the outstanding unfunded pension liability in the County Employee’s Annuity and
Benefit Fund of Cook County in 30 years, creating a $479.3 million projected total deficit for
FY2016.

2016 Revenue Overview
The preliminary revenue estimate for FY2016 is $2,933 million for the General and Health
Enterprise Funds. This represents a 1.2 percent, or $35 million decrease from the FY2015
budget.
The County’s General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues are comprised of Property
Tax, Non-Property Taxes, Fees, Intergovernmental Revenues, Other Financing Sources and
Miscellaneous Revenue sources such as rental income from leasing space and energy efficiency
rebates.
General Fund
The preliminary estimate for General Fund revenues in FY2016 is $1,499 million, an increase
of $66.3 million, or 4.63 percent compared to FY2015 budgeted revenues. This figure does
not account for the pending revenue allocation which subsidizes the Health Enterprise Fund.
The anticipated subsidy is $164 million.
Health Enterprise Fund
The preliminary estimate for Health Enterprise Fund revenues in FY2016 is $1,434 million, a
decrease of $101.3 million, or 6.6 percent compared to FY2015 budgeted revenues. This
figure does not account for the pending revenue allocation from the General Fund which
subsidizes the Health Enterprise Fund. The anticipated subsidy is $164 million.
The County’s General Fund and Health Enterprise Fund revenues are comprised of Property
Tax, Non-Property Taxes, Fees, Intergovernmental Revenues, Other Financing Sources and
Miscellaneous Revenue sources such as rental income from leasing space and energy efficiency
rebates.

12

 Property Tax
The preliminary estimate for Property Tax revenues in FY2016 is $310.3 million, reduced
from the prior fiscal year budget by $40.8 million primarily due to $25 million in rising debt
service obligations and $23.4 million in election costs due to the presidential election cycle.
Non-Property Taxes
The preliminary estimate for revenues for Non-Property Taxes for FY2016 is $822.3 million,
which is $10.3 million more than prior year budgeted revenues of $812 million. The
estimated increase in Non-Property Tax revenues are primarily linked to modestly improved
Sales Tax collections as a result of economic forecasts suggesting a moderate improvement in
conditions during FY2016.
General Fund Fees
The County General Fund receives various fees for certain services that departments within
the Fund perform. The fees charged by various County departments include fees for real
estate transactions, court case filings, permits, and licenses. The preliminary estimate for
General Fund fees in FY2016 is $222 million, a $20.2 million, or 8.3 percent decrease in
comparison to FY2015 year-end revenues. This is the result of State legislation moving up the
annual delinquent tax sale by 8 months as well as a continual decrease in court case filings.
County Health and Hospital System Fees
The Health Enterprise Fund receives fees from patient fees and supplemental payments for
care provided at County Hospitals. In addition, the Cook County Health and Hospital
System (CCHHS) operates a Managed Care Community Network (MCCN). MCCN
receives a fixed per member per month reimbursement for each of its 183,000 members.
CCHHS preliminary estimate for fees in FY2016 increases 3.2 percent, or $44.3 million to
$1.43 billion compared to year-end FY2015. The continued rise is due to improved billing
efforts and the renegotiation of all Medicaid health plans which will increase volume.
Intergovernmental Revenues
The preliminary estimate for Intergovernmental Revenues for FY2016 is $40.7 million, which
is the same as the prior year budget.
Miscellaneous Revenues
The preliminary estimate for Miscellaneous Revenues for FY2016 is $22.9 million, which is a
decrease of $5.6 million, or 32.7 percent compared to FY2015 year-end revenues due in part to
anticipated decreases in energy efficiency rebates and previous one-time revenues related to
enforcement actions and settlements.

13

 Other Financing Sources
Other Financing Sources entails the Public Safety allocation of the Motor Fuel Tax as well as
Indirect Costs charged to Grants and Special Purpose Funds. The preliminary estimate for
Other Financing Sources for FY2016 is $75.3 million, which is the same as FY2015 year-end
revenues.

Projected 2016 Expenditures
General Fund
Total FY2016 expenditures in the General Fund are projected to increase by $101.1 million
over the FY2015 appropriation. This increase is driven by rising personnel costs ($64.62M) as
a result of the full year impact of the 2015 mid-year wage increase, a scheduled 2% cost of
living adjustment, and scheduled step increases. Another key driver of increasing expenses are
rising employee health benefit costs ($10.6) which are expected to rise at the rate of medical
inflation. These increases are mitigated, however, by plan design changes and increased
contributions for health benefits agreed to in the labor agreements.
Non-personnel spending is also forecast to increase by 5.6% over 2015 appropriations.
Contributing non-personnel factors include increased technology spending as a result of
upgrades and maintenance obligations ($7.4M) and increases in workers compensation costs
($2.8M). Increased juror fees ($2.0M) as a result of State legislation increasing juror pay rates
increases impact the Chief Judge’s budget and the Juvenile Probation non-personnel budget is
projected to be $2.5 million over 2015, including a reduction in State DCFS reimbursements
of $850,000. Increased contractual rates for electronic monitoring ($1.7M) and food costs for
the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center ($440,000) and the Cook County Jail ($428,000) are
expected based on contract escalation. Postage costs at the assessor are also anticipated to
increase by $460,000 due to the City assessments in the triennial assessment cycle.
Health Fund
Health Fund expenditures are expected to increase by $63 million from the 2015
appropriation, a 4.1% increase from the prior year with budgeted expenses for FY2016
totaling $1.6 billion. The primary drivers of the cost increases continue to be personnel
expenditures, as well as an increase in the average monthly membership in the CountyCare
program. The average monthly membership in 2015 is 149,200 CountyCare members, and
this number is expected to increase to 186,439 in fiscal year 2016. This increase in the average
CountyCare monthly membership will increase the amount of claims for healthcare services
received by these additional members.

14

 Debt Service Fund
Rising debt service costs have a direct impact on the General Fund that is shown as a decrease
in Property Tax revenue available. Increases in required debt service payments on legacy debt
increase by $25.0 million in 2016, and will continue to rise through 2022. These costs do not
include any new debt that the County may need in coming years to fund investments in its
facilities. Debt Service rises by $30 million again in 2017, and levels off at approximately $300
million in 2022 versus the $225 million that was budgeted in 2015.
During 2009 and 2010 the County sold a significant amount of new money debt,
approximately $686 million, which was structured for a roughly $100 million increase in debt
service in the 2011. Subsequent refinancing of this legacy debts service has allowed the
County to create a multi-year ramp, and even though the County has limited the issuance of
new money borrowing in recent years and has $236 million less debt outstanding than in
FY2015 than in FY2011, the County’s debt levels remain very elevated versus peer Counties
across the nation. The County will continue to limit issuance of new debt as it has during the
last four years; however when the projected cost of new capital improvements is forecast it is
anticipated that the debt service figure will actually peak at $354 million in coming years.
Highway Infrastructure Funding
The Cook County Highway Department produced a Detailed Study of Highway Plan for
Cook County dated August, 1940. Since that time, there has not been another long range
transportation planning effort led by the County until recent efforts. In 2014, the
Department of Transportation and Highways embarked upon the current initiative that will
result in the development of Cook County’s 2040 Transportation Plan. A need for increased
funding for Roads and Bridges has been identified in the planning process.
As far back as at least 1997, Motor Fuel Tax (MFT) has been used to support Circuit Court
Operations. In FY2016, we will begin a rollback of the MFT funds supporting court
operations. By 2017, all MFT funds ($64.5M over 2015 funding levels) will be allocated to the
Department of Transportation and Highways.

 Pension Fund
The County Officers’ and Employees’

retirement and disability benefits to
qualified employees of Cook County. The
benefit structure is defined by state law, and
this benefit structure drives the actuarial
cost of the associated benefits. Repeated
amendments to the pension benefit
structure were adopted by the State
Legislature and signed into law between 1984 and 2002. The funding from the County and
employees has also been set by state law. The Pension Fund was 94% funded in 2000, even
when including retiree healthcare funding (and roughly 100% funded when netting out the
costs associated with retiree healthcare). However, in light of the significant benefit increases
enacted by the State in 2002 (without any commensurate increase in statutory funding by
employees and the County) along with the severe market downturns in 2001 and 2008, the
current statutory payments lead to a fund that only continues to worsen dramatically in the
years to come, much like a consumer who pays the minimum on a credit card balance and can
never get ahead.
The Fund’s independent actuary has identified that the current payment the County and
employees send to the Fund under State law is $449 million less than an Actuarial Required
Contribution (“ARC”). As a result, unfunded interest compounds for future generations, and
within a decade if nothing is done the increased annual interest cost alone exceeds the $449
million shortfall today. The graph on this page demonstrates the exponential growth in
interest costs if nothing is done to address this challenge.
Though the County has attempted to work with the Governor and the State legislature to
address this problem in recent years, to date the State has failed to enact reforms that would
address the Fund’s long term structural imbalance. The County put forward a comprehensive
plan with support from both employee unions as well as groups representing the local
business community, but without action the problems continue to compound.
The County has designed an alternate payment schedule to achieve the lowest possible
payment that allows the pension liabilities to be paid off in 30 years and still see growth in

16

 payments of no more than 2% in future years if actuarial assumptions are met. The growth
rate of 2% was designed to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s long-term target for
inflation. Put simply, we do not believe that a payment structure that relies on overly
optimistic future tax revenue growth assumptions in excess of inflation will be sustainable for
the County in the long-run. This alternative payment schedule requires additional funding
above and beyond the $195 million outlined in the Pension Code, with $270.53 million
additional in 2016, $340.70 million in additional funding in 2017 and 2% growth in payments
thereafter.
While the County will continue to work towards equitable and constitutionally sound
pension reforms, we have included in the Preliminary Forecast for 2016 budgetary figures
associated with a solution to the Pension Fund’s challenges that acknowledges the legislature
and governor’s lack of action on pension reform to date, as the County, the Fund, and plan
participants cannot afford to wait for the State to address these challenges.

CONCLUSION
The fiscal environment for the County remains challenging. The figures for Fiscal Year 2015
indicate a need for corrective action on expenditures. The Preliminary Forecast for Fiscal
Year 2016 is also challenging, with both revenue and expenditure pressures projected. In
FY2016 the County anticipates targeting both expenditure and revenue solutions to address a
long-term comprehensive plan to remake County government as more efficient entity, while
addressing the long-term challenges associated with legacy debt service, the solvency of the
Pension Fund, and highway infrastructure funding. These challenges only become more
expensive to address with the passage of time, and we cannot kick these costs down the road
to our children and grandchildren. The administration looks forward to working with the
Board of Commissioners, elected offices, taxpayers, employees and other stakeholders to
address the challenges. The tables that follow provide further analysis as described in this
summary overview.
