EXPLANATION
In 2004, the CHA issued RFS 04-01309-01 to replace its existing system applications for
finance, human resources, payroll and purchasing to 53 pre-qualified vendors in the management
consulting category and received 4 responses. Upon review and after an extensive and thorough
competitive negotiation process, the CHA selected the joint proposal of Blackwell Consulting
and Lawson Software for award under the procurement. As joint awardees, Blackwell and
60 East Van Buren · Chicago, Illinois 60605 · (312)913-7282· www.thecha.org

 Lawson cooperatively supplied and implemented the Lawson Enterprise Resource Planning
system under Contract No. 9777. As a component of the implementation, Lawson Software, Inc.
(“Lawson”) provided its copyrighted ERP software platform, system and applications
(collectively, the “Lawson System”) to the CHA under a perpetual license term. At the time of
procurement and award, the CHA negotiated annual support and maintenance pricing for up to
five (5) years from the acceptance of the Lawson System. The CHA has exercised its rights to
annual support and maintenance under Contract 9777 for each of the five (5) years since the
completed implementation, and the negotiated pricing and terms for Lawson maintenance and
support under Contract 9777 will expire on December 31, 2010.
Given the pending expiration of Contract 9777, the CHA now seeks to secure maintenance and
support services for an additional period of two (2) years by entering into an annually renewable
support and maintenance services contract with Lawson Software, Inc. to continue to support the
Lawson System implemented and in use at the CHA. It was originally envisioned that the
selected ERP system contemplated under RFS 04-01309-01 would suit the agency’s needs for a
period between seven to ten years (presuming no significant changes in market conditions), and
the Lawson System has performed to those expectations for the first five years since
implementation. The Lawson System continues to serve valuable operations and functions for
the CHA, and its future maintenance and support was approved for sole source procurement for
the requested two (2) year contract term.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The Lawson System was procured as a result of a competitive procurement process under RFS
04-01309-01, released to the ITS “Pre-Qualified” vendor pool in 2004 for the purposes of
designing and implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning system. Because of the
proprietary nature of the software, platform and applications comprising the Lawson System,
sole source procurement continues as a necessary requirement for the application’s support and
maintenance needs, including foundation upgrades. The Department of Procurement and
Contracts approved the original sole source procurement for the original Lawson Maintenance
Service Agreement in 2004 as part of Contract No. 9777, formalizing the initial two year
maintenance term with fixed pricing for additional annual maintenance and support terms for up
to five years in total. Additionally, the Department of Procurement and Contracts later approved
sole source procurement for the Lawson 9 Foundation Upgrade to the Lawson System
implemented in 2007 to assure continued optimal performance and usability in accordance with
the agency’s designated intent.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the Chicago Housing Authority to enter into a
two (2) year contract with Lawson Software, Inc. for Lawson Support and Maintenance in an
amount not-to-exceed $430,115.75.
