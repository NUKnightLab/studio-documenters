If we can be of further assistance please call upon us.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN THE CITY OF 
OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY
AND THE
DETROIT CITY 
GREEN TASK FORCE

This Memorandum of Understanding dated 2019, is entered into by the City of
Detroit?s Office of Sustainability and the Detroit City Council?s Green Task Force (GTF) in an
effort to cooperate and coordinate their respective expertise by allowing the 005 to receive from GTF in
an advisory capacity information relative to greenhouse reduction initiatives.

RECITALS:

A. In 2017, the Mayor's office established the 005 with a mission to create healthy, green, vibrant,
accessible neighborhoods where all Detroiters can contribute and benefit through: Collaboration
between City departments and agencies; (ii) Engagement and partnership among the City, citizens, and
relevant organizations; and Process and policy improvement.

B. The GTF has been established pursuant to City Council Rules Section 3.5.3 Special Committees,
subsection 3.5.3.2 Taskforce, that allows for the creation of a taskforce for the purpose of studying a
particular problem or issue that is limited to one year, but may be renewed annually by resolution.

C. The GTF has the dual focus of promoting internal sustainability practices to help City
Government become more energy efficient and also to promote a sustainability agenda throughout
Detroit as a whole.

D. The Administration and the City Council are in agreement that the collaboration between the
005 and the GTF would be effective and efficient in the promotion and development of greenhouse gas
reduction initiatives and have reached a mutual understanding as to the following:

Section 1, Purpose: The purpose of the MOU is to provide the 005 the availability to engage with
the GTF as an advisory body with regard to developing greenhouse gas deduction initiatives. The City
Charter, Section?6-509 Green Initiatives and Technologies, provides that the City will implement a long-
term strategic plan ("Green Initiatives and Sustainable Technologies Plan" or Plan") for the
establishment, use and support of green initiatives, technologies and businesses, utilizing public and
private partners. In furtherance ofthat objective, Subsection 6-5096} provides that the Mayor may
create advisory commissions under section 7?103 to assist with the development, monitoring,
implementation and revision of the GIST Plan.

Section 2, Authority: The Administration and the City Council mutually understand that pursuant to
the City Charter, 7-103, Advisory Commissions, that it is within the purview of the Mayor to establish
advisory commissions to advise the Mayor or any administrative department. This MOU is entered into
by and between the legislative and executive branches of government and that the Administration is
selecting the GTF to serve in an advisory capacity pursuant to the authority granted under Section 7-103.

Section 3, GTF: The 005 entering this MOU understands that the GTF is established pursuant to
City Council Rules of Procedure, Subsection 3.5.3.2 Taskforce. The representatives of the GTF consist of

1

numerous environmental advocacy groups, non-profit organizations, environmental businesses,
government employees and residents and will be available in an advisOry capacity as long as the GTF
continues to be established pursuant to City Council Rules. The GTF is established for one year and may
be renewed annually by resolution.

Section 4, Term: This MOU shall be effective as ofthe date upon which it is signed by the
authorized representative of the 005, and a resolution by the City Council of approval is obtained. The
MOU will remain in effect unless or until the 005 submits a written notice of termination of the MOU to
City Council and/or the GTF has been dissolved or discontinued. Upon termination of the MOU, the
authority granted pursuant to Section 7-103 allowing the GTF to be utilized in an advisory capacity shall
be voided.

This MOU being executed by the Parties:

Given the relatively small size and timeframe of this award, this opportunity will be used to
develop and pilot the social media campaign in the City of Detroit. The proposed activities will be
completed within the two-year period of performance. A sustainability plan will be developed and,
if successful, the campaign will be expanded throughout the DEMA (and possibly the State).

As this funding is provided in the form of a cooperative agreement, it is the perfect opportunity for
the Part A Program to have the support of the Health Resources and Services Administration in
developing, launching and evaluating this campaign. Through this partnership, the Part A Program
will be better placed to use social media in its work and who work on the campaign will
gain leadership skills they can apply to ending the epidemic.

This is a new proposal and is not an expansion of a previously funded Part A activity.

CC: Stephanie Washington, Mayor?s Of?ce I
VIA: Hon. Brenda Jones, City Council President

DATE: 11 July 2019

RE: RTCC CAMERA ACCESS AND VIRTUAL PATROL

I have several questions regarding the use of Real Time Crime Center cameras, the installation of
new cameras, and the access of pre-existing cameras as follows:

Where will the cameras be located?

What determines why they will be located in a speci?c area?

Will the cameras be permanent or mobile?

What is the time frame for installation?

Will live feed/streaming access strictly be prompted for use during virtual patrol?
If still frames are used to establish probable cause, will they be restricted to capture
during Virtual patrol?



Please provide a detailed response by 15 July 2019. If you have any questions do not hesitate to
contact my of?ce at, 313-224-1198.

FROM: Council Member Raquel Castaneda-Lopez 
DATE: July II, 2019
RE: Contract 6002039 Real Time Crime Center Expansion

 

Please provide the following information related to the Green Light Program expansion:

When will Council receive the report from the MSU research group conducting the comprehensive
analysis of the Green Light program?

The DPD policy related to traf?c light mounted cameras provides that immigration uses are
prohibited. Is there a similar prohibition for non?traffic light mounted cameras?

standard operating procedure for facial recognition technology states that the Crime
Investigation Unit is ?authorized to submit requests for face recognition searches to be performed by
external entities that own and maintain face image repositories.? I-Iave these requests been made? To
which external entities?

Has DPD connected its facial recognition systems to body?worn cameras or drone footage?

standard operating procedure states that the facial recognition information will not be sold,
published, exchanged, or disclosed to commercial or private entities or individuals except ?to the
extent authorized by agreement with the commercial vendor?. Please provide a copy ofthe
agreement and indicate the relevant language authorizing this sharing of information.

To date, have there been any instances of outside agencies requesting face recognition searches or
data from 

What law enforcement agencies currently maintain a MOU or interagency agreement with DPD in
order to share these images or other data obtained? Provide copies of each existing MOU

Provide any research studies that show that surveillance cameras reduce, prevent, or deter violent
crime.

In light of emerging research that suggests facial recognition software may misidentify certain
groups more than others, in particular African American women, what is the Department?s strategy
to mitigate the potential disproportionate negative impact?

Please contact my office 3) 224?2450 if you have any questions.
