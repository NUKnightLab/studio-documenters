 Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’
Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago
Policy Regarding Businesses Owned by
Minorities, Females, and Persons with Disabilities
for Administrative Contracts and Service Agreements
WHEREAS, the trustees of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of
Chicago (“LABF”) recognize a commitment to the success of businesses owned by minorities, females,
and persons with a disability and acknowledge the competitive advantage diversity brings to the business
environment; and
WHEREAS, the trustees of LABF are dedicated to promoting opportunities to award administrative
contracts and service agreements executed on behalf of LABF to businesses owned by minorities,
females, and persons with disabilities; and
WHEREAS, while recognizing this initiative, the trustees acknowledge their fiduciary responsibilities to
LABF regarding best price and execution for all contracts for the purchase of services entered into on
behalf of LABF; and
WHEREAS, the Executive Director shall report to the Retirement Board annually on all contracts let for
contractual services; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly of Illinois amended the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/1-109.1(6),
to require entities subject to the Pension Code, including LABF, to adopt a policy that sets forth goals for
utilization of businesses owned by minorities, females, and persons with disabilities, as those terms are
defined in the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Females, and Persons with Disabilities Act, 30 ILCS
575/1 et seq., for all contracts and services and annually review the established goals.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT, the trustees of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board
Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago approve this policy to include the utilization of qualified
businesses owned by minorities, females, and persons with disabilities in any search for administrative
contracts and service agreements that may be conducted by the Fund. Within the bounds of fiduciary and
financial prudence, it shall be the goal of LABF to expend between 15% and 20% of its spending on
administrative contracts and service agreements from businesses owned by minorities, females, and
persons with disabilities.

Page 1 of 2

 This policy shall be reviewed annually and reported to the Governor and the General Assembly as
required by the Pension Code.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that this is a true copy of a Policy duly reviewed by the Retirement Board of the
Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago at a meeting held on
April 23, 2019. The Policy was originally adopted at a meeting held on November 17, 2009, and

WHEREAS, the trustees of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of
Chicago (“LABF”) recognize the competitive advantage diversity brings to the business environment and
remain dedicated to creating an inclusive business environment by increasing the diversity of LABF’s
fiduciaries and professional management; and
WHEREAS, in the procurement of consulting services for consultants,1 who act as fiduciaries2 on behalf
of LABF, the Retirement Board will continue to require the inclusion of qualified service providers who
are minority owned businesses, female owned businesses, and businesses owned by a person with a
disability, as those terms are defined in the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Females, and Persons with
Disabilities Act, 30 ILCS 575/1 et seq.; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly of Illinois amended the Illinois Pension Code, 40 ILCS 5/1-109.1(5),
to require entities subject to the Pension Code, including LABF, to adopt a policy that sets forth goals for
increasing the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of its fiduciaries, consultants and senior staff and
annually review the established goals.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT, the trustees of the Laborers’ and Retirement Board
Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago approve this policy to expend all reasonable and prudent
efforts to use and retain fiduciaries, consultants, and senior staff that are diverse based on race, ethnicity,
and gender. This policy shall be reviewed annually.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that this is a true copy of a Policy duly reviewed by the Retirement Board of the
Laborers’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity & Benefit Fund of Chicago, at a meeting held on
