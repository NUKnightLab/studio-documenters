Where the remains of any dead human body are to be cremated, thus becoming
unavailable for later examination, it shall be the duty of the funeral director or person having

custody of the dead human body to obtain from the Medical Examiner a Ppermit to Gcremate.

The Medical Examiner may deny a P?permit to Gcremate, if it is necessary to preserve
the body for law enforcement purposes.

Records Act," as heretofore or hereafter amended.

Sec. 38-144. - Fees.

The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 32-
1 of this Code.

(1) Autopsy report.

(2) Toxicology report.

(3) Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.

(4) Permit to Ggremate a dead human body obtained from the Of?ce of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic ?ling, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the
decedent and the authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or other

special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's discretion.

to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify that families have ?inds for
burial prior to removing a body from the Of?ce of the Medical Examiner. 1n the cases of
funeral homes, this "storage fee" would replace the ?return fee" if a funeral home returns
a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body being stored is not picked up
within ten days from the date of storage, the body will be disposed of in accordance with
Sec. 38?132. -- - . - .
