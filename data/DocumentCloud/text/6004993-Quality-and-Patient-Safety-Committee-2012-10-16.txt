Report from System Chief Medical Officer
As part of his report, Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, presented a short video that he received
at a recent National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH) conference; the video
addressed the subject of hospital governing boards and their responsibilities toward quality.
Chairman Michael commented on the information contained in the video. He stated that it summarized in a
cogent way the direction that the System needs to go. He noted that one of the discussion points for this
meeting relates to data collection and measurement; the System needs to have a consensus on what are the “big
dot” or System-wide issues or goals that are important - that discussion will begin today on what some of those
“big dot” items might be.

IV.

Report from System Interim Chief Nursing Officer
Tanda Russell, System Interim Chief Nursing Officer, provided an update on staffing and recruitment activities.
She stated that there are approximately two hundred (200) registered nurse vacancies System-wide. She added
that she is working on finalizing a nursing dashboard; the dashboard should be ready to be presented at the next
Committee Meeting.

Report from System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety (Attachment #1)
Dr. Krishna Das, System Interim Director of Quality and Patient Safety, provided an overview of her report
regarding The Joint Commission and the preparations for the upcoming survey at John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital
of Cook County. Subjects covered in the report included the following: Survey Overview; Areas of Emphasis;
Preparation Plans; and Messages to Staff. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Following the presentation of the report, Chairman Michael stated that it is expected that an educational session
will be provided on the subject for the Committee Members following the November meeting.

VI.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Pierre Wakim, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of Provident Hospital of Cook County,
was unable to attend this meeting as he was attending a conference; he will provide a report at the next
Committee Meeting.
Dr. David Goldberg, President of the EMS of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, provided a
summary of the following subjects that have discussed at recent meetings of the EMS: The Joint
Commission survey preparations; Meaningful Use; Patient Experience; Section 1115 Waiver – financial and
care provision components; and Schwartz Rounds.
Director Velasquez inquired regarding the subject of reduction in productivity related to the implementation
of electronic medical records; this was referenced earlier by a public speaker during the portion of the
meeting reserved for public testimony. Dr. Goldberg stated that in his clinic, the numbers are no different;
it sometimes requires a little bit more time in the actual clinic setting to finish the work. He added that
many of the doctors are connected online, so more people are either staying late or taking work home for
evenings and weekends to complete their documentation. He stated that he did not think that the upgrade to
the EMR system was at the expense of the number of patient encounters overall. Chairman Michael noted
that this is a good example of a subject to which the Committee should pay attention, particularly as it
moves forward with the discussion of quality measures.
Dr. Mason clarified that the electronic medical record system is being upgraded – this is not a first-time
implementation. The following individuals provided further comments on the subject: Dr. Enrique
Martinez, Interim Chief Operating Officer of the Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook
County (ACHN); and Dr. David Barker, Chief Medical Officer of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center of
Cook County. With regard to productivity in the ACHN clinics for August, Dr. Martinez stated that the
number of visits in the clinics was approximately 50,000 visits for the month; in September, there was a two
or three percent (2-3%) reduction in the visits, but overall, the numbers were pretty much the same. Dr.
Barker stated that the CORE Center is meeting almost all of the requirements of Meaningful Use; he noted
that the one requirement that that staff is struggling with is the “depart process.”

VII. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Updates on the following topics:
 Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) (Attachment #2)
Overview of current EMR and reports generated using the EMR database; discussion of development of
new reports/uses of EMR to improve patient care
Dr. Bala Hota, System Interim Chief Information Officer, presented the update on EMRs, which
included information on the following subjects: Current State of EHR; Functionality Added;
Challenges; Roadmap for Quality Measurement; Open Source Reporting Server; Waiver RegistryTechnology Stack; Development of Rules; Rules Development-Pediatric; and Barriers. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Michael inquired whether all users had completed the online training. Dr. Hota responded that
approximately 98% of nursing staff and over 70% of the physicians had completed the training. With
regard to feedback received from the users regarding the training, he stated that the biggest complaint
was that it took a long time, as the total time to go through all of the modules is approximately four (4)
hours. Chairman Michael inquired regarding any other training opportunities offered to users who may
need additional training assistance. Dr. Hota stated that currently, within the Cerner application, there is
a tool called “Learning Live” that is available to all Cerner users. There is currently one-half (1/2) of a
full-time equivalent employee (FTE) of training staff; that person is available for drop-in training, but
that is not really enough to support ongoing live training. Through some supplemental funding Dr. Hota
hired an additional person to come in several days a month; the administration is also exploring the idea
of including some training services through the Cerner contract in the upcoming year. Following further
discussion on the subject, Chairman Michael requested that Dr. Hota review and consider the current
training opportunities for the EMR system and return to the Committee in November or December with
suggestions on what type of training resources and level of appropriation increase may be needed to
enhance or improve the EMR training1.
Director Muñoz inquired regarding the specific measures that are required to be met for Meaningful Use.
Dr. Hota responded that he can forward this information to Director Muñoz2.
With regard to the information presented on barriers, Chairman Michael inquired regarding the key
aims/goals/measures for the System. He noted that the System has some in mind, because some are
mandated; for the ones that are not mandated, does the System have a clear enough picture today to
know what the Board and management would want? For example, has the business intelligence team
prioritized, in terms of producing reports and extracting data, or is that something that needs further
work? Dr. Hota responded that there are measures that already exist that would be the natural starting
point.
 Current Quality Measures/Reporting
Overview of current reports being generated and made for compliance and other purposes
 Developing a Quality Dashboard (Attachment #3)
Discussion concerning the process and high-level timetable for developing a Quality Dashboard
Dr. Das presented a report which contained the following information regarding Quality dashboards and
quality measures/reporting: Types of Dashboards; CCHHS Comparison Dashboard; External Reporting;
Example: Hospital Compare Preview; and Proposed Quality Dashboard (Inpatient). Additionally, she
provided two (2) examples of reports for the Committee’s information (included in Attachment #3). The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

VII. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Updates on the following topics:
 Current Quality Measures/Reporting and Developing a Quality Dashboard (continued)
Mary Driscoll noted that the information contained on page five (5) of the presentation incorrectly
reflects the organization responsible for the Illinois Hospital Report Card; the Report Card is published
by the Illinois Department of Public Health. For the Committee’s information, she noted that the volume
and cost indicators included in that report are pulled from the System’s billing data.
With regard to patient safety indicators, Chairman Michael asked for Dr. Das’ overall assessment of the
validity of those measures, in terms of really providing an indication of how well the System is doing in
avoiding issues of risk to patients. Dr. Das stated that the vast majority of the “hospital acquired
conditions” are truly manifestations of patient safety in the hospital; as part of the efforts to improve
patient safety, there are interventions that have been specified in all of these areas, in order to reduce the
risk of harm to the patients.
Chairman Michael inquired whether there is a set of these patient safety indicators that management
thinks would be valuable for this Committee to see on a monthly basis, that reflects whether the System
is getting better or worse or staying the same, in terms of these indicators; this is assuming that reports
could be received on these sorts of criteria in a very timely manner. Dr. Das responded that this data is
collected monthly. She stated that she would favor looking at this as a group; of the forty (40) events
this month, she would recommend tracking it and subdividing it into infection control indicators and
nursing-specific indicators.
As a follow-up to this meeting, Chairman Michael requested that Dr. Das come back at the next
Committee Meeting with a final recommendation on what the plan would be moving forward,
specifically on the patient safety indicators that she thinks would be appropriate for the Committee to see
on a monthly basis, as an indicator of how the System is doing3. He suggested that the Committee
Members review the information received at this meeting to see if they believe there are other critical
areas that should be included in the dashboard; additionally, he recommended that the subject be
discussed at the next Board Meeting4. He stated that it is important to get feedback from the Board,
because this is a full Board responsibility, and he wants to ensure that everyone is comfortable that the
Committee is looking at the right areas for the dashboard. Dr. Das noted that the information presented
at this meeting is all inpatient data; there is equivalent outpatient data that as it is collected should be
presented for consideration, as well.
 Updating the Quality Plan
Discussion concerning the process and high-level timetable for updating the current Quality Plan
Chairman Michael stated that the System has a quality plan; for now, because of the Joint Commission
activities, it will remain as it is, but it is not too early to begin thinking about the preparations for 2013 to
update and improve the quality plan. He noted that it will go hand-in-hand with the kinds of things that
Dr. Mason presented in the video; that is, a decision driven by the medical and nursing staff and
supported by the Board and other interested members of the community to identify the main aims for the
System.
Director Muñoz stated that some of these aims are more of that of the level of the Board; he
recommended that perhaps this discussion should take place at the Board level. Chairman Michael
agreed; he noted that the role of this Committee is to encourage the process along and to make sure all
understand the process.

VII. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
B. Updates on the following topics:
 Updating the Quality Plan (continued)
Dr. Linda Rae Murray, Chief Medical Officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health, noted
that most of the data that this Committee reviews is hospital-centric; as the Board considers this subject,
she recommended having Dr. Sandy Martell, Interim Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County
Department of Public Health, come in and talk about population measures or what kind of equity
measures the Board and Committee should be looking at. Chairman Michael agreed. He stated that the
people in the community should be engaged; he welcomed that input and dialogue. Director Muñoz
added that one of the issues that the Board has discussed in the past few years is how the System’s
partners can be engaged to work together with the System to achieve success with the System’s “big
aims.”
With regard to the issue of patient safety indicators and how this Committee will play a role in
overseeing that process, in order to remain involved and understand what’s going on, Chairman Michael
suggested that the Committee Members participate as ex-officio members of the existing internal
committees that review those cases on a monthly basis.

The priority index combines information about your organization's performance and the relative importance of each question to respondents' overall rating.
Higher priority is given to those issues that are relatively more important to respondents (higher correlation coefficients) and relatively lower performing
(lower percentile rank) for your organization. Questions are listed in decreasing priority. To provide stability, the Priority Index is based on the prior rolling 12
month period.

The priority index combines information about your organization's performance and the relative importance of each question to respondents' overall rating.
Higher priority is given to those issues that are relatively more important to respondents (higher correlation coefficients) and relatively lower performing
(lower percentile rank) for your organization. Questions are listed in decreasing priority. To provide stability, the Priority Index is based on the prior rolling 12
month period.

The priority index combines information about your organization's performance and the relative importance of each question to respondents' overall rating.
Higher priority is given to those issues that are relatively more important to respondents (higher correlation coefficients) and relatively lower performing
(lower percentile rank) for your organization. Questions are listed in decreasing priority. To provide stability, the Priority Index is based on the prior rolling 12
month period.

The priority index combines information about your organization's performance and the relative importance of each question to respondents' overall rating.
Higher priority is given to those issues that are relatively more important to respondents (higher correlation coefficients) and relatively lower performing
(lower percentile rank) for your organization. Questions are listed in decreasing priority. To provide stability, the Priority Index is based on the prior rolling 12
month period.
