the Department of Human Resources/Training have completed all necessary due diligence to support
the submission of this initiative and recommend the approval of this item accordingly.
CORPORATE GOAL
Guiding Principles: Engage in responsible and effective management strategies to achieve the best use
of our assets.
Goal 2, Strategy 2: Foster an improved institutional culture around a shared vision of excellence.
FUNDING:
General Fund
GENERAL BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION
It is critical that CHA provide a compensation plan that has competitive salaries in order to attract and
retain top talent. The existing method of compensation administration is no longer adequate. Typically
companies perform market and compensation analysis annually or bi-annually. The CHA has not
conducted an authority-wide compensation and classification study since 1996. Hay Management
Consultants was selected in 1994 after participating in CHA’s procurement process and worked over a
two year period to classify positions, create job descriptions, limit title redundancies and create a new
salary structure.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority Board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Chief of Staff concurs with the recommendation to participate in City Colleges of Chicago Contract
for Compensation and Classification Study, to have Deloitte Consulting, LLP perform such study for the
CHA in an amount not-to exceed $149,500.
The Chief Executive Officer recommends the approval to participate in City Colleges of Chicago
Contract with Deloitte Consulting, LLP for Compensation and Classification Study.
