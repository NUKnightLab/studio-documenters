PURPOSE:

The "Policy for Asset and Inventory Management" de?nes requirements for recording, inventorying,
maintaining and disposal of assets to promote ef?cient and effective asset utilization throughout their
useful lives and appropriate disposal of assets when they are no longer being utilized by the Chicago
Public Schools (CPS). This policy, and procedures created from this policy, are based on and will be
maintained to comply with the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), "State and Federal Grant
Administration Policy: Fiscal Requirements and Procedures,? and with ?Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards? (2 CFR 200), in addition to
CPS internal controls.

SCOPE:

This policy covers all tangible, nonexpendable items. or non- real estate purchased by or donated to CPS
having a value of greater than $500 but less than $25,000 per unit and a useful life of more than one
year as well as ?walkable? technology assets (tablets, chromebooks, mobile phones, etc. as de?ned by
the CPS Chief Information Of?cer) These items are identi?ed in this policy as ?."assets

APPLICABILITY: 

This policy applies to all CPS organizational units, including central of?ce departments, network offices,
and schools. Each organizational unit accountable of?cial is responsible for the recording, inventorying,
and maintaining of assets assigned to the organizational unit in accordance with this policy.
Organizational unit accountable of?cials may designate additional unit personnel to complete tasks for the
organizational unit in accordance with this policy. Adherence to. this policy is necessary to comply with
federal and state regulations, governmental accounting standards, and to maintain adequate internal
control over assets.

SYSTEM OF RECORD AND TRACKING:

All assets are to be recorded into the electronic inventory and asset management system within 30
days of purchase or donation. Assets are considered purchased once invoices are validated by Oracle
Accounts Payable. Assets are considered donated at the time of receipt by CPS staff.

Technology items and other assets, including furniture or equipment, are to be recorded in CPS's
centralized electronic asset and inventory management system (designated system of record). These
assets, and other items the District manages, will be af?xed a radio-frequency identi?cation (RFID) tag or
(barcodelpoly) tag for electronic tracking. Generally, RFID tags will be used for "walkable"
technology assets while all other assets will have barcode/poly tags. In the case of extenuating
circumstances or intangible assets, appropriate inventory and recording measures that do not depend on
physical tags will be speci?ed in asset management procedures.

Overall, assets worth less than $500 per unit or having a useful life of less than one year may, at the
organizational unit?s discretion, also be recorded in CPS's centralized electronic inventory and asset
management system and tracked using barcodelpoly tags.

The following data elements, at a minimum, are to be recorded for each asset:

description of the asset,

serial number or other identi?cation number;

the transfer in centralized electronic inventory and asset management system. Within 30 days of
transfer, recipient organizational unit accountable of?cials will ensure that the minimum data elements are
recorded for each transferred asset and that the asset is transferred to the recipient's organization within
centralized electronic inventory and asset management system.

If donor organizational unit accountable of?cials or designees deem an asset as not being utilized or not
needed and have not identi?ed another recipient, the asset must be repurposed to the warehouse within
30 days. _Warehouse personnel must ensure that the minimum data elements are recorded for each
transferred asset and that the asset is transferred to the warehouse within CPS's centralized electronic

SCOPE:

This policy covers all assets purchased, constructed or donated that meet or exceed the established -
capitalization thresholds and useful lives as de?ned in Section II B. Capitalization Thresholds and Useful

APPLICABILITY.

This policy applies to all CPS organizational units including central of?ce departments network of?ces,

and accounting for capital assets. In addition, Illinois Administrative Code Title 23 Part 100 Section
100.60 (23 IL 100.603) requires each school board to adopt a capitalization threshold in order to properly
account for capital assets. Finally, proper accounting for capital assets is necessary in order to comply

POLICY TEXT:
CAPITAL ASSET DEFINITIONS

Capital assets are real or personal property that have a value equal to or greater than the capitalization
threshold for the particular classi?cation of the asset and have an estimated life of greater than a year.

A. Classi?cation of Capital Assets

Assets purchased, constructed or donated that meet or exceed the established capitalization
thresholds or minimum reporting requirements must be uniformly classi?ed. CPS records assets
in the following categories:

0. Land

Buildings

B. Classi?cation De?nitions

"Land? is the surface of the earth, which can be used to support structures and may be used to
grow crops, grass, shrubs, and trees. Land is characterized as having an unlimited life.

?Buildings" are structures that are permanently attached to the land, have a roof, are partially or
completely enclosed by waits, and are not intended to be transportable or moveable.

?Building improvements? are capital events that materially extend the useful life of a building or
increase the value of a building by at least 25 percent of the original life period or cost, or both.
For a replacement to a portion of a building to be capitalized, it must be part of a major repair or
rehabilitation project, increase the value and/or useful life of the building, and be of signi?cantly
improved quality and higher value compared to the replaced portion. Replacement or restoration
to original utility level is not capitalized.

"Leasehold improvements? are improvements made to existing structures by the lessee, who has
the right to use these leasehold improvements over the term of the lease. These improvements
will revert to the lessor at the expiration of the lease. Moveable equipment or of?ce furniture that
is not attached to the leased property is not considered a leasehold improvement.

?Personal prOperty" is any movable. tangible asset used for operations, the bene?ts of which
extend beyond a year from the date acquired and rendered into service. Improvements or
additions to existing personal property that constitute a capital outlay or increase the value or life
of the asset by 25 percent of the original cost or life will be capitalized as a betterment and
reCorded as an addition of value to the existing asset. Note: Costs of extended warranties andlor
maintenance agreements, which can be separately identifiedfrom the cost of the equipment, wiil
not be capitalized.

"Works of art and historical treasures" are collections or individual items of signi?cance which are
not held for ?nancial gain, but rather for public exhibition, education or research in furtherance of
public service.

?intangible assets? are assets that have these three characteristics: lack physical (tangible)
substance, nonfinancial in nature, and initial useful life that is greater than one reporting period
(see GASB 51). Intangible capital assets include:

1. Major computer system software - Any trademarked software package that is purchased or
donated which comprises or adds to the useful life of the legacy database systems, the
OracleTM database system, or the Peoplesoft database system.

2. Minor computer system software Any trademarked software package that is purchased or
donated, or software that is internally developed to create new systems, that is not classi?ed
as Major Computer System Software. .

?Construction in progress? is the economic construction activity status of assets (buildings,
building improvements, software, etc) which are substantially incomplete.

CAPITAL ASSET GUIDELINES
A. System of Record and Tracking
initial purchases are ?rst recorded via vendor invoice entry into the Districts designated software
system for disbursements, then compiled by location and project and recorded for capital asset
?nancial reporting purposes. Donated assets and other non-monetary transactions will be
recorded directly in the ?nancial reporting software. In addition to the data elements identi?ed in
the ?Policy on Asset Management,? capital asset records should include the following:

in service date

0 Useful life
0 Depreciation method

B. . Capitalization Thresholds and Useful Lives

Capitalization thresholds and useful lives for each asset class are as follows:

Class

Land Ail NI . 
. All 50

Buildin - All .25

5


software . 20
Minor . 3
Construction

 

90

October 25, 2017

c. Capital Asset Acquisition Cost 

Capital assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or
constructed. Historical cost includes the vendor's invoice plus the value of any trade-in or
educational allowance, initial installation cost, modi?cations, attachments; accessories or
apparatus necessary to make the asset usable and render it into service. Historical cost also
includes ancillary charges such as freight and transportation charges, site preparation costs and
professional fees.

The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that?do not add to the value of the asset or
materially extend assets lives are not capitalized.

Capitalization of computer software includes software license fees if the total dollar amount of the
fee divided by the number of units served (terminal or user count) meets the criteria to capitalize
the purchase.

lntemally developed software costs associated with the preliminary project and the post-
implementation/operating phases should be expensed as incurred. Capitalization of costs should
begin when the preliminary project phase is complete and management has explicitly authorized
or commits to funding the software project with the intent it will be completed and used to perform
its planned functions. Capitalization should cease no later than the time at which substantial
testing is complete and the software is ready for its intended purpose or rendered in service.

During the application development phase, internal and extemal costs should be capitalized,
including costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of old data by
new information systems. General and administrative costs and overhead expenditures
associated with software development should not be capitalized as costs of internal use software.

D. Leased Assets

Per GASB Statement No.62, assets shouid be capitalized if the lease agreement meets any one
of the following criteria.
The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.
a The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
a The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the
leased property.
The present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease,
excluding executory costs, equals at ieast 90 percent of the fair market value of the
leased property.

Leases that do not meet any'of the above requirements should be recorded as operating leases.
E. Depreciation Method

Capital asset costs are depreciated over their' estimated useful lives. The straight- -Iine
depreciation method {historical cost divided by useful life) will be used. Depreciation expense and
accumulated depreciation will be calculated in the system of record and posted to the accOunting
general ledger on a basis.

Land and works of art and historical treasures are deemed inexhaustible and are not depreciated.
Depreciation is not applicable while assets are accounted for as ConStructidn in Progress.

Buildings designated as "historical" by the City of Chicago will not be depreciated unless used in
the operations of CPS. However, building improvements not deemed "historical" by the City of
Chicago will be depreciated the same as any improvements.

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of (1) the remaining lease term, or (2)
the useful life of the improvement if the lease contains an option to renew and the likelihood of
renewal Is uncertain, the leasehold improvement is amOrtized over the life of the initial lease term
or useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.

F. . Impairments

Per Statement No.42 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, ?governments are
required to evaluate prominent events or changes in circumstances affecting capital assets to
determine whether impairment of a capital asset has occurred. Such events or changes in
circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include evidence of physical damage,
enactment or approval of laws or regulations or other changes inenvironmental factors,
technological changes or evidence of obsolescence, changes in the manner or duration of use of
a capital asset, and construction stoppage. A capital asset generally should be considered
impaired if both the decline in service utility of the capital asset is large in magnitude and 
the event or change in circumstance is outside the normal life cycle of the capital asset?

91

October 25, 2017

The general ledger and ?xed asset subledger book value of impaired assets will be reduced to
re?ect the impairment amount. Impaired assets will not be retired from the general ledger and
?xed asset subledger until disposal.

G. Disposals and Retirements

Disposal of capital assets purchased with grant fundsmust be coordinated with the appropriate
grant administrator. Disposal of capital assets purchased with bond funds must be coordinated
with the CPS?Treasury Department. . -

Upon disposal, capital assets and their related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
general ledger and ?xed asset subledger. The use of proceeds from the sale of capital assets
may be restricted, depending on the funding source used to purchase the assets.
