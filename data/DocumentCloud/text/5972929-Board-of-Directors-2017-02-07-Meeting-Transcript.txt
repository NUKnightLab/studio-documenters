Okay.

So we'll start with the approval of

then we will expect to meet on Tuesday, June 6th,

at the same time, 10:00 to noon.

September 12th and Wednesday, December 6th.

4

Tuesday,

As always we are very appreciative to

5

our wonderful hosts here at the Metropolitan

6

Planning Commission and Mary Sue Barrett.

7

really appreciate your endless hospitality and we

8

really appreciate you allowing us to hold our

9

meetings here, Mary Sue.

10

So we

With that I would like to go into a

11

brief organizational matter update, an operations

12

update.

13

fact that Scott doesn't have his placard that

14

there is a few things amiss today.

15

Patty Dominguez is here.

16

had a very sad death in her family.

17

know that all of you will keep a special thought

18

for her and her family today.

19

probably back with us next week, but it's a rough

20

time for her family so keep a special thought.

21

Thank you.

22

First of all, you probably notice by the

Typically

She unfortunately has
And so I

So she will be

It's been an extremely busy time at

23

the CIT over the last few months.

And so first I

24

want to take a second to express my appreciation

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

to our terrific staff.

2

proud of the work the team has done over the past

3

few months on our projects, specifically on Smart

4

Lighting that we are going to talk about in more

5

detail today.

6

I really cannot be more

A great deal has been asked of them

7

and they have delivered every single time.

So I

8

hope that as you hear more today, you'll share in

9

that thought.

And there's been a lot of late

10

nights, a lot of very diligent work.

11

want to really give a special thank you to Tom

12

and to George and Patty and everyone on the team

13

including some of our new -- our new team who I

14

will introduce in a minute.

15

And so I

Also, thank you to you, the board, and

16

our advisory board.

17

through this process has been invaluable.

18

Your advice and assistance

So moving on to the staffing update.

19

Our current status is we still have the same four

20

full-time employees that you saw last time.

21

also have a few new part-time employees.

22

a couple of new interns.

23

and a fellow.

24

introducing you to our new -- our new part of the

We

We have

We have an associate

So I'll look forward to

team.

2

And regarding health benefits, you

3

voted at the last board meeting for us to move

4

forward and be able to offer a suite of benefits

5

to our employees in order to keep the CIT

6

competitive and continue to attract this talent.

7

I am proud to let you know that on

8

January 1st we were able to get these benefits up

9

and running for calendar year 2017, and now have

10

a good benefits program to offer to our

11

employees.

12

that.

13

And so I appreciate your support in

We are lucky enough that Scott Falk

14

and the team at Kirkland have been providing

15

continued pro bono assistance to the Chicago

16

Infrastructure Trust since its inception and

17

continue to do so.

18

that assistance.

19

And I am very grateful for

We have kicked off that employee

20

manual process that I've talked to you about.

21

And the manual that we have done some redrafting

22

on is now in the hands of Scott's partners at

23

Kirkland, and they are very diligently helping us

24

get through that.

And I will look forward to

bringing that to you at our next board meeting

2

for presentation and approval.

3

Also, we are working with our auditors

4

from Prado & Renteria.

5

very helpful in getting our audits scheduled for

6

2016.

7

that to you in the next board meeting as well.

I should be able to bring the results of

Hilda Renteria has been

Moving on to the recommendation of the
2017 budget.

We continue to prudently manage our

10

expenses.

11

providing great value to the City of Chicago and

12

sister agencies.

13

opportunity to review the budget and to ask

14

questions about it.

15

We have continued to focus on

And we are -- you've all had an

And so I am requesting your approval

16

for that budget today.

17

2016 unaudited actuals.

18

you've all seen both in your board packet and

19

prior to this meeting and had a chance to take a

20

look at it.

21

This is the fiscal year
This is something that

As you can see we are operating under

22

budget.

And I feel like we have continued to

23

provide outstanding value to the City at a

24

relatively economical rate to -- for the services

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 7

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

that we are providing.

2

a complete procurement process including

3

financial analysis, feasibility analysis.

4

think that if the City had gone and procured that

5

outside, it would be considerably more expensive.

6

So moving on to the 2017 budget versus

7

the 2016 actuals.

8

amount.

9

hires.

As you know, we have done

And we

We have budgeted to our grant

And so we are hoping to do some more
You'll see the increases is primarily in

10

labor cost.

11

pipeline expands, we will need some additional

12

team members and hope to add those in the coming

13

year.

14

And we are hoping as our project in

I'm happy to entertain any questions,

15

but ask and recommend that you approve the

16

budget.

17

MS. HUBBARD:

Just one.

How many more years

18

will that grant be available to us?

19

you -- is this the last year?

20
21

MS. DARLING:

The one that

No, you know, that's something

that is negotiated each year.

22

MS. HUBBARD:

Okay.

23

MS. DARLING:

As part of the Home Buyer's

24

Assistance Program, you know, if -- if the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 8

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

program exceeds the amount in that grant -- in

2

our grant, then we would share that amount 50/50.

3

MS. HUBBARD:

Okay.

4

MS. DARLING:

So, you know, we are obviously

5

moving towards more self-sufficiency and also a

6

more fee for service model, but we will be

7

looking at that in 2017.

8
9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think it's an

appropriate question because it's going to lead

10

in the pipeline of projects that we look at as a

11

board and that the staff looks at through 2017

12

with an eye toward opportunities that will

13

generate revenue so we can be self-sustaining.

14

And we certainly shouldn't treat this as a, you

15

know, evergreen investment.

16

where Leslie is going and it's the right question

17

to ask.

18

MR. LINGENFELTER:

So I think that's

I think it's also worth

19

noting though that with this amount of expense

20

we've generated, you know, 30 million in pipeline

21

for home mortgages and a 9 figure plus investment

22

in street lighting and city infrastructure.

23

it's a pretty good return on the investment.

24

MR. SCOTT:

So

But none of that provides fee

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 9

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

income to make the trust self-sustaining.

2

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Correct.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Well, the home mortgage

4

should, right, ultimately -- it's backed out of

5

this at some level.

6

directionally where we want to go.

7
8
9
10
11

But, yeah, that's

Any other questions on the budget?
I'm happy to entertain a motion.
MS. CAFARO:

I'll move it, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter.

12
13

16

All in favor?

(Chorus of ayes.)
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

14
15

Moved by Miss Cafaro.

Any opposed?

(No response.)
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Motion passes.

Now, we're going to go through two

17

specific project updates and then kind of talk

18

about the pipeline.

19

anticipated obviously is Smart Lighting.

20

let's dive in.

21

MS. DARLING:

The biggest and most

All right.

So

So this is the big

22

story for today.

We are excited to bring a

23

recommendation to you on Smart Lighting.

24

been working on this project for the whole time

We have

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 10

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

you all have been on the board and I have been

2

here.

3

time and efforts for more than a year now, but we

4

thought it might make sense to go back and as we

5

started and you all remember, Tom was on loan to

6

us through E & Y and with the CCA and helped put

7

together our strategic planning document.

It has taken up the great majority of our

8
9

And so we wanted to go back and sort
of talk about for a second about how this project

10

aligns with -- with both our strategic plan and

11

our value proposition.

12

guiding principle is about providing

13

complementary services to meet the City's needs.

14

We have done that here.

15

and expanded their capacity to provide this

16

project.

17

sister agencies and the taxpayers for the

18

delivery of this project.

You know, you can see the

We've assisted the City

19

Insuring value to the City and its

We feel like we have checked that box

20

in spades.

We, as you know, I just said for

21

budgetary purposes we feel like we have provided

22

tremendous value.

23

be able to bring this project in where -- exactly

24

where we expected to be able to do that.

We also think we are going to

And

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 11

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

also provide great value through the costs and

2

the proposals that we have seen for this project.

3

And, also, number three, act as a

4

dedicated and specialized resource for

5

alternative project delivery.

6

that this project is really absolutely a great

7

example of where we've been able to do that.

8
9

Again, I think

So we have provided all those
specialized resources, the subject matter

10

expertise.

11

about street lighting now.

12

Marquisos who has become I think the world

13

renowned expert on it.

14

I can't tell you how much we all know
And especially George

And so we have taken, again, idea

15

incubation; something that was thought about from

16

the City for a long time and we have turned that

17

project into reality.

18

project and we have provided project management

19

for the project.

20

within our strategic plan.

21

we have provided great benefits to the City.

22

We've aggregated that

So we think it really fits
It's been -- we hope

So back in April 2016 when we met we

23

told you about the primary project goals;

24

converting approximately 85 percent of the City's

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 12

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

lighting fixtures to LED, implementing a lighting

2

management system or a control system for the

3

lights, a centralized system that would provide

4

realtime outage information to the City in

5

addition to possibly other services and provide

6

targeted infrastructure stabilization.

7

MS. HUBBARD:

Leslie, can you go back a

8

little bit and refresh our memory on the 15

9

percent that isn't getting done what they -- what

10
11

kind of lights those are?
MS. DARLING:

Sure, Kym.

That's a great

12

question.

13

So the lights that you see in the City and the

14

neighborhoods that are not the Cobra head or the

15

coach light lamps, so the ones that are more

16

decorative that are primarily in the central

17

business district.

18

So those are the ornamental lights.

You'll see a lot of kind of the

19

6-globe lamps around Wacker Drive for example and

20

other places in the City.

21

percent are pretty much ornamental.

22

have, you know, I think there's 26 or -- there's

23

some very high number of different lamp heads.

24

So they're the 15
And those

And I think at the time we didn't know

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 13

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

if that would be cost effective to change over

2

those lights.

3

Cobra head lamps which is the most prevalent lamp

4

and fixture that we have.

5

And so we were focussing on the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think it also -- the 85

6

doesn't include some amount of conversion that

7

had already taken place in the City.

8

example, you know, along Lake Shore Drive, other

9

places where you see LED conversions that exist

10

For

today.

11

MS. HUBBARD:

Thank you.

12

MS. DARLING:

So here we wanted to show you

13

a little bit about the timeline and how we have

14

gotten to where we are today.

15

incredibly aggressive time schedule and we have

16

largely been able to achieve it.

17

pleased with the outcome of the procurement

18

design.

19

We set an

We are really

There's been, as you know, incredible

20

interest in our process.

21

expectations to the vendors and, you know, as you

22

can see when we issued the RFQ in April 2016 we

23

had 30 respondents.

24

And we set clear

Prior to that we did the RFI where we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 14

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

added I believe 42 respondents.

And so we

2

continue to whittle that down.

3

with -- with 9 shortlisted firms and engage in an

4

iterative process and refine that scope with

5

input from the shortlist of respondents.

6

found that that worked incredibly well.

We wanted to work

We

7

We wanted to have a project that was

8

-- that worked for both the City, but also that

9

vendors could respond to in a meaningful way to

10
11

be able to accomplish the project.
And so the planning at the top of the

12

process that we did allowed us to move

13

expediently once the proposals were received on

14

January 9th of this year.

15

planning that we have done for this will result

16

in a similar process through a contract

17

negotiation.

18

through a timely and competitive process.

19

think we've accomplished that.

20

And we expect that the

Again, we want to deliver value
And I

So now we want to get a little bit

21

more to the meat of what we think you are going

22

to have delivered through this process.

23

gone through all the proposals and we're

24

confident that the base scope of that project we

We have

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 15

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

will be able to deliver on all of those goals.

2

So I want to turn it over to George

3

who will discuss a little bit about the lighting

4

conversion and the lighting specification and

5

talk a little bit more about the anticipated base

6

scope of the project.

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.

I will try to keep my

8

remarks fairly brief.

But when this whole --

9

when this whole project started and we were given

10

the world is your oyster kind of idea, tell us

11

what we can do with the modernization that makes

12

sense for the City of Chicago.

13

have aging infrastructure and streetlights and

14

there is an opportunity because of advancements

15

in technology what is the best mix of ingredients

16

to kind of deliver a project that makes sense for

17

the City of Chicago.

18

We know that we

A there was a lot of talk initially

19

about smart city and sensors and internet of

20

things and the world -- all kinds of things.

21

so we really kind of dug down to see what's

22

really feasible at this stage recognizing there

23

is a lot of potential in the future.

24

And we pretty quickly came to a

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

 16

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

project that had three critical elements from our

2

point of view.

3

of these three.

4

And I think we -- it's comprised

So we said we need to save some energy

5

and so we chose the most cost effective or

6

economically justifiable conversions which

7

presented 92 percent of the inventory which are

8

Cobra heads.

9

And so we said, well, let's convert

10

those to LED.

That will save us a lot of

11

electricity.

12

see if we can't use some of that savings to add

13

some technology that gives us the ability to

14

better deliver services to the citizens.

15

realtime outage information as opposed to waiting

16

for citizens to call 311.

17

priority.

And then in addition to that let's

So

That was a critical

18

No other city that I know of at the

19

scale of Chicago has gone down that technology

20

route in kind of having kind of automated ability

21

to monitor and control lighting.

22

somewhat of a ground breaker in that area.

23
24

So we would be

And we also recognize that we didn't
have the money to replace everything that needed

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 17

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

replacing.

2

better information the condition of our assets;

3

we could do targeted infrastructure repairs that

4

would extend the useful life of our existing

5

infrastructure and kind of bring it in line with

6

the lifespan of the products that we are about to

7

install.

8
9

But if we were prudent and if we had

So this was I think a big vision and
we modeled it and we spoke to other

10

municipalities and we got as much information

11

from the private sector as we could.

12

it into a financial model.

13

could work.

14

confirmation.

15

And we put

We said I think this

And but we needed private market

And so after this procurement process

16

I am pleased to report that we have it.

So even

17

though we added quite a bit to the specifications

18

and we added -- asked for a lot of functionality

19

and a lot of capabilities that gave us some

20

flexibility into the future, we put a lot of

21

things into this procurement.

22

largely because Chicago is such a large lighting

23

project, I think we got some very competitive

24

proposals.

And I think

And we were able to achieve the vast

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 18

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

majority of what we promised which is very good

2

news from my perspective.

3

better having this confirmation.

4

I am sleeping much

I don't know what else to say about

5

that other than I'll give you a couple of

6

examples of how we knew that we were going to get

7

some economies of scale.

8

going to buy fixtures cheaper than perhaps

9

smaller municipalities or even the LED's that

10

We knew that we were

we're purchasing today at a much smaller scale.

11

So we knew that our prices were going

12

to come down because of the quantity we're

13

buying.

14

we leveraged -- rather than have cheaper

15

fixtures, we got better fixtures for the same

16

price.

17

that have the latest in dimmable drivers that

18

give you the ability to communicate two-way

19

fixture and get inventory information.

20

this realtime live inventory is an advancement

21

for Chicago.

22

But I think rather than -- I think where

So by better fixtures I mean fixtures

So having

Prior to 2013 Chicago didn't even know

23

how many street lights it had.

24

guess.

It was just a

And we added and we subtracted and there

was this whole back and forth with our utility

of this project a comprehensive condition

So we know where the lights are and

And we really didn't know what

was like.

18

across the City and within 300 days we are going

to get back a complete asset assessment.

we'll know which are the worst poles.

know which wiring is temporary and really should

MR. SCOTT:

So you talked about the

13

conversion and, you know, we all know that we

14

have some that we had started to convert

15

currently.

16

fixtures, are they able to connect with the ones

17

that we are putting up now?

this asset assessment and, you know, one goes off

the grid that is not one of the new ones, are

they able to communicate so that we can still

repair those?

So how will the new improved light

MR. MARQUISOS:

So when we are doing

That's a great question.

23

there's been a lot of confusion because since

2015 every time -- and I want to correct the

terminology or at least clarify the terminology.

2

When we say conversion we mean take off the old

3

fixture, replace with an LED.

4

What you're referring to that most of

5

the LED lights that citizens are seeing now are

6

replacements not conversions.

7

about all new poles, all new wiring.

MR. SCOTT:

9

MR. MARQUISOS:

So we're talking

Yes, yes.

10

MR. SCOTT:

11

MR. MARQUISOS:

As part of a street redo.

Yes.

And when they put those new poles up,
Those LED lights that you see

Now, how are they different?

Well,

20

they don't have control nodules on them.

good news is they have the ability to add control

3

lights will be more defined.

So the newer lights

So that's a

But Chicago has a wide variety of

contexts.

different width streets.

13

fixtures that are appropriate for each context.

14

So it will be a better defined light for the

particular context it is tasked to light.

16

hopefully we reduce light trespass when we apply

17

the correct luminaire to the context that it's

18

designed.

19

We have poles on both sides of the

So we are trying to get

And

I don't know if that --

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just one clarifying

20

question in response to the Alderman's question.

21

If an Alderman -- you know, this is largely a

22

conversion of the lights and a changing of the

23

poles where the infrastructure is most needed,

24

right?

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 23

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

If an Alderman wanted to

3

continue to use -- if they had a major

4

thoroughfare that they were redeveloping and they

5

wanted to use menu money to also prioritize those

6

poles if the poles weren't on kind of the most

7

needed list for the infrastructure stabilization

8

repairs, correct me if I'm wrong; but they would

9

still be able to do so going forward and in

10
11

conjunction with the lighting conversion as well.
MR. SCOTT:

And let me kind of touch on

12

that.

13

from what I was told, and I could be wrong; that

14

we can't do the poles and then someone else do

15

the heads.

16

together.

17

So we can actually do this offline if necessary.

18

I actually had a meeting about that.

And

You have to do the entire portion
And this is just for selfish reasons.

MR. MARQUISOS:

No, I think the question is

19

a valid one.

So the reality is Chicago has most

20

of its poles and wires were installed in the

21

1950s and '60s.

22

are still in many cases have some useful life

23

left, but the City needs to have a continual

24

process where they are replacing things.

They are -- they're steel.

They

Like

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 24

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

they have to make a continual investment to

2

replace it.

3

to last forever.

4

You can't just expect these things

This project is not designed to

5

replace.

It is designed to kind of get

6

everything to a place that we increase the

7

reliability.

We're getting better information on when things

fail and we're putting in more reliable

So we're reducing failure rates.

That's its function.

MR. MARQUISOS:

In conjunction.

And every

20

time you do a replacement, it will get pulled

21

into the new lighting management system and

22

you'll have realtime information about those new

23

fixtures.

24

MR. SILVERS:

I wanted to ask you about the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 25

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

line about the City wide wireless network.

2

you explain that a bit further?

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

Can

Sure, it's a little

4

interesting.

5

radiofrequency network that essentially is -- I

6

don't want to give -- I don't want to say too

7

much about it because we are still in the

8

procurement stage.

9

So we will have a dedicated

But essentially what you will see is

10

either at a circuit level or at a light level the

11

lights will be transmitting information about

12

their operations.

13

wirelessly through radiofrequency to some kind of

14

a central access point that gets communicated to

15

a central point presumably somewhere in CDOT's

16

operations.

17

And that will get communicated

It gives them regular reports on

18

what's working and what's not.

And then that

19

also allows COT to send messages to the lights.

20

I need you to dim.

21

need you to turn off or whatever it is.

22

is now the ability to remotely monitor and

23

control lights.

24

dedicated system for street lighting.

I need you to increase.

I

So there

And that's all done on a

800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 26

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

The beauty of that is it has the

2

capacity, should the opportunities become

3

economically justifiable in the future, to

4

transmit data for other uses.

5

are the smarty city applications that today we

6

don't think make a ton of sense to invest in, but

7

we have pretty good confidence that in years to

8

come the City is going to want to jump in and get

9

more utility out of that network.

Right.

So those

So that's --

10

it's an investment that serves us now.

11

hopefully will serve us in the future.

12

MR. SILVERS:

And

And to that point could you

13

talk a bit about -- I mean, we've talked about

14

this before.

15

about what those potential sort of add-on

16

technologies are that are enabled by the platform

17

for future smart city technologies.

18

sorts of things does this set up the possibility

19

of being able -- for the City to be able to do

20

later?

21
22

But could you just explain a bit

MR. MARQUISOS:

Like what

Well, we could have a whole

meeting on that.

23

MR. SILVERS:

I'm not asking you to do that.

24

MS. DARLING:

I told you he's become the

2

world's leading expert.
MR. SILVERS:

Yes.

Well, it's quite -- it's

3

quite evident you've become the world's leading

4

expert already.

5

MR. MARQUISOS:

No, I am very much a novice

6

in this.

I am trying to understand what the --

7

but essentially everybody's espousing the

8

internet of things.

9

ability to now transmit information about what

So these devices have the

10

they're doing or what they're seeing.

11

have the ability to apply sensors throughout the

12

City to tell you things like how dark is it?

13

many people are traveling by?

14

there?

15

potholes?

16

So you

How

How many cars are

Are there parking spaces?

Are there

Is the snow plowed?
You can get all kinds of information

17

about what's going on in the streets and then you

18

could respond to it.

19

And so the question is -- and you can transmit

20

all kinds of other information.

21

goes on and on and on.

22

virtually limitless.

23

what cost and what's the return.

24

And that's basically it.

Air quality.

It

The potentials are

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It's just a question of at

Some of those that George

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 28

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

mentioned are sort of largely for a greater

2

public good and public use.

3

are purely commercially viable.

4

-- I think that the beauty of the approach that

5

the team has taken here is to maximize

6

flexibility and future adaptability.

7

when -- especially the commercially viable

8

options that have real revenue tied to them

9

become available, the City will be in a position

And some of those
And I think that

So that

10

to potentially justify and make the further

11

investment, you know, to enhance the existing

12

network.

13

I think at the moment it's a lot of

14

great ideas that -- that don't have firm, you

15

know, revenue streams that make sense to invest

16

in today.

17

12 months from now or sooner.

18

But I think that can change, you know,

MR. SILVERS:

Mr. Chairman, I have been very

19

much supportive of this direction with that --

20

with your analysis in mind.

21

sure that the staff got on the record here what

22

the capabilities -- what the long-term

23

capabilities are.

24

I wanted to make

I just had one further question which

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 29

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

is you've been describing mostly these

2

opportunities as ones that involve feeding data

3

back from the location into the system.

4

my understanding that there's also the

5

possibility of going the other way, right?

6
7
8
9
10
11

MR. MARQUISOS:

It was

Yes, it's two-way

communication.
MR. SILVERS:

Right.

So that, therefore,

it's a potential platform for distributing
broadband.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Well, I want to pull back

12

that expectation.

13

this is radiofrequency.

14

fiberoptic cables being installed here.

15

these things are going to get -- and so the data

16

transmitted is relatively low, right.

17

MR. SILVERS:

18

MR. MARQUISOS:

This is a low bandwidth.

So

We're not talking about
Most of

Right, so it's -You don't need a lot of data

19

to tell you whether the light is on or off.

20

just we check in with the lights and they give us

21

a report.

22

going to be, you know, the platform for providing

23

wifi throughout the City.

24

It's

So I don't want to say that this is

MR. SILVERS:

Okay.

It's not.
All right.

Well, that

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 30

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

was clarifying.

Can I -- Mr. Chairman, if you

2

don't mind I just want to complement more broadly

3

the team on this from an outsider's perspective.

4

All right.

5

I mean, I believe I sit on this board

6

as an advisor partly to bring kind of a national

7

infrastructure perspective to the work of the

8

Trust.

9

you look at the conversation about infrastructure

This project is I think exactly -- when

10

nationally, the real challenge is is it going to

11

be possible to make sort of technological leaps

12

in -- at this time with the fiscal constraints

13

being what they are.

14

And this project has several lessons

15

that go beyond Chicago I think in this

16

perspective.

17

to have people really dedicated to trying to

18

figure out the technological and financial

19

problems.

20

One lesson is how important it is

And George's presentation and the

21

expertise he's developed is a -- is a sort of an

22

example of what kind of value is created when

23

there are people really focussed on solving these

24

problems as opposed to just sort of the problem

1

being in the air.

2

not addressed for years.

3

are not seized.

4

Right.

In which case often is
And the opportunities

Secondly, I think it's worth noting we

5

haven't spent a lot of time on this here because

6

it's kind of built in; but there was a very early

7

decision here to pursue a low cost of capital

8

approach, right.

9

as the actual provider of financing because they

Which led us back to the City

10

had the lowest cost to the City.

11

lowest cost of capital.

12

They had the

But what the Trust provided was the

13

focus and expertise.

14

in where we are.

15

in terms of what it tells us about how both

16

Chicago and the nation can really practically

17

make this leap.

18

And I think that's evident

And it's really consequential

All right.

And so before we moved on from the

19

technology, I just wanted to express, you know,

20

how pleased I am to be able to be part of that.

21

And the fact that it has larger positive

22

implications for the country.

23

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

24

MS. HUBBARD:

Thank you.

Yes.

Yes, I had just a couple

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 32

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

questions.

Will this have an impact both on pre

2

and post installation on employment within the

3

City of Chicago for CDOT?

4

And then the second question is have

5

we looked at the salvage value of anything that

6

we're taking out like poles or anything like

7

that?

8

can be --

9

Is there some salvage valuation that we

MR. MARQUISOS:

Both good questions.

So as

10

far as the pre, so we know that there will be

11

jobs created as part of the 4-year installation.

12

And we anticipate somewhere in the order of 50 to

13

100 people who will be working full-time on

14

deploying this system.

15

Post the ideal is that the durability

16

of the LED's will now free up people who go out

17

and first check to see whether the lights are

18

actually out and then go out and replace a bulb

19

that burned out three years after it was

20

installed.

21

do other things like repairing wires and things

22

that they really -- so we have a group of people

23

who are now designated as for lack of a better

24

term bulb changers.

Those people will now be freed up to

And they hopefully will be

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 33

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

less and less needed as we go forward and they

2

can be deployed to other things.

3

And I think we are talking about a

4

system that will become much more efficient for

5

CDOT to generate the work orders, prioritize them

6

and issue the work crews to kind of maintain the

7

system which has been a continual challenge for

8

the City.

9

is past its useful life and reliability is a big

10
11

I mean, a lot of this infrastructure

concern.
As Aldermen can attest, their citizens

12

want and need lighting reliably delivered.

And

13

so by just being limited we're trying to do more

14

with what they have.

15

chance of getting that.

And I think we have a good

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

The salvage value.

Oh, the salvage value.

So

18

we -- we went back and forth and did some

19

estimates about what is the value of the aluminum

20

heads that are coming down?

21

the steel that's coming down?

22

significant in the sense that it's probably in

23

the million dollar range all in.

24

What is the value of
And it's

But we felt that rather than the cost

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 34

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

of trying to document it and share in it and

2

bring it to our yards and do -- we kind of gave

3

it to the vendor and asked them to build it into

4

their pricing.

5

So we asked them to assume the salvage

6

values reversed to them and they built it into

7

their pricing.

8

they still have to document the safe disposal of

9

any hazardous materials.

That way we're not kind of --

So the City gets that

10

kind of and -- as well as the recycling of

11

everything that's recyclable.

12

products that are coming off the poles get

13

disassembled and separated and recycled, but the

14

salvage value goes to the vendor and that's built

15

into their pricing.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

17

MR. AFFRUNTI:

So all these

Other questions?

Ralph.

And this might be a little

18

bit forward thinking.

So is there the

19

capabilities for these poles to at a certain time

20

have some LED advertisement that would work in

21

conjunction with these poles?

22

of the Aldermen here has a festival in his area,

23

most of the time we're hanging banners.

24

we would have LED investment?

So let's say one

Go ahead, Leslie.

are always going to be an option for the City.

more bandwidth to the pole than is currently

It's not part

It doesn't mean it's not possible

It also requires

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

There is a pilot that the

City is undergoing right now.

13

MS. DARLING:

Right.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It was just announced two

15

weeks ago I think for that capability on a small

16

scale.

17

Leslie said if that pilot proves to be cost

18

effective or, you know, revenue generating; then

19

there would be a decision whether the poles for

20

example or other forms of infrastructure in

21

neighborhoods are the best places to expand in

22

it.

23
24

And I think what would happen is as

In either case it would likely require
an incremental infrastructure investment.

In either case it's going to

MS. DARLING:

And I think to go back both

9

to, Damon, what you're saying also is, you know,

I think LA has an example where they're in their

11

7th year of implementation of their LED lighting

12

project.

installed I think 150 or 200 -- George, you can

14

correct me if I'm incorrect, smart poles which

15

are poles with more wireless capability.

16

they have a different contract than their

17

conversion contract.

18

And within the last 18 months they've

And

So, again, sort of this is -- this is

19

the first step in this process.

And more

20

functionality, smart poles, other things, you

21

know, other smart city technologies can always be

22

added in the future.

23

hard to make sure that we have future proofed our

system to make sure that those additional

And we have really worked

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

functionalities can be added later in years if

desired by the City.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Let's move forward and

talk about the neighborhood demonstrations.
MS. DARLING:

Sure.

So as you know when we

6

last talked the City was about to embark on a

7

neighborhood demonstration project.

8

a demonstration in 7 areas in the City on the

9

kind of border of 7 different wards, 7 locations

10
11

So this was

from top to bottom.
And there was an open online survey

12

for residents to submit feedback up through the

13

9th which is the day that the proposals were due.

14

However, if residents are still interested in

15

providing feedback when you go to the feedback

16

section, there is still an opportunity to send an

17

e-mail to us at the Infrastructure Trust.

18

can still see that feedback.

19

So we

We received almost 900 submissions to

20

the survey.

88 percent felt that light levels

21

were sufficient or more than enough.

22

that the LED lighting improved nighttime

23

visibility.

24

lights made it easier to distinguish colors at

64 agreed

And 57 percent agreed that the LED

night.

The white light does provide better

2

visibility.

3

So we wanted the public to have an

4

opportunity to weigh in on the lighting levels.

5

These are not the end fixtures that will be used.

6

That's obviously still part of the procurement

7

process.

8

of having the public feedback which was

9

incredibly helpful, we also learned a great deal

But it also in addition to the benefit

10

because our lighting technical advisors went on

11

numerous field trips and visited every single

12

location.

13

And I'll let George very briefly tell

14

us about what they learned from that.

15

think there were some very valuable lessons from

16

the lighting technical advisors that we were able

17

to implement and will be able to implement into

18

our procurement.

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

Because I

So I'll try to -- so

20

it is a fascinating experience.

I recommend it

21

to everyone to get in a van with a bunch of

22

lighting guys and go out in the City and look at

23

various lights in different neighborhoods.

24

information is astounding.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

The

 39

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

So what we intended and what we got

2

from our public demonstrations is a little bit

3

different, but I think in the end it ended up

4

being quite valuable.

5

we would have 7 almost identical demonstrations.

6

And so it would afford citizens 7 opportunities

7

to view the same thing and comment on it.

8
9

So the intention was that

When we actually went out and visited
each location, we came to understand that each

10

location was somewhat markedly different in so --

11

and this is probably a lesson learned, right.

12

one arterial street is not equal to another

13

arterial street and same for residential streets.

14

So there was quite a bit of variability across

15

these 7 locations.

16

So

And in many cases the lights performed

17

really well.

18

even distribution, very little light trespass,

19

the glare was manageable, great thing.

20

You could say I love it, well lit,

In other cases we had some real

21

problems.

We had lights that were clearly

22

over-illuminating the opposite side of the

23

street.

24

the pole was getting washed in light that was

And the house that was directly opposite

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 40

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

really unacceptable.

2

these demonstrations in addition to the public

3

feedback.

4

continue to kind of refine.

5

So we learned a lot from

They have all been kind of -- and we

And I think I want to reiterate what

6

Leslie said.

What we demonstrated was potential

7

LED lighting.

8

not -- and we did not demonstrate dimmable

9

opportunities.

It was not light fixtures.

It was

We didn't do anything like that.

10

We just said let's put up some fixtures that

11

closely approximate the light levels that we are

12

asking for and see what they look like.

13

was a confirmation of concept, if you will, both

14

from the public and from our own internal staff.

15

And we have some work to do.

16

And it

And I think that the vendors have

17

responded in a way that give us options to make

18

what we end up installing better than what we end

19

up demonstrating.

20

MS. DARLING:

So that's the good news.
Thanks, George.

Now, I want

21

to get right into the evaluation process.

So as

22

you know we've discussed before that this is not

23

a low bid contract.

24

best value evaluation.

This was an -- this was a
We used a best value

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 41

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

determination informed by numerous criteria.

2

looked at way more than just pricing.

3

We

We wanted, as George was able to share

4

with you, fixture and technology quality and

5

capabilities were incredibly important to us.

6

didn't want to just get the lowest price and a

7

fixture that didn't meet our requirements.

8

wanted to see if we could sort of have it all

9

here with a fixture and technology that provided

We

We

10

the functionality and quality that we were

11

looking for, an approach to project

12

implementation that worked in conjunction with

13

what the City's needs were, making sure that we

14

had a team that had the qualifications and

15

experience and local resources and a commitment

16

to workforce development and local economic

17

initiatives that we laid out very clearly in the

18

RFP.

Go ahead.

19

MR. SCOTT:

I have one more question.

20

MS. DARLING:

21

MR. SCOTT:

Sure.

It's about capabilities as well.

22

So, you know, we all know about the public safety

23

dilemma that we're experiencing in Chicago.

24

the district that is in the 24th Ward, the 11th

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

And

 42

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

District, has been afforded the pilot of

2

ShotSpotter.

3

Wondering what is the ability to link

4

the two so that when that program is rolled out

5

across the City, is it possible to use -- right

6

now they're affixing them to individual's homes.

7

And they have to get a signoff and a waiver from

8

that individual.

9

on any of these new converted heads, I think that

If that ability presents itself

10

would be a better possibility for the City of

11

Chicago.

12

it -- is it compatible?

13

So has that been explored by CPD and is

MS. DARLING:

We have been in touch with CPD

14

consistently about this project in working with

15

Jonathan Lewin our CIO.

16

project and we have been working together on

17

plans and how this may be rolled out including

18

areas that have public safety issues.

19

something that we are -- we are having

20

conversations about.

21

He's aware of our

So that is

I don't want to make a commitment to

22

you right now, but it's certainly something that

23

if they feel the use of the poles and/or these

24

fixtures could benefit and, you know, there's a

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 43

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

fiscal match up there; then obviously, you know,

2

I'm sure that CDOT and CPD would work closely

3

together on making that a reality.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think just to address

5

the concern what I would say is what we can make

6

sure the staff does is be proactive rather than

7

reactive to wait for them to say understanding

8

from your perspective and I've heard this from

9

Alderman O'Shea whether we hear from CPD or not

10

that it's their priority, from the perspective of

11

the two members of the council who are

12

represented here, it's something that we should

13

be proactively pursuing.

14

will do that.

15

MR. SCOTT:

So I think the staff

And I do not -- I don't want a

16

guarantee.

17

opportunity presents itself and they match up

18

dollar for dollar and it's something that is

19

compatible technology wise, that we are exploring

20

every possible option to help with not only

21

saving costs for them as well as the City; but

22

making sure that we've explored, you know, how to

23

combat that public safety issue.

24

I just want to make sure that if that

And I know that we have been thinking

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 44

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

about that with the lights and the dimming

2

capabilities and all the other capabilities.

3

just wanted to make sure that ShotSpotter was on

4

the table as well.

5

MS. DARLING:

I

Absolutely, Alderman Scott.

6

give you my commitment that we will continue to

7

be proactive about that and make sure that we're

8

working together with CPD on making sure that we

9

are not siloing this project and we're working

I

10

together with all the City departments.

11

And, you know, we've really worked

12

hard to work with all the stakeholders from OEMC

13

to park district to CPD.

14

on because there's been so many different

15

stakeholders that we have been working with as

16

part of this project and we will make sure that

17

CPD is prioritized.

18

MR. SCOTT:

19

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And I could go on and

Thank you very much.
My biggest concern is

20

everybody saw this new show last night, APB.

21

It's going to be apps and, you know, all kinds of

22

stuff.

23
24

MS. DARLING:
didn't see it.

I heard about that, but I

Uh-oh.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 45

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1
2

MR. SCOTT:
well.

3
4

It's based here in Chicago as

MR. SILVERS:

You're responsible for making

that a reality.

5

MS. DARLING:

We're going to get right to

6

work.

7

this slide, but I wanted you to see the thought

8

process that went into how we consider the total

9

project score as we did the evaluation of the --

10

So I don't want to spend a lot of time on

of the RFP responses.

11

So these are the items that we looked

12

at.

13

So I wanted you to just sort of get a feel for

14

the breath and depth of thought that we put into

15

how we were going to weigh the value of these

16

proposals.

17

A little bit about how they were weighted.

I wanted Tom to take a quick minute to

18

discuss how the evaluation time and the

19

evaluation process works.

20

wanted to have an aggressive schedule, but a very

21

comprehensive and -- comprehensive process with a

22

very robust evaluation team that involved, as I

23

just said, many of the stakeholders.

24

You know, we really

So, Tom, if you could just take, you

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 46

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

know, a minute or two and quickly talk about the

2

process and we can entertain questions on that.

3

MR. BUDESCU:

Sure.

Thanks, Leslie.

So,

4

you know, we'll start on the right.

5

evaluation team was set up prior to the proposals

6

coming in.

7

process that once the proposals came in, we could

8

move as fast as possible because the goal is

9

really to get these lights up as soon as we can.

10

The

And we wanted to have a very defined

And so the evaluation team is composed

11

of three broad groups; the technical advisors,

12

the evaluation committee and the selection

13

committee.

14

The technical advisors were

15

essentially nonvoting advisors.

16

of City staff as well as staff from partner

17

organizations that had the technical expertise to

18

support the evaluation committee in better

19

understanding the proposals and evaluating the

20

proposals.

21

It was a group

There are three separate subgroups

22

within that.

One was specifically set up to

23

provide technical advice on lighting.

24

understanding the luminaire specifications and

So

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 47

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

what was being proposed.

2

that helped with the lighting management system.

3

And a workforce development subgroup that helped

4

evaluate the workforce development plans that

5

were coming in for the proposals.

6

A technology subgroup

The evaluation committee was an

7

independent review committee that was tasked with

8

essentially aggregating all that feedback as well

9

as going through all the proposals, scoring them

10

and reaching a consensus on the ranking of what

11

proposals offer from the best value to the least

12

value for the City.

13

They would then provide their

14

recommendation to the selection committee whose

15

job was to review that work, review that

16

recommendation and either accept or reject.

17

if they accept, they would then provide that

18

recommendation to the executive director of the

19

Infrastructure Trust.

20

And

So very quickly and in a little more

21

detail, it was really a four-phase evaluation

22

process.

23

was conducted by the CIT to say, we received six

24

proposals.

The preliminary responsiveness review

Do they meet the criteria we set out

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 48

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

as responsive -- for responsiveness in the RFP?

2

And all six did.

3

phase and the independent proposal review by the

4

evaluation committee.

5

presentation and demonstration of the technology

6

solution by each of the proposers, a review by

7

the technical advisor meetings and separate

8

workshop with each of the technical advisor

9

subgroups to provide their insight and feedback

Which moved them to the scoring

This included oral

10

to the evaluation committee and also for the

11

evaluation committee to ask the technical

12

advisors any questions they had in terms of

13

interpreting the proposals.

14

Then there was a preliminary scoring

15

consensus by the evaluation committee and a

16

consensus decision about whether to request best

17

and final offers or not.

18

was a final evaluation committee census on best

19

value determination.

20

And then finally there

That was phase three.

That evaluation committee

21

recommendation was then memorialized and provided

22

to the selection committee and presented as part

23

of an in-person presentation by representatives

24

of the evaluation committee to provide the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 49

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

rationale for their recommendation as well as

2

afford the selection committee the opportunity to

3

ask the evaluation committee any questions about

4

their process.

5

MS. DARLING:

Thanks, Tom.

We really wanted

6

to -- we really wanted to create this vision and

7

set the stage to make it a reality.

8

given a very high-level idea, as George had

9

mentioned, and we worked to craft the scope and

We were

10

the process to really improve the quality of life

11

for Chicago residents.

12

that we were saving energy and providing better

13

services to City residents and providing better

14

quality of light and quality of life.

15

We wanted to make sure

Also, we wanted to create additional

16

jobs to the extent that this project will be able

17

to do that.

18

ended up.

19

We are very pleased about where we

And so, you know, at this point we are

20

happy to answer additional questions; but we

21

would like to recommend the resolution that you

22

were sent previously and sits before you

23

regarding moving the great finalists to the City

24

so they may begin negotiations of the selected

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 50

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

members.

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

3

MR. SILVERS:

Yes.

Could the staff amplify --

4

explain a bit more about the workforce

5

development part of the criteria?

6

looking for and --

What you were

7

MS. DARLING:

Sure, absolutely.

8

MR. SILVERS:

And so where we are.

9

MS. DARLING:

So, first of all, I can tell

10

you that the finalists all met or exceeded the

11

MBE/WBE requirements as set forth in the RFP.

12

also are requiring in the RFP and the finalists

13

agreed to meet the requirements of having 50

14

percent of the work hours be performed by City of

15

Chicago residents.

16

We

Of those 10 percent are going to be

17

from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods as

18

set forth in the City's EEO ordinance and a map

19

created by the Department of Planning and

20

Development.

21

City.

Those are split into 2 areas of the

22

And so the west and south sides of the

23

City will be separate -- are in separate parts of

24

the map.

So 5 percent from each west and north

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 51

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

and 5 percent from east and south.

2

would be happy to provide that map to you.

3

MR. BUDESCU:

So and I

Yes, there is also a

4

requirement that 50 percent of the staff hired to

5

do the asset condition assessment --

6

MS. DARLING:

Thank you.

7

MR. BUDESCU:

-- in the first year of the

8

project have to be -- come from either CPS

9

programs that are -- there's a specific

10
11

requirement.
MS. DARLING:

Yes, it's a vocational program

12

and -- or from the Chicago Community College

13

Vocational Program.

14
15
16

MR. BUDESCU:

Or from an ex-offender

apprentice program.
MS. DARLING:

Right.

So and all of the

17

respondents agree to do that and abide by that

18

and made a commitment one way or the other.

19

believe that we'll be able to meet or exceed

20

those workforce recommendations and requirements

21

with selected measures.

22

MR. BUDESCU:

And one more thing.

We

There was

23

also an encouragement to meet the City's minority

24

and female participation goals as set out in the

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 52

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

EEO ordinance as well.

2

MS. DARLING:

Correct.

3

MR. BUDESCU:

And those that provided a

4

commitment to do so were given positive

5

consideration in the evaluation of their

6

workforce development plan as well.

7

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think just to make sure

8

that we didn't miss anything, after the meeting

9

we can just send around what those criteria were.

10

MS. DARLING:

11

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

12

public documents.

13

MS. DARLING:

14

Yes.
They were part of the

They were part of the public

documents and also part of your briefing.

15

MR. SILVERS:

Thank you.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Any other questions?

17

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Just to really backhoe on

18

Damon's earlier points.

To be a procurement

19

aficionado to be able to go through a process

20

like this and to get such significant, you know,

21

multiple respondents that were qualified across

22

such a complex process is really a credit to all

23

of you for structuring it.

24

demonstrates the value that you get when you get

And sort of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 53

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

a dedicated set of people to coordinate the

2

complexity and the innovation.

3

a best value process and to have the level of

4

interest we had sustained through this is a real

5

accomplishment.

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And so I support

Everyone has been

7

provided a copy of the resolution that's proposed

8

instructing the team here to having reviewed

9

responses from all six proposers and received a

10

recommendation of two finalists to move forward

11

with negotiations for the project in recommending

12

that to the City of Chicago moving forward with

13

those two finalists.

14

questions, I'd by happy to entertain that motion.

15

MS. HUBBARD:

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

If there are no other

17
18

All in favor?
(Chorus of ayes.)
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

21

Any opposed?

(No response.)

22

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

23

MS. DARLING:

24

Moved by Miss Hubbard.

Seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter.

19

almost 7-and-a-half million dollars worth of

investment in our neighborhoods.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

One of the things that,

3

Ralph, you mentioned before and I know Kristi had

4

come out to speak with your guys, but that, you

5

know, springtime is obviously an important time

6

for this.

7

know there is some staffing associated with this

8

as well.

9

springtime and peak home buying and revisit with

I think we should really plan to -- I

But plan to gear up before the

you, Ralph, and all of the member organizations

11

between you and Jorge and Miss Fredop (phonetic).

12

If you look at the numbers here, this

13

is kind of just off the top of my head; but of

14

the loans that have closed so far, you know,

15

you're talking about an average home of about

16

$220,000.

17

you know, just north of $70,000.

18

score just south of 700.

19

this could not be further in the middle of

20

working families of Chicago.

21

You know, average family income of,
And credit

You know, this is --

Right.

And the number of people that this

22

applies to is massive.

And we've had, you know,

23

good traction, but this isn't -- this is the --

24

the euphemism, the tip of the iceberg.

This

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

isn't even the tip of the iceberg.

a snowflake off of the top.

This is like

So I think we need your help, Ralph,

10

and some of your colleagues.

11

Alderman Scott and Alderman O'Shea, with your

12

colleagues in getting more traction.

13

out what went well, what didn't go well.

14

this is such a tremendous opportunity that is

15

made available because of, you know, kind of

16

where we are in the cycle.

17

there's more rate uncertainty, it will -- it

18

should spark even further interest in people

19

wanting to kind of lock in sooner.

20

We need your help,

Figuring
Because

And I think as

So as we approach the spring and as we

21

approach potentially more rate uncertainty, you

22

know, we would love your feedback to the team in

23

how we get this out, get this widely adopted and

24

take advantage of this next season.

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

MS. HUBBARD:

I just wanted to ask one

2

question and I have to leave unfortunately.

3

mentioned that to you, Leslie.

4

the potential increase in interest rate or is it

5

a fixed rate on this program?

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I

Is it impacted by

Well, so all the rates

7

are subject to whatever the rates of the lenders

8

are.

9
10

MS. HUBBARD:

Okay.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So if -- if the -- if

11

people believe pay rates are going up, I better

12

lock in even my refi now let alone purchase a new

13

home, you know, there's -- there is a benefit to

14

early action.

15

MS. CAFARO:

Mr. Chairman, it's February and

16

it's already spring in Chicago I think looking

17

outside.

18

approaching actually the season.

19

in it.

20

Super Bowl --

And I do think this is -- we are not
I think we are

So I would accelerate that.

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

22

MS. CAFARO:

Usually post

People start --

So I would -- I think your

23

comments are right on, but maybe it's more

24

immediate.

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes.

And I've seen, you

2

know, we've participated in the City service

3

fairs, we've participated in different

4

aldermanic; it just hasn't taken hold.

5

MS. CAFARO:

And it should.

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And it absolutely should.

7

Again, average size of the grant is $8,000.

8

These are working families.

9

family income with $70,000 on average.

You know, full
Not, you

10

know, stellar credit scores.

11

it's in 37 of the 50 wards means it's applicable

12

everywhere.

13

And the fact that

So, you know, I think we have to be

14

more thoughtful, but more creative about it.

15

also haven't had the dedicated resource to it

16

which I think will help as we try to do that.

17

But, you know, I think being

We

18

thoughtful in partnerships with the realtors

19

maybe and sort of doing more of that.

20

lenders have been helpful, but there's only so

21

much that they're going to do.

22

realtors are the ones who are trying to, you

23

know, drive demand.

24

MS. DARLING:

The

I think the

And we did meet with the --

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 59

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

just to add to that, we did meet with the

2

Illinois Association of Realtors, their public

3

policy committee, and they sent out a blast

4

through the MLS Service to all the realtors that

5

show in the City of Chicago to make them aware of

6

the program.

7

So we have been taking steps to spread

8

the word.

We are obviously going to become more

9

aggressive.

So this is not the only program like

10

this that's available.

11

that the program also stays competitive.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

13

MS. BARRETT:

So we have to make sure

Yes.

This update and the

14

partnerships you just mentioned in relation to

15

the realtors are really important.

16

there is a network of not-for-profit housing

17

counseling organizations.

18

there is a lot of offerings out there.

19

backing -- backup that marketing push I think

20

would be helpful, and we can assist with that

21

network of organizations as well as there's been

22

a fair amount of attention to the Cook County

23

Land Bank making both land and parcels with homes

24

on them available.

In addition,

And like you said
So

So there may be some

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 60

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1
2

partnership marketing opportunities there.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Yes, I also think that

3

there's -- you know, there was -- you're more

4

familiar with this probably than anyone, Mary

5

Sue, but the hardest hit program that was driven

6

by the U. S. Treasury that put money in the

7

states in this case that will be -- we talked a

8

little bit about this, that will be the local

9

agency that administers as IDA.

10

Which I think

Kim used to run actually.

11

But I think that after this session in

12

Springfield there will be more attention to that

13

program.

14

proliferation of those resources driving more

15

demand.

16

not mutually exclusive and can be done in

17

conjunction.

18

And the sort of release and

And I think that these two programs are

I think that's part of the -- you

19

know, Leslie raises the issue.

There are a lot

20

of different housing programs out there.

21

being clearer about what we can partner with and

22

what by definition is similar and needs to be

23

mutually exclusive, I think will be helpful in

24

partnering with the folks who are already --

And us

Yes, experts in marketing

there and will help a lot.
MS. DARLING:

Okay.

So we are going to continue to

5

be very involved in the Smart Lighting Project

6

both through the contract negotiation process and

7

at least the first year of implementation at the

8

request of the City.

9

continue to be a pole on our resources

So we expect that that will

10

particularly through getting a contract executed

11

and getting the project up and running.

12

expect that will continue to take quite a bit of

13

our resources.

14

So we

But we are, as you know, continuing to

15

explore new opportunities in pertaining to the

16

development of many new projects.

17

continuing to work on a Retrofit 2 Project.

18

have a meeting set up next week that the City is

19

coordinating.

20

you on a possibility of additional energy savings

21

projects.

22

We are
We

So we will be circling back with

So that is -- that is what I can share

23

right now.

I don't have a lot of specifics on

24

additional projects that are under consideration,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 62

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

but we are consistently working on maximizing

2

value of underutilized assets for the City and

3

also looking to partner with the City on future

4

investments.

5

I think we are very uniquely

6

positioned.

7

has proven out what we are capable of and we are

8

looking forward to partnering with the City as we

9

go forward.

10

We think the Smart Lighting Project

I've spent some time talking to

11

Chairman Summers about some other ideas about

12

using some of our own program funds to see what

13

we can do to continue to invest in our City even

14

a small amount.

15

beneficial use of our time and look forward to

16

brainstorming with all of you on that in the

17

coming months ahead.

We feel like that may be a very

18

We want to get a jump on that and are

19

looking forward to having more to share with you

20

in the comings months.

21

want to tap the great resources that you as the

board have and are open to hearing your ideas

During my lifetime I've seen the stars

disappear.

the Indiana Dunes, the City of Chicago at

5

midnight looks like sunrise.

contributing to the sky glow over -- the light

7

dome over the City of Chicago is contributing to

the light sky glow over the Indiana Dunes.

And, for example, from the beach at

And so that's

But, yeah, so this is not -- not

necessary.

11

Dunes with no light, and I'm not suggesting that

12

you eliminate all lights in the City of Chicago;

13

but the lighting is unnecessarily bright.

14

Because just by your own public comments 88

15

percent of the public say that the sky or that

16

the demo lights is more than sufficient.

17

It -- if you can walk at the Indiana

Now, I mean, that sounds like a good

18

thing, but it's actually a bad thing.

The -- I

19

wonder if you had an expert on vision on your

list of technical experts.

21

the lighting, you're actually increasing the

22

contrast.

24

it's actually more difficult to see.

Because by increasing

So in a shaded area it -- from an

So, you

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 65

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

know, there is actually some disadvantage to

2

increasing the lighting.

3

But there is several things, several

4

factors, the blue content shielding timers which

5

I think you've got covered.

6

the contrast.

7

that interferes with your night vision.

8

you're dark adapted in one area and walk into the

9

blue rich section under the LED lights, not that

And, like I said,

But the blue content of the light,
So if

10

LED's are particularly different than mercury

11

vapor; but the effect is the same and -- although

12

LED's are more efficient and cost effective.

13

But so your damage -- your night

14

vision you go back into a darker area, it's going

15

to take you, you know, minutes or more to adapt.

16

The blue content has several effects.

17

Well, the AMA, American Medical Association,

18

recommends that it be 3,000 Kelvin or less and

19

that's just over the summer they made this

20

recommendation.

highest limit of the American Medical Association

recommendation.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Mr. Silvestri, if I could

ask you to wrap up your comments here.

3

MR. SILVESTRI:

Okay.

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm sorry, but we have a

5

three-minute time limit.

6

upfront, so I let you go over a bit.

7

could just --

8

MR. SILVESTRI:

I didn't say that

Okay.

So If you

Michigan City just

had a test intersection at Franklin and 6th

10

Street.

And we left that up for almost a year.

11

And we went through several iterations of

12

different light.

13

our district.

14

And we regret that because now the AMA is

15

recommending 3,000.

16

Just for our small, you know,

And we settled on 3,500 Kelvin.

This is after the fact.

Now, I would ask -- in conclusion I

17

would ask that you do another demo.

18

admission this is not the final product.

19

that the next -- the full rollout of all the

20

streetlights will be better, but why not do a

21

demo of the final product.

far below the 3,000 Kelvin color temperature.

If you can give me clue

No problem.

I have been involved -- my

probably before then.

reducing the health issues of light at night.

I've donated tens of

Briefly it turns out that life

16

involved in the planet with the day and night

17

that your brain is suprachiasmatic nucleus and

18

the brain interprets that as blue light in the

19

daytime, lack of blue meaning nighttime.

20

So when the retina notices blue light,

21

it immediately within one second shuts down your

22

melatonin production.

23

with health?

24

What does that have to do

Turns out that lack of melatonin

higher increased rate of breast, prostate, bone

cancers, some pancreatic, some lymphomas,

aggression, sleep disorders, more propensity for

wanting drugs and alcohol, that ability of not

being able to control and mood disorders, memory

disorders and more.

9

And not only that, it hurts maybe the
wildlife and the ecosystems.

So there's so much,

10

much more I can't -- you know, at the time I

can't go into this.

12

There's LED's that come in all different

spectrums.

But Larry was right.

One of the top experts in the world

everyone.

21

And I think

So I want to thank

I have been involved in this

22

conversation online and I was just wondering the

23

input from the City and people like advocates

24

like the lady there, has that been taken into

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 71

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

account in the procurement process and to what

2

degree has that been taken into account?

3

So night sky, Kelvin, color

4

temperature, light trespass.

5

that been part of the conversation in the

6

procurement process or -- I'm sure it has been,

7

but is that -- is -- to what degree has that

8

input been taken into account?

9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

How much of has

Well, what we will do is

10

if there is a question, then after all the

11

comments we'll have a statement that addressing

12

anything that --

13

MR. LUAUTERS:

Oh, I see.

Okay.

So I hope

14

that the input from the City because I didn't see

15

on there any input about like color temperature,

16

night sky.

17

the best for the City and the region.

18

everyone here does to really set an example for

19

what Chicago can do.

20

Like, you know, we want to make this
And I know

So we encourage you to, you know, and

21

I don't know where the procurement process is

22

because I work in construction.

23

down the line in procurement, any change costs

24

money.

And once you're

And so I'm wondering, you know, at what,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 72

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

you know, hopefully we can see actual mockups of

2

what they're going to -- what's been procured and

3

then be able to make adjustments after that.

4

Because otherwise, you know, once it's

5

procured because as you said the test light areas

6

are not representative of what we're going to get

7

ultimately.

8

them.

9

bright and very blue.

So it's sort of moot to go look at

Because I've been to them and they're very
And so, you know, a lot of

10

people don't feel like those are going to be

11

beneficial for, you know, health and lighting.

12

So ideally you can see a mockup of what's going

13

to be procured and then be able to make

14

adjustments because anything other than that is a

15

waste of time.

16

So and thank you for your time and

17

effort.

decision for Chicago.

And we hope you make the absolute best

their most critical element.

It's harsh.

The lighting is -- the word

And I think although the

And that is because Chicago is an

amazing beautiful city.

These lights don't

achieve that goal.

16

poor design in the fixtures.

17

themselves are very tiny point sources.

18

source illumination produces these dark, you

know, bright areas and then dark shadows.

20

these lights, the fixtures, lack a diffusing

element.

22

Another thing also is that if you talk

been driving on the road and we've seen some of

for the oncoming traffic if you're driving into

that a new lighting design is chosen.

13

that has a warmer hue and a diffusing element so

14

that Chicago is put in the best possible light

15

and also with a full cutoff so the lights aim

16

downward.

17

opportunity to speak.

18

Something

Thank you very much for this

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Thank you, Mr. Harris.

19

Before we go to executive session if Leslie or

20

George you want to respond to some of what we

21

heard here in the public comment period.

22

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

23

George and then wrap up.

24

MR. MARQUISOS:

I think I'll turn it to

Okay.

First of all, I

 75

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

appreciate all of your -- there's nothing better

2

than concerned citizens kind of coming forth and

3

expressing these points of view.

4

that they are relevant.

5

And I think

And to answer your question, do we

6

take things seriously?

Yes.

And have we spent a

7

lot of time looking at and researching all forms

8

of how these lights are being perceived?

9

again, I'm not a lighting expert, but we are

And,

10

lucky enough to have partnerships with people who

11

are.

12

the ANSI standards right now for LED lights in

13

the future are on our team.

14

the technical advisors that assisted us.

So the people who are writing the codes,

15

And they're part of

And I just want to give you -- this is

16

not a -- I'll give you an example of the kind of

17

balancing that we're trying to accomplish here.

18

So let's just take the example of amber light.

19

And, again, it's a warmer light.

20

line with the color temperature of high pressure

21

sodium.

22

-- there's no downside.

23
24

Why not put it in?

It is more in

Right.

There's no

Well, amber lights as best we know,
again, aren't widely manufactured and not readily

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 76

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

available.

2

understood that whether -- they're less available

3

than the current.

4

But that aside we have pretty much

So an amber light now is producing

5

somewhere around 74 lumens per watt as opposed to

6

120 lumens per watt per 3,000 Kelvin.

7

that mean?

8
9

What does

Why do I care?
What that means is if everything went

amber, the City of Chicago would spend $6 million

10

more per year on it's electric bill.

11

the 15-year useful life of that, that translates

12

to over $100 million at current rates.

13

not even assuming electric rates go up.

14

real consideration.

15

the only consideration, but we're trying to

16

balance a host of things.

17

And over

So that's
That's a

And I'm not saying that it's

And in addition to that we have people

18

who live in neighborhoods with high crime and

19

they like the visibility, the greater

20

effectiveness of surveillance cameras.

21

the peripheral vision, the color rendition.

22

There's a lot of aspects in whiter light that

23

some people respond to and very much appreciate

24

in value.

They like

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 77

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

So there is a host of opinions and

2

perceptions about how lighting should, in fact,

3

be deployed.

4

and where I'm hoping to answer your question, we

5

are not locked into a procurement.

6

we buy, this phase one, we're stuck with for the

7

next four years.

8

whereby we have the ability and actually it's

9

mandatory that we reprocure light fixtures every

The beauty I think of what we have

So whatever

We have built in a process

10

year.

11

built-in cost for changing fixtures.

12

So we are not locked in and there is no

And actually we have the reverse.

We

13

are anticipating that the cost of light fixtures

14

are going to come down over the next four years

15

and we have a method where the City takes

16

advantage of those advancements.

17

built that in, some flexibility, into our light

18

fixture selection process moving forward.

19

And so we've

The other good thing is those light

20

demonstrations that you're seeing now that many

21

are interpreting as being too bright or too

22

harsh, the dimmable drivers built into each one

23

of these fixtures allows us -- what we know about

24

LED lights is 15 years from now they will

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 78

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

probably not be burned out.

2

probably delivering less light than they do day

3

one.

4

They will be

So we have the ability to now dim them

5

to the point where we get the average light that

6

we expect over its 15-year duration.

7

affords us the ability to keep a consistent level

8

of light throughout its entire useful life.

9

And that

These are all things that give us the

10

ability to respond to and adjust as we learn more

11

and adapt to what the citizens of Chicago need.

12

MR. SILVERS:

Can I just ask George to

13

address the diffusion point the gentleman made

14

earlier.

15

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes, okay.

So there's been

16

a lot of -- and I'm reluctant to get into it too

17

much.

18

MR. SILVERS:

Please not too much, but some.

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

These will be fully shield

20

and full cutoff.

And so all our lights have been

21

specced so far.

22

demonstrated are zero up-light lights.

23

is no light that is allowed to be transmitted --

24

obviously if it gets reflected up, that's another

And the lights that are being

1

thing.

But there is no light that is being

2

transmitted above the horizon line of the fixture

3

itself.

4

is no light being transmitted above 20 feet.

5

that is per the specification.

6

the recommendations of the Dark Sky and the AMA.

7

And so the light is being directed down.

So if the fixture is at 20 feet, there

8
9

And

And that is per

Now, LED's have different lenses that
we try to disperse the light.

We are limited by

10

the location of our poles.

The poles are where

11

they're at.

12

them.

13

So we have to figure out a fixture that is going

14

to deliver the light in an average dispersion and

15

not trespass as best we can given, you know, the

16

restriction of the constraint of the pole height

17

and location.

18

continue to work on and refine over and over and

19

over again.

We don't have the money to move

We don't have the money to change them.

And that's what we are going to

And this is an ongoing process.

I

21

don't want anyone to come away thinking it's a

This is what the City is going to

We are learning every time we deploy.

question?

sorry.

temperature.

procurement we get maybe a little more, you know,

or just at 3,000; why can't we come down to a

warmer temperature?

Just one question about the Kelvin

If we are shooting for 3,000 and in

Because I think that's one of the
key -- the key things.

Like where are we going

10

to end up?

11

we are going to end up where we want to be?

12

I'm

And how are we going to assure that

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Okay.

What we're going

13

to do is George will be available after the

14

session.

15

to public comments which isn't a requirement.

16

We're doing it because we think it's the right

17

thing to do.

18

spend time on that question, he'll be around just

19

after.

20

And he's done a good job of responding

And rather than keep everyone and

Leslie, do you have anything else you

21

wanted to say before I'll make a quick comment

22

before we adjourn?

23
24

MS. DARLING:

No, but I think George really,

really addressed the questions and issues that

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

 81

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

came up from the public comment.

2

echo his appreciation.

3

and we have taken the public's reaction to this

4

project into consideration.

5

extraordinarily seriously and we've tried to

6

balance all the interests to come out with a

7

project that works for as many Chicagoans as

8

possible.

9

I do want to

We do take public comment

We have taken it

This is going to be a change in the

10

night sky in the City of Chicago and we are very

11

appreciative that that change is going to occur

12

and some people are welcoming it and some people

13

less so.

15

Chicago and its citizens.

16

comments.

17

Our goal is to make sure that we are

We appreciate your

This, as George said, is not a done

deal.

We have not completed the procurement

19

process.

20

to tweak to make sure that we're delivering the

best light.

people mentioned, the AMA recommendations and the

International Dark Sky Association's

recommendation of 3,000 Kelvin light.

We'll have the opportunity to continue

So we certainly look forward to

7

keeping you updated.

And there will be a lot of

8

public outreach as a part of this project I have

9

implemented.

And I think you'll see, you know,

10

possibly websites and where you'll be able to see

11

where the lights are going to be deployed.

12

there will be a lot of information available to

13

the public and we'll look forward to keeping you

14

updated.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And

Let me just say that the

16

-- this has been a more than year long process

17

inclusive of the RFI.

18

tremendous job of shepherding it with multiple

19

stakeholders and several different types of

20

questions that they've had to answer, financial,

21

environmental, political, you name it.

22

they've done a phenomenal job.

23

both Damon and Carl mentioned, this is a

24

testament to what we can do in adding value and

And the team has done a

And

And I think as

2

capacity to any complicated process like this.
One request that I would make of the

3

board and advisory board members, we didn't spend

4

a lot of time on project pipeline today.

5

part of that is because this process has taken

6

quite of a bit of resource from the team.

7

And

And now that we're at this juncture,

8

Leslie and the team and all of us I think are at

9

an appropriate time to refocus our efforts on

10

what is next and be as thoughtful and creative

11

and innovative as possible.

12

And one thing that Leslie mentioned,

13

which I think should be a good guide for us, is

14

we'll all be thinking about value add, but also

15

revenue generating.

16

virtue of what our budget versus actual has been

17

some resources to invest and to invest in things

18

that can ultimately create opportunities for us

19

to be innovative.

20

And that we will have by

The thing that I would ask all of you

21

is to be thinking about those things and be as

22

creative and innovative as possible.

23

much as you can, give some individual time to

24

Leslie and Tom and George and the team.

And in as

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 84

Chicago Infrastructure Trust Meeting - February 7, 2017

1

And what I've found personally is that

2

it's productive, you know, spending some time in

3

a room and letting, you know, kind of your

4

thoughts fly, thinking about best practices and

5

things that you've seen or things that you don't

6

know where it may exist or where the right home

7

for it may be; but it's something that you think

8

the City needs and would benefit from.

9

nothing else let's entertain that conversation.

10

And what I would encourage all of us

If

11

to do is to have that discussion with Leslie and

12

the team between now and the next board meeting.

13
14

With that I'm happy to entertain a
motion to adjourn.
