**Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the information regarding coding, Director Michael referenced page 15 of the
report; he inquired further regarding the action under which a coder is removed from production. Marie
Franklin, Coding Manager for McKesson Revenue Management Solutions, responded that when a coder
scores in the red zone, the coder is removed from production, and the errors are reviewed by Compliance and
Education. The coder is given thirty additional charts to review; if the coder passes at 90%, the coder is put
back into production, and under a quality assurance process, 25% of their charts have to be reviewed. If a
coder fails the remedial batch, the coder is still out of production; another batch is given. Depending on the
errors, if it is the same error, then management would move toward corrective action. If it is a different
error, management would provide the education and request additional charts to review. Director Michael
inquired as to the approximate percentage of coders that are out of production and being retrained in a given
quarter. Ms. Franklin responded that, overall, perhaps less than 10% are removed from production.
Natasha Lafayette-Jones, Director of Health Information Management (HIM), provided additional
information regarding the update on coding. She reviewed some of the internal processes for coding; she
noted that previously some results were submitted that were their first external audit results. She indicated
that, with regard to inpatient results, coding accuracy is at 94.1%; the System’s benchmark for coding
standard is 95%. Management takes the external results and works with the coders to educate; the entire
group gets the education on what happened, how it happened and how to avoid it. She stated that audit
results on coding for the Emergency Rooms (ERs) are expected in May and will be brought to this
Committee and to the Board1.
For the ER audit, she stated that they will segregate out the internal staff and results and the external
vendors’ results; in the case of ER, facility and professional coding will be reviewed from an external
perspective.
Director Velasquez inquired as to the total number of coders on staff at the System, and whether they are all
certified. Ms. Lafayette-Jones responded that twenty-three coding positions are budgeted for the System;
twelve positions are filled and eleven are vacant. There are ongoing efforts to recruit and ensure that the
System reaches the proper staffing model. With regard to junior coders, which are non-certified coders, Ms.
Lafayette-Jones stated that there are two budgeted positions, both of which are filled. She referenced a
previous letter of agreement, under which the System had offered education to ramp-up the coders; she
stated that the junior coders are the two coders that were not able to achieve the level prescribed. Under the
agreement, the junior coders perform certain types of coding that are not as impactful as more complicated or
higher-acuity cases.
Ms. Lafayette-Jones stated that there are efforts to centralize coding. In conjunction with the ICD-10
project manager, she stated that there is a need to centralize coding to ensure that the System can properly
educate its coders.
The current staffing model addresses mainly the acute care coding, which includes inpatient, ERs, same-day
surgery and observation accounts. This staffing model does not accommodate outpatient, which is
predominately what McKesson does from a professional fee perspective. Chairman Muñoz clarified that the
additional work load that exists that is not addressed by the current staffing levels is addressed by the System
bringing on external coding vendors to bring the System to the levels that are needed. Ms. Lafayette-Jones
responded affirmatively. Chairman Muñoz inquired further regarding acute care coding and coding for
services that fall outside that category. Ms. Lafayette-Jones stated that, with regard to ambulatory services
and clinics, staff from HIM and Medical Records will also code some of the minor procedure areas, where
doctors are doing invasive and not basic procedures.

**Report from System Corporate Compliance Officer (continued)
The Committee held an extensive discussion regarding coding for Trauma services. John Cookinham,
System Chief Financial Officer, stated that an issue arose in which the System received notice from the State
that the System had virtually no Trauma activity, which is not the case. This issue appears to be tied to
revenue codes, rather than to medical coding; it was determined that the Charge Description Master (CDM)
and the revenue code setup for the services in that area were not set up properly.
Following the discussion of the matter, Chairman Muñoz stated that a report on the issue would be useful, to
review and get a sense of how the issue evolved and the magnitude – in order to understand whether it was
an issue involving, for example, information flow, process, or information technology. Mr. Cookinham
responded affirmatively; he stated that an assessment of the issue will be brought back to the Committee2.
During the review of the information on the Accounting of Disclosures Survey, Ms. Bodnar noted that
efforts are currently underway to include language in the Conflict of Interest Policy relating to the
ramifications for not completing the survey within the designated parameters; this language is anticipated to
be added in time for the roll-out to the entire population by May 2nd.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Item
A. Update from McGladrey LLP on FY2012 Audit
The following representatives from McGladrey LLP, provided an update on activities relating to the
FY2012 Audit activities: Pat Kitchen, Partner; and Tim Heinrichs, Director. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
Mr. Kitchen stated that he is pleased to report very good progress on the audit activities; representatives
from McGladrey continue to receive strong cooperation from System management. In terms of the
System audit, there are elements of the financial statements that are audited by the Health System audit
team, and elements that are audited by the County audit team. With respect to the items for which he and
his colleagues have primary responsibility as the Health System audit team, those areas are substantially
complete – including cash, inventory, capital assets, accrued vacation and third-party settlements; he
stated that there are no significant issues to report.
With respect to the testing of patients accounts receivable, Mr. Kitchen stated that the testing is ongoing;
they are hoping to conclude this soon, but to date, they have not encountered any issues or red flags/areas
of concern with that testing.
The areas being audited by the County audit team include additional cash and investments, self-insurance
liabilities, debt, pension liabilities, payroll, and various tax revenue. To date, there have been no
communications from the County audit team with respect to any issues that would have a trickle-down
effect, in terms of the Health System financial statements.
Mr. Kitchen stated that the County audit is progressing ahead of schedule; there is a fair amount of work
yet to be done to complete the audit, in time for the County to file its Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report (CAFR) by the May 31 deadline. With regard to the completion of the Health System financial
statements, it was indicated that this should be completed sometime in May.

 Annual Sanction Screening Checks
The checks are specialized searches to identify
individuals or entities that have been sanctioned or
debarred from participation in federally funded
healthcare programs.

March 12, 2013
Cathy Bodnar, MS, RN, CHC
Chief Compliance Officer
Cook County Health & Hospitals System
1900 West Polk, Suite 123 Rm 118
Chicago, IL 60612
Dear Cathy:
This is a summary report for our review of Cook County Health & Hospitals
System employees and vendors which was conducted by our office on February
28 - March 4, 2013. Based on data we received on February 26, 2013, we
reviewed 5,970 employees and 1,028 vendors (after removing exact duplicates)
for possible sanctions which could affect federal or state healthcare funding.
These individuals and vendors were reviewed by checking for name matches
against the OIG List of Excluded Individuals/Entities and the System for Award
Management (SAM) Exclusions list (formerly known as the GSA Excluded Party
List System) which also includes the U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially
Designated Nationals (SDN) List. They also were matched against the State of
Illinois Provider Sanctions list.
When no match occurs, we assess that individual to be not excluded from federal
or state healthcare programs. When a possible match does occur, our analysts
then review each possible match and perform any additional research as
necessary to resolve each of these matches. After further review, we determined
that none of these matches were positive.
These employees and vendors will continue to be screened for any new
exclusions through our ContinueCheck® monthly rechecking service for the next
11 months as specified in our contract. Cook County Health & Hospitals System
also may send us a list of newly-hired employees and newly-engaged vendors
each month to be included in this monthly rechecking.
Sincerely,

Brady
