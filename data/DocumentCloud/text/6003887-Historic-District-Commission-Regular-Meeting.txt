STAFF REPORT 5-8-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER:19-6185
ADDRESS: 479 (469) PRENTIS
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WARREN PRENTIS
APPLICANT: SUSAN CARDONA
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 5-2-2019

PREPARED BY: J.ROSS

PROPOSAL
The resource located at 479 Prentis was erected ca. 1910. The 2 ½-story dwelling features a
rectangular footprint. The roof is hipped with a front-gable at the primary elevation. Hipped and
gabled dormers top the roof. Several rooftop skylights are visible from the public right-of-way.
Exterior walls are brick at side elevations, while brick and stucco with half-timbering detailing is
located at the front elevation. A prominent two-story wood porch extends the front elevation’s full
width. Window bays are located at the front and side elevations. Windows are 1/1 wood units. A 4story apartment building sits to the west of the building, while an open lot is directly to the east.
With the current submission, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to install solar
panels at the building’s rooftop. Specifically, the installation consists of the following two lowprofile solar panel arrays as per the attached:
•
•

A 16’-7”x 12’x8”, 9-panel array at the west roof surface. The array is pushed back 14’-9”
from the house’s front face, behind a chimney
A 6’-7”x 8’-5” three panel array this is located on at the rear-facing roof surface

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
The solar array proposed for installation at the rear portion of the roof will not be visible from the
public right-of-way. However, the 9-panel array will be visible. See the National Park Service
Bulletin entitled “Interpreting the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, # 52
Subject: Incorporating Solar Panels in a Rehabilitation Project”:
https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/applying-rehabilitation/its-bulletins/ITS52-SolarPanels.pdf
This bulletin notes that “properties with a hipped or gabled roof are generally not good candidates for
a rooftop solar installation. Solar panels on historic buildings should not be visible from the public
right of way such as nearby streets, sidewalks or other public spaces.” However, the below National
Park Service publication entitled “New Technology and Historic Properties” does cite two examples
of solar installations that are “…visible but not conspicuous…” and thus meet the standards:
https://www.nps.gov/tps/sustainability/new-technology/solar-on-historic.htm
In re: to the current application, please note that the applicant’s initial submittal did propose to install
the larger 9-panel array directly north of the chimney, in a location which would be highly visible
from the public right-of-way. However, after a discussion with HDC staff, the applicant repositioned
the array to a less-visible location, behind the chimney/14’-9” from the house’s front face. Also, the
adjacent 4-story apartment building serves to further minimize the visibility of the western roof slope
and the proposed 9-panel array. Finally, as previously noted, the 6-panel array is located on the rear
roof slope and will not be visible from the public right-of-way. It is therefore staff’s opinion that the
installation will be inconspicuous and will not detract from the building’s or districts historic
character.

 APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7) Relationship of Materials. A majority of buildings are faced with brick and feature stone or cast
stone trim. Single-family residential buildings are generally faced with brick and feature wooden
brackets, bay windows, vergeboards, timbering, porch supports, dentils, entablature, or other
classically inspired elements, and other details depending on style. A small number of singlefamily residential buildings feature wood clapboard siding. Stone or stone facing defines the
foundations of buildings at 643-647 and 748 West Alexandrine Avenue, 481 Brainard Avenue,
3957 and 4107 Cass Avenue, and 500 West Willis Avenue, the lower levels of buildings at 4120
Cass Avenue, 3761 Second Avenue, 495-497 West Willis Avenue, and the entire primary façade
of buildings at 624 and 627 West Alexandrine Avenue and 3977 Cass Avenue. The buildings at
3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, 3900 and 3977
Second Avenue, and 4100 Third Avenue are composed primarily of stone. Sash windows are
historically wood but have, in many cases, been replaced with windows of more modern
materials. Stone is used for window sills on a majority of buildings within the district. While
roofs within the district are generally flat and not visible, pitched roofs typically feature visible
slate or asphalt shingles. Buildings at 686 Selden and 711 West Alexandrine Avenue feature clay
tile roofs. The building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist
Church, features a copper roof on its tower.
(8) Relationship of Textures. On a majority of buildings within the district, the major textural effect
is that of brick with mortar joints juxtaposed with cast stone or limestone trim. Patterned
brickwork is used to create subtle detail on commercial and apartment buildings, such as
spandrels and rectangular panels, and more pronounced textural interest where it exists on the
upper stories of buildings, such as at 461 West Alexandrine Avenue, and in an arcaded cornice
on the building at 711 West Alexandrine Avenue. Where they exist, detailed wooden
vergeboards, gables, brackets, and dormers create considerable textural interest on all singlefamily residential buildings in the district. Rough-cut stone with thick mortar joints creates
considerable textural interest on buildings where it exists, while other buildings feature smooth
stone with thin mortar joints. In general, asphalt shingle roofs do not contribute to textural
interest.
(9) Relationship of Colors. Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate on
wall surfaces, while natural stone colors in shades of gray, red, and brown also exist. Although
most roofs are flat and therefore not visible, sloped roofs typically feature gray asphalt, while
some feature red or green clay tile or slate in contrasting colors of gray, red, or green. Wooden
architectural details are frequently painted in bold colors, appropriate to the architectural style of
the buildings, which contract markedly with brick facing. Brick apartment buildings are generally
unpainted, with gray stone trim contrasting with brown or buff brickwork. Brick on commercial
buildings is frequently painted in shades of yellow or orange. The original colors of any building,
as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for that building and may provide
guidance for similar buildings.
(10) Relationship of Architectural Details. Buildings in the district exemplify a broad range of
architectural styles, and their architectural details relate to their style. Pre-1880 residential
buildings, as well as commercial buildings on Woodward Avenue, are Italianate in style. Singlefamily residential buildings are often Queen Anne or Stick/Eastlake in style. Romanesque
Revival structures include the building at 3977 Second Avenue, commonly known as the
Campbell-Symington House, and the building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as the
Cass Avenue Methodist Church. Larger apartment buildings include the Spanish Medieval
building at 624 West Alexandrine Avenue, commonly known as the El Moore Flats, and several
buildings in Beaux Arts and Colonial Revival styles. Also represented are the Jacobethan
−2−

 Revival, Craftsman, Spanish Colonial, Late Gothic, and Neo-Georgian styles. Buildings range
from vernacular to high style in appearance, with the level of architectural detail varying greatly
from one building to the next.
(11) Relationship of Roof Shapes. Most apartment buildings and all nonresidential buildings have flat
roofs that cannot be seen from the ground, with the exception of the building at 3901 Cass
Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, with prominent cross gables
defining its nave and transept and a hip roof defining a two-story addition. Single-family
residential buildings feature multiple roof shapes, with steep, intersecting gables, dormers,
towers, and tall chimneys creating dramatic silhouettes. Flat-roofed apartment buildings often
feature stepped or triangular parapet walls, occasionally with crenellation or balustrades, which
add interest to the building’s roofline.
RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it is HDC staff’s opinion that the proposed solar installation is
inconspicuous/minimally-visible from the public-right-of-way and therefore will not detract from the
home’s or district’s historic character. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for the work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation standard number 2) The historic character of a property shall
be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces
that characterize a property shall be avoided and standard number (10) New additions and adjacent
or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the
essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
•

Motion DRAFT
I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed project
because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation standard number
2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of
historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and standard number (10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction
shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
