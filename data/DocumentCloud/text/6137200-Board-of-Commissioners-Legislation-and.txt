NOTICE

There will be a meeting of the Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations Committee of the
Board of Commissioners of Cook County on Tuesday, May 13, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 AM. in the Board
Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois to consider the following:

293931 CANDIDATES FOR THE INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY BUREAU
OF HEALTH (APPOINTMENTS). Transmitting a Communication from Todd H. Stroger, President,
Cook County Board of Commissioners, dated May 2, 2008.

I would like to thank the members of the Nominating Committee for the work they have done and
most importantly for putting together a list of 20 excellent candidates. This has been a difficult
process, in that, all of the candidates offered have certain skills that make them viable candidates to
enhance this Independent Board. In putting together this list, I have attempted to look at the
following two key factors:

(1) I want a balanced board with diverse skill sets needed to address the problems we face
in a large complex public health network such as ours; and

(2) I want a board that reflects the cultural, gender and racial diversity of our County.

Additionally, I attempted to the best of my abilities, to be certain that there were no potential conflicts
of interest in the members I have selected.




a

As stated above, I feel all of the candidates provided are excellent; thus, I will not address any
questions that relate to why I did not select a particular individual. Instead, I would recommend to
any person that wishes to offer someone else to consider, who they would remove from the list I
have put forth.

Before I give you the names recommend, I call upon the Cook County Board of Commissioners to
improve the ordinance drafted on the night of the budget meeting because such language fails to
address critical issues such as Procurement, how Human Resources will function as it relates to this
new board and the County, what occurs when there is a vacancy on the board or whether the
Inspector General will have jurisdiction over the new board.

Provided for below are my recommendations that I will offer to the Board of Commissioners for their
approval: .
