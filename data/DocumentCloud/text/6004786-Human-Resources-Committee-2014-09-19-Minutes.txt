Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, presented her report, which included information on the following
subjects: Comparison of Vacancies Filled - FY2013-FY2014; FY2014 Posting Activity; FY2014 Vacancies and
Separations; 2014 Vacancies; CCHHS HR Initiatives; Leadership Development Program; and CCHHS Labor
Relations. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Ms. Lopez noted that some of the data on slide 2 was incorrect (Attachment #1 contains the revised, corrected
information).
Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the go-live date for the payroll data function; he noted that it is
always good to go into a new fiscal year with this kind of information. He was unsure whether it was possible or
not, but he expressed the hope to see the new data up and running by December 1. Ms. Lopez stated that she was
informed by the System Chief Financial Officer, John Cookinham, that staff is working on that; they hope to start
having some reports as early as today. She added that she will return to the Committee with a date of when it will
be fully implemented1.
Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the criteria to enter the Leadership Development Program (LDP).
Ms. Lopez stated that, currently, this program is for people who are currently in management positions; she noted
that the administration is working on a program for those who want to be managers and for front-line workers.
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided additional information on the subject. He stated that
building an infrastructure for expectations for uniform education of management across the board is something
that is needed to be developed. The LDP is establishing a beachhead for investing in CCHHS leadership staff, but
the development of an ongoing curriculum of learning for these types of management is going to be important.

Action Items
A. Minutes of the Human Resources Committee Meeting of August 15, 2014
Chairman Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to accept the minutes of the
meeting of the Human Resources Committee of August 15, 2014. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. **Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement (Attachment #2)
i. Local 399, Operating Engineers – Prevailing Wage Rates
Action was taken on this item following the adjournment of the closed meeting.
Chairman Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to approve the proposed
Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding Prevailing Wage Rates for Operating
Engineers with Local 399. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Any items listed under Sections IV and V

D. Proposed Amendment to Exhibit 1 of the CCHHS Severance Policy (Attachment #3)
Ms. Lopez provided an overview of the item presented for the Committee’s consideration.
Director Carvalho inquired whether every position on Exhibit 1 is considered to be hired “at will” and can be
terminated without good cause. Elizabeth Reidy, System General Counsel, responded in the negative. She
stated that when the System Board was established, they introduced Personnel Rules, which were adopted by
the Board in July of 2010. Based on those Rules, for those individuals who were employed by the System prior
to July of 2010, they would maintain career service, which means they could be eliminated for cause or if the
position itself were eliminated. While this is a list of positions, some of those positions, because the person in it
happened to be hired before July 2010, they would have career service. Director Carvalho clarified that, if a
person’s title is listed on Exhibit 1 and they are career service, this does not really apply to that person.
Chairman Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to approve the proposed
Amendments to Exhibit 1 of the CCHHS Severance Policy. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

 PROPOSED AMENDMENT – 10/03/14

SEVERANCE POLICY
This Severance Policy was established by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
(CCHHS) to provide a severance payment to eligible key executive employees in order to
facilitate the recruitment and retention of qualified, experienced individuals for critical
leadership positions. This Severance Policy will apply to Eligible Employees whose
employment with CCHHS is involuntarily terminated for a reason other than for Good
Cause.
Policy at a Glance
Eligible Employees will receive an amount of money equivalent to three (3) months of
their base salary to be paid in a single payment upon termination of employment in
consideration of their agreement to release the County, its Health System and their
Commissioners, Directors, agents and employees from any and all liability with respect
to the termination of their employment. Such agreement must be in writing in a form
acceptable to the System Director of Human Resources.
The severance payment is not considered salary and payment will not include
withholding for employee benefits. Eligible Employees will be entitled to the benefits to
which any other employee exiting County/System employment is entitled.
Definition
“Good Cause” as it applies to the determination of the System to terminate the
employment of an Eligible Employee shall mean any one of the following: (A) willful,
material, or irreparable breach of the employee’s breach of his/her duties or
responsibilities in the course of his/her employment; (B) the Eligible Employee’s gross
negligence in the performance or non-performance of his/her duties or responsibilities;
(C) the Eligible Employee’s willful dishonesty, fraud, or misconduct with respect to the
business affairs of the System, which materially and adversely affect the operations or
reputation of the System; (D) the Eligible Employee’s indictment for, conviction of, or
guilty plea to a felony crime involving violence, dishonesty or moral turpitude whether or
not relating to the System; or (E) a confirmed positive illegal drug test result.
“Eligible Employee” shall mean the employee in one of the positions identified in the
Scope section of this Severance Policy as being covered by the Policy; provided however,
that an individual in the position on an interim basis shall not be an eligible employee.
Scope
This Policy covers the Chief Executive Officer and certain all System leadership; all
Affiliate Chief Operating Officers and certain direct reports of the COO’s as identified in
attached Exhibit 1 to this Severance Policy, who are regular, full-time employees.

Page 23 of 26

 PROPOSED AMENDMENT – 10/03/14
To the extent an Eligible Employee has an agreement with the System with regard to a
severance payment that agreement will control.
No Conferral of Benefits
With the exception of this single severance payment, this Severance Policy does not
confer upon Eligible Employees any status or benefit other than that which they already
have by virtue of their employment. This Severance Policy does not change the Eligible
Employee’s status as an employee at will exempt from career service status. The
determination that the termination of employment of an Eligible Employee was for good
cause may not be the subject of a grievance under the System’s Personnel Rules.
