requesting authorization to renew a grant in the amount of $120,000.00 from the Illinois C riminal Justice
Information Authority for the Youth Gun Violence Program. This program serves juveniles who have
been charged with first and second-time nonviolent firearm offenses with the goal of preventing future
g un violence. The program is a partnership between the State's Attorney's Office, the Cook County
Circuit Court's Juvenile Probation Department and Schwab Rehabilitation and Care Network. This

Network functions as the service provider and facilitates program elements. This g rant requires a match
commitment of one dollar for each three dollars of federal funding. The match amount funds the fringe
benefits and a portion of the salary for the State's Attorney's weapons data special ist.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $40,224.00. Grant Award: $ 120,000.00. Funding period: October I , 200 I
