STAFF REPORT: 11-13-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6470
ADDRESS: 444 LODGE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BERRY SUBDIVISION
APPLICANT: WILLIAM LUCHI
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 10/30/2019
DATE OF STAFF SITE VISIT: 10/29/2019

PREPARED BY: A. DYE

SCOPE: ERECT NEW GARAGE, NEW CONCRETE DRIVEWAY, NEW REAR YARD PATIO,
BUSH/TREE REMOVAL, COAL CHUTE REMOVAL
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The house at 444 Lodge is a two-story Tudor Revival design constructed in 1922. The asymmetrical front
elevation is faced with a variegated Flemish brick pattern; tall, narrow windows in multiple groupings, an
array of brick patterns displayed within the centrally placed half-timbering, and a steeply pitched roof,
punctuated by a large cross gable and three small shed dormers.
At the time of the current owner’s purchase of the property, there was no garage on site, only the concrete
slab and floor drain remained. Per staff’s review of the HDC property file, a copy of BSEED’s 1991
inspection of the then-existing (and likely original) garage was completed. As it was deemed dilapidated,
dangerous, and in near state of collapse, the Building Department had it demolished in 1991. Photos of the
garage prior to demolition, along with BSEED’s demolition letter, is attached to this staff report.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval for the following work
items:
Erection of a Two Car Garage + Extension
• The new detached two-car garage to be located in the northeast corner of the lot, where an
existing slab and driveway indicated a garage formerly existed and demolished prior to the
current owner purchasing the property. Brush located along the fenceline around the garage
location will be removed.
• The new garage draws inspiration from the historic Tudor Revival architecture of the house,
matching the brick color, trim and lintel details, and window style. The gable return and lintels

 will be cut on an angle to match the existing detailing. The facade around the covered entryway
utilizes a false-half timbering and basketweave brick pattern to allude to the detail of the
existing house's brickwork.
• The roof of the new garage is pitched at 12:12 to complement the existing house's 16:12 roof
pitch, while trying to keep the garage to a reasonable height. In a nod to the massing and
alignment of the central second story window on the primary gable on the front facade, the
painted wooden lintels of the garage door, windows, and doors all line up with the gable return
trim.
• Detroit city zoning regulations mandate a maximum height of 15'-0" for an accessory structure
in R1 zones. The 12:12 pitch on the new garage results in an overall height of 19'-11 1/2".
Following HDC approval, the project will seek a zoning variance for the increase in building
height.
• The footprint of the building will extend to the south for the allowance of an extra room. A single
door on the west elevation and French doors on the south elevation will offer access to this space.
New Concrete Driveway
• The existing slab and driveway, in bad repair, will be demolished to prepare for a new slab and
driveway. The existing curb cut will be used, but the width of the curb cut and driveway near the
street will be widened so that it is a consistent width to the single garage door opening.
• In order to do this, an at-grade coal chute adjacent the house will be removed, the hole filled and
prepped for the new driveway surface.
Concrete Patio
• Extending from the French doors on the south elevation, a concrete patio (12’0” deep x 23’5 ½”
wide) will be poured, and will extend around the west elevation to offer a walking surface to the
single door.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The new garage is consistent with the historic character of the property, in both placement and
design.
• The existing driveway is not constructed of a historic material and the additional driveway width
will not require the removal of character-defining features of the house. The lot size and width of
the house are extensive, so the increased width of the driveway is proportionate to the property.
ISSUES
• None
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work as proposed will not result in the removal of historic materials or the
alteration of features and spaces that characterize the property. The work is also compatible with the
property’s historic character. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the work as proposed because it meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards for
Rehabilitation, Standards:
#2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials
or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
#9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible

 with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and
its environment.

 (1)

Height. Buildings must be two (2) stories plus roof; the walls must not be less than eighteen (18) feet in
height.

(2)

Proportion of building’s front facade. Including the roof area in the front elevation, existing examples
have between a 1:1 and 1:2 height to width ratio. Buildings which are narrower than tall, or emphatically
wider than tall, are not acceptable.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the facade. Areas of void generally constitute between fifteen (15) per cent
and thirty-five (35) per cent of the total facade area, excluding the roof. Proportions of openings
themselves are generally taller than wide; in some cases, vertically proportioned openings are combined to
fill total opening wider than tall.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facade. In buildings derived from classical precedents (notably
neo-Georgian substyles) voids are arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the area of
the facade. In examples of other styles (especially those of medieval inspiration, such as neo-Tudor) voids
are arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. Generally, individual buildings occupy one subdivision lot.
No part of any building shall be closer to the side line of the property than ten (10) feet; where a building
occupies more than one subdivision lot, it should have normal spacing (ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet) from
one side of the property. Many houses have two (2) building lots, the house placed on one, and the other
used for landscaping and recreational purposes.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In the neo-Georgian examples, entrances and porches, if
any, are centered on the facade virtually without exception. More freedom exists in other examples; if not
centered, the entrance and/or porch is generally part of a balanced composition.

(7)

Relationship of materials. Wall materials, almost without exception, are brick, stone, and concrete
(stucco). Stone trim is common; wood is almost universally used for window frames and other functional
trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Roofs of slate, tile, asphalt shingle, or wood shingle (not
shake). Where roofs of other than asphalt exist, their maintenance should be encouraged.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of the low-relief
pattern of mortar joints in the brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. The use of stucco or

concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces is not unusual. The district contains a fair number of
buildings in which a tile roof contributes a strong textural contrast to the composition. Slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which
purport to imitate some other variety.
(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown) predominate in wall surfaces. Natural stone colors are also

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian buildings display
classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Areas commonly, but not always, treated are
porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows. Details on the "Mediterranean" style
buildings are more often done in stone or brick, and sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows,

acceptable. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is either left in its natural state, or painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in
natural colors (red tile, slate colors, natural wood) and asphalt shingles should be kept within this range. Paint colors often
relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, notably neo-Georgian, generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in
the range of those colors, including "putty." Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been
in use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries on similar buildings may be considered for
suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably neo-Tudor) generally have painted woodwork and window frames of
dark brown or cream color. Half-timbering is virtually always stained dark brown. Original colors on houses built before 1942,
as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable.

 door openings, and porches, usually with a somewhat vertical emphasis. Neo-Tudor buildings tend to have
simple details in the form of windows, door frames, and eaves of wood. Carved wood or carved stone
ornament is occasionally seen. Stone window sills are common in all styles.
(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. Pitched and hip roofs predominate. One or two (2) examples of the gambrel
type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the pitched or hip types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual.
Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist only on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements.

(12)

Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is that formed by the houses themselves. New buildings
should contribute to that wall of continuity.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. One feature of the district is the
vacant land, which creates a feeling of openness in the district. Side lots, landscaped and used by
adjoining households, are the most important expression of the vacant land. Individual properties have
front lawns, often subdivided by walks leading to the entrance, and foundation plantings. More elaborate
schemes are uncharacteristic. Paved side drives leading to rear garages are common, as are paved areas in
front of such garages. Many large trees have fallen to Dutch Elm disease; important trees should be
replaced so as to maintain the number of trees over a period of years. Landscaped side lots should be
fenced or hedged at the setback line, so as to contribute to the wall of continuity formed by the houses.
Fences of those types prevalent prior to 1942 should be encouraged.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. The area contains a large quantity of vacant land, which causes a
very low density in the area. Except for the public park on the river, the vacant land is largely due to a lack
of building activity. Other open space exists in the form of "side lots."

(15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. The scale of the facades-and the houses-ranges from medium to
very large. The simplicity of the classical elements in the neo-Georgian buildings tends to emphasize their
scale, while the greater complexity of the more medieval facades and elements tends to bring down the
scale. Major wings at the front or side are untypical; side appendages are limited to small sunrooms and
porches, set back from the front.

(16)

Directional expression of front facades.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Buildings must be set back twenty-four (24) feet from the street, and no
porch or veranda may protrude to within less than fifteen (15) feet of the street line. Buildings on the river
frontage have a greater setback. In any event, existing setbacks must be maintained.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverage. On the assumption that buildings will occupy single subdivision lots, with
normal side and front yard setbacks, and assuming that no building is unduly deep, lot coverage will be
appropriate. This generally ranges between ten (10) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent of the total lot
surface, excluding garages. Along the river, coverage is in the area of seven and five-tenths (7.5) per cent,
the lots being much larger in relationship to the houses.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the facades. The neo-Georgian and the newer buildings generally have very
simple, rectangular facades. Neo-Tudor buildings have more complex facade arrangements.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Homes in the area face their front yards, even though they may have large
side lots. Garages are generally in the rear, facing the front of the lot. The open space provides long
vistas of some of the buildings.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired buildings are
generally symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally asymmetrical, but balanced
compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. Environmental character is created by the relationship to the river and

In general, the expression of direction is neutral.

 the Stanton Canal, the open quality created by the vacant land, and the seclusion of this residential area
amongst high-rise apartments and various commercial and light industrial uses.
