Report of the Board President:
President Shlonsky wished everyone a happy new year. She commented she is amazed at what the
library has accomplished in 2018. The library is truly unique, and it has something to offer everyone in the
community at every stage of life. She commented there is no other institution in our community that is
holistic in its approach to improve and advance lives. She thanked the Board of Trustees, Executive
Director Feldman and staff for everything you have done, and she is excited about 2019.
Report of the Executive Director:
Executive Director Feldman thanked President Shlonsky for her kind words. She mentioned CCPL’s staff
development day is scheduled in May and extended the invitation to the Board members.
Executive Director Feldman wished everyone a happy new year. She congratulated the officers for
another term.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned we received a resolution from State Senator Sandra Williams,
congratulating us on being named once again a “five star” system by Library Journal.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned the Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN) will be
upgrading our current 1-gigabit connection that goes from here to Columbus to a 2-gigabit connection.
Only the largest library systems in the State of Ohio will get this upgrade and it will allow us to continue to
offer all of the digital connection that we need for our services.
Executive Director Feldman acknowledged Director Jankowski has been appointed to the Cuyahoga
County Public Workforce Board and she will represent CCPL.
Executive Director Feldman mentioned we will be giving the KeyBank grant to our second entrepreneur
tomorrow and our Media Services Department created a video of this year’s recipient Candence Caprice
a fashion designer. Last year the entrepreneurship award of $5,000 went to Jackie Achadu, Owner,
Hunny Bunny’s Confections. The video was shown.
Executive Director Feldman commented it is always good to recognize the outcomes of the programs that
we do. We are very fortunate to have supporters like KeyBank to help us offer these programs in the
community and how responsive our community is to utilize the programs we offer.
Executive Director Feldman stated Deputy Director Strobel will present on how CCPL is deepening our
engagement with customers. Looking at the data we are seeing the overall customer visits changing and
Deputy Director Strobel will put that in perspective for the Board.

Deputy Director Strobel thanked the Board for the opportunity to present the trends we see in library visits
at CCPL and library systems across the nation. She stated there are three primary customers visit drivers:
1) to borrow materials; 2) to attend programs; and 3) to use our technology.
1.

We have seen significant changes in borrowing materials over the past few years. The growth in
digital circulation is up over 12% from 2017 and 153% since 2014. Other streaming resources like
Hoopla for music and Kanopy for movies have also seen double digit growth. There is a
decrease in circulation of physical materials by 10%. The growth in digital content circulation has
affected they physical circulation and with the convenience of online streaming and downloads,
customers do not have to visit a branch to access material from our collection. We surveyed
customers in 2016 and 12% said “picking up materials” was the reason they visited the library,
this was down from 30% in 2012. The number of holds dropped 29% in the last five years. This
means there are fewer customers coming into the branch to pick up items, therefore fewer
customer visits.

2. We made a shift in the goals and types of programs we offer which has affected overall branch
visit statistics. Three years ago, we asked CCPL branches and our Literacy and Learning
Division department to prioritize impact over output. Our library programs emphasize learning
and growth. This important shift to programmatic impact means that we have fewer seats in a
class, which affects customer visits.
3. In our 2016 survey data users said they come less to the library because of the increased access
to technology. Over the past five years, we have seen a 24% drop in public computer usage.
While some of that is counterbalanced by tremendous growth in Wi-Fi use in the branches, better
access to technology at home and work means that some customers are less likely to visit the
library.
Deputy Director Strobel mentioned besides the three primary drivers for a decline in customer visit there
are two others that have an impact: 1) door counters; and 2) population.
1. Door counters across CCPL system were replaced in February of last year. Prior to that, we had
a variety of different types of counters which all required human intervention in the recording of
door counter statistics. Door counters count people coming and people leaving. The old
counters required staff to check the counters daily, divide the count in two and then manually
enter that number into an online form. The new counters automatically divide the number and
submit it to a central database.
The new door counters have given us some excellent insights. A spot check of visit statistics in
three of our branches shows positive trends. On school days from 3pm to 4pm the North
Olmsted Branch welcomes on average 300 people, most are students from the new school
across the street. On school days in Warrensville Heights Branch, an average 525 visitors come
through our doors between 3pm and 8pm. And it’s rare for the Parma-Snow Branch to see less
than 100 visitors before 10am.
2. According to the US Census, Cuyahoga County experienced the third largest population dip in
the country between 2016 and 2017. Only six of our forty-seven communities have experienced
any growth in population since 2010.
At the national level, we’re following a relatively standard trend in customer visits. While broad
2018 data is not yet available, we reached out to a close peer library Multnomah County in
Portland, Oregon. In 2018 they had 3.7 million visits (in a population of 800,000 compared to our
609,000), which was a decline of 14% over 2017.

Deputy Director Strobel stated the investments we’ve made in our buildings are responsive to the shifts in
customer behavior that we’re seeing today, and our spaces are designed to accommodate the macrotrends that successful businesses have identified such as:




Remote working
Experience-based programs and services
Growing social capital and reducing isolation

Deputy Director Strobel stated customer visits will be a primary focus for CCPL in 2019. The goals of our
public education campaign this year are tied to growth in visits. Our programming strategy will center on
bringing customers into the branches for engaging and meaningful experiences. And finally, our new
Engage Every Customer initiative emphasizes creating relationships and building community so that
every customer becomes a frequent visitor.
Report of the CCPL Foundation Board Liaison
Director Rich stated in Trustee Blakemore’s absence she does not have a report this month.
Human Resources Report:
Human Resources Director Sample referred the Board to the report provided.
04-01/2019
Trustee DePiero moved approval, seconded by Trustee Spangler. Seeing no discussion, the Human
Resources Report dated January 22, 2019, was approved as presented by unanimous vote of the Board
members present. (See pages 15-20)
Finance Committee Report:
Finance Committee Chair Leonard reminded us that the Finance Committee met prior to the Board
meeting, and Director Morgan gave an in-depth review of the financials.
Director Morgan gave highlights from the Finance report. He stated in general property taxes we
exceeded our original budget by $707,869.90. The final amount received was $42,752,869.90.
Director Morgan stated in the Public Library Fund (PLF) the final amount received was $20,769,026.45
and this exceeded our original budget by $781,590.41. This amount and the overage amount in general
property taxes will be carried into 2019 to fund several large projects in facilities.
Director Morgan stated patron fines and fees exceeded our original budget. The amount received was
$1,356,592.28. This amount exceeded our original budget by $6,592.28. Our fines and fees revenue
were down from last year, but the increase in passport fees helped to cover the decline in fines and fees.
Director Morgan stated the percentage increase for interest rates exceeded our original budget due to
rising interest rates throughout 2018.
Director Morgan stated our sales of resale supplies of bus passes and stamps did very well. The original
budget was exceeded by $17,791.94 for those accounts.
Director Morgan stated in general expenditures, salaries and benefits, supplies, library materials and
capital all came in under the original budget for the year.
Director Morgan stated that for purchased and contracted services, we had to transfer additional dollars
to the original budget to close out the year.

Director Morgan stated they closed out all the standing orders and blanket purchase orders. The closing
of those purchase orders along with the increases in general property taxes and PLF gave us a carryover
of $1,851,996.98 for 2019 general fund. Those dollars are earmarked for some expensive capital
projects and those dollars will be taken out of the general fund and we will not need to use the capital
fund. Most of those dollars will be used for the Maple Heights Branch project to completely replace the
HVAC system. The estimated cost is $1.5 million. All of this will be illustrated in the permanent budget in
February. (See under FINANCE)
Investments - December
Director Morgan stated we reinvested the proceeds from a CD that matured at TriState Bank with another
CDARS for six months with a purchase yield of 1.59%. We kept the maturity short should there be a rise
in interest rates we can take advantage. There were no other investments for the month.
Director Morgan stated there were three transfers. We needed to make three advances to the special
revenue funds. Those advances will be paid back in 2019.
Project Build
Hotspot Lending

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Let’s Make 2019 the Year of the Book
Even as the digital age has progressed, changing the way many people access
information, surveys show that books and literacy remain closely associated with
the library brand, and that reading services remain a major source of support and
advocacy for libraries, as well as for the American Library Association (ALA). But
as libraries continue to expand and transform in response to evolving community
needs, I sometimes question whether the ALA is losing sight of just how central books
and reading are to the work of libraries.
ALA must envision a more wide-reaching, visible national platform for our members’
invaluable work promoting great books. The Notable Books lists have long been
a resource for my own reading choices, and earlier in my career I relied on them
for readers’ advisory. Today, it feels like public libraries are increasingly focused
on current best-sellers. And, as I have frequently bemoaned, readers’ advisory is
becoming a lost art.
Yes, there is still a RUSA CODES: Readers’ Advisory Research and Trends Committee.
But when I visit ALA Connect, I can ﬁnd no discussion posts or shared ﬁles among the
members, nor even a scheduled meeting at the upcoming ALA Midwinter conference.
It troubles me that the Notable Books lists and the work of the ALA’s readers’ advisory
committee are buried in a section within an ALA division.
When I see recent trends indicating a national resurgence of independent bookstores,
I am thrilled to think of new homes for readers. But I also fear that libraries will lose
ground if we don’t compete better for readers’ attention. So I am calling on ALA to
explore ways to better support our book-related services, and to ensure that the next
generation of readers’ advisors will have a home in libraries.
When ALA introduced its successful Libraries Transform campaign in 2015, it was
meant to build on our foundational principles. What’s more foundational to libraries
than books? If we envision 2019 as the year of the book, imagine the transformation
we might lead.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE
A Parma Heights customer called branch manager Nick Cronin to compliment Patricia HehirBrewer for her assistance on Monday. She said that Patricia had gone above and beyond in
helping her with an application for an out of state birth certiﬁcate. The customer said that she has
almost no computer skills, but that Patricia had set her up with a guest pass and very patiently
helped her navigate online while remaining very sensitive to the personal information she was
required to enter. She summarized by saying that Patricia made a frustrating task much easier and
that she was greatly appreciative of the time she spent with her. Finally, she commented that she
often comes in to fax and copy and that everyone on the PAH staff has been really helpful any time
she has questions or needs assistance.

Recently, customer Peggy Ferguson called the Brecksville Branch to express her gratitude for the
assistance she received in completing her online HEAP application. While reviewing the paper
application, she noted that mail-in applications can take 12 – 16 weeks to process. She called the
library to ask if she could receive assistance with the online application. After a lengthy phone
conversation, she was assured that any of the ﬂoor staff could help her navigate the website
and/or help her scan and upload required documents. When Peggy came in to the branch,
Lynne White was able to help her create an email account, register a new account with the Ohio
Development Services Agency, scan necessary documents separately, upload documents and help
Peggy navigate the application without entering personal data. When Peggy was ﬁnished and
ready to leave, she expressed gratitude to Lynne White with a big hug and told Lynne that she
would never have been able to complete the online application without Lynne’s help.

On Monday evenings in January, the Berea Branch held a three-part Spanish class taught by Professor Alia
Almashni. The class was enthusiastically attended, with a combined attendance of 85, and very well received.
Many customers asked the library staff to hold another session so they can continue learning.

Financial Statement Analysis
January 2019

Revenues
We received our first distribution from the County for our General Property Taxes. This
is a smaller distribution which is typical for January. We should see a much larger
distribution in February for our first large advance.
Our first distribution for the PLF was smaller than anticipated. As we do every month,
we will monitor this account closely. Last year we started out the year with smaller
distributions than expected and then as the year progressed, our distributions were as
expected and also the difference to make up for some of the smaller distributions.
Patron Fines and Fees shows a large increase over last year for the same month.
Once again as we saw last year Passport Fees was the largest increase. The month of
January was the most revenue we have collected in one month since the
implementation of the program in May of 2010. We also collected a large amount in
interest for the General Fund.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month.

Expenses
All expenditures for Salaries and Benefits were spent under budget with the exception
of Insurance Benefits. In the month of January we fund all of our Health Saving
Accounts for employees with half of their deductible for the year. With this funding, the
percentage spent for the month was over. We anticipate that expense so the budget is
created with this amount and the percentage will return to the expected level in the next
couple of months.
Many of the other accounts have been encumbered for our standing orders so the
percentage of expensed and encumbered looks higher than would be expected for the
month. Again we create the budget with these standing orders as part of those
numbers.
All other expense account are where we would expect them be for the month.

Investments
We purchased one piece of commercial paper in the month of January. It was from
Natixis NY and had a yield of 2.82%.
Transfers
We made two transfers for the month, both from the General Fund to Kindergarten
Clubs for a total of $5,080.83.
