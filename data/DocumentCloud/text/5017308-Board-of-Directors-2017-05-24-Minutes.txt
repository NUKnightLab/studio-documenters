OTHER MATTERS

COMMENT

Mr. Lewand calied for public comment and stated that two minutes would be given.
Mr. John Lauve of Hoily, Michigan stated the following:

?Tomorrow we are having a public hearing by the City Councii on the Plan for this project.
Planning is something that is done in advance of the project, but you guys have taken care
of it because you have watched very diligently and seen that you don?t have to follow the
rules. That also has to be mailed out to every taxpayer the notice.

Apparently, the Arena deal, this property was said to llitich. This property for the Wayne
State deal was sold to llitich, and now you are going to give him this other piece of property
over here. Here is the layout of what has taken place.

They came up with this cataiyst deai. Notice how they came along here, they came around
and swooped around this piece of property right next to the bait park and continued all
around. This whole thing was constructed for one purpose and that was to help out llitch.
He's gotten enough and now he wants $100 miilion more because he deserves it.

He promised to fix these buiidings up when he put the stadium in and then he used it as a
temptation to justify this. And here is our favorite right here. That project is in the catalyst
project and instead we are going to build a new Fox headquarters instead of fixing up these
buildings. Here?s two buildings that he owns. This is from the Arena site on Cass. He
owns that Hotel next to the Masonic Temple. if we took the money and made the Masonic
Tempie a project, then we could fix up that neighborhood instead of a garage and these
iittle headquarters.

Here is another set of buildings that he owns right across the street. Notice the windows
are air windows. 80 we are not fixing up properties that need to be fixed up. We are being
irresponsibie by just rubber stamping his new headquarters. And that is corruption?that
is what it is."

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Lauve that his time was up and thanked him for his comments.

ADJOURNMENT

With there being no other business to be brought before the Board, Mr. Lewand adjourned the
meeting at 3:35 pm.
