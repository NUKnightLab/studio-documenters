Directors.
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, presented the requests for the Committee’s
review and discussion.
Anna Ashcraft, Director of the Cook County Real Estate Management Division, provided additional
information regarding request number 1. Chairman Carvalho inquired regarding whether some projects will be
placed on hold while this plan is being developed and completed. Ms. Ashcraft responded in the negative; she
added that projects that appear to be non-essential will be slowed down while the plan is developed. With
regard to the question of re-use of the old Cook County Hospital Building, Ms. Ashcraft stated that the plan
will be to look at the ability to re-use that building, as had been previously recommended, and still have
adequate property on the campus to accommodate the needs for Fantus Clinic and parking.
Dr. Terry Mason, System Chief Medical Officer, inquired regarding the entities that will be working on this
project with U.S. Equities. Ms. Ashcraft responded that the team is comprised of approximately seventy-five
to one hundred individuals; she added that there are numerous companies that are involved in the project.
Board Chairman Batts requested additional information regarding request number 4; this is a request to extend,
amend and increase the contract with Health Management Associates (HMA). Dr. Ram Raju, Chief Executive
Officer, responded that HMA has been working with the System for many years; Matt Powers, of HMA, has
been instrumental in assisting the System with the Section 1115 waiver application activities. Dr. Raju stated
that HMA will be assisting the System to implement and operationalize the medical home structure.
The Committee received a brief update regarding the recruitment for the position for which services are being
contractually provided under request number 3. John Cookinham, System Interim Chief Financial Officer,

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Notification of Emergency Purchases
Ms. Besenhofer informed the Committee that an emergency purchase has been made for the purchase of two
portable ultrasound units for the Emergency Department at Stroger Hospital. She stated that formal notification
of this purchase will be sent out after this meeting.

B. Financial Reports through February 2012 (Attachment #2)
This item will be presented for consideration and acceptance at the May 24, 2012 Meeting of the Finance
Committee.
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Financial Reports through February 2012. The
Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the Committee’s discussion of the drop-off in revenues, Chairman Carvalho noted that, last year, when
the System’s revenues were lower than expected, the cause was partly attributed to the delayed budget process;
under the FY2011 budget process, revenue and expense projections were made in July but the budget was not
finalized and approved until February, which is three months into the fiscal year. For FY2012, Chairman
Carvalho stated that the budget process was not delayed; it was considered and approved according to plan. As
there was no delay in the budget process, he inquired as to any other factors that may be contributing to the
System’s revenue shortfalls for 2012. He noted that the budget was approved in November 2011, and the
System’s revenue projections were off-target by December 2011, which is the first month of the fiscal year; he
asked how the actual revenues could deviate from the System’s revenue projections within that short period of
time.
Mr. Cookinham responded that management continues to try to accelerate the processing of applications
payments to the System; he noted that there has been progress, but issues remain. Dr. Raju provided an
example relating to delays in Medicaid claims processing. He stated that when the retroactive rate adjustment
took place, claims that were being processed were rejected, because they were based on the old rate; he added
that, while the higher rate will be beneficial to the System, the rejected claims will now have to be resubmitted, which will take additional time.
Dr. Raju also summarized the System’s strategy for budgeting in the face of uncertainty regarding revenues.
To budget based upon a very conservative, low-end forecast of revenues would require significant reductions
in staff and services, doing irrevocable damage to the System and its clients. Instead, the System adopts a
reasonable but aggressive target for revenues, and then works to achieve those revenues, or come as close as
possible under the circumstances.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (Attachment #3)

regarding the plan, a list of proposed spending reductions, and a fact sheet regarding the subject (Attachment #4).

V.

Report from Chief Financial Officer (continued)
Mr. Cookinham provided an overview of the information included in his report. The Committee reviewed and
discussed the information.
Dr. Raju provided an update on the subject of pending Medicaid applications for System patients that are awaiting
processing at the State. He stated that there were 14,000 pending Medicaid applications at the State at the
beginning of the year; currently, there are 7,000 pending Medicaid applications, out of which 4,000 are in the
appeals process. Once those have cleared the appeal process, the System should be down to 3,000 pending
applications; he added that the System is approaching the normal, steady level of pending applications, which is
2,000.
During the presentation of Mr. Cookinham’s report, Dr. Raju provided information on the total amount of charity
care provided annually by the System. He stated that approximately $300 million in charity care is provided each
year, up-front; the additional amount for those services for which the System will not receive payment increases
the total annual amount to $500 million dollars in charity care provided by this organization. Dr. Raju pointed out
that this amounts to at least half of the System’s annual budget.

VI. Adjourn
As the agenda was exhausted, Chairman Carvalho declared the meeting ADJOURNED.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities and financial activities for the month ended February 29, 2012.
This discussion focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities
during the current month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide primary,
intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to
pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy
activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2010 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board and the Cook County Board
of Commissioners approved Vision 2015 Strategic Plan, which outlines, over five years,
restructuring CCHHS to deliver the best possible care for the vulnerable population of
Cook County within the constraints of dollar resources available to the health system.
This plan seeks to better allocate resources.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the three months with overall
revenue of $247,238 and overall expenses was $220,739.
Net Patient revenue for the three months was $174,948.
5
Page 31 of 85

 Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $1,027. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.

Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
General
As compared to November 30, 2011, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
February-2012 increased by 23 days of revenue (or 14.9%). There were 154 days of
revenue (charges) outstanding at November 30, 2011 and 177 days outstanding at the end
of February-2012. The increase in this figure is due in part to the fact that the internal
bill hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced from 20 days to 6 days and in part to the
fact that billed accounts grew by $85.411M (24.1%).
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Providing the collection agencies the necessary time to perform their collection
services; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Inpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of February-2012 decreased
by $10.890M (51.4%) as compared the November 30, 2011 balance. This amount is also
less than the previous month’s balance by $2.509M (19.6%). These items taken together
indicate an increasing number of accounts are moving to a “Billed” status.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS on the
diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and
bad debt write-offs will not result in actual cash collections.
6
Page 32 of 85

 Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of February-2012 increased by $53.761M (or 27.9%).
This amount exceeds the previous month’s balance by $19.992M (8.8%). This increase
also increased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding.
The increase in this number indicates more accounts are waiting for the collection
process to conclude. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity care and bad debt
write-offs. $10.890M of this increase was due to the decrease in Discharged Not Final
Billed. This increase also increased CCHHS’ days in revenue outstanding.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays on a per-diem and Medicare pays on the diagnosis, regardless of charges
on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity care and bad debt write-offs will not result
in actual cash collections.
$3.018M In-Patient accounts were written-off to charity care during February-2012,
bringing the fiscal year’s total to $8.249M.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System Only
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $0.674M (3.0%) by the end of
February-2012, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2011.
The change in this figure indicates more patient bills were moved to a “Billed” status, as
compared to November 30, 2011. Part of the increase in this figure is due the reduction
of the internal bill hold from 20 days to 6 days.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of February-2012 rose by $31.650M
(19.6%) over the balance as of November 30, 2011. This figure is also greater than the
previous month’s balance by $13.692M (7.6%).
The growth in this figure indicates a greater number of Out-Patient accounts were moved
to a “Billed” status and a reduced number of Out-Patient accounts had collection and
write-off related activities completed as compared to November 30, 2011. Part of this
increase is due to the fact that the internal bill hold on Out-Patient accounts was reduced
to 6 days.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

 $15.086M Out-Patient accounts were written-off to charity care during February-2012,
bringing the fiscal year’s total to $42.890M.

Operating Expenses at the end of three months was $220.739M broken down as follows:
Salaries and Wages - $121.891M
Benefits - $35.618M
Supplies - $19.656M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $24.579M
Depreciation - $8.361M
Utilities - $992
Insurance - $9.643M
Nonoperating Revenue was $71.263M. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $33.593M and property tax in the amount of $20.021M.
Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the
underlying sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet
received from the state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales
transaction to the receipt of funds.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 19, 2012
Governor Quinn Announces Plan to Stabilize Illinois’ Medicaid System
Proposal Saves Medicaid System for Millions

SPRINGFIELD – April 19, 2012. Governor Pat Quinn today announced a plan to stabilize Illinois’
Medicaid system and prevent collapse of the program, one of his top priorities this session. The
Governor’s plan creates $2.7 billion in Medicaid savings – which includes more than $2 billion in
Medicaid reductions and federal matching funds from additional revenues on tobacco products.
Today’s proposal follows weeks of productive talks led by the governor’s office with a working group
comprised of members from all four legislative caucuses, as well as meetings with numerous provider
groups.
“We must act quickly to save the entire Medicaid system from collapse, and protect providers and the
millions of Illinois residents that depend upon Medicaid for their healthcare,” Governor Quinn said.
“This proposal will fundamentally restructure our Medicaid system, alleviate the pressures on the rest
of our budget, and ensure the program is sustainable for years to come.”
Medicaid provides healthcare to 2.7 million people in Illinois and coverage for half of all births. In his
February budget address, the Governor highlighted the urgent need for a $2.7 billion reduction in the
Medicaid program to prevent systemic collapse. At the end of the current fiscal year (FY 2012),
Illinois will have $1.9 billion in unpaid Medicaid bills. The Civic Federation projects $21 billion in
unpaid Medicaid bills by 2017 if Illinois’ Medicaid system is not fundamentally and immediately
restructured.
The Governor convened a working group – comprised of members from each of the four legislative
caucuses – to explore all options and develop a framework to save our Medicaid system. The working
group met with and incorporated suggestions from many provider groups, including: hospitals,
podiatrists, durable and disposable medical equipment companies, long-term care providers, dentists,
pharmacists, and hospice providers.
Governor Quinn’s proposal reduces Illinois’ Medicaid liability by $2.7 billion, with three-quarters of
the plan comprised of cuts, reductions and efficiencies, one-eighth in state revenue, and one-eighth in
federal matching funds:






Cuts, reductions and efficiencies to 58 separate items totaling $1.35 billion (50 percent)
Rate reduction to providers totaling $675 million – (25 percent)
Additional revenue through a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax totaling $337.5 million
(12.5 percent)
100 percent federal match funding from the increased cigarette tax totaling $337.5 million (12.5
percent)

“The status quo is not an option, and I want to thank the members of the working group, who have
worked diligently with us to find real solutions to this problem, “Julie Hamos, Department of
Healthcare and Family Services director, said. “What we are presenting today is a balanced approach
that targets fraud and abuse, continues our move to coordinated care for Medicaid clients, and takes
advantage of federal matching funds to make every dollar go further.”

The cuts, reductions and efficiencies across 58 separate items in the Governor’s proposal include:








Program integrity to prevent client and provider fraud
Elimination or reduced coverage of certain optional populations and services
Controls on use of Medicaid services to prevent over-use or waste
Adjustments to rates that are outdated or do not reflect budget realities
Expanded cost-sharing by clients
Redesigned healthcare delivery system through Coordinated Care
Complete implementation of all reforms in 2011 Medicaid reform law

To access more funds from the federal government, the Governor’s plan to limit Medicaid liability
includes a tobacco revenue increase. By including a tobacco revenue increase, which amounts to just
one-eighth ($337.5 million per year) of the $2.7B savings we must find in the Medicaid program, the
state will be eligible for an additional 100 percent in federal matching funds ($337.5 million per year).
In addition to the direct revenue, raising the cost of cigarettes by a dollar will improve the health of the
people of Illinois, reducing tobacco-related Medicaid and health care costs over the long-term.
According to the American Cancer Society, tobacco use cost Illinois $1.5 billion in Medicaid spending
last year. Increasing the cigarette tax by a dollar a pack will prevent more than 70,000 children from
becoming addicted adult smokers, decrease youth smoking by 11 percent and save more than 38,000
Illinois residents from premature, smoking-caused death.
"The American Cancer Society is pleased to see the Governor combining smart fiscal and public health
policy with this proposal,” said Katherine L. Griem, M.D., President of the American Cancer Society,
Illinois Division. “Smoking remains the leading cause of cancer and this proposal will not only reduce
the burden on the state’s Medicaid program for years to come, but more importantly, it will save lives
and improve the health of people across Illinois, particularly in curtailing youth smoking."

this population.
State-only program. Could move clients to
Cook County 1115 waiver, if approved by
GA and federal CMS.
State-only program. Other states dropped
coverage when Medicare D became

No pay for scheduled c-sections prior

Advocates for improving birth outcomes
have national campaign to reduce
incidence of scheduled (elective)
deliveries <39 weeks. Best outcomes are
achieved when babies are born at fullterm via normal vaginal delivery.
Adopt Medicare standard with patient

primary care physician) and surgery at a
Center of Excellence.
Determination of Need (DON) is tool used
for seniors and people with physical
disabilities applying for nursing facilities
and supportive living facilities (SLF - see

Changes policy based on Medicare rule.
Pharmacies typically dispense
maintenance medications to residents of
long-term-care settings in 30-day supplies,
but this leads to waste when a resident
dies, changes medications, is hospitalized,
or otherwise leaves the facility.

$150.0

Medicare Part D implemented a policy
effective 1/1/2012 requiring pharmacies
to dispense drugs in 7-day rather than 30day supplies for LTC residents, initially
limited to brand name drugs as a
transitional approach. HFS will implement
similar policy. Impacts approximately
1,000 clients.

Medicaid Stabilization – Fact Sheet




The Medicaid system is on the brink of collapse and the $2.7 billion hole in Medicaid must be addressed this
spring.
The Governor has a plan that addresses the entire $2.7 billion problem with three components: $2 billion (75
percent) reductions, a $1 per-pack cigarette tax and taking advantage of federal matching dollars.
Without solving the Medicaid crisis this spring, the program will devastate next year’s fiscal year’s budget (the
budget that will be passed in May), limiting our ability to fund critical state priorities, including education, public
safety and the capital construction program.

Background
Illinois’ Medicaid program is on the brink of collapse. The program, which provides health care to 2.7 million Illinois
residents in need, will end this current fiscal year (though June 30) with $1.9 billion in unpaid bills. Unless we take
action to fundamentally restructure Medicaid this session, the Civic Federation estimates $21 billion in unpaid Medicaid
bills by 2017.
Medicaid and pensions now account for 39 percent of state general revenue spending, putting a tremendous squeeze
on the rest of our budget and impacting Illinois’ ability to provide other essential services, such as education and public
safety.
We must save our Medicaid program in order to continue providing services that millions of Illinois residents depend
upon. The status quo is not an option. Every day without action to stabilize Medicaid only makes the problem worse
and will lead to additional service reductions.
How did we get here?




Program costs have risen 6 percent per year since 2008, due to significant enrollment growth from the recession
and Illinois’ reliance on a fee-for-service system;
The expiration of the federal stimulus; and
Last year’s deferral of $1.9 billion in Medicaid bills to future years.

Stabilizing the Medicaid System
2011’s Medicaid reforms, championed by Governor Quinn, are helping to tighten eligibility and move Illinois to a
managed, coordinated system of care. However, we must still reduce Medicaid expenditures in the program by $2.7
billion in the coming year to prevent the system from collapsing.
In his February budget address, the Governor called for $2.7 billion in savings to Medicaid liability this session. The
Governor convened a working group – comprised of members from each of the four legislative caucuses – to explore all
options and develop a framework to save our Medicaid system.
The working group met with and incorporated suggestions from many provider groups, including: hospitals, podiatrists,
durable and disposable medical equipment companies, long-term care providers, dentists, pharmacists, and hospice
providers.
Page 84 of 85

 OFFICE OF GOVERNOR PAT QUINN
The Governor has proposed a plan to stabilize Illinois’ Medicaid system by reducing Medicaid liability by $2.7 billion –
a plan comprised of three-quarters cuts, reductions and efficiencies.





Cuts, reductions and efficiencies to 58 separate items totaling $1.35 billion (50 percent)
Rate reductions to providers totaling $675 million (25 percent)
Additional revenue through a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax totaling $337.5 million (12.5 percent)
100 percent federal match funding from the increased cigarette tax totaling $337.5 million (12.5 percent)

The cuts, reductions and efficiencies across 58 separate items in the Governor’s proposal include:








Program integrity to prevent client and provider fraud
Elimination or reduced coverage of certain optional populations and services
Controls on use of Medicaid services to prevent over-use or waste
Adjustments to rates that are outdated or do not reflect budget realities
Expanded cost-sharing by clients
Redesigned healthcare delivery system through Coordinated Care
Complete implementation of all reforms in 2011 Medicaid reform law

Limiting Medicaid liability through revenues raised by increasing the cigarette tax is a crucial component of the
Governor’s plan because it is good fiscal and public policy:







According to the American Cancer Society, tobacco use cost Illinois $1.5 billion last year in Medicaid spending.
The revenue raised by the federal match accounts for a full one-eighth ($337.5 million per year) of the savings
we need to find in the Medicaid program.
Beyond the direct revenue, raising the cost of cigarettes by a dollar will improve the health of the people of
Illinois, reducing tobacco-related Medicaid and health care costs over the long-term.
Again according to the American Cancer Society, raising the cigarette tax will prevent more than 70,000 children
from becoming addicted adult smokers, decrease youth smoking by 11 percent and save more than 38,000
Illinois residents from premature, smoking-caused death.
In its FY2013 Illinois Budget Roadmap, the Civic Federation supported increasing the state tax on cigarettes
from the current rate of 98 cents per pack to $1.98 per pack in FY2013 to reduce the State’s budget deficit and
to fund public health expenses in future years.

Result of Medicaid Stabilization
The Governor’s proposal will ensure Illinois is able to continue its Medicaid program.
It is respect for the doctors, clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, and pharmacists who provide care under the Illinois
Medicaid program, often under very challenging circumstances, that must motivate us to work together to save the
entire program from collapse. Our goal is to create a high quality Medicaid program that is sustainable for this year and
years to come.
We must implement a program to stabilize Illinois’ Medicaid system as soon as possible. The longer we delay without
implementation, the larger the hole in the Medicaid program becomes and the closer the program moves to collapse.
