 Office ofthe Purchasing Agent 

Confirmation Hearing for Purchasing Agent 

Maria de Lourdes Coss 


Thank you Chairman Suffredin and Commissioners of the Cook County Board. I want to take this opportunity to express my
deepest appreciation to President Preckwinckle for appointing me as Purchasing Agent for Cook County.
As you see on my resume, I have a Master's Degree in Public Administration and over 24 years of public procurement
experience. I have private sector, non-for-profit, local government, and higher education experience. Prior to becoming
the Director of Purchasing at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I was Managing Deputy Procurement Officer at the City of
Chicago. I returned to the City in 2005 after being at the Public Building Commission for almost five years when Mary
Dempsey asked me to join her team to help her reenergize the Department of Procurement Services. I am a Certified Public
Purchasing Officer and' sit on the Board of the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing. While at the UniversitY, I
was appointed by Governor Quinn to the Business Enterprise Council to represent higher education and was also a member
of the Disparity Study Oversight Committee.
This is an exciting opportunity to implement change to positively impact the lives of taxpayers. I share this administration's
vision for transparency and efficiency to restore public trust in the operations of government. Consistent with the
President's vision, the implementation of strategic efforts is imminent. It is important that we implement strategies that
will help the County realize cost savings in its purchases in order to continue to deliver the services necessary for the
taxpayers. It is also our goal to implement workshops to educate vendors regarding the process of doing bUSiness with the
County in order to achieve more competition and greater participation by minority and women-owned businesses.
Through the implementation of strategic efforts, cost savings will be realized and relationships will be enhanced. A team
approach to purchasing with the offices of other elected officials will help leverage volume. Working together will help us
maximize the benefits of each other strengths and open the lines of communication. Better communication will be an asset
in achieving greater transparency of procurement transactions.
Transparency in government is a nationwide topic when it comes to procurement. Many agencies throughout the country
have some type of transparency initiative providing taxpayers a view of government operations, particularly government
spending and contract awards. This initiative goes hand in hand with technology. We will be looking at short and long term
solutions to achieve the level of transparency to which this administration has committed. The implementation of
technology will also be an opportunity to rethink and streamline processes in order to eliminate any redundancy that
ultimately results in inefficiencies and waste.
Finally, in order to create a sustainable base to continue to seek and implement best practices, it is crucial to establish a
professional development program leading to certification in public procurement. The training has proven valuable in other
organizations and it is a measure of excellence in the area of public procurement not only nationally, but also
internationally. Holding a certification in public procurement such as Certified Professional Public Buyer (CPPB) or Certified
Public Purchasing Officer (CPPO) elevates the level of professionalism ofthe staff, their expertise and credibility. These are
designations that are highly regarded in the field of public procurement. The course work lead to the adoption to values
and principles that should be upheld by qualified public procurement personnel.
In summary, the implementation of formal training and technology will help us build a solid base to continue to adopt best
practices, think more strategically, build relationships, improve communication internally and externally, make processes
more transparent, and help reduce the cost of services provided by the County. Thank you.

RE: Maria de Lourdes Coss

Dear President Preckwinkle:
] am very pleaSed to write in support of your nomination of Maria de
Lourdes Coss as Purchasing Agent of Cook County. I have worked
directly with Ms. Coss on purchasing matters for many years and believe
she is an exemplary choice for Purchasing Agent for Cook County.
Ms. Coss has an outstanding professional reputation and record ofwork in
the field of government procurement and purchasing. Not only is she
extremely knowledgeable about the field as evidenced by her long and
successful career, most importantly she is a person of high integrity arid
honesty. I first worked with Ms. Coss when she was the Director of
Procurement for the Public Building Commission where the Chicago
Public Library is a major client. Ms. Coss not only handled her duties
with tremendous competence and professionalism. but I was always
confident that she and her team were scrupulous in following applicable
purchasing laws and procedures including adhering to the PBC's M/WBE
policies and requirements.
So highly did] think of Ms. Coss' integrity and abilities that in 2005 when
Mayor Richard M. Daley asked me'to reinvent and revitalize the City of
Chicago's Department of Procurement Services (DPS), I sought out Ms.
Coss to leave the PBC and to assist me in my work at DPS. Ms. Coss
became the Managing Deputy Procurement Officer. She was an
invaluable member of our new team - devising and implementing a
strategic plan, introducing efficiencies to eliminate a massive backlog,
training staff in proper procedures and in the purchasing code and laws,
introducing technology to ensure greater efficiency and accountability.
and helping to set a tone ofhonesty, integrity, professionalism and
competence that had been lacking in that department. The Department of
Procurement Services was transformed for the better, thanks in large
measure to the dedication and professionalism of Ms. Coss and those she
recruited and trained at DPS.

 President Preckwinkle
January 11,2011

Ms. Coss' reputation in the profession continued to grow after I left DPS.
In 2006, she was recruited to the position of Director ofPurchasing at the
University ofIllinois at Chicago (UIC). I was very pleased to recommend
her for that position, to the Chancellor of the University. Her outstanding
work there for the past four years has obviously brought her to your
attention.
I can think ofno fmer way to transform and professionalize purchasing for

Cook County than to appoint Lourdes Coss as the Purchasing Agent for
the County. And I can think ofno finer way to set a tone of honesty,
integrity and fairness within that department than to have Ms. Coss as its
leader.
I recommend her to you with great enthusiasm. I know that she will make

you, the Commissioners and the people of Cook County proud to know
that its purchasing department will not only comply with appJicable laws,
but that their work will be marked by the highest degree ofcompetence,
innovation, professionalism and integrity.
I congratulate you on your selection of Ms. Coss. Please feel free to

contact me directly if you or any ofthe Commissioners wishes to talk with
me further.

Re:

Maria del Lourdes Coss

Dear President Preckwinkle:
It is an honor to be asked to furnish this letter in support of Lourdes Coss' appointment to the
office of Purchasing Agent of Cook County. 1 have known Lourdes for fifteen years as both a
client and colJeague. In 1995, Lourdes represented the City of Chicago's Department of
Purchases, Contracts and Supplies ("City Purchasing"), and 1 represented the City's Department
of Law, on the team that worked on the development of the Central Area Circulator for the City.
Lourdes was very knowledgeable about both procurement and City government. More
importantly to me, she was very generous with her knowledge and her time, as 1 was new to City
government at that point, and I learned a great deal from her.
In ] 997, I joined City Purchasing as an Assistant Purchasing Agent, and was responsible for all
procurement for the Department of Aviation. Lourdes was working as the contracts administrator
for the Department of Sewers at that point. Fortunately, she was willing to take on a bigger role
in City Purchasing, and became the Deputy Purchasing Agent for the City's infrastructure
departments when I was appointed Deputy Purchasing Agent for Aviation. We worked closely
together to standardize forms and practices across departments, manage change orders more
effectively, and decrease the processing time for infrastructure contracts. We both left City
Purchasing in 2000, but when I returned to the City Law Department in 2005, I was happy to
learn that Lourdes had returned to the Department of Procurement Services as the Deputy
Procurement Officer for the Department of Aviation. Once again we worked closely with each
other in the effort to move the O'Hare Modernization Program from the planning stage to
construction, and were able to initiate the controls and processes that facilitated the OMP's
achievements in meeting their schedules and budgets.

As far as I am concerned, the County could not have made a better selection for its Purchasing
Agent. Lourdes has the knowledge, interpersonal skilJs, patience, and most importantly, the
integrity that is essential for public procurement work. 1 have no doubt that Lourdes wiJ) do wen
in the position of Purchasing Agent, and that her good work wiJ] reflect well upon and provide the
necessary support to your administration, and County government as a whole. Pleas.e feel free to
contact me at 312-628-7016 should you have any questions in this regard.

Re: Maria De lourdes Coss
Dear Toni:
Maria De lourdes Coss is the perfect choice for the position of Chief Procurement Officer for Cook
County.
Very few people, loCally or nationally, have the experience and the reputation that lourdes Coss has in
the procurement and purchasing community and among small business owners and the minority and
women's business community.
She has had a major impact on public procurement and is committed to transparency, process
improvement, the utilization of technology and ethics and integrity.
Her experience at the University of Illinois as Director of Purchasing resulted in the implementation of ,
an organizational structure and processes that is exactly what Cook County needs in their procurement
programs.
She served with esteem as Managing Deputy Procurement Officer at the City of Chicago and especially
at the Public Building Commission where she expanded its compliance with Minority and women's
business goals.
She has continued to be active i~ important purchasing organizations and in procurement and M!WBE
councils to enhance and strengthen government procurement programs for minority and women
business enterprises.
I commend the President's office for an excellent appointment of lourdes Coss as Chief Procurement 

Officer.

Re: Lourdes Coss
Dear President Prec.kwinkle:
I am writing in support of the appointment of Lourdes Coss to the position of chief procurement officer
for Cook County.
Her credentials are excellent with 24 years experience in government procurement, national
certification (Certified Public Purchasing Officer) and a master's degree in public administration.
I could recommend her on the credentials alone, but she brings more to the job that that. From
personal knowledge I know that ethics and integrity are paramount to her. She really enjoys profession
of procurement and understands how procurement needs to work within the system to meet the goals
of the larger organization.
A good leader recognizes that good staff is key to the success of the organization. One thing that
especially impressed me was her dedication to her staff. She went to great lengths to train and raise the
professionalism of the staff. Mo.:;t of the buying staff now holds at least one procurement certification.
! had previo'.lsly appointed lourdes as Acting State Purchasing Officer for the University of IlIino!s at
Chicago. That was a good decision on my part and I think you made a good decision to appoint her to
your CPO position.

 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to present on behalf of President
Preckwinkle a federal lobbying contract for Susan White of Susan J. White and
Associates. Susan has had a relationship with Cook County for and began lobbying
on behalf of Cook County in 1997.
Let me be clear on the current climate in Washington DC. This will be a difficult year
for units oflocal government. As you know, upon becoming Speaker of the House,
John Boehner and the Majority Caucus have outlined their governing priorities.
Among those priorities are:
Reducing government spending and cutting appropriation levels by 9% under last
year's marks, which are projected to save the fed.eral government tens of billions of
dollars;
Freezing and reducing domestic discretionary spending to save over $50 billion.
Domestic discretionary spending includes programming and federal grants to units
of local government. The new House Budget Committee Chairman has previously
advocated for discretionary funding to be level-funded through fiscal year 2014Â­
that would mean reducing budget line items each year by the rate of inflation;
The new Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has proposed
block granting Medicaid funds to states.
As you know, the federal government pays a fixed share of a state's Medicaid costs.
If the federal government moves to block granting those dollars to states, it would
then pay only a fixed dollar amount of a state's costs.
If Illinois exceeded the amount of Medicaid funding provided to it, the state would
be responsible for all costs that exceed the cap.
Even with the income tax increase that was passed last week by the Illinois General
Assembly, Illinois remains billions of dollars in debt. Block grants could be
devastating to our Health and Hospitals System.
Also targeted by Members of both parties are continuing appropriations to help
reduce the federal deficit. Already indentified by Members of both parties are funds
that we receive, allocated in the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000,
for funding our health system. From this appropriation alone, we receive over $130
million per year.
And Members of both parties in both chambers have said earmarks will be
eliminated within the budget this year.

 The federal budget for FFY 2012 will be smaller than the one currently in effect. And
cuts will be made to states and units of local government. We will take every
opportunity that is presented to bring more federal resources home to Cook County,
including submitting projects for inclusion with the surface transportation
reauthorization bill.
But our first priority will be defending and keeping the resources that we receive
from Washington DC. That is responsible course of action. Helping us do that again
this year will be Susan White.
Susan's government relations practice spans over thirty years in Washington on
federal, state and local government issues, including health and tax policy legislation
and regulation. She has successfully sought direct funding under Medicaid for
hospitals, specific tax provisions for her clients and appropriations funding for local
projects in the social services and infrastructure areas.
Susan worked for ten years as a health and tax and finance lobbyist for the National
Association of Counties and in her own business has represented numerous
counties over the years.
Susan has over thirty years in Washington DC, working closely with key
congreSSional leadership offices and congressional committees, including the Senate
Committees on Finance and on Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP); the
House Committees on Ways and Means, on Energy and Commerce, and on Education
and Labor; the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations and others.
She works with numerous public interest and trade groups in Washington, including
the American Hospital Association, the National Association of Public Hospitals, the
National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Governors' Association,
the National Association of Counties, the National Conference of State Legislatures,
the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities.
She has a reputation for honesty and competency among members of the Cook
County and Illinois Congressional Delegation and J am happy to present her contract
for this committee's consideration.
Susan or I am happy to answer any questions that you or any committee member
may have for us.
