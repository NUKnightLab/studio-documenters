OPENING STATEMENT
This is a difficult time in our nation. A democracy depends on balancing opposing points of view with at
least modicum of respect for our differences. Instead, what we have seen in the past week 0 in Louisiana,
Minnesota and Dallas – is splintering in our social bond. Two more black men shot and killed by police
who are sown to serve and protect; police officers, professionally performing their duties, assassinated by
a demented gunman. We cannot, as a nation, accept such acts, and we must dedicate ourselves to
addressing our social ills, closing or at least narrowing our divisions, repairing shattered trust and healing
our badly wounded body politic. My fervent hope is that we can confront this difficult time, engage in
real dialogue by listening to each other and work toward meaningful solutions.

COMMEMORATING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE AND MEMORY

WHEREAS, John Flynn Rooney, an award winning journalist, and reporter for the Chicago Daily Law
Bulletin for nearly three (3) decades died June 30th, leaving behind family, countless friends, devoted
readers and a community enriched for having known him; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney was one of the legal community’s greatest chroniclers; he was noted for his
intelligence, exceptional attention to detail and excellence. “No detail seemed too minor to escape his
attention. No question appeared too tough to ask. No story was too big or too small, or too difficult, to
handle,” 1st District Appellate Justice Michael B. Hyman said as he presented Rooney with a lifetime
achievement award last month during The Chicago Bar Association’s Herman Kogan Media Awards; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney had the unique ability to work without rancor and as a result was genuinely
admired and respected; there was never a personal, partisan, or ulterior motive when it came to the way he
wrote. He was known as a reporter who could be hard-hitting with his sources when he needed to be and as
someone who reflected the very best of the free press; and
WHEREAS, while he was in high school and college, John Rooney worked as a runner for renowned
personal-injury attorney Philip Corboy. He and the Rooney siblings who followed him did such a good job,
lawyers at the firm started calling the runners “Rooneys,” The title to this day is still used at Corboy and
Demetrio and according to Thomas Demetrio “It’s a badge of honor to be called a Rooney”; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney was a second-generation news man. His father, Edmund J. Rooney Jr. was a
reporter for the old Chicago Daily News. John Rooney graduated from Marist High School. He earned his
bachelor’s degree in communications from Loyola University of Chicago and a master’s degree in public
affairs reporting at Sangamon State University, now known as University of Illinois Springfield.; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney spent three (3) years as an editor and reporter at the City News Bureau of
Chicago, where he covered education, transportation and federal courts. After a short time spent as a
Page 12 of 180

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 13, 2016

reporter for the Tampa, Florida Tribune and a producer for Walter Jacobson at WBBM-TV Channel 2,
Rooney started with the Law Bulletin, covering the county courts from the Daley Center and reporting on
1st District Appellate Court decisions. After four (4) years, he moved to the Dirksen Federal Courthouse
where he would spend another four (4) years covering the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. His intelligent
and insightful reporting were much admired; he covered notable corruption cases against lawyers, judges
and other elected officials, including Thomas J. Maloney and Adam N. Stillo Sr., both former Cook County
circuit judges. Rooney returned to the Daley Center in 1997 and began reporting on the tenures of Cook
County chief judges Harry G. Comerford, Donald P. O’Connell and Timothy C. Evans before becoming a
general-assignment reporter in 2003. He held this position until his retirement; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney will long be remembered for breaking the story in 1982 about the Chicago-area
deaths from cyanide-laced Tylenol. His reporting was honored with the Peter Lisagor Award from the
Chicago Headline Club; and
WHEREAS, John Rooney is survived by his wife, Margaret, and their three (3) sons, Ned, Jack and Dan.
He will be sorely missed.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of John Flynn Rooney
and herewith expresses its sincere gratitude for the invaluable contributions he has made to the Citizens of
Cook County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be spread upon the official
proceedings of this Honorable Body and that an official copy of the same be tendered to the family of John
Flynn Rooney.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of
abandoned with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial
real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.

member also may be buried in a national cemetery at no charge; and
WHEREAS, states, territories, and tribal governments may impose additional requirements more stringent
than those required by federal law; and

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment
Classification 6b that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for an abandoned industrial
facility; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Classification System for Assessment defines abandoned property as
buildings and other structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 continuous months,
have been purchased for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser in
whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances justify
finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the municipality states the Class 6b is necessary for development to occur on this specific
real estate. The municipal Resolution cites the qualifications of this property to meet the definition of
abandoned with special circumstances; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value, qualifying industrial
real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from the
date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property from
the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market
value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the County
of Cook, that the President and Board of Commissioners validate the above-captioned property is deemed
abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 6b; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed to forward a

Agenda Item No. 15-6468, enacting a Hotel Accommodations Tax. The Bureau of Technology, in

WHEREAS, paid sick leave has a positive effect of the health of not only employees and their family
members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national
survey of U.S. restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have come to
work sick; and,

preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and,

City have passed legislation requiring employers within their jurisdictions to provide paid sick leave; and,
WHEREAS, a cost model developed by the Civic Consulting Alliance found that a paid sick leave

labor costs for most employers.

42, Human Relations, Article 1, In General, Section 42-1 through 42-6 of the Cook County Code is hereby

ESTABLISHING EMPLOYER PAID SICK LEAVE FOR RESIDENTS OF COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois
Constitution, Article VII, Section 6 (a); and
WHEREAS, pursuant to their home rule powers, the Cook County Commissioners may exercise any power
and perform any function relating to their governments and affairs, including the power to regulate for the
protection of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare; and
WHEREAS, promoting the public health and welfare for those who work within the County’s border
plainly meets this criterion; and, Page 2 of 10
WHEREAS, employees in every industry occasionally require time away from the workplace to tend to
their own health or the health of family members: and
WHEREAS, in Cook County, XX percent of private sector workers received no paid sick leave; and,
WHEREAS, paid sick leave has a positive effect of the health of not only employees and their family
members, but also the health of fellow workers and public at large and the most comprehensive national
survey of U.S. restaurant workers found that two-thirds of restaurant wait staff and cooks have come to
work sick; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System spends between 350 and 500 million in
uncompensated care and has an interest in the health of County residents; and
WHEREAS, paid sick leave reduces health care expenditures by promoting access to primary and
preventative care and reduces reliance on emergency care; and
WHEREAS, nationally providing all workers with paid sick leave would result in 1.1 billion in annual
savings in hospital emergency department costs; and
WHEREAS, over 20 municipalities including New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Jersey
City have passed legislation requiring employers within their jurisdictions to provide paid sick leave; and
WHEREAS, a cost model developed by the Civic Consulting Alliance found that the paid sick leave
framework reflected in this ordinance would result in only a small, 0.7 to 1.5 increase in labor costs for
most employers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
42, Human Relations, Section 42-1 of the Cook County Code is hereby enacted as follows:
