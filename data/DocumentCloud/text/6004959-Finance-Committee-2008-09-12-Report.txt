women business enterprise participation and use of sub-contractors. A list of the vendors involved in
the project was requested; Mr. Small replied that the list will be made available at the next meeting. 

Questions regarding the System?s limit of liability policy (charity care) were raised. Mr. Small explained the
background on the policy. He stated that there was a portion of time where all self-paid billing was suspended so
that the limit of liability policy could be redesigned to make it more understandable and easily implemented. That
was rolled out this past April, but it has already been stated as a rather generous policy overall. Director O?Donnell
asked that copies of the policy be distributed to Directors.

Director O?Donnell stated that a plan should be received from MedAssets; this plan should include
accomplishments, benchmarks and anticipated revenue expected, and whether or not these goals are met.

Director Golden informed the Committee that a work plan with a time line is included in MedAssets? contract.

Cook County Health and Hospitals Svstem

Income Statement for the Seven Months Ended
June 30, 2008

Summary

The operating results for the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System for the ?rst seven months of the 2008 ?scal year were
favorable compared to budget. The year to date Operating
Revenue for the ?rst seven months was less than budget by
$31,175,072. The favorable ?nancial performance is primarily due
to a lower level of expenses compared to budget. Operating
Expenses are below budget by $47,768,491.

Operating Revenue

The System continues to emphasis the charging, billing, and
collection of patient fees. At the end of June the shortfall from
budget had improved from the shortfall at the end of May, In

addition the revenue cycle vendor hired by the system, Med
Assets, has completed some of the initial start up work. Med
Assets has begun to make operational changes in July that will
improve collection in subsequent months.

The Inter GovernmentalTransfer Revenue for ?scal 2008 will be

lower than the budgeted amount. To mitigate this

management has w0rked with the State Of Illinois to do the account

reconciliations, which normally occur in April, in October which
should result in the System receiving in funding.

The projectionof annual patient fee revenue is somewhat
improved from the projection reported in May. The System
the patient?fee revenue will now bebelOw budget by
approximately $36.4 million as compared to the priOr projected

shortfall of $41 million.

Operating Expenses .
The System Operating Expenses were below budget for the ?rst

seven months of the 2008 ?scal year by $47, 768, 491 or 7. 8 
The System has had internal discussions with its staff to try to
identify alternative ways to improve the accuracy of the ?nancial
information that is used to measure operating results. There
continues to be improvements in the reporting process.

Salaries and Wages $1,468,000 or 
Salaries Wages and Bene?ts were below budget for the System at

the end of June. The System is able to accurately measure the
level of Salary and Wage expense through the use of actual payroll
system data plus an accrual using a standard methodology.

Supplies $21, 530,486 or 25.0%

The bulk of the June YTD favorable expense performance
compared to budget was for Supplies and Purchased Services. The
System continues to estimate the expenses for these items through
the use of actual payments through the end of June along with a
60% accrual on the actual expenses for the ?rst seven months for
items that may beunpaid at the end of June. The System continues
to explore an alternative methodology to insure the accuracy of
estimates for these expense items.

Purchased Services, Rental and Other $22,297,564 or 25.3%
This category of expense is estimated with the same methodology

used to determine the levels of expense for Supplies.

Utilities 209, 670 or 18.0%
The expenses for Utilities for the ?rst seven months are based on

actual expenses for Gas and Electricity and an estimated accrual
for other utilities. The June Utility Expense was the ?rst month
that new reports from the County were used to determine levels of

expense.

Depreciation 

The Depreciation expense reported in the June 2008 YTD ?nancial
statements is based on the estimated level of expense in the last
audited ?nancial statements. This is another area where the
Finance staff is exploring alternatives to using this approach.

Year to Date Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day

A comparison of expenses per unit of service is as follows:

. Category Stroger Oak Forest Provident
Salaries and Wages $1894.20 $1891.73 $1904.31
Emp. Bene?ts 708.53 734.44 708.32
Supplies 459.05 326.01 366.72
Purchased Services 439.15 273.83 589.58
Depreciation - 208.17 135.33 106.90
Utilities 61.47 94.83 67.02
Contributed Services 16.12 16.30 80.65
Total $3786.69 $3472.47 $3 823.50
Volume

The volume at all three facilities is above the budget when the IP and OP
activity are compared against the budget. The visit volume at the ACHN
cliniCs is belowbudget 'by 9,358 visits or about 2.7% YTD. The largest
decline in visit volume is at the Fantus Center. on the main campus.

Non Operating Revenue

Non Operating Revenue is reported by the Comptroller?s of?ce. The
System incorporates that information in its ?nancial statements.
The amounts collected for Cigarette Taxes and Sales Taxes are signi?cantly
below budget for the ?rst seven months of the ?scal year. The Sales Tax
revenue is expected to increase as the new Sales Tax amounts begin to be
collected later in the ?scalyear. The ComptrOller?s of?ce has estimated that
the new Sales Tax increase, which began July 1, will. result in an additional
in funding to the Health System in October.
