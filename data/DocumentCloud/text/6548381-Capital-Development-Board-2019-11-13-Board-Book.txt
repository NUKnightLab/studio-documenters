Project History: The Chicago Read Mental Health Center is a 314,410 square foot, 13-building facility established in 1965.
The original scope of work for provided for the replacement of the fire alarm systems; including mass notification and
interface with the HVAC systems. The scope also provided for the replacement of some of the fire doors and adding
sidewalks for egress.
DHS has two projects at Chicago Read Mental Health Hospital and, after careful consideration, CDB has decided to combine
these two projects into one. Primera Engineers is the A/E of record on both projects. The first project (#321-030-153) is to
install a new fire alarm system. This project was advertised in PSB 249, the orientation meeting was held on 6/17/19, and
the project has an executed contract. The second project (# 321-030-154) is to install a new HVAC system in every
building. The second project was advertised in PSB 255, the orientation meeting was held on 10/16/19, and currently does
not have an executed contract.
DHS stated they are only able to vacate one residential building at a time during construction. As the preliminary schedule
currently looks, these two projects will be awarded 5 months apart. Due to the logistics, it is in the best interest of the state
to combine the two projects into one project. In doing so, the A/E would design and bid the project as one bid package.
PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT MODIFICATION: Add the scope of work from CDB Project 321-030-154 to this
project, change the project description to upgrade fire alarm system and replace HVAC system. Project 321-030-154 will
be canceled. Also, change all project schedule dates, except for the contract completion date.

2 of the project is the exterior rehabilitation. The work consists of the repair and replacement of sidewalks, ramps, porches,
and terrace areas on Somerville. It also includes painting and repairs to porticos, railings, and guardrails; and backfilling of
earth and seeding of yard areas to create a positive slope and surface drainage away from the perimeter walls of both
buildings.
The new gutters and downspouts on the Anderson and Somerville domiciliaries currently drain into the yards surrounding
the buildings; this can cause pooling around the existing storm drain inlets and potentially infiltrate back into the building.
When the existing light poles were brought down and examined, it was discovered that the photoelectric sensors did not
function and the electric access plates were broken.
Description of RFP Change: Tie in the downspouts to the underground storm drains for both buildings, repair the light
poles and install new photoelectric sensors on the poles.
Requested Action: We are requesting approval of proceed order G-3 in the amount of $154,000 to allow the contractor to
proceed with storm sewer tie-ins before winter weather slows the work.

CDB PROJECT NO. 040-010-107
ARCHITECHNICS PROJECT NO. 5718

Mr. MacGibbon,

This letter is to inform you of a Using Agency request to add renovations to the storm sewer system for
this project. The RFP for this change is attached.

The reasons for the requested change are as follows:

(1) There are areas on several sides of both buildings that have little to no slope, so there is no
opportunity for surface drainage to get away from the buildings.

(2) The lack of positive drainage has led to water infiltration in the basement on several occasions.

(3) Some storm drains that have been piped underground at Anderson Barracks are causing severe soil
erosion where they are discharged to grade.

(4) Several downspouts are attached to long corrugated tubes to try and keep water away from the
buildings, they are not very efficient and 

We initially discussed including underground storm drainage in the project with the Using Agency, but it
was determined at that time that there was not enough money in the budget for this work, which proved to
be the case following the receipt of bids.

The attached RFP also includes a small increase in costs to renovate the existing historic light poles,
there were conditions that required additional repairs which were not known until the poles were brought
down and examined.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments regarding this request.
Sincerely,


1.1

Subject: FW: Anderson Somerville roof water drainage request
Chris,

IDVA would like to respectfully request that the current project involving renovations of Anderson and Somerville (040-
010-107, Ph 2) be expanded to include burying drain pipes from the roof downspouts and channeling the water to
existing storm sewers and the draining ditch to the south of the buildings. The Home is unable to channel the water far
enough from the buildings themselves to prevent it from building up around the foundations and allowing infiltration of
sand/silt into the basements as noted in the Executive Order 2019-O4 report. The constant flow of mud through the
basements makes walking in the basement dangerous for residents as well as employees who must access these areas
and renders this space unusable for storage. The excessive moisture will likely cause the rusting out and early failure of
the water heaters and storage tanks that were installed in project 040-010-105.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject: Anderson Somerville roof water drainage request

Gwen, I?m writing you as to a request to drain all roof water from Anderson and Somerville buildings into a buried storm
line leading to an existing storm water drainage ditch just east of the Somerville building. Currently we are experiencing
several areas around these two buildings that due to a flat grade is holding roof water drainage and creating an
environment rich for pest control issues. Some of these areas actually drain back towards the buildings creating
foundation mud inundation issues within the basements. This mud issues was wrote up by our 1904 audit surveyors as
an environmental issue to be corrected. Whether it?s ran into an actual storm line or existing drainage ditch would be
best determined by an engineer. was in hopes that this request could be achieved through the CD8 phase 2 site work.
Thank you.

Project Manager: Darnell Barnes

Project History: The Dan Ryan Field Office (D0085) in Chicago, was originally a 12,000 square foot office facility that was
demolished and replaced with a 9,500 square foot office facility. The new building will be split into two sections; one section
will serve as the IDOT EEO/Resources center and the other section will be Ieasable office space. Each section centains a
set of restrooms. Both sections will share conference space and break room/copy area.

This project was bid on November 15, 2018 and the contractor received ATP in January of 2019. When the contractor
entered the building prior to demolition, they discovered that the water lines inside the building had burst while the structure
was unoccupied. The original scope of work included plans to connect the new building?s water line to the existing city line
at the same point of entry. As such, proceed order G-7 was issued in August of 2019 to reconnect to line at this location.
The contractor was working with the City of Chicago Building Department who transferred this issue to the City of Chicago
Water Department. During the transfer, three representatives from the water department passed away. The final
representative required that the line be relocated to the opposite side of Taylor Street due to the age of the existing line at
the original location. This new location requires our contractor to excavate across four lanes of traffic and two sidewalks,
while avoiding multiple other utility lines. Due to these conditions, the City required a revised set of NE design documents.
(The modification for this additional work was approved October 15, 2019), The general contractor provided a cost to
IDOT and CDB on November 1, 2019 for the additional scope of work to move the line and repair city sidewalks and
roadways per their specifications.

Description of RFP Change: Install a new water line and repair sidewalks and roadways as required by the City of Chicago
specifications. This will be classified as an unforeseen condition.

Requested Action: We are requesting approval of proceed order G-7R in the amount of $184,000 to allow the contractor
to move forward with the water line. This revised proceed order combines the previously approved $33,369.81 with an
additional $150,630.19 for a total of $184,000.00.

Subject: RE: IDOT 900 5 Des Plaines Field Office - PO for water main work

From what i see the RFPCO was established at $33,369.81 but my understanding is that this
was set prior to the City identifying a location for connection at a much great distance than the
original connection location. As a result the cost is considerably higher.

The options as presented should be roughly equivalent and there is significant delta which
may be the cause of a minor error in the way the material costs were separated into different
sc0pes of work.

i have enclosed a mark-up of the review comments. We made some assumptions based on the

information provided. Jeff/Henry can you please take a look at the mark-up and provide

Project History: The Northwest Armory was built in 1940 on land granted by the Chicago Park Commissioners. The
building is equipped with an auditorium that measures 187 feet by 127 feet with seating capacity for 1800. The building also
contains locker rooms, day rooms, a kitchen, officers club, gymnasium, underground garage with space for 200 army trucks,
boiler room, and heating/ventilating plants.
The Scope of work for this project includes the renovation of restrooms and plumbing upgrades to the eastern portion of the
Northwest Armory. Additional scope was added to address an unforeseen condition associated with the raised structural
slab that required a review of the existing structure and additional design to coordinate with adjacent rooms.
The layouts of the restrooms are changing dramatically, and the existing raised cement terrazzo floors were being
removed to accommodate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) use as required by the scope of the project. During
demolition of the floors, it was discovered that the areas of the floor to be removed were structural. The original facility
drawings did not indicate that the areas in question were structurally raised floor areas that meet the height of the terrazzo
with a void area higher than the bottom of the rest of the structural slab. The underside of the floor system was also not
visible as there were dropped ceilings covering the bottom of the second-floor slab.
Therefore, there were two options to raise the floors to meet the required elevation: (1) bring the raised floors into the
adjacent hallway outside of the restrooms and create a ramp near the south stairwell in the east/west direction, or (2)
remove the raised slabs and re-pour them at the main second floor slab elevation as originally intended in the design
documents. The Department of Military Affairs’ preferred approach was to remove the elevated structural slab and pour
the slab to match the main elevation of the second-floor slab. This approach is reflected in the change order documents.
Description of RFP Change: This change order will provide for the demolition and removal of the existing floor and allow
the new floor to be poured at the proposed elevation. This will be classified as an unforeseen condition.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of change order G-03 in the amount of $169,461.71.

RFPCO 3 Unforeseen Structural Issues

Dear Ms. Zgonjanin:

This letter will explain why RFPCO 3 for unforeseen structural issues was required including
the impact to the original schedule.

During demolition of the three inch thick terrazzo floors which were placed directly over the
structural concrete floors it was discovered that two areas indicated to be removed were actually
structural slabs that had been raised and a void created on the bottom of the slabs. During the
design phase we did not have visual access to the bottom of the concrete floor slabs as there
were drywall ceilings covering the bottom of the ?oor above. Also, the original drawings
provided were unreadable and did not give any indication of the offset structural slabs during
review and design.

Two options were offered to the using agency to move fonrvard.

Option one was to raise the ?oors up with lightweight concrete mix to the height of the structural
slabs and carry the raised ?oor out into the hall way where a ramp would be created that met
ADA requirements

Option two was to remove the raised structural slabs as originally designed and then repour the
slabs to match the original slab elevation which would maintain the original design intent.
Both options would require a structural review and design by a structural engineer.

The Department of Military Affairs (DMA) (the using agency), elected to have the raised floors
removed and poured back to match the existing structural slab elevation therefore maintaining
the design intent.

Due to the unforeseen condition, Muller2 requested a contract modi?cation to perform the
structural review and design. Modi?cation request was submitted to CDB on June 6, 2019 and
?nalized on June 26, 2019. RFPCO was submitted to Contractor on July 30. 2019 and based
on questions from the contractor was revised on August 8, 2019 and again on August 22, 2019
for some additional questions from the contractor.

Project History: The Crestwood Armory (VT003) is a 216,283 square foot, two-story building constructed in 1981. The
scope of work provides for replacing and upgrading the building HVAC system and controls. This includes repairs to the
plumbing and fire protection systems, painting and sealing the outside surfaces of the exterior walls, replacing or resealing
windows, tuckpointing, selectively replacing ceramic tile floors, replacing stair tread finishes, painting and replacing the
kitchen ceiling. The scope also provides for the abatement of asbestos containing materials.
Due to proposed project budget estimates and at the advice of the original architect/engineer, the base bid did not include
a Building Automation System (BAS). The new architect was tasked to provide a design for BAS controls while
implementing the plans from the previous architect/engineer.
Description of RFP Change: The inclusion of a BAS per the using agency request. This request was a part of the original
project scope; however, the BAS system was not included in the bid documents due to lack of budget. The using agency
would now like to include the system and has provided a funding letter for the additional $248,918.21 required.
Requested Action: We are requesting board approval of change order V-1 in the amount of $248,918.21 to add a BAS.

RE:

546-310-008 DMA Upgrade Mechanical Systems/Renovate Interior
and Exterior Robinson Armory for RFP CO Approval and
Board Presentation

RFP CO V-1 $344,530.18 Mechanical Contractor – Amber Mechanical Contractor to
provide and install Building automation that will allow automatic centralized control of a
building's heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (BAS), per RFP V-1
This RFP/CO V-1 includes the BAS that will control all air condition and heating
components.
The base bid in the contract did not include BAS because of budget constraint. The
project was bid, and the project bid was about $800k below the A/E estimate. This BAS
was omitted from the design because for lack of budget. The A/E was replaced for the
construction phase, and Milhouse Engineer was tasked to provide a design for the BAS
while implementing the previous A/E plans.
The RFP CO V-1 was issued to Amber Mechanical with specifications and plan that were
created by Milhouse per a MOD 1. The specification included four control companies.
The control companies that were included Automated Logic, Automatic Building Control,
Inc., Control Engineering Corp., and Johnson Controls, Inc.
The Amber Mechanical contractor was asked to provide multiple subcontractor
opportunities for the BAS controls. The contractor submitted the design to four
temperature contractors to ensure a competitive bid environment. The four contractors
who were asked to provide bid estimates for the BAS were: JCI, Total Automation
Controls (TAC), Automated Logic, and Automated Building Controls (ABC). TAC was the
only firm to submit a bid. Formal CDB estimating procedures were then implemented to
ensure fair pricing as TAC is a subcontracting division of Amber Mechanical.
The review of the proposals provided by Amber Mechanical resulted in RFP CO V-1 in
the amount of $344,530.18.
