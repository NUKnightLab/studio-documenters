to increase the County Law Library Filing Fee to defray the cost of operating and

WHEREAS, P.A. 96-0227 was supported by many other counties around the state
including: DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, Madison, McHenry, McLean, St.
Clair, Tazewell, Will and Winnebago Counties; and
WHEREAS, prior to P.A. 96-0227, the General Assembly only increased the
maximum filing fee by three dollars, during the previous 20 years, which is less

WHEREAS, the current $18 dollars is inadequate in defraying the expenses the
Cook County Law Library; and

fluctuate independent of the Library’s influences, cases filed in the courts, patron

the revenues and expenses of the Library; and

available online to the average citizen, when, the average citizen does not have
subscriptions to online legal publications; and
WHEREAS, county law libraries provide the general public with access to justice,

that they would not be able to access anywhere else; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s Law Library is a National Hub Law Library which
provides citizens with access to over a quarter of a million print titles and several
online legal databases and with seven branch libraries, it is the only law library in
the area that is freely available to all people without restriction; and
