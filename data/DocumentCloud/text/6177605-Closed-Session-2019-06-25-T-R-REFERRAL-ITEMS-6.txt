Mrs. Mary Armetter Larkins

We, the members of the Detroit City Council, solemnly pause today to honor the memory of the late
MARY ARMETTER LARKIN S, a beloved 100-year old matriarch who was granted her angel wings
on June 3, 2019; and

MARY ARMETTER LARKINS was born to the union of Jeff and Annie Belle Glenn on December 25,
1918, in Thomasville, Georgia. She was the sixth child blessed to this union. Four of her siblings preceded
her in death. At an early age, MARY accepted Christ as her personal savior at St. Paul Missionary Baptist
Church in Thomasville, Georgia. MARY was united in marriage with Amos W. Larkins in 1939. To this
union they were blessed with three children: Willie Bell (deceased), Jacqueline and Dereck (deceased);
and

In 1944, MARY relocated to Detroit, Michigan. She began her long career at Harper Hospital in 1945,
working in the Uniform Department. MARY was later transferred to the Nursing Department as a Nurse
Assistant. She retired from Harper Hospital after thirty-two years of dedicated service. MARY was a
woman of strong faith and church was a very important part of her life. In 1956, she joined Chapel Hill
Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of Rev. John Truitt and continued to attend for the next
sixty-three years. MARY was a devoted member and served on the Mother?s Board, the Adult Choir, and
as a Leader for the Rose of Sharon Missionary Circle. She also enjoyed being an active member of The
Jolly Social Club; and

Never one to meet a stranger, MARY possessed a loving spirit and an out-going personality with the
willingness to help others. She was such a compassionate and humble person that loved to spread joy to
all who graced her presence. MARY was an avid gardener and enjoyed taking care of her flowers! She
also loved to bake cakes; 7Up pound cake was her favorite cake to make. MARY leaves to treasure and
cherish her memory, her daughter, Jacqueline Larkins; granddaughter, Ferrari Griffin; her sister, Ollie
Lawson; and a host of other relatives and lifelong friends. MRS. MARY ARMETTER LARKIN has
been a good servant and ensured that her impact would be forever embedded in the hearts of those she
cherished for years to come. NOW, THEREFORE BE IT

That the Detroit City Council and of?ce of Council President Brenda Jones, hereby expresses
condolences and joins with family and friends in honoring the life and legacy of MRS. MARY
ARMETTER LARKINS. She will be greatly missed and her contributions and the lessons she taught will
live on forever.
