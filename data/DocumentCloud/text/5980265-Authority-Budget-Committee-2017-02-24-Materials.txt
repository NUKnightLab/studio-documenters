Motion: Ms. Greene moved to approve the minutes of the September 16, 2016, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
2. Discussion
A. Lead Agency Issues

 B. Indirect Cost Policy
Authority Executive Director John Maki led a discussion regarding the Authority’s
indirect cost policy. Associate Director Kevin Givens described the indirect costs rate
structures; federally-approved rates and the de-minimis rates.
C. Grant Schedule/Timing Issues
Mr. Givens said that due to the number of RFPs expected in 2017, the Budget Committee
will be required to meet more frequently. Budget Committee meeting dates will be
scheduled soon for all of 2017. If scheduled meetings become unnecessary throughout
the year, they will be canceled.
Director Maki said that an effort would be made to distribute grants’ periods of
performance more evenly throughout the year so that staff is not tasked with having to
process new grants or close-outs all at the same time.
3. Bullying Prevention
Mr.Givens called attention to a memo dated November 17, 2016, regarding SFY17
Bullying Prevention funds. He said that at the August 18, 2016, Budget Committee
meeting, $62,700 was designated to Goodcity as fiscal agent for Prevent School Violence
Illinois (PSVI) to conduct a two-day bullying prevention training. Authority staff has
since determined that Goodcity is ineligible to receive state grant funds. PSVI selected
the Illinois Balanced and Restorative Justice Project as their replacement fiscal agent.
Authority Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman said that Goodcity did not have the proper
registration with the Secretary of State’s Office per Grant Accountability and
Transparency Act (GATA) rules when the grant was to be issued and an alternate fiscal
agent was sought.
This item was presented for informational purposes only. No Budget Committee action
was required for the item and none was taken.
4. Death Penalty Abolition Act
Mr. Givens called attention to a memo dated November 17, 2016, regarding the Death
Penalty Abolition Act. He said that staff recommends designating $476,767 in SFY17
Death Penalty Abolition Act funds to Thresholds to subcontract with Chicago Survivors
to provide crisis response and recovery services to family members of Chicago homicide
victims.

From:

John Maki, Executive Director

Date:

February 24, 2017

Re:

Recommendation to no longer require match for JAG programs

ICJIA currently requires grantees to provide a 25 percent cash match for all Justice Assistance
Grants (JAG) they receive. This is an agency policy that is neither required nor encouraged by the
U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). ICJIA staff recommend eliminating the JAG match requirement.
DOJ states in its solicitation, “Match Requirement: Match is not required under the JAG
Program. Although match is an effective strategy to expand justice funds and build buy-in for
local criminal justice initiatives, BJA encourages states to consider financial and other potential
local constraints related to imposing a match requirement on sub-grantees, as it may adversely
affect small local jurisdictions.”
ICJIA’s Board last discussed the JAG match requirement at a May 2006 Budget Committee
Meeting. At that meeting, staff recommended maintaining a 25-percent cash match requirement
for all JAG, so that grantees would have a financial stake in their programs and “to make the
JAG awards go as far as possible.” It was discussed at the meeting that if ICJIA encountered a
cash-strapped grantee with a record of sound fund management, then “special matching funds
requirements” could be discussed “at that time.” The Budget Committee unanimously approved
the staff’s recommendation.
Since that vote, ICJIA has had an unwritten policy whereby it may waive a JAG grantee’s match
requirement if the grantee can demonstrate financial hardship. Four of 39 2014 JAG grantees
received a match waiver. Four of 25 2013 JAG grantees received a match waiver. Seven of 35
2012 JAG grantees received a match waiver. Criteria for what constitutes “financial hardship”
have not been formally developed.
As required by ICJIA’s JAG Plan for Federal Fiscal Years 2016-2019, staff reviewed the match
policy. Based on this work, staff recommend eliminating the match requirement for JAG for the
following reasons: (1) consistency with the DOJ award solicitation, which discourages a JAG
match requirement; (2) the decision to grant a match waiver is somewhat arbitrary in that it
requires a subjective analysis of need and depends upon the grantee requesting a waiver, which
may also happen inconsistently; and (3) well-designed grant-funded programs should fulfill the
primary goals of a match requirement—leveraging funds and developing local buy-in—without
actually requiring matching funds.

Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime Notice of Funding Opportunity Designation
Requests
At the May 12, 2016, Budget Committee meeting, the committee set aside $800,000 in FFY14
Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds to support the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime Notice of Funding Opportunity. The goal of the Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent
Crime program is to reduce violent crime and strengthen the relationship between law
enforcement and communities by completing the Problem-Oriented Policing Scanning, Analysis,
Response and Assessment (SARA) process, building local research and evaluation capacity, and
implementing procedural justice and focused deterrence. Initial grants will be awarded for the
assessment process. Subsequent grants will be awarded for training and implementation.
The initial funding opportunity resulted in following designations:

Funding Source:

FFY14 Justice Assistance Grant: $98,862; Match requirements dependent on
Budget Committee’s match requirements determination.

Program Description
The purpose of Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime is to reduce violent crime and strengthen the

process. Subsequent grants will be awarded for training and implementation.
Program Activities
 
This program supports local multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) consisting of the city mayor, law enforcement,
local and federal prosecutors, community corrections (probation, parole), and community stakeholders to
enhance effective working relationships with community, criminal justice and social service agencies,
collaborate across criminal justice agencies, and conduct crime analyses using the Problem-Oriented Policing
SARA. During the planning phase this program funds may be allocated to:
1. One full-time project manager to facilitate leadership development and cross system collaboration, engage
in the SARA process for the MDT in partnership with an identified research partner and develop an
implementation plan.
2. One research partner to assist the MDT in conducting crime analysis and developing an implementation
plan that includes data collection to facilitate a process and outcome evaluation.
3. Travel within Illinois to attend regional networking and information sharing events.
Goal
The goal is to reduce group-related violent crime through strengthened governmental collaboration and
increased trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
Priorities

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Community-Based Residential Treatment for Adults (Adult Male Re-Entry) –
Illinois Department of Corrections

Funding Source:

FFY 2014 Justice Assistance Grants (JAG): $331,569; Match requirements
dependent on Budget Committee’s match requirements determination.

Program Description
The need for this program was identified at the Authority’s 2000 statewide planning summit. The program was
first funded through the Edward Byrne Memorial Anti-Drug Abuse Act and has been continued with Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) funding.
Program Activities
The Community-Based Residential Treatment for Adults pre-release program design provides for a structured
environment that includes strict expectations for behavior, participation, and active involvement during
substance abuse treatment programming at an Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) Adult Transition
Center (ATC). Treatment services focus on the reintegration of the offender into the greater community, with a
particular emphasis on employment and confinement. Treatment is specific to maintaining abstinence and
preventing relapse and vigorously promotes personal responsibility and positive character change.
After release from the ATC, the participants receive individualized case management. The former offenders
receive referrals and linkages to community-based agencies and services. Post-release, the grant-funded case
managers may assist participants with appointments, goal setting, acquiring identification, job search, housing,
admittance to educational or vocational programs, childcare, transportation, etc. as needed on an individual
basis. They work to link offenders to services, supports, and resources in the community, including recovery
home beds, and facilitate admission to treatment and other support programs.
Priorities
The program addresses the State Corrections priority to “support programs which allow state and local
correctional facilities to apply proven and innovative programs to assist in meeting the needs of incarcerated
persons and to maintain the safety and security of the institution, staff and inmate population.”
Performance Assessment
Without a state budget, IDOC has not been able to pay its vendors. Case management vendor TASC has
nonetheless continued to provide one of the three budgeted case managers and is working to hire another.
Because of the extensive background checks necessary to work with juveniles in a correctional setting, the
process of hiring replacement staff is lengthy and sometimes necessitates agreement extensions to fully expend

RE:

Justice Assistance Grants Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)

NEW NOTICES OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITY (NOFOs)
As Director Maki explained in his January 23, 2017 memorandum to the Board, as required by
the Grants Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) and ICJIA’s Strategic Plan for JAG,
ICJIA will be using standardized Notice of Funding Opportunities (NOFO) to make JAG awards.
Given ICJIA’s current staffing levels, it is not possible to transition all JAG programs
simultaneously to NOFO-driven awards; therefore, staff has grouped the JAG programs into four
primary strategic areas and will issue a staggered series of corresponding NOFOs to which
potential grantees will be able to apply over the next two years per the schedule below.
Strategic Areas
Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics

Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to Narcotics NOFO
Staff is requesting $4.2 million in available JAG funds from the FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 be
set aside to issue a competitive NOFO in the second quarter of 2017 for the Comprehensive Law
Enforcement Response to Narcotics. The NOFO will solicit proposals for three types of
programing: Police-led substance use diversion/deflection programs, multijurisdictional largescale narcotic trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs.
This three-pronged strategy is designed to address both the supply and demand for narcotics.

1. Police-led diversion/deflection
Individuals face a range of obstacles to entering or gaining access to treatment, including
uncertainty about how to access to services, shame and stigma, denial of SUD or substance
misuse, costs and lack of insurance/Medicaid, transportation, treatment waiting lists, and prior
negative treatment experiences (Appel, Ellison, Jansky, & Oldak, 2004). Police agencies across
the nation have implemented programs to reduce some of these obstacles. Two promising models
are police deflection and diversion programs. Each is described below.
Police Deflection Initiative Models
One model is “deflection” in which police serve as a point of contact for individuals seeking
treatment (Charlier, 2015). Deflection programs entail substance users either voluntarily
contacting the police or being contacted via outreach efforts (Police-Assisted Addiction and
Recovery Initiative, 2016). Users are offered SUD treatment without fear of arrest, and police
provide referral and transportation to treatment facilities as well as linkages to other appropriate
support services (Charlier, 2015). Police can immediately connect individuals to appropriate
human and social services, including assessment, case management, peer mentoring, and
treatment, while avoiding potential criminal justice system entry.
Diversion Initiative Models
Another model is police diversion programs in which police typically engage individuals after
they have had involuntary contact with police officers. The program may be offered pre-arrest or
post-arrest. Police diversion programs offer community-based treatment, case management,
housing, and job attainment services (Beckett, 2014; Collins, Lonczak, & Clifasefi, 2015).
2. Multijurisdictional large-scale narcotic trafficking enforcement
Drug trafficking is the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, and sale of drugs (UNODC, 2016).
Trafficking of drugs is a violent enterprise due to the need to exhibit strength and force to
competitors and rivals, as well as for retribution against lower-level distributors who do not sell
(Blumstein, 1995; Johnson, 2003). Despite violence and risk of law enforcement involvement
and punishment, the potentially great monetary rewards tempt some into drug trafficking. Drug
trafficking directly contributes to violent crime, availability of illicit drugs, growing numbers of
drug-users, and increasing numbers of drug-related hospitalizations and deaths. Therefore, drug
trafficking constitutes a major threat to public health and the well-being of society as a whole.
In order to combat drug trafficking, states use multijurisdictional drug task forces, which are
made up of law enforcement officers from state, county, and local police departments to pool
resources and more efficiently and effectively combat the drug distribution in multiple
jurisdictions (Mazerolle, Soole, & Rombouts, 2007). Outcome evaluations have found that
multijurisdictional drug task forces are more effective at making more serious drug arrests than
non-drug task force law enforcement (Olson et al., 2002; McGarrell & Schlegel, 1993; Schlegel
& McGarrell, 1991; and Myrent, 2013).

 JAG NOFO

3. Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units
Multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution units were designed to address the complexities of
prosecuting drug trafficking crimes. For example, in drug trafficking cases, prosecution need
strong evidence proving the involvement in a single enterprise to distribute narcotics, as well as
an understanding the drug trafficking organization, its day-to-day operations, and links to
organized crime and overseas suppliers (Natarajan, 2006). These narcotics units work with police
officers to provide prosecutorial oversight to those cases so that the evidence will withstand legal
challenges and lead to a successful prosecution. While there is not enough research to draw
conclusions on specialized narcotic prosecution units, research has examined other specialized
prosecution units and have shown these units reduced the likelihood of case rejection meaning
cases were likely to move forward to the next stage of adjudication (Pyrooz, Wolfe, & Spohn,
2011).

The following chart indicates how the funds will be distributed within the three categories of the
NOFO compared to how it is currently distributed. Staff requests permission to use its discretion
to be able to adjust the distribution should not all funds, within each category, be utilized.

specific program designations for funding at a future Budget Committee meeting. The attached
Funding Briefs provide a description of the categories that will be contained in the NOFO.
ICJIA Research and Evaluation NOFO
Staff requests setting aside $946,000 in JAG funds to issue a sole source funding opportunity in
the second quarter of 2017 for the Authority’s Research and Evaluation program. The 6.65 Full
Time Equivalent (FTE) Research & Analysis unit staff to be funded through this initiative
perform a unique function for the state, serving as gatekeepers for researchers’ use of the state’s
criminal history database, supporting the research and technical assistance needs of the
Authority’s grants unit, and oversight of independent evaluations of evidence-based and
promising practices that inform the Authority Board and other decision makers.
The attached Grant Recommendation Report provides a description of the activities to be funded
through this NOFO.
Staff will be available at the meeting to answer questions.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) Comprehensive Law Enforcement Response to
Narcotics

Funding Source:

JAG (FFYs TBD) / Match requirements dependent on Budget Committee’s match
requirements determination.

Request Type:

Agency Initiative

Program Description
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (Authority) is soliciting proposals for programs to reduce
the demand for and supply of narcotics and associated violence. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)
will make available three categories of funding for Law enforcement-based deflection and diversion programs,
multijurisdictional large-scale trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotic prosecution programs.
Program Activities
The growing nationwide opioid epidemic has left communities struggling to deal with its impact, as first
responders and emergency rooms see sharp increases in overdoses, businesses and residents experience thefts to
feed user drug habits, and drug use disrupts the families and careers of users. The scale of the problem across
the state calls for a comprehensive solution, reducing both the demand for drugs and their supply.
Law enforcement agencies have recognized that arrest and prosecution of low level drug users does not enhance
community safety or effectively reduce demand, as drug users repeatedly cycle through the criminal justice
system but never address their addiction. In response, law enforcement agencies have crafted new models to
reduce demand by deflecting drug users from involvement in the criminal justice to meaningful treatment, and
to divert arrested low level offenders from prosecution to treatment. These models are built on partnerships with
community health care and substance abuse treatment resources as well as prosecutors. One category of funding
to be offered under the NOFO will support law enforcement-based deflection and diversion programs. The
NOFO will detail necessary program components that are research-based best practices and allow applicants to
build proposed models based on the local need.
The second NOFO category will address the supply of drugs through multijurisdictional large-scale trafficking
enforcement programs. These cooperative units will work to target the most serious drug problems,
emphasizing interdiction and the disruption of networks that control narcotics trafficking, and the associated
violence that established, expands, and protects distribution territories.
The third category will support multijurisdictional complex narcotic prosecution programs that work as active
partners for drug units to provide the case development necessary to target the traffickers rather than users, and
increase public safety by disrupting distribution networks and the violence that supports them. Specialized drug
prosecutors provide vital assistance to the enforcement programs by obtaining overhear orders, search warrants,
and providing investigation consultation.

Goals
To increase public safety and reduce the large social and economic cost of narcotics use through the use of
specialized enforcement and prosecution of drug traffickers and the use of treatment over incarceration for lowlevel offenders.
Priorities
The following are the current JAG Goals/Priorities addressed by the NOFO.
Drug Enforcement and Treatment Programs
Goal: To support research-informed and promising drug enforcement and treatment efforts by providing
resources to programs that break the cycle of system involvement in the criminal justice system for people who
abuse legal and illegal drugs and substances, that ensure the safety of the crime victim and the public, and that
promote the payment of restitution to crime victims and to support evidence based programs that enhance public
safety and reduce the amount of drugs and substances illegally manufactured and distributed.
Prosecution, Court Programs, and Indigent Defense
Prosecution Goal: To support all public prosecutors, including appellate prosecutors, by providing the resources
and training necessary to assist them in protecting public safety by holding offenders accountable while
ensuring the constitutional rights of the accused and enforcing crime victims’ constitutional and statutory rights.
Law Enforcement
Goal: To support law enforcement by providing them with the resources necessary to protect and serve the
community through the development and implementation of data driven, promising, or research-informed
policing strategies that protect public safety and reduce crime, particularly violent crime.
Funding Prospectus
Under the Grants Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) grants are initiated through a Notice of
Funding Opportunity process. Grants initiated through a NOFO may be supported for three years.
Budget Detail
To be determined.

The Department of Justice has encouraged the use of JAG funds to support research-based programming. The
Authority has continued to use JAG funds to build and maintain Authority’s Research & Analysis (R&A) unit
capacity for data collection, analysis, evaluation, and the dissemination of research findings on various crime
topics that are a priority for the state.
Program Description
Through the proposed funding, R&A will carrying out a program of research and evaluation focused on drug
and crime control programs, system efficiency, and evidence-based practices to provide policy and decision
makers with better information on the extent and nature of drug and crime problems and the impact and
effectiveness of the justice system's response to them.
Program Activities
This funding will allow R&A to continue to:
 Develop, collect, analyze and disseminate research and statistical information on a variety of crimerelated topics, including the extent and nature of the drug and crime problem in Illinois and the justice
system’s response to it.
 Inform and advise the Authority regarding evidence-based and promising practices to inform the
development and implementation of JAG-funded programs.
 Provide technical support to the Authority grants unit, specifically in the development of funding
opportunity solicitations, review of applications, and analysis of program performance through data
report collection and analysis, grantee site visits, and staff training.
Priorities
The project addresses the Justice Research and Evaluation priority to “support research and other programs that
contribute to knowledge about crime, its causes, prevention and deterrence and about the needs of victims,

RE:

FFY17 Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Plan
Introduction

RSAT FFY17 INTRODUCTION
The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) requires grants to be initiated
through a competitive process, unless an adequate justification is presented for sole
source funding in a particular case. The application for Federal Fiscal Year 2017 (FFY17)
Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) funds is expected to be released in the
spring with an award commencing October 1, 2017. The Authority has not yet been
notified of a FFY17 RSAT award to Illinois.
In order to comply with GATA, the Authority plans to issue a notice of funding
opportunity to solicit applications for state and local correctional treatment and aftercare
services to be supported with anticipated FFY17 RSAT funds and local funds remaining
from the FFY14, FFY15 and FFY16 awards. The notice will detail federal RSAT
requirements and model RSAT programs and best practices. Designation
recommendations resulting from this funding opportunity will be presented at the July 27,
2017, Budget Committee meeting.
FFY14, FFY15, and FFY16 RSAT local-use funds designated for the 2016 medicationassisted treatment funding opportunity were never allocated as no applications were
received. Staff recommends including these grants in the FFY17 RSAT funding
opportunity. Remaining local-use funds include:

FFY15 Victims of Crime Act: $167,000; 20% Match

Request Type:

Request for Application (RFA)

Program Description
The Authority has worked to identify statewide needs through research, examination of state data sources, and
collection of feedback from experts in the field. The Transitional Housing Program is an effort to address an
important need and service gap identified in Illinois: transitional housing services for victims of domestic
violence, including intimate partner violence and human trafficking. An Authority survey of transitional
housing program directors revealed two critical components for successful transitional housing programs:
1. Survivors need a minimum of 24 months to gain the skills and stability toward independence and safe,
permanent housing.
2. A consistent contact or case manager is key to establishing rapport with the client and meeting the
clients’ multi-faceted needs over time.
A cornerstone of victim services has been to empower victims’ choices and acknowledge that the victim knows
their needs best. Certain policies and programming may be designed that take into account the impact of trauma
on a person’s thinking, feelings and behaviors. Applicants illustrating the use of trauma-informed services were
preferred. A minimum of $2 million in VOCA funds was made available for the development or expansion of
transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Grant awards must be spent over a
period of 12 months. Additional funding to extend the grant period will depend on both the availability of funds
and project performance during the first 12 months.
Program Activities
Safe Passage provides Transitional Housing services in DeKalb County-Cities of Geno, Sandwich, SycamoreVillages of Clare, Cortland, DeKalb, Esmond, Hinckley, Kingston, Kirkland, Malta, Shabbona, Somonauk,
Waterman. Safe Passage provides victims of domestic violence and or human trafficking and their children with
pathways to permanent, safe housing and self- sufficiency through individualized, empowering approaches.
Since 1981, Safe Passage has provided DeKalb County a 24/7 crisis hotline, an emergency shelter, legal and
medical advocacy, individual, group, and family counseling and therapy, and transitional housing to victims of
intimate partner violence (IPV), including domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking and
human trafficking. Safe Passages’ Transitional Housing Program opened in 1995, and the program has a history
of successful operation of a trauma informed and lifesaving service that helps victims avoid homelessness or
return to an abuser and successfully rebuild their lives. Many Safe Passage clients have severe and complex
trauma histories and daunting barriers to escaping abusive partners and life situations. Poverty, mental illness,
PTSD, unemployment, limited education, health concerns, affordable child care, legal problems and ruined

credit are just a few of the barriers they face. Safe Passages offers safe housing and trauma informed services,
for 24 months.
The need expand this program is evident in the increasing lengths of stay victims staying in the Safe Passages
emergency shelter have been requiring in the last few years. The shelter is always full and each week many
women and children are turned away. Safe Passages is requesting funds to expand its Transitional Housing
program from seven to 10 apartments and to hire a program-dedicated case manager and part-time counselor to
provide a full array of trauma-informed services.

children, a 24-hour crisis line, legal advocacy, children’s programming, emergency shelter, transitional housing,
and crisis intervention. This funding opportunity would be used to provide five additional transitional housing
units to meet the needs of rural survivors who lack options in obtaining safe and affordable housing. The goals

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Transitional Housing – A Safe Place

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2015 Victims of Crime Act: $300,000; 25% Cash Match

Request Type:

Request for Application (RFA)

Program Description
The Authority has worked to identify statewide needs through research, examination of state data sources, and
collection of feedback from experts in the field. The Transitional Housing Program is an effort to address an
important need and service gap identified in Illinois: transitional housing services for victims of domestic
violence, including intimate partner violence, and human trafficking. An Authority survey of transitional
housing program directors revealed two critical components for successful transitional housing programs:
1)
Survivors need a minimum of 24 months to gain the skills and stability toward independence and safe,
permanent housing.
2)
A consistent contact or case manager is key to establishing rapport with the client and meeting the
clients’ multi-faceted needs over time.
A cornerstone of victim services has been to empower victims’ choices and acknowledge that the victim knows
their needs best. Certain policies and programming may be designed that take into account the impact of trauma
on a person’s thinking, feelings and behaviors. To that end, preference may be given to applicants illustrating
the use of trauma-informed services. A minimum of $2 million in VOCA funds will be available for the
development or expansion of transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Grant
awards must be spent over a period of 12 months. Additional funding to extend the grant period will depend on
both the availability of funds and project performance during the first 12 months.
Program Activities
The $300,000 grant would create transitional housing at A Safe Place for 30 additional victims and an estimated
90 additional children, as well as support a new case manager position, who will work exclusively with the
victims supported through this grant. The case manager will secure and place victims in transitional housing,
and facilitate the in-house delivery of employment assistance, education assistance, housing advocacy,
economic assistance, in-person therapeutic counseling, children’s services, and legal system advocacy, as well
as make referrals for other services. In addition, the case manager will implement prescribed client assessment
tools, comply with reporting requirements, and attend the authority-sponsored semi-annual meetings.
This grant will expand one-stop services, including transitional housing and trauma informed support services
for victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking. All qualified clients served through this grant will be
offered transitional housing and support services for a minimum of 24 months. Programs are specifically
designed to encourage and support the victims’ effort to regain control over their lives.

This program will provide supportive services specifically designed to address the needs of domestic violence
survivors and their families. Their participation in their own goal setting and planning process is central to their
success. The program will provide deposit and rental assistance to each family for the duration of the 24-month
period, and as needed and assessed for appropriateness, support for utilities. If the client reaches her service
plan goals prior to the 24-month time frame, they will be encouraged to utilize the program for the full 24
months, to further facilitate a successful transition into independence. Clients will pay no more than 30% of
their rent, the remaining amount of rental costs will come from the program.
The program will hire two additional part-time case managers and one part-time employment/education case
manager. The current part-time program coordinator will become full-time to provide access to advocacy,
counseling, case management, public assistance and employment coordination services.
Each family will also receive support and coordination of services for the needs of their children through
contact with one point person within the program throughout their housing stay. The case manager will provide
access to services for each client. Once that access has been provided, the client will be responsible for
maintaining relationships with service providers as part of their service planning goals. By providing a primary
point-of-contact, Suzy’s Caring Place ensures the continuity of care and support of families, which is expected
to enhance successful outcomes.

Program Activities
KAN-WIN proposes to implement a scattered site transitional housing program to survivors of domestic
violence and human trafficking in north and northwest suburban Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and
Will counties. Survivors will gain safe housing via a minimum of 24 months’ rent and electricity subsidies paid
directly to landlords and electricity companies, with the possibility for a six-month extension in case of
emergency. This will include 100 percent of the security deposit and first three month rent and 80 percent of
rent for remaining duration of stay. A total of $1,100 will be the maximum rent, approximately 4 percent higher
than the average median rent of service area. A transitional housing program coordinator/case manager will be
hired to provide housing advocacy and case management, including economic, educational and employment
advocacy. The executive director will oversee the program, supervise, evaluate, and produce fiscal reports. The
resource coordinator will assist the transitional housing coordinator in serving survivors, including recruiting,
processing applications, and collecting donation for furniture and household goods.

BUDGET COMMITTEE GRANT RECOMMENDATION REPORT
Program Name:

Transitional Housing – Salvation Army: STOP IT

Funding Source:

Federal Fiscal Year 2015 Victims of Crime Act: $178,000; Match: $44,500

Request Type:

Request for Application (RFA)

Program Description
The Authority has worked to identify statewide needs through research, examination of state data sources, and
collection of feedback from experts in the field. The Transitional Housing Program is an effort to address an
important need and service gap identified in Illinois: transitional housing services for victims of domestic
violence, including intimate partner violence, and human trafficking. An Authority survey of transitional
housing program directors revealed two critical components for successful transitional housing programs:
1)
Survivors need a minimum of 24 months to gain the skills and stability toward independence and safe,
permanent housing.
2)
A consistent contact or case manager is key to establishing rapport with the client and meeting the
clients’ multi-faceted needs over time.
A cornerstone of victim services has been to empower victims’ choices and acknowledge that the victim knows
their needs best. Certain policies and programming may be designed that take into account the impact of trauma
on a person’s thinking, feelings and behaviors. To that end, preference may be given to applicants illustrating
the use of trauma-informed services. A minimum of $2 million in VOCA funds will be available for the
development or expansion of transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Grant
awards must be spent over a period of 12 months. Additional funding to extend the grant period will depend on
both the availability of funds and project performance during the first 12 months.
Program Activities
The Salvation Army’s STOP-IT program will provide comprehensive services for eight survivors each year;
three will be referred for a Housing Choice Voucher for rental assistance from the CHA’s Demonstration
Program for Trafficking Victims and five will be eligible for rental assistance.
STOP-IT will offer survivors of human trafficking a scattered site, 24-month transitional housing program.
Survivors will hold their own lease and live in an apartment in Cook County. This model allows survivors and
their children a choice in where they live. It also allows for the family to remain in the same community and
apartment once they no longer need rental assistance and supportive services, or at the end of the 24-month
program. Survivors will pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent, with the remainder being paid
directly to the landlord from STOP-IT or from the CHA’s Demonstration Program for Trafficking Victims.

 VOCA FFY15

goals are set by clients and the specialist helps them to achieve those goals. This program will work with
victims for up to 24 months to offer case management services including needs assessment, individual service
planning and safety planning, coordination of services, referrals, evaluation, and advocacy. This program

The Authority has worked to identify statewide needs through research, examination of state data sources, and

important need and service gap identified in Illinois: transitional housing services for victims of domestic
violence, including intimate partner violence, and human trafficking. An Authority survey of transitional

Survivors need a minimum of 24 months to gain the skills and stability toward independence and safe,
permanent housing.
2)
A consistent contact or case manager is key to establishing rapport with the client and meeting the
clients’ multi-faceted needs over time.
A cornerstone of victim services has been to empower victims’ choices and acknowledge that the victim knows
their needs best. Certain policies and programming may be designed that take into account the impact of trauma
on a person’s thinking, feelings and behaviors. To that end, preference may be given to applicants illustrating

development or expansion of transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Grant
awards must be spent over a period of 12 months. Additional funding to extend the grant period will depend on
both the availability of funds and project performance during the first 12 months.
Program Activities
North Cook Transitional Housing (NCTH) is a partnership between two domestic violence agencies, WINGS
and Apna Ghar, who will be responsible for overseeing rent payment and case management. The $279,900
grant will support a total of 12 transitional housing apartments. This program will provide 12-16 families
fleeing domestic violence with access to an apartment, rent, and utility support coupled with individualized case
management and trauma-informed services for 24 months. Each participant will be assigned a case manager
from either WINGS or Apna Ghar. Case managers are able to assist participants with connecting to mainstream
resources, accessing legal assistance, creating a budget, working on resumes and job seeking, referring to
education resources, and more during this first year. Potential participants will be screened by one of the NCTH
case managers to determine eligibility: Once a person is deemed eligible, the program coordinator will help
these families locate an apartment in the community in which they already have supports, such as employment,
childcare, family, friends and counseling, or one that the participant feels will offer greater safety. If extra
support is needed in locating an apartment, a third-party housing locator will be contracted. All services offered
through NCTH follow a trauma-informed, client-driven model. Case managers from both agencies receive

75

ongoing training on trauma-informed services and work to incorporate those principles in all work with clients.
Recovery is possible when survivors are empowered to make the choices that they believe best address their
needs and when those supports are offered in a holistic, culturally appropriate way. Although it is anticipated
that most of the participants will come from WINGS’ and Apna Ghar’s emergency shelters located in northern
Cook County, it will not be a prerequisite of the program. All of the housing where the participants will reside
will be located in the north or northwest suburbs or north side of Chicago, an extremely large geographic area.
Goal
GOAL: To provide victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking and their children with
pathways to permanent, safe housing and self-sufficiency through individualized, empowering
approaches.

Priorities
The Victim Service Ad Hoc Committee (VSAHC) in 2013 identified transitional housing programs as a funding
priority. In July 2016, the Authority issued a notice of funding opportunity seeking applications for the
development or enhancement of transitional housing for victims of domestic violence and/or human trafficking.
Eleven of the 19 submissions were recommended for funding by the review panel. Staff recommends
designating funds to the following entities and programs.
Funding Prospectus
A minimum of $2 million in VOCA funds was made available for the development or expansion of transitional
housing for victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. Grant awards must be spent over a period of 12
months. Additional funding to extend the grant period will depend on both the availability of funds and project
performance during the first 12 months.
Past Performance
None.
