Property Summary
10527 South Corliss was a scattered site building for CHA residents. It is in the historic district of
Pullman which requires extensive review regarding any plans to rehabilitate the property. The
property has fallen into severe disrepair.
Funding
Not Applicable.
Background
Building at 10527 South Corliss. The Cook County Land Bank Authority (CCLBA) is seeking to
acquire the CHA-owned vacant property located at 10527 South Corliss Avenue. The CCLBA is
seeking to acquire the Corliss property on behalf of Community Neighborhood Initiatives (CNI).
CNI plans to renovate 10527 South Corliss as part of its Pullman Revitalization Plan where they
1

 have already invested more than $5 million to renovate dozens of historic rowhomes, all of which
have been sold to new owner‐occupants. The CCLBA already owns the vacant row house adjacent
to the CHA-owned vacant property which CCLBA will also deed to CNI.
The Property, acquired in 1983 by the CHA, is a two-story, two-unit row house located in the
Pullman community area, and within the Pullman Historic District. The Property has been vacant
since November 2005. It is presently secured and considered uninhabitable. In 2014, the property
was listed in the MTW Annual Plan for disposition, and again in the 2016 MTW Annual Plan as part
of the second amendment to the plan.
In December 2017, CHA staff completed a physical needs assessment of the property and
confirmed that a costly gut rehab would be needed to fully rehabilitate the property. The property
was appraised in March 2017, and is valued at $13,000.
Additionally, the CHA has submitted the Property for review by the Illinois Historic Preservation
Agency (IHPA), as part of the environmental review process. IHPA has recommended a
preservation covenant be placed on the Property before it is conveyed to the CCLBA to ensure its
architectural integrity.
The CHA has met all necessary regulatory requirements under 24 CFR 970.9 (Resident Participation
– Consultation and Opportunity to Purchase) through a series of notices, meetings, and an offer of
sale to the Central Advisory Council. On August 5 and August 6 of 2015, the CHA convened public
meetings where residents discussed the proposed 2016 Annual Plan. Residents were informed of
and commented on the Corliss dispositions. Further, the CHA met with residents from the zip code
surrounding 10527 South Corliss on March 14, 2019, to inform them of the disposition as well as
to offer residents the opportunity to purchase the property. Lastly, the Central Advisory Council
was given the opportunity to purchase 10527 South Corliss on August 13, 2019. Together, these
actions fulfill the resident consultation and offer of sale requirements in 24 CFR 970.9.
The CCLBA has agreed to acquire the vacant property for the appraised value of $13,000, and has
agreed to purchase the Property with a preservation covenant as recommended by IHPA. The
transfer and sale of the Corliss property is contingent upon approval by the CHA Board of
Commissioners, as well as HUD approval of the disposition application.
The requested action complies with all federal disposition regulations.
Respectfully Submitted:
