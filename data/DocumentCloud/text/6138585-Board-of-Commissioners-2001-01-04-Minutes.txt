A RESOLUTION CALLING UPON
THE ILLINOIS GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO INCREASE THE APPROPRIATION
FOR THE LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
(LlHEAP) FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES
WHEREAS, the cost of heating a home using oil, natural gas or electricity has increased 45 percent over
last year to residents of Cook County; and

WHEREAS, some areas of Illinois have experienced an increase in electricity costs due in part to
electricity generation fueled by o il or natural gas; and
WHEREAS, low-income households in Cook County and other counties in the State of Illinois are
especially burdened by fuel price increases, forcing many families to forego essentia l living expenses in
order to stay warm during the winter season and thereby creating conditions for potential health problems;
and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Energy Department has pred icted that homes heated with natural gas w ill
experience a 50 percent increase in heating costs from a year ago due in part to low reserves and higher
costs; and
WHEREAS, homes heated with o il will experience cost inc reases of 35% over a year ago due in part to
reduced production and low reserves. Both oi l and natural gas consumers w ill experience higher electrical
costs as they compete with electrical producers who depend upon oil and/or natural gas; and

WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provides funds for home energy
assistance under a state administered Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and it is
now incumbent that the State of IIlino is appropriation of $9,619,596.00 approved on December 18, 2000
be increased; that the household income qualification be raised to include moderate income families; and

The fo llowing communication was made a part of the record :
LETTER
January 3, 2001
Honorable John P. Daley
Cook County Commissioner
118 N. C lark, Room 567
Chicago, IL 60602
Re: County Authority To Use Voting Machine
Dear Commissioner Daley:
You have asked the State's Attorney's Office to advise whether the Cook County Board
of Commissioners ("County Board") can exercise its home-rule authority to permit the
insertion of punch card ballots into ta bulation equipment during voting hours in loca l
elections invo lv ing no statewide or federa l offices. Based upon the analysis be low, we
conclude that the County Board ' s home-ru le authority does not extend to allowing punch
card ballots to be inserted into the County's tabulation equipment prior to the end of
voting and that, while the State Board of Elections (" State Board" ) has approved the
County 's voting equipment, that equipment must be used in a manner that is consistent
with the Election Code.
As a general matter, approval by the State Board is required before the County may use
new voting equipment. T he use of electron ic, mechanical or electric voting systems is
governed by Article 24A of the E lection Code, which requires the State Board ' s authority
for the use of voting syste ms. I 0 ILCS 5/24A-I. While the County Board is g iven the
authority to "adopt, expe riment with, or abandon a voting system approved for use by the
State Board of Elections," Article 24A specifies: " In no case may a county board ...
contract or arrange for the purchase, lease or loan of an electronic voti ng system or voting
system compo nent without the approval of the State Board of Elections...." I 0 lLCS
5/24-3.
Moreover, ex1st111g case law indicates that the regulation of election procedures is a
statewide, not a local, concern. See Leck v. Mic hae lson, 129 Ill. App. 3d 593 , 601 -602,
4 72 N.E.2d 11 66 (1 st Dist. 1984), a.ffd in part, rev 'd in part, 111 Ill. 2d 523 ( 1986). Jn
Leck, the First District Appellate Court analyzed the intent of the framers of the 1970
Illinois Constitution a nd conc luded that the regulation of elections procedures does not
pertain to local government a nd affairs so as to come within the grant of home rule
powers found in A11icle VII , section 6 of the 1970 Illinois Constitution. & at 60 I
(election laws fa ll entire ly within the jurisdiction of the legislature and not home rule
units). This conclusion finds support in the uniformity clause of the Constitution, Article
Ill , section 4, which is titled "Election Laws" and provides in full :
T he General Assembly by law shall define permanent residence for
voting purposes, insure secrecy of voting and the integrity of the election
process, and fac ilitate registration and voting by all qualified persons.
Laws governing voter registration and conduct of e lections shall be

 JOURNAL O F PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 4, 2001
The Illino is Supreme Court has stated :
Unde r our constitution, the State Board of Electio ns is charged with the
responsibility of supervis ing and administe ring elections and ins uring
that they will be conducted in a general and uniform manner.
Totte n v. State Bd. of Elections, 79 111. 2d 288, 294, 403 N .E.2d 225 ( 1980).
Thus, the a uthority to use voting machines in all elections is governed by Illinois law,
which delegates the sole a uthority fo r the approval of the use of voting machines to the
State Board . The procedures fo r counting and tallyi ng ballots, however, are governed by
the Election Code. I 0 ILCS 5/24A- l 0. 1.

It is our understanding that the County has obtained Elections Systems & Software's PBC2100, the new in-precinct punch card tabulating equipment approved for use by the State
Board on November 16, 1999, which has the capability to fu nction both as a ballot box and
a ballot tabulator. We further understand that the machine is designed (i) to be left on
throughout the day of voting so that, as the ballots are inserted into the machine, votes are
recorded into the machine's memory, and (ii) to detect ballots that have been over-voted or
do not contain election judges' initials. The equipment is also designed so that no vote
data, other than the number of ballot cards inserted, w ill be revealed while the po lls are
open fo r voting. Although the PBC-2 100 was approved by the State Board, under the
Election Code, the ballots are inserted by the election judges after the polls are closed.
While an arg ume nt could be made that the County Board has the authority under Section
24A- 3 of the Election Code to "experiment with" the vot ing machine which has already
been approved by the State Board of Elections, including the authority to a llow insertion
of the ba llots into the tabulator during vot ing hours, such a procedure appears to be
inconsistent with the procedure plainly set forth in Section 24A-10.1. This Section
requires that the counting procedures commence " [i]mmediately after the c losing of the
po lls" and provides that:
The ballot cards and ballot card enve lopes shall be separated in
pre paration for counting by the a utomatic ta bulating equipment provided
for that purpose by the election a uthority.
Before the ballots are ente red into the a utomatic tabulation equipment, a
precinct identification card provided by the e lection a uthority sha ll be
ente red into the device to ensure that the totals are all zeroes in the count
column on the printing unit. A precinct j udge of election shall then count
the ballots by entering each ballot card into the automatic tabulating
equipment. . .
10 ILC S 5/24A- I 0. 1.
While the language of Section 24A-10.1 prescribing the procedure for counting punch
card ba llots may be construed as directory rather than mandatory, it does not provide
support fo r the insertion of the ballot card into the ta bulating machine during polling
place ho urs. Indeed, this procedure is contrary to the procedure set forth in that statute
which indicates that the procedures commence "[i]mmediately after the closing of the
polls." ill T he mandatory/directory distinction in the statutory construction of election

388

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 4, 2001
laws has been employed to detennine whether a vio lation of a particular statutory
provision will render an affected ballot void. See McDunn v. Will iams, 156 Ill. 2d 288,
3 17, 620 N.E.2d 385 ( 1993) (citing Pullen v. Mulligan, 138 Il l. 2d 21 , 46, 56 1 N.E.2d
585 ( 1990)). Failure to comply with a mandatory provision re nders the affected ballots
void, w hereas technical violations of directory provis ions do not affect the validity of the
affected ballots. Even if a policy permitting insertion of punch cards during voting hours
does not render a ballot void, it remains a technical violation of this statutory directive.
See G lenn v. Radden, 127 Ill. App. 3d 7 12, 715, 469 N .E.2d 616 (5th Dist. 1984) (failure
of electio n officials to follow leg is latively prescribed procedure for counting absentee
ballots not excused by fact that such fai lure sanctioned by loca l custom; but no evidence
that noncompliance affected fairness of election, therefore election resu lts stood).
However, even if the provisions were regarded as directory, the re does not appear to be a
pos itive grant of authority e nabling the County Board to adopt vote counting procedures
which conflict with Section 24A-I 0.1 .
We note that the procedure permitted by the legislature in Article 24A of the Election
Code for punch card voting systems, I 0 ILCS 5/24A- I et seq., may be contrasted with the
procedure pennitted by the legislature in Article 24B for " Precinct Tabulation Optical
Scan Technology" voting systems approved by the State Board, which specifica lly allows
ballots to be inserted into the automatic tabulating equipment during polling hours. I 0
ILCS 5/24B-I0.1. If the PBC-2 100 were considered " Precinct Tabulation Optical Scan
Technology counting equipment," the County may be authorized to permit insertion of
the ballots into the equipment during polling hours. However, we have no information
suggesting that this is the case.
In conclusio n, even though the State Board has approved the PC B-2 100, the County
Board 's home-rule powers do not include authority to adopt its own procedures for
counting ballots, even where the e lection concerns only local offices and does not include
state or federa l offices. Moreover, Article 24A of the Election Code governs the use of
punch card voting systems and does not appear to permit the County to a llow e lection
judges to insert punch ballot cards cast in the precinct into the tabulating
equipment/ballot box during polling place hours. See I 0 ILCS 5/24A- I 0. 1.
The instant dilemma is one that could be resolved by the Genera l Assembly through an
amendment to the Election Code that would a llow for the insertion of ba llots into an
automatic tabu lating machine during voting hours.
Very truly yours
