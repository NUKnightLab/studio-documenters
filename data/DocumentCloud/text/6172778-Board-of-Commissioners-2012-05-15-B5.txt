EXPLANATION

The proposed resolution is to approve the form of lease for Park Boulevard Phase ZB and all
future on-site and off-site phases (formerly known as the Stateway Gardens Development). The
development will offer 108 units, of which 37 rentals are reserved for CHA residents, 34
Affordable, and 37 Market Rate rentals. It is understood that the developer has an interest and
desire to implement its own lease forms and policy that encourages consistent community
standards and for the effective management of its mixed-income developments. The lease and
policy have to accommodate various aspects of the multiple types of tenants and characteristics
of a mixed-?nance transaction.

The authorization of approval of the form of lease and occupancy policy for the Park Boulevard
Phase 23 is required at this time to facilitate the closing of this development transaction. A
public comment period was held from March 21, 2012 through April 20, 2012. A public
comment hearing was held on April 10, 2012 at Stateway Community Partners. Notice for the
30-day comment period was published in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Defender, and Hoy
newspapers, as well as posted on the CHA website and on site at the following CHA
Administrative Of?ce, Central Advisory Council, Latino Site Of?ces and UPA Property
Management Office. Consideration will be given to any forthcoming comments prior to
?nalizing the documents.
