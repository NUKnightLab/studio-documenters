Report from System Chief Financial Officer
Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer, presented a report on the following subjects:
• Update on MedAssets Revenue Cycle Activities
Mr. Ayres stated that the centralized billing office (CBO) project, transcription and coding are major areas of
activity. Each of these have plans which are being implemented. They are working now on the staff buildouts for the CBO; there are requests related to expenditures for this project included in the Contracts and
Approval items for this agenda. They are starting to work on the scheduling of selection and training of
employees, and they are negotiating with the union for the move of those employees into other functions.
• Update on Enterprise-Wide Computer System
Mr. Ayres stated that the Enterprise system has three major components: the Lawson general ledger
installation, a payroll/human resources component and a materials management system. The Lawson general
ledger installation, originally scheduled for January, then delayed until March 2010, has now been pushed
back up to January. He stated that the installation and implementation of the other two components is
proving to be more difficult; there is a great deal of data-build, decision-making, and coordination with the
County that will need to take place.

Report from System Chief Financial Officer (continued)
• Update on Charge Description Master (CDM)
Mr. Ayres stated that they are in the final stages of having a plan for the implementation of a standard CDM
by January of 2010, and for the System to start the departmental re-work in earnest, in the December to
January timeframe. He noted that there are a number of issues, such as those relating to documentation and
technology, that impact the implementation of the CDM.
Director O’Donnell inquired whether it was possible to do a partial implementation of the CDM. Mr. Ayres
responded affirmatively, stating that there are certain high-revenue departments that have been selected to be
worked on now.
Additionally, Director O’Donnell inquired as to the status of CareLink. Mr. Ayres stated that the feedback
from the clinical providers has been received. Mr. Foley stated that there needs to be a meeting with
MedAssets on the subject, after which they will first come back through the work group for any revisions to
the policy.
• Meeting of the Finance Committee of the Cook County Board, Thursday, October 29, 2009 at 1:00 P.M.
Mr. Ayres stated that later that afternoon, the Finance Committee of the Cook County Board will be meeting
to continue their review of the FY2010 Proposed Budget Recommendation. They will be reviewing the
System’s budget at 1:00 P.M.
• Performance Improvement Assessment and Implementation of Plan
Mr. Foley provided an update on the performance improvement assessment and implementation of the plan.
He noted that the work that was added for Cermak Health Services should be completed by next week.
Opportunities have been identified throughout the System. A consulting firm will not be needed for fullblown implementation of the plan, however, assistance will be needed for some components of the plan, such
as those relating to labor productivity, supply chain management and physician services/staffing.

IV.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Draft Financial Modeling of Strategic Plan
Mr. Ayres provided information relating to the financial modeling of the strategic plan. He stated that it is a
cyclical process. The Board and management determine the direction, then the financial team applies some
relatively high-level financial modeling to it, to get an indication of what the order of magnitude or impact
might be. As the Board and management refine the direction and the actual operating plans are developed
for the transition, the financial team goes back to refine the models in a continual fashion; what is
eventually developed is a budget.
Mr. Ayres introduced Harold Emahiser, of Integrated Clinical Solutions, who is responsible for the actual
financial pieces relating to the strategic planning process. He presented a summary of the process.
Mr. Foley inquired whether different options or scenarios can be provided for the three-year financial plan,
and whether the financial impact could be evaluated with each option or scenario. Mr. Emahiser responded
affirmatively.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Proposed Memorandum of Understanding between the Cook County Department of Public Health
and the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago (Attachment #1)
Acting Chairman Golden noted that Dr. Stephen Martin, Chief Operating Officer of the Cook County
Department of Public Health, was unable to attend the meeting; she indicated that she had spoken with him
the day before to address her questions on the proposed Memorandum of Understanding.
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Interim Chief Operating Officer, presented the item for consideration on
behalf of Dr. Martin. He stated that the request relates to a potential affiliation with the Public Health
Institute of Metropolitan Chicago (PHIMC) to apply for a Center for Disease Control-based grant called
Communities Putting Prevention to Work. The focus of the grant is obesity reduction, increasing physical
activity and improving nutrition in the area. PHIMC would act as the fiscal agent; potential funding for this
could be approximately $10 million. There is a tight timeframe for approval of this affiliation; October 30th
is the deadline to get the necessary approvals.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the item. Questions were raised with regard to the method of
selection and previous experience. Although PHIMC would be responsible for hiring relating to this grant,
Acting Chairman Golden stated that she had inquired whether the System could post job opportunities for
this grant on the System’s website. Additionally, Acting Chairman Golden noted that the equipment
purchased with this grant will be owned by the County when the grant is over.
Acting Chairman Golden stated that this request is only for the County to put forward the application.
There will be other opportunities to continue the dialogue with regards to hiring, indirect cost rate, as well
as if there are any contracting opportunities with the grant. Mr. Foley agreed, stating that representatives of
PHIMC can be invited to a Finance Committee meeting to answer questions or provide additional
information.
Director Ramirez, seconded by Director O’Donnell moved the approval of the proposed Memorandum of
Understanding between the Cook County Department of Public Health and the Public Health Institute of
Metropolitan Chicago. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Chief Financial Officer of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County; and Elizabeth Melas, of the
County’s Office of Capital Planning and Policy, provided information on the contractual requests presented.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests presented. With regard to request numbers 21 and 22,
Hershel Tolsen, of the County’s Office of Contract Compliance, stated that these requests have not been
reviewed by his office.
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of request numbers 1 through 20
under the Contracts and Procurement Items, and the conditional approval of request numbers 21 and 22,
pending review by the Office of Contract Compliance. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Re: Communities Putting Prevention to Work
Dear Mr. Carvalho:
On behalf of the Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH), I respectfully request that the following timesensitive matter be placed on the agenda of the Finance Committee at its next meeting.
CCDPH has an opportunity to partner with the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago (PHIMC) to apply for a
significant grant opportunity announced by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called “Communities Putting Prevention to Work” which will involve evidencebased interventions directed to the topics of obesity reduction, increasing physical activity and improving nutrition in the
region. Strategies and interventions implemented under the grant, if awarded, must be population-based, evidence-driven,
must address public policy and must reach diverse groups. The grant amount is funded under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 and could result in funding in excess of $10 million dollars. The application process is very
competitive and requires a commitment by October 30, 2009. Public health departments are encouraged to apply in
partnership with an entity that will engage in fiscal and administrative tasks in order to assure that grant requirements
imposing tight timelines for substantial deliverables are capable of being met. This grant represents a significant
opportunity to promote wellness and improved health outcomes in suburban Cook County.
PHIMC is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization that is highly qualified and experienced in public health policy and
administration of large grants. PHIMC is willing to partner with the CCDPH in applying for this grant and in
administering the grant in accordance with CCDPH and Health System directives subject, of course, to the approved grant
terms and the rules imposed by the Funding Source. While the CCDPH will be the lead programmatic agency on this
grant, if we are successful, funds may be disbursed to numerous agencies and local government bodies that agree to carry
out specific tasks and programs designed to achieve the objectives of the grant. If awarded, a group of high level
community leaders, the Project Leader and Program Director must comprise a Leadership Team to oversee the strategic
direction of the grant and to enact policies. In short, while CCDPH will take a programmatic lead, the grant is one that
will have a wide jurisdictional impact, requiring significant collaboration beyond with public health partners beyond our
immediate County and health system resources.

We Bring HealthCARE to Your Community

 The CCDPH requests approval of plans to submit a letter of intent and proposal to apply to participate in this grant-funded
initiative with PHIMC and of the enclosed Memorandum of Understanding with the PHIMC. The MOU outlines the
commitment of the parties regarding the core responsibilities of the CCDPH and the PHIMC with respect to the
performance and administration of the Communities Putting Prevention to Work grant, if awarded. It identifies PHIMC
as the recipient and administrator of the grant funds, identifies the role of the CCDPH as programmatic lead, provides for
appropriate approvals of expenditures and provides for the development of additional contractual documents between the
CCDPH and PHIMC as necessary to implement an approved grant budget and approved programmatic activities in an
effective, quality and timely manner.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,

Stephen A. Martin, Jr., Ph.D., M.P.H.
Chief Operating Officer

WHEREAS, PHIMC has specialized expertise in carrying out, supporting and administering grants to carry out
public health programs and in working with numerous community agencies and leaders in the broad public
health community; and
WHEREAS, the parties intend to submit a joint application for funding under the Grant, whereby they will
carry out the programmatic activities of the Grant jointly and whereby PHIMC will serve as fiscal agent for the
Grant, receiving and disbursing Grant funds as approved by CCDPH in accordance with the terms of the Grant,
the approved budget and any terms or rules applicable thereto;
NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed by the parties that:
1. Application. PHIMC, working in cooperation with CCDPH, hall submit a Letter of Intent and subsequently,
a Proposal to receive funding under the Grant, and shall include in said Proposal a description of their roles in
administering and carrying out programmatic activities under the Grant.

 3. Reimbursement. The parties shall be entitled to reimbursement of their respective administrative and other
costs from the Grant Funds as mutually agreed, consistent with the requirements of the Grantor and the
approved Grant Budget. If the Grant is awarded, the parties shall enter into formal contracts as necessary and
appropriate to implement their responsibilities under the Grant. The parties shall mutually agree upon specific
implementation duties, budgeted costs, and administrative charges and reimbursements allocated to each party

Grantor. If the Grant is awarded, this MOU shall continue until the responsibilities of both parties under the
Grant have been fully performed, except as modified or superseded by a more detailed Contract defining the
respective responsibilities of the parties in implementing the Grant.
7. Termination. Both parties are committed to completion of this project without a termination. In the event
of an alleged breach or dispute, the parties agree to meet through their principals in an effort to negotiate in
good faith to avoid any disruption of programmatic activities. In the event these efforts are unsuccessful after a
significant, good faith effort, either party may terminate this MOU by giving the other party at least ninety (90)
days written notice. In the event of a termination by either party, the PHIMC shall release to CCDPH all Grant
funds that have not been contractually committed prior to the date of termination, and CCDPH shall either
secure another agency to perform the functions of PHIMC or shall perform the functions of PHIMC directly,
subject to the approval of the Grantor.
9. Notices. All correspondence between the parties to this MOU shall be addressed as follows:

Description of
Services:

322 South Green Street, Suite 506
Chicago, IL 60607.
Provide eligibility enrollment services to uninsured patients who receive medical
care at Cook County Health and Hospitals System.

Justification:

GLM's original contract # 06-41-591 with effective dates from 7/1/20066/30/2009 had a PO maximum payable amount of $1,860, 000.00. Business
needs required executive management to direct the referral of several special
projects t o the vendor which were the result of a severe MANG unit backlog
which would have resulted in multi-million dollar loss to CCHHS if left
unresolved. GLM was assigned all pending Medicaid accounts aged 61 days and
older with a value of approximately $42m. Consequently, the vendor's eligibility
enrollment work resulted in additional revenue as well as unbudgeted vendor
fees. Based on the increased referral volume GLM depleted available PO funds
prior to the end of their contract date of 6/30/2009, thus warranting an increase
of additional increase to the PO in the amount of $469, 477.70 which was
approved by the board on or about June 8,2009. Shortly after that increase was
approved the board approved the extension of GLM's contract period beyond
the original contract expiration date of June 30, 2009. This was necessary
because the financial counseling re-design plan and associated contract could
not be completed prior to GLM1s contract expiring which would have left the
County without eligibility vendor coverage. On September 18, 2009, the board
approved the financial counseling re-design plan and signed the necessary
contract to initiate implementation. A close-out plan for GLM to work out their
existing inventory has been established and request for an increase to their PO
once again is necessary to continue to process invoices for services rendered
through March 31,2010.
