COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM
ITEM #1
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 17, 2008 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Re:

Community Block Grant Program, Emergency Shelter Grants Program
and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program

transmitted herewith are the recommended projects for the 2008 Community Development Block Grant
Program (CDBG), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program (ESG), and the proposed use of funds under
the HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME). The 2008 CDBG Proposed Projects represents the
4th year of the Five Year Consolidated Plan (Plan), which is a Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
mandate, that requires the County to utilize federal dollars in accordance with the strategies outlined in
the Plan. As part of the HUD approved Citizens Participation Plan, the Cook County Community
Development Advisory Council adopted these recommendations at a public hearing held on May 8, 2008.
The amount of CDBG funds requested was $24,039,028. The amount of CDBG funds available for
programming is $10,505,109. The proposed use of CDBG funds will provide 100% benefit to low and
moderate-income persons.
The amount of ESG funds requested was $1,014,000. The amount of ESG funds available for
programming is $445,665. The proposed use of ESG funds provides essential services and
maintenance/operations costs for homeless shelters in suburban Cook County, as well as programs for
homeless prevention.
The amount of HOME Investment Partnership funds granted by the U.S. Department of Housing and
Development (HUD) is $5,599,793. Additionally, the County will receive $44,853 for the American
Dream Down Payment Initiative recently announced by HUD. Applications for eligible HOME projects
are accepted throughout the year. The proposed use of all funds must be incorporated into the County’s
Annual Action Plan for submittal to HUD.
Prior to submitting required documents to HUD, Cook County is required, by Executive Order 12372,
Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, to submit proposed projects to the Northeastern Illinois
Planning Commission and the Illinois State Clearinghouse for their review and release to HUD. The
County must also publish the description of the Annual Action Plan. All documents and certifications
must be submitted to HUD no later than August 15, 2008.
I respectfully request approval of the recommended CDBG and ESG projects, the proposed use of the
HOME funds, and that I, or the Chief, Bureau of Capital, Planning and Facilities Management, or his
designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of the County of Cook, any and all documents necessary to
further the programs approved herein, including, but not limited to, subrecipient agreements,
intergovernmental agreements, amendments and modifications thereto, loan documents, lien assignments,
releases of mortgages and liens, and mortgage assumptions.

general prevailing rate of wages in this locality for laborers, mechanics and other workers engaged in the
construction of public works coming under the jurisdiction of this County is hereby ascertained to be the
same as the prevailing rate of wages for construction work in the Cook County area as determined by the

with both the Secretary of State Index Division and the Department of Labor of the State of Illinois.

or type of work needed to execute the contract or to perform such work. The Purchasing Agent in
awarding the contract shall cause to be inserted in the contract a stipulation to the effect that not less than
the prevailing rate of wages, as found by the Bureau of Human Resources, shall be paid to all laborers,

SIDNEY A. THOMAS, Chief Operating Officer, Provident Hospital of Cook County
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $208,800.00 to Nighthawk Radiology Services, Coeur
d’Alene, Idaho, for Tele-Radiology Services for review, analysis and diagnosis of patient radiographic
films. The contractor provided 24 hour service coverage to assist hospital physicians to meet patient
demand. The service was performed pending the evaluation and award of the annual Request for
Proposal (RFP) (Proposal 08-50-1035P, opened 5/30/08) for this service.
Reason:

The service was necessary due to the need to continue to provide critical radiology services at
the hospital for in-patients, out-patients and emergency room patients in a safe environment
due to the abrupt resignation of three (3) of the four (4) radiologists at Provident Hospital of
Cook County. This payment is necessary due to secondary to a delay in execution of the
contract approved on the May 15, 2007 Board Agenda, negotiations on language in the
contract between the vendor and the States Attorney’s Office, and a further delay in
completion of the RFP process. RFP proposals have been received and evaluated and a
vendor will be selected and submitted to the Purchasing Agent for inclusion on the July 22,

Reason:

$1,966,250.00
(589,875.00)
589,875.00
$2,556,125.00 $1,966,250.00

The Recorder of Deeds Office wants to correct the amount so as to accurately reflect the dollar
amount. The incorrect language that appeared in the fourth (4th) amendment of contract
should not have resulted in a decrease of $589,875.00. The intention was to reference the 5th
and final payment amount of the contract. The deleted amount of $589,875.00 must be
restored, in order to ensure full implementation of the contract pursuant to the revised contract
agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $589,875.00. (527-579 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the County Recorder Document Storage System Fund.
