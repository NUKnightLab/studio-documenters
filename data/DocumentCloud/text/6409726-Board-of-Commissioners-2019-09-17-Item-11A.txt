It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (BOC) of the Chicago Housing Authority
(CHA) authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to Approve 1) CHA Community
Support Corporation’s Ownership Interest in Southbridge Phase 1A and 1B; and 2) Execute and

Background
The Harold Ickes Homes development (Ickes), originally situated on approximately 18 acres
within the near south side community area of the city of Chicago and was located between 22nd
Street (North), State Street (East), 25th Street and 24th Street (South) and Dearborn and Federal
Street (West), is currently being redeveloped. The demolition of all buildings was completed in
2010 and the selected development team for Ickes, approved by the BOC June 16, 2015, is The
Community Builders, Inc. a Delaware corporation and McCaffery Interests, Inc., an Illinois
corporation.
On September 18, 2018, the BOC approved the funding, submission of a Project-Based Voucher
(PBV) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Financing Plan to the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development and execution of a Housing Assistance Payment Contract for
the closing and redevelopment of Ickes Phase 1A and 1B, to be known as Southbridge.
1

 On March 27, 2018, the BOC approved the formation of CHA Community Support Corporation,
an Illinois not-for-profit entity (CHA CSC) to allow its participation and financing in mixed-finance
projects.
The Ickes development team needs an un-affiliated entity to have a 21 percent (21%) ownership
interest in the ownership of Phase 1A and 1B due to the requirements of the low-income housing
tax credit investor in the projects. CHA CSC is acceptable to the investor. Therefore, CHA
requests approval to allow CHA CSC to have an ownership interest in Southbridge Phase 1A and
1B.
Respectfully Submitted:
