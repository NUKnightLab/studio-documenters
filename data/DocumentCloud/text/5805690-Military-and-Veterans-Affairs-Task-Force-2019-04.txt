Re: MDOT TAP Grant Application
Dear Mr. andidge:

We are pleased to continue our long partnership with the City of Detroit as we
work to complete the Riverwalk connection of the East Riverfront to the West
Riverfront through an application to the Michigan Department of Transportation
(MDOT) Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP). The request will support the
construction of a segment of Riverwalk at the DDA parcel between the Riverfront
Towers complex and Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Centennial Park.

The Conservancy will fund the matching requirements of the grant as well as
raise funds for the project costs over and above the grant amount. In addition, as
the perpetual steward of Detroit?s riverfront, the Conservancy will manage and
fund the ongoing maintenance and operation of the new Space.

We are grateful for the City?s partnership on this project. If you have any
questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,
