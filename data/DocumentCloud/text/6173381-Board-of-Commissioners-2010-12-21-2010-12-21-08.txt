GENERAL BACKGROUND
As the only agency funded by the State of Illinois to administer the Illinois Child Care
Assistance Program for Cook County, IAFC manages and maintains an extensive database of
childcare and early education programs. Based on this status, CHA contracted with IAFC, since
2007, through a non-competitive procurement to provide a childcare referral program
specifically for CHA residents. The contract’s primary focus was to establish a program to

 provide enhanced childcare resource and referral services for CHA families. As the Admissions
and Continued Occupancy Policy’s (“ACOP”) work-requirement has increased to 20 hours per
week in FY2010, accessibility to childcare has become an increased need for these families. Due
to the success and importance of the enhanced referral program IAFC performs, Resident
Services recommends the continuation of the enhanced referral program to assist CHA families
in accessing the most effective childcare resource.
IAFC initiated a program of support for parents of young children who are CHA residents. The
program includes making enhanced referrals for families to childcare and/or early childhood
education programs based on their specific needs and eligibility for various programs. Enhanced
referrals include an initial consultation to identify key indicators and needs. Families are then
contacted within two (2) days and provided substantial information on available resources.
Additional follow-up is made within a week to track child placement and determine if additional
follow-up is needed. As of October 2010, 487 enhanced referrals have been completed, and over
4,100 informational packets have been distributed to residents. In addition to continuing the
enhanced resource and referral program, in 2011 IAFC will initiate a parent leadership program
for CHA residents. Participating parents will engage in a series of ten (10) sessions focused on
topics including, but not limited to, child development, parent-child relationship building,
effective communication with children, and cultural learning opportunities for children.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer, or his designee, to enter into a one-year contract with two (2) one-year options with
Illinois Action for Children for the period of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 in an
amount not-to-exceed $330,000.
