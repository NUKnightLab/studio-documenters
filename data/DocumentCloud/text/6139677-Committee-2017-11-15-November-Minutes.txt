OTHER BUSINESS:
B. LEGISLATIVE:
i.

Update and Possible Action Regarding P.A. 100-0023** *

The Fund’s Legislative Liaison John McCabe was present.
Fund Counsel Burns advised the Board that P.A. 100-0023 allows for the assignment of receipts,
or revenues that the City would normally receive from the State in annual payments, such as
income taxes, sales taxes, motor fuel taxes and the like. The language in the Act gives a secured
interest to bond holders which pensioners do not have. Pensioners claims, even if secured by the
Constitution, are unsecured. The consequence of this language is that in the event of a
bankruptcy bondholders would be in a better position to get paid than pensioners. The intercept
language that was in SB 777 is also of lesser value to the pension funds since the assignment of
receipts allows the City to direct those payments before the Fund would ever be able to intercept
them. It was advised that all four pension funds meet to discuss these issues. Additionally our
legislative liaison should watch on both the federal and state level for any movement for
bankruptcy legislation. Executive Director informed the Board that the four pension fund executive
directors had met to discuss this issue and the Municipal Fund is drafting language to attempt to
lessen the impact of the new Act that they hope can move ahead in January.

income and we could expect modest to negative returns.

better position to reposition the portfolio.
