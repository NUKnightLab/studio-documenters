PURPOSAL:

IX.

Church of Our Father Baptist c/o Pastor Burnard Byles appeals the
decision of the Buildings Safety Engineering and Environmental
Department (BSEED SLU2019-00094) which (Approved with
Conditions) permission TO ADD BSEED a Specially Designated
Distributor’s (SDD) license (Carry-Out Sale of Liquor for off-premise
consumption) to an existing SDM establishment (Carry-out Sale of
Beer & Wine for off-premise consumption) in an existing 5,415 square
foot building in an B4 (General Business District).This case is appealed
because appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by
any person, firm, partnership or corporation, or by any City
department, commission, board or other City agency which is
aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any
decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department
involving Conditional Uses; Michigan courts have held that in order
to meet the “aggrieved person” standard, the appellant must prove
that he or she (or it, if the appellant is an organization) has suffered
special damages related to the beneficial use and enjoyment of
his/her own property that are not common to other property owners
similarly situated. The party filing the appeal must be more than a
mere resident of the City; he or she must be able to show harm or
damages that are unique to him or her, and to his/her property,
specifically. (Sections 50-4-102 Appeals, Michigan Case Law on
“Aggrieved Person” Standard and 50-3-381 General Approval Criteria
(Community Appeals)).AP
