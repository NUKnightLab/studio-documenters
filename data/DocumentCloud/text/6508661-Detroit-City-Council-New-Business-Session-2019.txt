SUMMARY

Each year the Board of Review is required by state law to establish a new process and
guidelines in reviewing and determining property tax exemptions by reason of poverty in
accordance with MCL 211.7u. This portion of the General Property Tax Act was created to
allow homeowners who own and occupy their real residential property as a primary
homestead the opportunity to be exempt of property taxes in whole or in part when the
property owner is unable to contribute to the public charges as long as they have met the
required guidelines established by the local governing unit and the application approved by
the Board of Review and adopted by City Council by resolution in accordance with MCL
211.7u.

 

The Board of Review remains closely engaged in the current matters faced by many
homeowners challenged with property tax delinquency and/ or at risk of foreclosure. The
Board of Review continues to aid the community in considering these challenges when
possible to help homeowners maintain ownership within the City of Detroit by providing a
connected and unified relationship with the Office of the Assessor, City of Detroit Treasury,
Wayne County Treasurer and other community based agencies and organizations in order
to assist as many homeowners as possible under law.

Therefore, we are presenting to this Honorable Body the 2020 Homeowners Property Tax
Assistance Program Guidelines and Application in accordance with MCL 211.7u.

TO: Boards of Review and Assessing Of?cers
FROM: State Tax Commission
RE: 2019 Boards of Review

This Bulletin contains information that Boards of Review need to be aware of for the 2019
assessment year. The State Tax Commission Frequently Asked Questions regarding the statutory
obligations for Boards of Review can be found on the State Tax Commission website at

amt-t - 517-335-3429

Page 2

Wednesday following the first Monday in April or 10 days following the close of the
March Board, whichever is ?rst.

0 July 16, 2019. If convened, the July Board meets on the Tuesday following the third
Monday in July, unless an alternate start date is adopted by the local unit.

I December 10, 2019. If convened, the December Board meets the Tuesday following the
second Monday in December, unless an alternate start date is adopted by the local unit.

2) Alternate Start Dates for the July or December Boards of Review:

Public Act 122 of 2008 amended MCL 211.53b to provide that July or December Boards of
Review may have an alternate start date. The act requires that the governing body of the City
or Township adopt by ordinance or resolution alternate start dates that must conform to the
following: For the July Board, an alternate date during the week of the 3rd Monday in July.
For the December Board, an alternate date during the week of the 2nd Monday in December.

3) Documentation of Board of Review Changes:

The State Tax Commission requires that all Boards of Review maintain appropriate
documentation of their decisions including; minutes, a copy of the form 4035, form 4035a
whenever the Board of Review makes a change that causes the Taxable Value to change and
a Board of Review Action Report. Form 4035 must include a detailed reason why the Board
made their determination. Assessors please note, you are n_ot required to file the Board of
Review log or Action Report with the State Tax Commission.

Minutes must include all the following items:
- Day, time and place of meetings.

0 Members present, members absent, name of elected chairperson and notation of any

review.

0 Record daily the actual hours the Board was in session, and time of daily adjournments.
Record the closing date and time of the ?nal annual session.

4) In?ation Rate used in the 2019 Capped Value Formula:

MCL 211.34d de?nes the calculation for the In?ation Rate Multiplier. The statute states in
part:

(I) "In?ation rate" means the ratio of the general price level for the state fiscal year
ending in the calendar year immediately preceding the current year divided by the

Page 3

general price level for the state ?scal year ending in the calendar year before the year
immediately preceding the current year.

Further, states "General price level" means the annual average of the 12 
values for the United States consumer price index for all urban consumers as de?ned
and officially reported by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor
statistics.

Based on this statutory requirement, the calculation for 2019 is as follows:

1. The 12 values for October 2016 through September 2017 are averaged.
2. The 12 values for October 2017 through September 2018 are averaged.
3. The ratio is calculated by dividing the average of column 2 by the average of column 1.

The specific numbers from the US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics are as
follows:

 

Oct-16 241.729 Oct?17 246.663
Nov-16 241.353 Nov-l 7 246.669
Dec? 1 6 241.432 Dec-17 246.524

Jan-17 242.839 Jan-18 247.867
Feb-l 7 243.603 Feb-l 8 248.991
Mar-l7 243.801 Mar-18 249.554
Apr-17 244.524 Apr-18 250.546
May-l7 244.733 May-18 251.588

Jun-17 244.955 Jun-l8 251.989

Jul-17 244.786 Jul-l 8 252.006

Sep-17 246.819 Sep-l8 252.439

Average 243.841 Average 249.749
Ratio 1.024

Change 2.4%

Local units cannot develop or adopt or use an in?ation rate multiplier other than 1.024
in 2019. It is not acceptable for local units to indicate to taxpayers that you do not
know how the multiplier is developed.

5) County Multipliers:

It has come to the attention of the State Tax Commission that some Boards of Review believe
it is appropriate to develop their own County Multipliers. It is not acceptable for a local unit
or Board of Review to develop County Multipliers. The multipliers developed by the State
Tax Commission must be used.

6) Quali?ed Errors:

The State Tax Commission continues to note a number of July and December Boards of
Review making changes that are not allowed by the statute. Boards of Review 

Page 4

assessors are cautioned to take great care to ensure that any changes made by the July
or December Board meet the requirements of MCL 211.53b.

MCL 211.53b provides that the July or December Boards of Review can correct "quali?ed
errors? for the current year and one prior year, unless additional years are speci?cally
addressed by the statute.

A correction under subsection (6) regarding Principal Residence Exemptions may be
made for the year in which the appeal was ?led and the three immediately preceding
years.

A correction under subsection (8) that approves a quali?ed personal property
exemption contained in MCL 2  1.90 for small business taxpayers may be made for the
year in which the appeal was ?led and the immediately preceding tax year.

The July and December Boards of Review have no nuthoritv over the Eligible
Manufacturing Personal Property Exemptions contained in MCL 211.9m and MCL 211.9n.
If an assessor misplaces or missed a timely ?led Form 5278, that is not considered a clerical
error or mutual mistake and cannot be considered by the July or December Board of Review.

Regarding MCL if the taxable value of property is adjusted and the assessor
determines that there had not been a transfer of ownership, the taxable value of the property
shall be adjusted for the current year and for the three immediately preceding calendar years.
An adjustment under this subsection shall be considered the correction of a clerical error.

Qualified Errors are de?ned in MCL 211.53b as:

- A clerical error relative to the correct assessment ?gures, the rate of taxation, or the
mathematical computation relating to the assessing of taxes

- A mutual mistake of fact.

- An adjustment under section 27a(4) taxable value or an exemption under section
7hh(3)(b)? quali?ed start-up business exemption.

a An error of measurement or calculation of the physical dimensions or components of the
real property being assessed.

I An error of omission or inclusion ofa part ofthe real property being assessed.

0 An error regarding the correct taxable status of the real property being assessed.

In An error made by the taxpayer in preparing the statement of assessable personal property
under section l9.

0 An error made in the denial of a claim of exemption for personal property under section
90.

?Clerical Errors? and ?Mutual Mistakes of Fact? are defined by the courts as follows:

Clerical Error was de?ned by the Court of Appeals in International Place Apartments 
Ypsilanti Township 216 Mich App 104; 548 668 (1996). as ?an error of a
transpositional, typographical, or mathematical nature.? July and December Boards of
Review are NOT allowed to revalue or reappraise property when the reason for the action is
that the assessor did not originally consider all relevant information.

Page 5

Mutual Mistake of Fact was de?ned by the Court of Appeals in Ford Motor Co City of
Woodhaven, 475 Mich 425; 716 247 (2006) as ?an erroneous belief, which is shared
and relied on by both parties, about a material fact that affects the substance of the
transaction.? This definition was clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court in Briggs Tax
Service, LLC Detroit Public Schools, 485 Mich 69; 780 753 (2010). The Michigan
Supreme Court indicated that to qualify, the ?mutual mistake of fact? must be one that
occurs only between the assessor and the taxpayer.

7) Disabled Veterans Exemption:

The State Tax Commission has issued significant guidance on the Disabled Veterans
Exemption. This guidance can be found on the State Tax Commission website under ?What?s
New?. Boards of Review are encouraged to review all Disabled Veterans Exemption
guidance issued by the State Tax Commission.

Boards of Review are strongly cautioned that the determination that a veteran is 100%
disabled or individually unemployable is made by the US. Department of Veterans Affairs.
Boards of Review do not have authority to make an independent determination that a veteran
is 100% disabled or individually unemployable. Conversely, Boards of Review do not have
the authority to determine a veteran is not 100% disabled or individually unemployable once
the US. Department of Veterans Affairs has issued their determination.

Disabled Veterans Exemption for Unremarried Surviving Spouse: The State Tax
Commission is aware that the Michigan Tax Tribunal in MTT Docket 16-004780, Deborah
E. Rabun City of Farmington Hills, held that a surviving spouse cannot qualify for the
exemption when the deceased disabled veteran never owned or occupied the subject property
as a homestead.

While the STC understands that is the position of the MTT, the STC does not agree or
support that determination. It was never legislative intent that the unremarried surviving
spouse be required to forever live in the original home. in fact, the STC in their original
guidance indicated that: the Disabled Veteran ?s exemption is not an exemptionfor the benefit
ofthe property. Instead, it is an exemption personal to the qtiali?/ing disabled veteran or the
unremarried surviving spouse ofthe qualified deceased disabled veteran.

Since the exemption is personal to the qualified individual the STC is advising assessors and
Boards of Review that they can and should approve exemptions for unremarried surviving
spouses that meet all other statutory requirements, regardless of if the disabled veteran ever
owned or occupied that subject property as a homestead.

8) Personal Property Tax:

On May 3, 2018 Governor Snyder signed in law P.A. 132 of 201 8. This act made changes to
the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption (MCL 211.90), speci?cally changing the filing
requirements to provide that eligible taxpayers do not have to annually file to receive the
exemption. Taxpayers who filed for the exemption in prior years still must file Form 5076,
Small Business Property Tax Exemption Claim Under MCL 211.90, in 2019 to claim the
exemption. Once granted, the assessor will then continue the exempt the personal property
until the taxpayer ?les a rescission indicating they no longer qualify for the exemption.

Page 6

Assessors can implement an audit program to determine if taxpayers still qualify for the
exemption.

As a reminder, Public Acts 261?264 of 2017 were signed into law on December 28, 2017.
These Acts made several changes that affect both the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption
and the Eligible Manufacturing Personal Property Exemption (EMPP).

P.A. 2610f 2017 changes the deadline for filing the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption to
February 20 and changed Form 5076 from an Affidavit to a Statement. This allows the
assessor to accept either a facsimile or electronic signature on Form 5076. Form 5076 has
been updated to reflect these statutory changes.

P.A. 261-264 of 2017 also changed the statute to allow assessors to accept a postmark by
February 20 for Form 5278 to claim the EMPP exemption. Form 5278 and Form 632
(Personal Property Statement) have been updated to reflect these statutory changes.

Finally. P.A. 261-264 of 2017 changed the appeal procedure for both the Small Business
Taxpayer Exemption and the EMPP exemption. Taxpayers who miss the filing deadline for
either exemption may ?le a late application directly with the March Board of Review. The
March Board of Review should grant the exemption as long as the taxpayer otherwise
qualifies for the exemption. Both the Assessors Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer
Exemption and the Assessors Guide to EMPP and ESA have been updated to re?ect these
statutory changes.

The updated Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption and Assessors Guide to
EMPP and ESA are available online at 

Further information and guidance on the Eligible Manufacturing Personal Property (EMPP)
Exemption, Special Acts and the Essential Services Assessment (ESA) is available at
Additional questions should be sent via email to


 

 

9) Poverty Exemptions:

The State Tax Commission issued Bulletin 6 of 2017 regarding Poverty Exemptions. This
Bulletin reflects updates due to recent court decisions and legislative changes. Specifically:

The Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in errero Township of Walton (Docket No. 302221)
that monies received pursuant to MCL 206.520 (homestead property tax credit) is a rebate of
property taxes and is not income for purposes of MCL 21 1.7u.

Statutory changes to allow an affidavit to be filed for all persons residing in the residence
who were not required to file federal or state income tax returns in the current year or in the
immediately preceding year. This does include the individual filing for the exemptions.

Board of Review members are encouraged to review Bulletin 6 of 2017 prior to the start of
March Board of Review meetings.

Page 7

10) Property Classi?cation and Transfer of Ownership:

Boards of Review are encouraged to review the Property Classi?cation and Transfer of
Ownership Guidelines available on the State Tax Commission website.

11) Public Act 660 of 2018:

Public Act 660 of 2018 was signed by the Governor on December 3 l, 2018. This Public Act
made several changes to the General Property Tax Act. MCL 21 l.lOd(7) was amended to
allow a village located in more than I assessing district to request State Tax Commission
approval that the assessment of property within the village be combined with the assessment
of property in of those assessing districts. Public Act 660 also amends MCL 2] 128(6) to
allow the governing bodies of 2 or more contiguous cities or townships to enter into an
agreement to appoint a single board of review to serve as the board of review for each of
those cities or townships.

The State Tax Commission will provide additional resources and guidance regarding changes
to be implemented as a result of Public Act 660 of 201 8.

12) Resources and Training:

The State Tax Commission has published a significant amount of resource information to
assist Boards of Review in carrying out their statutory responsibilities. This information can
be found on the State Tax Commission website at 
under the Board of Review Information heading.

 

The State Tax Commission recommends that all new and returning Board of Review
Members annually attend training to receive updated information related to legislative and
policy changes that have occurred during the past year.

For additional BOR resource and training information, please contact the State Tax
Commission at (517) 335-3429.

Bulletin 16 of 2018
October 22, 2018
Changes for 2019

TO: Assessing Of?cers and County Equalization Directors
FROM: State Tax Commission
SUBJECT: Procedural Changes for the 2019 Assessment Year

The purpose of this Bulletin to provide information on statutory changes or procedural changes
for the 2019 assessment year.

A. In?ation Rate Used in the 2019 Capped Value Formula

The inflation rate, expressed as a multiplier, to be used in the 2019 Capped Value Formula is
1.024.

The 2019 Capped Value Formula is as follows:

2019 CAPPED VALUE (2018 Taxable Value LOSSES) 1.024 ADDITIONS

The formula above does not include 1.05 because the in?ation rate multiplier of 1.024 is
lower than 1.05.

B. Federal Poverty Guidelines Used in the Determination of Poverty
Exemptions for 2019

MCL 211.7u, which deals with poverty exemptions, was significantly altered by PA 390 of
1994 and was further amended by PA 620 of 2002.

Local governing bodies are required to adopt guidelines that set income levels for their
poverty exemption guidelines and those income levels shall not be set lower by a city or
township than the federal poverty guidelines updated annually by the US. Department of
Health and Human Services. This means, for example, that the income level for a household
of3 persons shall not be set lower than $20,780 which is the amount shown on the following
chart for a family of 3 persons. The income level for a family of3 persons may be set higher
than $20,780. Following are the federal poverty guidelines for use in setting poverty
exemption guidelines for 2019 assessments:

Size of Family Unit Poverty Guidelines
1 $12,140

2 $16,460

3 $20,780

4 $25,100

5 $29,420

6 $33,740

7 $38,060

8 $42380

For each additional person $4,320

 

 

Note: PA 390 of 1994 states that the poverty exemption guidelines established by the
governing body of the local assessing unit mu also include an asset level test. An asset test
means the amount of cash, ?xed assets or other property that could be used, or converted to
cash for use in the payment of property taxes. The asset test should calculate a maximum
amount permitted and all other assets above that amount should be considered as available.
Please see STC Bulletin 6 of 2017 for more information on poverty exemptions.

Note: PA. 135 of 2012 changed the requirements for ?ling documentation in support of a
poverty exemption to allow an af?davit (Treasury Form 4988) to be ?led for all persons
residing in the residence who were not required to ?le federal or state income tax returns in
the current year or in the immediately preceding year. This does include the owner of the
property who is ?ling for the exemption.

Multipliers for the Valuation of Free-Standing Communication Towers

The State Tax Commission recommends that, subject to the quali?cations stated below,
communication towers should be valued for the 2019 assessment year using the table of
historical (original cost when the tower was new) cost valuation multipliers set forth in the
multiplier table below. These multipliers have been developed in a manner such that they
account for the typical depreciation which is expected for a tower of the indicated age and
also account for changes in the cost of the tower and erecting it that have occurred since the
time the tower was constructed. On this basis, the multiplier table which is shown below is
intended to predict the current true cash value of a tower of the vintage year in which the
tower was constructed. An important component in determining the current value ofa tower
built in a given year is the change in the cost of materials, particularly changes in the cost of
steel, between the time of construction and the current tax day. Since the table considers both
depreciation and changes in construction costs, and since changes in construction cost have
not always occurred at a constant rate, the multiplier table does not always evidence a decline
in the rate by which the historical cost must be adjusted in order to determine current value.
This effect is expected and can be better understood if one remembers that the multiplier
table is not a depreciation table and the multipliers are applied to the historic cost of
construction, not to the current replacement cost.

Communication towers are real property. When a communication tower is built on land
owned by the owner of the tower, the tower is valued and assessed as a real property
improvement to the land on which it is located. When a communication tower is built on
leased land, the owner is required to report the original construction cost of the tower on
Section of its personal property statement, in the same way that it would report any other
structure on leased land. Although the construction costs are reported on the personal

Page 3

property statement, a tower on leased land is not assessed on the personal property
assessment roll. Instead, the assessor is required to establish a separate real property
assessment for a tower located on leased land, using the procedures set forth in State Tax
Commission Bulletin 8 of 2002 and State Tax Commission Bulletin 1 of 2003.

Please note: Sometimes communication towers are located on land that is exempt because the
land is owned by an exempt entity such as a municipality or is otherwise exempt. When this
occurs, the tower must be assessed to the tower owner on the real property roll as a structure
on leased land. IN ADDITION, the assessor must also consider whether the land should also
be assessed to the tower owner as provided by MCL 21 1.18] .

There may be situations where the value ofa particular freestanding communication tower is
more or less than the ?gure developed by using this table. This could be due to unusual
depreciation (physical deterioration and/or obsolescence) or an unusual enhancement in value
caused by supply and demand factors in a particular area.

Property Commzmication Towers (Form 3594) is to be used for reporting the
costs of freestanding communication towers. This form was developed for the specific
purpose of gathering construction cost information for communication towers. The assessor
may use this form to gather detailed information regarding the construction costs of
communication towers. This cost information can then be used as a basis for valuation by
multiplying the historic cost by the appropriate multiplier from the table located below.

Please note the following:

The preferred method for valuing freestanding communication towers is using
original cost new multiplied by the appropriate multiplier from the following table.

0 In some cases historical/original cost may be unobtainable. Those cases may require
using the Assessor?s Manual cost new multiplied by the Assessor?s Manual
depreciation table multiplier.

a Do not apply the Assessor?s Manual depreciation table multipliers to the
historical/original cost of a tower.

- Do not apply the communication tower multipliers from the following table to the
Manual cost new ofa tower.

Form 3594 is a real property statement and, as such, the taxpayer is not required to complete
and submit the form to the assessor unless the taxpayer is specifically asked to do so. If a
communication tower is located on leased land, the owner should already be reporting its
original acquisition costs on Section of the personal property statement (Form 632 (L-
4175)). If so, the assessor would only need to send Form 3594 if more detailed information
regarding costs is needed. The assessor IS NOT REQUIRED TO SEND Form 3594 to tower
owners each year. The following table applies to both guyed and self-supporting
communication towers.

D. Sales Studies

Equalization study dates are as follows for 2019 equalization:

Two Year Study: April 1, two years prior through March 31, current year
Single Year Study: October 1, preceding year through September 30, current year

For 2018 studies for 2019 equalization the dates are as follows:

Two Year Study: April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2018
Single Year Study: October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018

Note that the time period revisions apply to all equalization studies, that is: sales ratio
studies, land value studies and economic condition factor studies for appraisals. Also note
that the revised time period for two year studies applies to all real property classifications.

Please be advised that the above sale study dates are not the same as the valuation date used
in appeals before the Michigan Tax Tribunal. Evidence presented in a Tax Tribunal appeal
should re?ect the value of the property as of tax day (December 31). This means that sales

Page 5

occurring after March 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 should still be considered and
included when submitting evidence in a Tax Tribunal appeal involving the 2019 tax year.

E. Property Classi?cation
The State Tax Commission reminds assessors that classification is to be determined annually
and is based upon the use of the property and not highest and best use of the property. The
Commission is aware that some assessors are still classifying property according to highest
and best use and/or are not classifying property on an annual basis. The Commission asks
that all assessors take the necessary steps to ensure that all real and personal property is
properly classi?ed according to MCL 21 1.340.

F. Updated Assessors Manual

The State Tax Commission at their February 14, 2017 adopted the new Assessors Manuals
and approved their required use for the 2019 year. While the printed manual did not change
from prior versions of the manual, the way CAMA software providers obtain the updated
costs in the manual did change. This has caused some confusion regarding some items in the
manual including the County Multiplier. The State Tax Commission will continue to
annually receive from Marshall Swift and annually approve County Multipliers. Because of
the electronic connection to the manual, those multipliers are included in the costs the CAMA
providers electronically retrieve. Therefore, assessors will no longer be required to add a
separate County Multiplier.

Staff continue to work with Marshall Swift and CAMA software providers on issues related
to tracking of costs between the printed and electronic manual. Updates will be provided via
listserv once a final solution is reached.

G. Updated Recommended Classi?cation Codes

At the February 13, 2018 State Tax Commission meeting, the Commission adopted CAMA
Data Standards, which included updated property classification codes. As a result of the
Commission?s prior action, the State Tax Commission at their meeting on April 9, 2018
rescinded the State Tax Commission Recommended Classification Codes adopted on April
21, 2011 and approved for use by assessors revised Recommended Classification Codes.
The updated State Tax Commission Recommended Classification Codes are available online
at 

 

H. Tax Tribunal Small Claims Division Hearings

Assessors should carefully read all notices, orders and other correspondence sent by the Tax
Tribunal. Assessors should pay special attention to the Notice of Hearing and ensure they are
available at the date and time of the scheduled hearing. It is important to appear at the
hearing and to timely file with the Tax Tribunal and serve a copy to the taxpayer of all
evidence and documentation you wish to be considered at the hearing.

Assessors representing their local unit in Tax Tribunal hearings need to submit evidence to
support the value of the property under appeal. If the assessor is relying on the property
record card as evidence of value, the property record card must be for the year(s) being
appealed. The complete property record card, including all calculations should be provided;
do not submit a property record card that states ?calculations too long? and then fail to

Page 6

include the additional calculations. Also, it is important to submit the studies prepared that
support the economic condition factor and land value on the record card. Assessors should
also be able to explain at the Tax Tribunal hearing how the value shown on the property
record card was calculated. More information regarding the Michigan Tax Tribunal,
including Tribunal Rules, forms and instructions is available at mniicliiunnem- ?umrih.

1. Changes to Personal Property Tax

On May 3, 2018 Governor Snyder signed This act made changes to
the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption (MCL 211.90), specifically changing the filing
requirements to provide that eligible taxpayers do not have to annually file to receive the
exemption. Taxpayers who ?led for the exemption in prior years still must file Form 5076,
Small Business Property Tax Exemption Claim Under ll/[CL 211.90, in 2019 to claim the
exemption. Once granted, the assessor will then continue the exempt the personal property
until the taxpayer files a rescission indicating they no longer qualify for the exemption.
Assessors can implement an audit program to determine if taxpayers still qualify for the
exemption.

As a reminder, Public Acts 261-264 of 2017 were signed into law on December 28, 2017.
These Acts made several changes that affect both the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption
and the Eligible Manufacturing Personal Property Exemption (EMPP).

P.A. 2610f 2017 changes the deadline for filing the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption to
February 20 and changed Form 5076 from an Affidavit to a Statement. This allows the
assessor to accept either a facsimile or electronic signature on Form 5076. Form 5076 has
been updated to reflect these statutory changes.

P.A. 261-264 of 2017 also changed the statute to allow assessors to accept a postmark by
February 20 for Form 5278 to claim the EMPP exemption. Form 5278 and Form 632
(Personal Property Statement) have been updated to reflect these statutory changes.

Finally, P.A. 261-264 of 2017 changed the appeal procedure for both the Small Business
Taxpayer Exemption and the EMPP exemption. Taxpayers who miss the filing deadline for
either exemption may file a late application directly with the March Board of Review. The
March Board of Review should grant the exemption as long as the taxpayer otherwise
qualifies for the exemption. Both the Assessors Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer
Exemption and the Assessors Guide to EMPP and ESA have been updated to re?ect these
statutory changes.

The updated Guide to the Small Business Taxpayer Exemption and Assessors Guide to
EMPP and ESA are available online at .-'nrimuri\

Exemption, Special Acts and the Essential Services Assessment (ESA) is available at

J. Principal Residence Exemption

Public Act 133 of 2018 was signed into law on May 3, 2018. The Act amended the General
Property Tax Act to remove a requirement that a property must be unoccupied in order for an
individual who resides in a nursing home or assisted living facility to continue to claim a
principal residence exemption (PRE) on the property. It also allows the exemption to
continue for a situation in which the individual is residing in ?any other location,? as long as
the individual is residing there solely for purposes of convalescence. Convalescence is a state
of recovering from a disease, operation, or injury. A convalescent is a person in that state. A
convalescent may choose to be cared for at home or a relative?s home rather than in a nursing
home or assisted living center. For example, a person who has just had a stroke and who is
recovering and rehabilitating at a relative?s home is an example ofa convalescent.

More information can be found on the PRE website at Treasury

K. Omitted or Incorrectly Reported Property (MCL 211.154)

The State Tax Commission at their meeting on November 28, 2017 approved revised
Omitted or Incorrectly Reported Property MCL 21 1.154 Forms. The prior form versions will
no longer be accepted. Please be advised ifthe old forms are submitted, they will be returned
and will need to be resubmitted.

L. Residential Solar Panels

The State Tax Commission at their meeting on February 13, 2018 rescinded their prior
guidance on the treatment of solar panels on residential real properties and determined that
solar panels on a parcel classified as residential real property shall be assessed as a
component of the real property. Assessors are advised to review and utilize the New
Assessors Manual to cost residential solar panels as a component of the residential real
property improvements. This determination is limited to solar panels on real property
classified under MCL 211.34c as residential real property only. The staff memorandum to
the State Tax Commission is available online at 3w. .michiuniggu 

M. Authority of July and December Boards of Review

The State Tax Commission has become aware of a significant number of instances where
Boards of Review are acting outside their statutory authorities. MCL 21 1.53b speci?es: The
board of review meeting in July and December shall meet only for the purpose described in
subsection (1) (Quali?ed Errors) and to hear appeals provided for in sections 7u (Poverty
Exemption), 7cc (Principal Residence Exemption), 7ee (Qualified Agricultural Exemption),
7jj (Qualified Forest Exemption), and 90 (Small Business Taxpayer Exemption).

Assessors should carefully review the Board of Review FAQ on the Commission?s website
to ensure their Boards of Review are acting within their statutory authorities.

STATE OF MICHIGAN

RICK SNYDER DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY NICK A. KHOURI
GOVERNOR LANSING STATE TREASURER
Bulletin 6 of 2017
June 6, 2017
Poverty Exemption
TO: Assessors and Equalization Directors
FROM: State Tax Commission

SUBJECT: Exemption of Principal Residence by Reason of Poverty
Bulletin 5 of 1995, Bulletin 7 of 2010 and Bulletin 5 of 2012 are rescinded.

MCL 21 l.7u provides for a property tax exemption, in whole or part, for the principal residence
of persons who, by reason of poverty, are unable to contribute to the public charges. Principal
residence is defined in MCL 211.7dd as a principal residence or quali?ed agricultural property.
MCL 21 I .7u(1) states that this section does not apply to property of a corporation. Even if a
corporation or a limited liability company meets the definition of a principal residence or a
qualified agricultural property, it is not be eligible to receive a poverty exemption.

Local Unit Responsibilities:

MCL 211.7u requires local units to annually adopt a policy, including an asset test, used to
approve or deny poverty exemptions.

First, local units must annually adopt guidelines which specify the total household income which
will be used to approve or deny poverty exemptions. Statute requires that the income levels shall
not be set lower than the federal poverty guidelines updated annually by the US. Department of
Health and Human Services and published by the State Tax Commission in their annual
Procedural Changes Bulletin.

According to the US Census Bureau, ?income? includes, but is not limited to:

Money, wages, salaries before deductions, regular contributions from persons not living
in the residence

0 Net receipts from non-farm or farm self-employment (receipts from a person?s own
business, professional enterprise, or partnership, after business expense deductions)

- Regular payments from social security, railroad retirement, unemployment, worker?s
compensation, veteran?s payments, public assistance, supplemental security income (881)

I Alimony, child support, military family allotments

- Private and governmental retirement and disability pensions, regular insurance, annuity
payments

PO BOX 30471 . LANSING, MICHIGAN 48909-7971
. (517) 335-3429

Bulletin 6 of 2017
Page 2

0 College or university scholarships, grants, fellowships, assistantships
- Dividends, interest, and net income from rentals, royalties, estates, trusts, gambling or
lottery winnings

Second, the local unit policy must include an asset test. The purpose of an asset test is to
determine the resources available: cash, ?xed assets or other property that could be converted to
cash and used to pay property taxes in the year the poverty exemption is filed. The local unit
should require that claimants provide a list of all assets when applying for a poverty exemption.
Following is a list of assets that may be included in the annual guidelines.

A second home, land, vehicles

Recreational vehicles such as campers, motor-homes, boats and 

Buildings other than the residence

Jewelry, antiques, artworks

0 Equipment, other personal property of value

0 Bank accounts (over a specified amount), stocks

0 Money received from the sale of property, such as, stocks, bonds, a house or car (unless a
person is in the speci?c business of selling such property)

Ir Withdrawals of bank deposits and borrowed money

9 Gifts, loans, lump?sum inheritances and one-time insurance payments

- Food or housing received in lieu of wages and the value of food and fuel produced and
consumed on farms

0 Federal non-cash bene?ts programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and school

lunches

The Michigan Tax Tribunal in Robert Taylor Sherman wp., Docket No. 236230 ruled that the
asset test does not include the value ofthe principal residence. Additionally, the Michigan Court
of Appeals in errero Township of Walton, No. 302221, ruled that the homestead property tax
credit is not to be considered income for poverty exemption purposes.

The local unit policy may provide for an applicant to own possessions in addition to the principal
residence and still receive a poverty exemption. Examples may include, but are not limited to:

- Additional vehicles

- More land than a minimum ?footprint? for the home

0 Equipment or other personal property of value, including recreational vehicles (campers,
motor homes, boats, etc.)

0 Bank account(s) (a maximum amount should be specified)

Third, MCL 211.7u(l) allows for partial poverty exemptions to be granted. A partial poverty
exemption is an exemption of a percentage of the taxable value of the principal residence rather
than the entire taxable value. The local unit can limit poverty exemptions to partial exemptions
or to minimum or maximum exemption of their choosing. The State Tax Commission
recommends that local governing bodies include within their annual guidelines, language and
criteria for granting partial exemptions and/or minimum or maximum exemptions.

Bulletin 6 0f2017
Page 3

Finally, the State Tax Commission recommends that local units develop an application to be
used by claimants and a 1written policy that details the process. To assist local governing bodies,
the State Tax Commission has developed a sample application and resolution. See attached.

Taxpayer Filing Requirements:

In order to receive a poverty exemption, a taxpayer must annually file a completed application
form and all required additional documentation, with the supervisor, assessor, or the Board of
Review where the property is located. The application form may be obtained from the local unit
where the property is located and may be submitted on or after January 1 but before the day prior
to the last day of the December Board of Review during the year in which the exemption is
requested.

To ensure an application is received in time to be heard by a Board of Review, the State Tax
Commission recommends the claimant contact the local governing unit directly to verify
deadline dates for submission of an application.

In addition to annually ?ling the application, in order to be eligible for the poverty exemption, a
taxpayer must do all of the following:

1. Own and occupy the principal residence.

2. Provide federal and state income tax returns for the current or immediately preceding
year, including any property tax credits, for all persons residing in the principal
residence (disclosure of the income of an owner who is not residing in the principal
residence is not required). An alternative affidavit may be filed for all persons
residing in the residence who were not required to file federal or state income tax
returns in the current or immediately preceding year. (See Form 4988, Poverty
Exemption A?davz?t)

3. Produce a valid driver?s license, or other form of identification, if requested by the
supervisor, assessor or Board of Review.

4. Produce a deed, land contract, or other evidence of ownership of the property, if
requested by the supervisor, assessor or Board of Review.

5. Meet the federal poverty income guidelines determined annually by the US.
Department of Health and Human Services OR meet allowable alternative income
guidelines adopted by the local governing body.

6. Meet the asset level test adopted by the local governing body.

7. Meet additional tests reasonably adopted by the local governing body.

Bulletin 6 of 2017
Page 4

Board of Review Responsibilities:

MCL 211.7u(1) indicates: The principal residence of persons who, in the judgment of the
supervisor and board of review, by reason of poverty, are unable to contribute to the public
charges is eligible for exemption in whole or part from taxation under this act.

The State Tax Commission has determined that the supervisor shall make a recommendation
regarding the claimant?s petition and the Board of Review shall consider, review and then
approve or deny the exemption request.

Additionally, MCL 211.7u(5) states, in part: The Board of Review shall follow the policy and
guidelines ofthe local assessing unit in granting or denying an exemption under this section.

When reviewing an application, the Board of Review should consider all information available to
them at that time. They should consider all documentation originally submitted by the taxpayer
and any additional relevant information that is available to the Board of Review.

The Board of Review can deviate from the adopted policy and guidelines of the local unit gn_ly
when there are ?substantial and compelling reasons why there should be a deviation from the
policy and guidelines.? If the Board of Review deviates from the adopted policy and guidelines,
they are required by statute to communicate the substantial and compelling reasons for the
deviation from the guidelines in writing to the taxpayer.

Appeal Rights:

A property owner or assessor may appeal a decision of the March Board of Review by
completing and submitting a petition to the Michigan Tax Tribunal no later than July 31 of the
same year. A property owner or assessor may appeal a decision of the July or December Board
of Review by completing and submitting a petition to the Michigan Tax Tribunal within 35 days
ofthe July or December Board of Review?s denial of the poverty exemption.

An application for poverty exemption, for a speci?c principal residence, may only be acted upon
by the Board of Review once a year. If an application is denied at the March Board of Review, it
may not be reheard by the July or December Board of Review during the same calendar year.
The taxpayer must ?le an appeal of the March Board of Review determination to the Michigan
Tax Tribunal. Similarly, if an application is denied at the July Board of Review, the December
Board cannot rehear that application, the taxpayer must ?le an appeal to the Michigan Tax
Tribunal.

A person who files a claim for poverty exemption is not prohibited from also appealing the
assessment on the same property in the same year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

Section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act COBRA) of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 9902
requires
the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to update the poverty guidelines at least
annually, adjusting them on the basis of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The
poverty guidelines are used as an eligibility criterion by Medicaid and a number of other Federal programs.
The poverty guidelines issued here are a simpli?ed version of the poverty thresholds that the Census Bureau

uses to prepare its estimates of the number of individuals and families in poverty.

As required by law, this update is accomplished by increasing the latest published Census Bureau poverty
thresholds by the relevant percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).
The guidelines in this 2019 notice re?ect the 2.4 percent price increase between calendar years 2017 and
2018. After this in?ation adjustment, the guidelines are rounded and adjusted to standardize the differences
between family sizes. In rare circumstances, the rounding and standardizing adjustments in the formula
result in small decreases in the poverty guidelines for some household sizes even when the in?ation factor is
not negative. In cases Where the year-to-year change in in?ation is not negative and the rounding and
standardizing adjustments in the formula result in reductions to the guidelines from the previous year for
some household sizes, the guidelines for the affected household sizes are ?xed at the prior year's guidelines.
As in prior years, these 2019 guidelines are roughly equal to the poverty thresholds for calendar year 2018

which the Census Bureau expects to publish in ?nal form in September 2019.

The poverty guidelines continue to be derived from the Census Bureau's current of?cial poverty thresholds;

they are not derived from the Census Bureau's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM).

The following guideline ?gures represent annual income.

Separate poverty guideline ?gures for Alaska and Hawaii re?ect Of?ce of Economic Opportunity
administrative practice beginning in the 1966-1970 period. (Note that the Census Bureau poverty
thresholds?the version of the poverty measure used for statistical purposes?have never had separate ?gures
for Alaska and Hawaii.) The poverty guidelines are not de?ned for Puerto Rice or other outlying
jurisdictions. In cases in which a Federal program using the poverty guidelines serves any of those
jurisdictions, the Federal of?ce that administers the program is generally responsible for deciding whether to

use the contiguous-states-and?DC guidelines for those jurisdictions or to follow some other procedure.

Due to confusing legislative language dating back to 1972, the poverty guidelines sometimes have been
mistakenly referred to as the (Office of Management and Budget) poverty guidelines or poverty line.
In fact, OMB has never issued the guidelines; the guidelines are issued each year by the Department of
Health and Human Services. The poverty guidelines may be formally referenced as "the poverty guidelines
updated periodically in the Federal Register by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under
the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902 


Some federal programs use a percentage multiple of the guidelines (for example, 125 percent or 185 percent
of the guidelines), as noted in relevant authorizing legislation or program regulations. Non-Federal
organizations that use the poverty guidelines under their own authority in non-Federally-funded activities

also may choose to use a percentage multiple of the guidelines.

The poverty guidelines do not make a distinction between farm and non-farm families, or between aged and
non-aged units. (Only the Census Bureau poverty thresholds have separate ?gures for aged and non?aged

one-person and two-person units.)

Note that this notice does not provide de?nitions of such terms as ?income? or ?family,? because there is
considerable variation in de?ning these terms among the different programs that use the guidelines. These
variations are traceable to the different laws and regulations that govern the various programs. This means
that questions such as ?Is income counted before or after taxes??, ?Should a particular type of income be
counted??, and ?Should a particular person be counted as a member of the family/household?" are actually
questions about how a specific program applies the poverty guidelines. All such questions about how a
speci?c program applies the guidelines should be directed to the entity that administers or funds the
program, since that entity has the responsibility for de?ning such terms as ?income" or "family," to the extent

that these terms are not already de?ned for the program in legislation or regulations.
Alex M. Azar,

Secretary of Health and Human Services.

guidelines shall include but not be limited to the speci?c income and asset levels of the claimant and total
household income and assets.

(5) The board of review shall follow the policy and guidelines of the local assessing unit in granting or
denying an exemption under this section unless the board of review determines there are substantial and
compelling reasons why there should be a deviation from the policy and guidelines and the substantial and
compelling reasons are communicated in writing to the claimant.

(6) A person who ?les a claim under this section is not prohibited from also appealing the assessment on
the property for which that claim is made before the board of review in the same year.

(7) As used in this section, "principal residence? means principal residence or qualified agricultural
property as those terms are de?ned in section 7dd.

I am requesting responses to my questions regarding the proposed demolition bond initiative.
After reviewing the LPD report I want to ensure I have an understanding of the issues as
identi?ed. Please review and respond to the list of questions and requests below.

1. Please solidify the bond number at $225m or $250m. The mixing of numbers is confusing
to the public and leads to distrust.

2. Please prepare a diagram that illustrates the stress test results on the ?nal bond offering
scenario selected by the administration.

3. Please respond to the recommendation that all demolition activities be located and managed
by one of?ce for ef?ciency purposes. Does the administration plan to implement this
recommendation?

4. Please detail how the administration plans to comply with a_ll IRS regulations around the
tax exempt status of the bonds. I.e. Who will be responsible for the compliance, where will the
records be held, how will this compliance process be carried out over the 30 years of the bonds,
which departments will be involved in compliance, etc?

5. The LPD report indicates every parcel which receives an investment of blight bonds will
have to be tracked for compliance purposes. Is this an accurate portrayal of the level of
monitoring required for these bonds to comply with IRS tax exempt regulations?

6. Please describe a worst case scenario, where the City cannot maintain compliance with the
blight bonds and the IRS removes the tax exempt status. How would this situation impact the:

a. Detroit taxpayers

b. City of Detroit

c. Purchasers of the bonds

7. After 2025 the administration indicates the City should experience the need for 100-200
demolitions per year. Justify this estimate?

8. The LPD report provides a narrative of how the City?s debt policy is impacted by the bond
proposal and debt affordability. A series of metrics/ratios is indicated as the measurements to
verify if the bonds comply with our debt policy. Please prepare info graphics to illustrate visually
how these metrics/ratios are calculated, so the layperson can understand how they work. Ex.
1.85X is indicated as a reasonable ratio on page 14 of the LPD report.

Please provide your responses by 23 Oct 2019. If you have any questions do not hesitate to
