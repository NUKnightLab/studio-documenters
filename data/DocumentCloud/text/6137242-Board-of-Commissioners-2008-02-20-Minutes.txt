the State is not a retailer within the meaning of this article. A person who is engaged in the business of

Except as provided in Section 74-273, every user of tangible personal property which is
purchased at retail on or after December 1, 1995, from a retailer and which is titled or registered at a
location within the corporate limits of the County with an agency of the State government, shall be liable
for a tax on the privilege of using such property in the County at the rate of three-quarter one percent
(1%) of such property's selling price (as the term "selling price" is defined by 35 ILCS 105/2 (use
defined). The tax imposed by this article and the obligation to pay the same is upon the user. The tax
imposed by this article shall be collected from the purchaser by the tax collector as defined by Section 74271, and remitted to the Department as provided in this article. The tax collector shall be liable to the
County for the amount of tax that it is required to collect. Retailers shall collect the tax from the users by
adding the tax to the selling price of tangible personal property when sold for use in the County, in the
manner prescribed by this article and the Department. The tax imposed by this article shall, when

property. The tax hereby imposed and not paid to a retailer pursuant to this section shall be paid to the
Department directly by any person using such property within the County pursuant to Section 74-277. If
any retailer, in collecting the amount which purports to constitute use taxes measured by receipts from

such retailer. However, if such amount is not refunded to the purchaser for any reason, the retailer is
liable to pay such amount to the Department.
(b)

personal property for use in the County shall, when collecting the tax as provided in Section 74-272 from

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, uses of tangible personal property, as defined
in Section 74-271, which are exempt under the applicable provisions of 55 ILCS 5/5-1008 (home rule

this article.
Sec. 74-274.

Retailer registration; security.

Every retailer maintaining a place of business in the County shall apply for registration as
a tax collector with the Department no later than 30 days after commencing such business or 30 days after
the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, whichever occurs later. Application

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008

The Department may require an applicant for registration to furnish, within 30 days after
commencing to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, a bond from a surety
company authorized to do business in the State, or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or
certificate of deposit, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the County all moneys becoming due
under this article. The Department shall fix the amount of any such security in each case, taking into
consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The
amount of any security required by the Department shall be as such as, in the Department's opinion, will
protect the County against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this
article. The amount of any security required by the Department shall not exceed three times the amount of
the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remittance liability or $50,000.00, whichever amount is
lower. A retailer that fails to furnish security required by the Department in accordance with this section
shall not be permitted to register as a tax collector.
(c)
A tax collector which has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and continuously
complied with the conditions of its bond or other security under the provisions of this article for a period
of three consecutive years, shall be entitled to a release of the bond or other security and shall be exempt
from all requirements of furnishing a bond or other security as a condition precedent to registration under
this article. Such exemption shall continue until such time as the Department shall determine that the tax
collector is delinquent in the filing of any return or is delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax
under this article.
(d)
With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the Department may sue in the
event of a forfeiture), if a tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security
guarantees, the Department shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the
Department through issuance of a final assessment that has become final under the law, convert or cause
to be converted the security which the tax collector has furnished, into money for the County after first
giving the tax collector ten-days' written notice by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or
forfeit such security to the Department. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the
Department shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank
certificate of deposit from the bank which issued the certificate. If the Department realizes more than the
amount of such liability from the security, plus the expenses incurred by the Department in converting the
security into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such
security, and the balances thereby received on behalf of the County shall be paid into the corporate fund
of the County.
(e)
A retailer maintaining a place of business in the County who fails to register as required
in this article shall be guilty of violating this article and shall be fined $1,000.00 for each offense. Each

preceding calendar month with the Department. Except as otherwise provided in this article, taxes
reported as collected and payable to the County shall be remitted to the County at the time a return is
filed. Such returns shall be in a form determined by the Department and should state such reasonable
information as the Department may require. Where the same person has more than one business registered
with the Department under separate registrations under this article, such person shall be required to file
separate returns for each such registered business.

5156

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
(b)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article concerning the time within which a
retailer may file the retailer's return, in the case of a retailer who ceases to engage in a kind of business
which makes the retailer responsible for filing returns under this article, such retailer shall file a final
return under this article with the Department not later than one calendar month after making the last sale
at retail. All taxes due to be paid to the County shall be remitted to the County at the time the final return
is filed with the Department.
(c)
Except as provided in this section, the retailer filing the return shall pay the Department
the amount of tax imposed by this article, less a discount of two percent of the tax collected, which is
allowed to reimburse the seller for the expenses incurred in collecting the tax, keeping records, preparing
and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department. However, the discount herein
provided shall not be allowed for any taxes not paid when due. All such discounts shall be credited
against the tax collector's liabilities under this article. Refunds to purchasers made by the retailer during
any return period shall be allowed as a credit on the next period return filed, but only if the retailer
included the receipts from such sale in a return filed and remitted the tax imposed by this article with
respect to such receipts.
(d)
The Director may require any tax collector to prepare and file an annual information
return on the form prescribed by the Department, within 15 days after the tax collector files its annual
income tax return with the State for such fiscal year. Such annual return to the Department shall include a
statement of receipts as shown on the retailer's State income tax return. If the total receipts of the business
as reported in the State income tax return do not agree with the receipts reported to the Department for the
same period, the retailer shall attach to its annual return a schedule showing a reconciliation of the two
amounts and state reasons for the differences. The retailer's annual return to the Department shall also
disclose such additional reasonable information as the Department shall require to enable the Department
to determine the accuracy of any periodic return filed by such retailer as provided by this section.
(e)
Where the tax collector is a corporation, all returns filed on behalf of such corporation
shall be signed by the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer or by the properly accredited agent
of such corporation, the chief executive officer or the highest ranking manager of such corporation. All
returns required to be filed by this section shall be signed by, and the accuracy of the return certified by
the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, chief executive officer, owner of the highest ranking
manager of the tax collector. Failure to file a return as herein required shall be in violation of this article
and shall subject the tax collector to a fine of $1,000.00 for each violation. Any person who files a return
with false or misleading information or signs or certifies such return, shall be guilty of violating this
article and shall be subject to a fine of $1,000.00 for each such violation. The return form prescribed by
the Department shall include a statement that any person signing such return may be subject to the
penalties provided in this article.
(f)
Any retailer filing a return under this section shall also report, for the purpose of paying
taxes due thereon, the total tax, if any, imposed upon it for the use of tangible personal property
purchased by it for its own use, where such tax was not otherwise collected by the selling retailer. Such
filing retailer shall remit the tax to the Department when filing such return.
Sec. 74-276.

Resellers of tangible personal property.

(a)
If a purchaser is not registered with the Department as a tax collector, but claims to be a
reseller of tangible personal property in such a way that the purchaser's use is not taxable under this
article, such purchaser shall apply to the Department for a County resale number. Such applicant shall
state facts which demonstrate to the Department why the applicant is not liable for tax under this article
and shall furnish such additional information as the Department may reasonably require.

5157

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
(b)
Upon approval of the application, the Department shall assign a resale number to the

which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to make a use tax-free purchase when the
purchaser in fact is not a purchaser for resale, or where the purchaser has discontinued making resales of

retailer that any use by such purchaser is nontaxable because of the retailer's sale being a sale for resale.
Sec. 74-277.

Purchaser paying tax directly to department.

(a)
When tangible personal property is purchased from a retailer for use in the County by a
purchaser or user subject to the tax imposed by this article, and who did not pay the tax imposed by this
article to the retailer, and who did not file returns with the Department as a retailer under Section 74-275,

shall, by the last day of the calendar month in which such property reverts to the use of such lessor, file a
return with the Department and pay the tax imposed by this article upon the fair market value of such
property on the date of reversion.
(c)
When a purchaser or user pays the tax imposed by this article directly to the Department,
the Department shall issue an appropriate receipt to such purchaser or user showing that the tax has been
paid to the Department. Such receipt shall be sufficient to relieve the purchaser or user from further
liability for the tax to which the receipt may refer.

occasionally and not on a frequent recurring basis, and who is not required to file returns with the

provisions concerning the requirements of registrants to post bond or other security with the Department
shall apply to such purchasers or users; except that such a purchaser or user shall not be entitled to the two
percent discount provided in Section 74-275 on any remittance, when such purchaser or user could have
paid the tax to the retail seller of the property who was a registered tax collector for the County, instead of
remitting the use tax directly to the Department.
Sec. 74-278.

Interest and penalties.

(a)
In case any person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail
subject to or required to collect the tax imposed by this article fails to file a return, the Department shall
determine the amount of tax due from such person according to the Department's best judgment and
information, which amount so fixed by the Department shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima
facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown in such determination. Proof of such
determination by the Department may be made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal
proceeding, by a reproduced copy of the Department's record relating thereto, in the name of the
Department under certificate of the Director. Such reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be
admitted into evidence before the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie proof of
the correctness of the amount of tax due as shown therein.

Commissioner Silvestri requested that the following letter be made a part of the record.
LETTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated February 20, 2008 from
PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioner and
Chairman, Litigation Subcommittee
This letter is to advise you of a recommendation of the Litigation Subcommittee to repeal the
Cook County Displaced Building Service Workers Protection Ordinance.

5170

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
Pursuant to a recommendation of the United States District Court, the subcommittee was asked to
consider modification or repeal of the ordinance. The majority of the subcommittee voted to
recommend repeal, upon analysis by the State’s Attorney’s office that modification would be so
extensive as to basically make the ordinance ineffective.
The Court has ordered that the State’s Attorney’s office inform the Court of the Board’s decision
tomorrow, February 21, 2008. Therefore, we must act on this issue today.
_________________________
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved that the Repealing Ordinance be
approved and adopted. The motion carried.
Commissioners Maldonado, Moreno and Sims voted “no”.

Co-sponsored by
JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY and PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII Section 6(a)
of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and perform any function
pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has the responsibility of funding public safety; and
WHEREAS, over the past several years there has been dwindling revenue which has resulted in drastic
cuts in the operational budget for public safety and a Federal Consent Decree mandating new hires within
the Department of Corrections make it essential that we seek new revenue enhancements and the
restructuring and consolidation of services; and
WHEREAS, currently foreclosure proceedings are under the jurisdiction of the Chancery Division of the
Circuit Court of Cook County and the sale of such property is conducted by four main private vendors but
could be done by the Sheriff, as in DuPage County, with a net savings of approximately ten million
dollars annually at no cost to the Sheriff’s Office.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County Board of
Commissioners call upon the Circuit Court of Cook County to transfer foreclosure sale services to the
Cook County Sheriff and that the cost saving be used for the Fiscal Year 2008 public safety budget.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CONSOLIDATING VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS
UNDER CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
WHEREAS, Cook County is faced with a historic structural deficit for fiscal year 2008 and beyond; and
WHEREAS, regardless of whether the Board of Commissioners increases any revenues, the County
needs to streamline its operations as much as possible; and
WHEREAS, traditionally offices, such as, the Assessor, Board of Review, Chief Judge, County Clerk,
Clerk of the Court, Public Administrator, Recorder, Sheriff, State’s Attorney and Treasurer have had
operations, such as, purchasing, payroll, information technology, revenue collection and auditing
internally and separate from the rest of the County; and
WHEREAS, it no longer makes sense to duplicate these operations for every elected official and some
Bureaus and departments; and
WHEREAS, these operations all have an impact on the County budget and the President and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners are ultimately responsible for the budgets of all these offices and
departments; and
WHEREAS, there are already bureaus and departments under the Office of the President which perform
these functions; and
WHEREAS, it is more cost efficient and will make the budget process less complicated to centralize all
of these operations in the bureaus and departments under the Office of the President; and
WHEREAS, centralizing operations in the County will generate savings in the outgoing years through
economies of scale by minimizing capital and operating costs, bulk purchasing, more streamlined and
accurate revenue collection, a more streamlined and cost effective information technology infrastructure,
and centralized training of staff; and

5172

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
WHEREAS, the bureau’s and departments that report directly to the President of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners are often, unofficially, referred to as, “Offices under the President”; and
WHEREAS, the name “Offices under the President” does not give the general public a sense of those
offices functions and therefore there should be an official name to describe the bureaus and departments
that report directly to the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the bureau’s and departments that report directly to the
President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall be in a new category of bureaus and
departments named “Centralized Management & Administrative Services”; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all the bureaus and departments that that are currently under the
title “Offices under the President” will now be under the title of “Centralized Management &
Administrative Services” ; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this name change will serve only to clarify the functions of the
bureaus and offices under the President for the general public, as the County moves forward with the
centralization of operations, and will no way impact the reporting lines of these bureaus and offices up to
the Cook County Board President or the current human resources processes; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all purchasing in the County shall be centralized in Centralized
Management & Administrative Services under the Office of the County Purchasing Agent; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all of the separately elected officials that have internal staff
perform purchasing functions may keep these employees, but those employees shall now report to the
Purchasing Agent. The Purchasing Agent may not terminate any employee housed in an elected official’s
office without approval of that elected official. If an employee housed in an elected official’s office
resigns or is terminated, that elected official will maintain the authority to fill that position; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all payroll services in the County shall be centralized in
Centralized Management & Administrative Services under the Office of the Comptroller; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all of the separately elected officials that have internal staff
perform payroll functions may keep these employees, but those employees shall now report to the
Comptroller. The Comptroller may not terminate any employee housed in an elected official’s office
without approval of that elected official. If an employee housed in an elected official’s office resigns or is
terminated, that elected official will maintain the authority to fill that position; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all information technology in the County shall be centralized in
Centralized Management & Administrative Services under the Office of the Chief Information Officer;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all of the separately elected officials that have internal staff
perform information technology functions may keep these employees, but those employees shall now
report to the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer may not terminate any employee
housed in an elected official’s office without approval of that elected official. If an employee housed in
an elected official’s office resigns or is terminated, that elected official will maintain the authority to fill
that position; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all revenue collection in the County shall be centralized in
Centralized Management & Administrative Services under the Cook County Department of Revenue; and

5173

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all of the separately elected officials that have internal staff
perform revenue collection functions may keep these employees, but those employees shall now report to
the Revenue Director. The Revenue Director may not terminate any employee housed in an elected
official’s office without approval of that elected official. If an employee housed in an elected official’s
office resigns or is terminated, that elected official will maintain the authority to fill that position; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all auditing functions in the County shall be centralized in
Centralized Management & Administrative Services under the Office of the County Auditor; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all of the separately elected officials that have internal staff
perform auditing functions may keep these employees, but those employees shall now report to the
County Auditor. The Auditor may not terminate any employee housed in an elected official’s office
without approval of that elected official. If an employee housed in an elected official’s office resigns or is
terminated, that elected official will maintain the authority to fill that position; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners shall work with the
Cook County Bureau of Finance and the Cook County Bureau of Information Technology & Automation
to make any necessary changes to this Resolution for the purposes of developing a plan to centralize these
services while creating a positive budget impact for the Fiscal Year 2008 budget and outgoing years.

RESOLUTION TO SUSPEND COOK COUNTY BOTTLED WATER BAN,
RESOLUTION NO. 07-R-436, AND TO ALLOW GREATER DUE DILIGENCE
AND PROPER AUDIT AND ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL, LOGISTICAL,
AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOTTLED WATER BAN
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Bottled Water Ban approved and passed on
November 6, 2007, the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of Administration had 90 days or
until February 4, 2008 to conduct a water audit as set forth in the November 6, 2007 version
of Resolution 07-R-436; and
WHEREAS, according to the Cook County Bottled Water Ban approved and passed on
November 6, 2007, the bottled water ban is to take effect on February 1, 2008; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bottled Water Ban calls for the premature implementation of
the bottled water ban in that said Resolution 07-R-436 requires the ban of bottled water prior
to the due date for the water audit required of the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of
Administration; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners must be apprised of and given the
opportunity to review and digest the analysis and results of the water audit so as to properly
determine whether a bottled water ban is in the best financial, logistical, and operational
interest of the various departments and agencies of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners can only exercise their fiduciary
duty and proper due diligence by first reviewing and digesting the analysis and results of the
water audit and subsequently evaluating whether to implement the Cook County Bottled
Water Ban, Resolution No. 07-R-436; and
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent and the Bureau of Administration absolutely require
greater than 90 days to exercise proper due diligence and conduct an audit which fully
accesses the needs of the various departments and agencies of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the financial, logistical and operational impact of the bottled water ban require
more than the 90 day period, allocated in the November 6, 2007 version of Resolution 07-R436, to develop a complete assessment and implementation plan; and
WHEREAS, a water audit and report is currently in progress by the Administration to assess
the status and quantity of the water cooler contracts and equipment; and
WHEREAS, preliminary assessments have detailed that not all department and agency
locations can use such a system or even have the ability to connect to a municipal water tap
source; and
WHEREAS, the cost of the installation of water filtration system at the various locations
could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and tens of thousands of dollars yearly for
additional filters and maintenance parts.

5209

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2008
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Resolution No. 07-R-436, the Cook

exercise of their fiduciary duty and proper due diligence, in the event the Board deems action

effective until such time greater than 90 days after said determination so as to allow the
Bureau of Administration the proper lead time for implementation of an alternative water
filtration system;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Purchasing Agent and the Comptroller shall

emergencies. This unique project and grant will fund an Outreach Worker who will work with both
clinics to be a voice in the community to explain how this program will work and secure new patients for
primary health care services at the Logan Square and Cicero Health Centers. In addition to funding the
Outreach Worker, this grant will fund approximately 1,000 primary care visits by new patients enrolled
into the “Chicago/Cook County Everyone Matters” program.
This grant does not require an application process and will be managed by the Hektoen Institute of
Medicine.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $100,000.00. Funding period: March 1, 2008 through

CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from
ROBERT R. SIMON, M.D., Interim Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into and execute a contract with Sav-Rx
Chicago, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the pharmacy mail order refill prescription services, which includes
emergency services for over-flow, non-mailed refilled prescriptions, for the Bureau of Health Services.
Reason:

A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued and Sav-Rx Chicago, Inc. was the only responder and
it was determined that they met the requirements of the RFP and the Minority and Women

patients. The mail order pharmacy is currently filling an average of 4000 prescriptions each
day with an additional 1100 refills per day for Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Provident
Hospital of Cook County and Fantus Health Center pharmacies. The Bureau of Health Services
will save approximately $1,600,000.00 with the new contract.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $81,500.00 and extend for six (6)
months, Contract No. 04-72-693 with Northwestern Pharmaceutical & Supply Corporation, Lincolnwood,
Illinois, for the purchase of reagents and consumable supplies for vendor provided chemistry analyzers.

Reason:

$1,472,087.10

81,500.00
$1,645,587.10

This request is necessary to maintain testing of patients’ samples for blood chemistry analysis
during the reorganization of the current laboratory services into a bureau-wide consolidated
laboratory. The bureau-wide laboratory consolidation will achieve economies of scale. The
process to develop new specifications requires additional time than anticipated since a
detailed assessment of each facility is necessary for the coordination of specifications into one
document. Moreover, this time will enable the laboratory to perform necessary correlation
studies which are required by regulatory agencies to insure that the existing and the new
instrumentation provide accurate correlated test results. The expiration date of the current
contract is February 29, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $81,500.00. Contract extension: March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009
2008. (897-365 Account).
