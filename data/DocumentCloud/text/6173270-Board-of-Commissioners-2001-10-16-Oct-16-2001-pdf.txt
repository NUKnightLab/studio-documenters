Tuesday, October 16, 2001 at 8:30 a.m. at the Duncan ABLA YMCA Community Center, located

The Chairperson convened the Public Hearing portion of the meeting by inviting residents and the
public at large to address the Board.
Immediately following the Public Hearing Session, Terry Peterson, Chief Executive Officer,
presented his monthly report. Per Mr. Peterson, the CHA can now take steps to raise up to $300
million dollars in the bond markets for the senior and scattered site capital programs and this
activity has the full support of HUD, as voiced by HUD Secretary Mel Martinez who personally
visited Chicago. Mr. Martinez also announced two HOPE VI grants for Taylor and Rockwell,
along with additional demolition money. This results in the CHA possibly having over $400
million in new funding to support the Plan for Transformation. Mr. Peterson concluded his
presentation by highlighting the planned activities for Year 3 of the Plan for Transformation, to
include rehabbing or rebuilding 6200 units (including 4500 senior units, 1000 scattered site units,
and 600 family units).
A motion was then introduced and seconded to adjourn to Executive Session. The Chairperson
announced that pursuant to the Open Meetings Act, 5 ILCS 120/2, the Board would adjourn for
