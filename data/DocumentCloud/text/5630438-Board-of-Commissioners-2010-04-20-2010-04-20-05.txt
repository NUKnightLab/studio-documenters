AUTHORIZATION TO APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE RELOCATION RIGHTS
CONTRACT TO MODIFY THE PROCESS FOR OFFERING REPLACEMENT
HOUSING TO RESIDENTS
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve an Amendment to the Relocation
Rights Contract to modify and improve the process of offering replacement housing to residents
in connection with the Plan for Transformation. The Central Advisory Council has reviewed and
approved the proposed Amendment.
FUNDING
Not Applicable
GENERAL BACKGROUND
In October, 2001, the Board of Commissioners approved the CHA Leaseholder Housing Choice
and Relocation Rights Contract (“Relocation Right Contract”) which governs the process by
which CHA residents are relocated from housing units to be rehabilitated or demolished and by
which such residents are offered replacement units.
In June 2008, the Board of Commissioners approved an amendment to Paragraph 4(c) of the
Relocation Rights Contract which modifies the Housing Offer Process (“HOP”) system and unit
offer process. The Central Advisory Council reviewed and approved the revisions. A copy of the
June 11, 2008 Board Resolution is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Additional changes are needed
to the Relocation Rights Contract in order for the CHA to fulfill its requirements to the
Leaseholders covered by the Relocation Rights Contract.
Three changes are being implemented to the Relocation Rights Contract. First, while
implementing the changes under Paragraph 4(c) of the Relocation Rights Contract, CHA still has
a group of Leaseholders covered by the Relocation Rights Contract that CHA could not locate. In
December 2008, the CHA implemented a massive undertaking to try locating missing
Leaseholders. This project was authorized by the Board of Commissioners and performed by
Globetrotters, Inc. This project consisted of a mass publication beginning July 2009 to contact
Leaseholders for whom CHA did not have current contact information. Language relating to this
effect and the rights of Leaseholders affected by the initiative is set forth in the revisions to the
Relocation Rights Contract under Paragraph 4(c) 5.

 Second, based on the CHA’s commitment under the Plan for Transformation and Moving To
Work Agreement, CHA is going beyond the federal and state requirements for the creation of
ADA/504 accessible units. As such, language is being added to the Relocation Rights Contract
under Paragraph 4(d) to allow residents needing the accessibility of ADA/504 units to have a
priority to the units above other Leaseholders within their specific priority group.
A third amendment to the Relocation Rights Contract is for Leaseholder families with income
that falls between 60% to 80% of the Annual Median Income (AMI). Over the course of
implementing the Relocation Rights Contract, the CHA determined that Leaseholder families
whose AMI was between 60% to 80% were having significant impediments to obtaining
housing in newly constructed or rehabilitated units. Therefore, language was added under
Paragraph 4(d) allowing such Leaseholders a preference for units in mixed-income communities
that are not restricted to families above 60% AMI.
These amendments have been extensively negotiated with the representatives of the CAC as well
as other resident and community advocates.
The result of these negotiations is a revision to the language of Paragraph 4(c) and Paragraph
4(d) of the Relocation Rights Contract. The revised language is attached as Exhibit B. The
revised language has been submitted and approved by the Central Advisory Council. Exhibit B,
as written, will replace Paragraph 4(c) and 4(d) of the Relocation Rights Contract and language
previously approved in June 2008.
Accordingly, the CHA submits the Amendment to the Relocation Rights Contract to the Board
of Commissioners for approval.
