PREVIOUS ACTION

In March 2019, the Board adopted a resolution supporting increased

• March 8 NOACA Board resolution supported increased
revenue for transportation, in the SFY 2020-2021

transportation to at least the $120 million goal contained
in the 2015 ODOT Transit Needs Study

 BACKGROUND

At April External Affairs Committee meeting, chair directed
NOACA Board to send resolution requesting that the Ohio
General Assembly and the Governor ensure:
• The previous commitment to fund public transportation at $70
million annually is approved in the Operating Budget, and
• Continued search for additional resources for public transit

5-27

 UPDATE
• New development: An additional $6.5 million, proposed
by the Governor and appropriated by the House for rural
transit and elderly assistance programs, was removed by
Senate
• These dollars are in addition to the $70 million committed
in the Transportation Budget
• Loss will hurt both rural and urban transit agencies
• OPTA urging Senate to restore these funds
• Board may wish to amend today’s resolution to include
this additional $6.5 million

allocate $63.5 million (previous flex funds) using:
• Federal Transit Authority (FTA) formulas, based on ridership,
population, and other applicable metrics
• National Transit Database (NTD) verified data and metrics
• Equitable and consistent local match requirements – to provide equity
to transit systems that raise and use local dollars, and not penalize
