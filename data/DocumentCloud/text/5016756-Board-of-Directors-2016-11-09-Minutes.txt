500 GRISWOLD SUITE 2200 DETROIT, MI - 4:00PM

PROJECTS
Packard Administration Building Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Mr. Vosburg presented the Packard Administration Building Brownfield Redevelopment
Plan.
Ms. Kari Smith, Anne Jamieson and Ms. Beth Gotthelf presented additional information
regarding the project and answered various questions from board members regarding
the history of the site, history of the developer, the hiring of Detroit based companies
and workers, outreach to the community, status of tax abatements for the project, and
the anticipated timeline for the redevelopment of the entire Packard Plant complex.
At 4:20 PM Chairperson Matt Walters arrived.
Project Introduction
Arte Express Detroit, LLC is the project developer (the “Developer”) for the Plan which
entails the rehabilitation of the vacant former Administration Building for the Packard
Motor Car Company at 1580 East Grand Boulevard into a 121,000 square foot four-story
commercial office building. Albert Kahn Associates, Inc., the original architect of the
building built in 1911, have been retained as architects for the project. The project will
involve green features such as the historic restoration of the exterior of the building to the
extent possible as well as a green roof. The developer will also be cleaning up adjacent
vacant land with green storm water features for outdoor courtyard amenities and tenant
parking.

 Approximately 7 permanent full time equivalent jobs and 136 temporary construction jobs
are expected to be created as a result of the project. A significant number of indirect jobs
via building tenants are also expected to locate at the development. The total investment
is estimated to be $22.6 million. The Developer is requesting $5,391,278.00 in TIF
reimbursement.
Property Subject to the Plan
The eligible property (the “Property”) consists of five parcels located at 1580 E. Grand
Boulevard (the Administrative Building), as well as 2821 & 5847 Concord (outdoor
corridors within the Packard complex) and 5580 & 5590 Concord (vacant lots to be
redeveloped). The parcels are generally located on the eastside of Detroit with the
Administration building on East Grand Boulevard, east of Mt. Elliot Avenue.
Basis of Eligibility
The property is considered “eligible property” as defined by Act 381, Section 2 because
(a) the property was previously utilized for a commercial and/or residential purpose; (b) it
is located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381; and
(c) the Property is determined to be functionally obsolete, blighted and/or adjacent to or
contiguous to an eligible parcel and is estimated to increase the captured taxable value
of that property as defined by Act 381. 1580 E. Grand Boulevard, the administration
building, has been certified functionally obsolete by a level 3 or level 4 assessor. 5821 &
5847 Concord have been determined blighted per Act 381 via a determination of blight
letter from Detroit City Planning Commission staff. The parcels identified as 5580 & 5590
Concord have been determined to be a facility pursuant to Part 201. Letters and/or
reports supporting these determinations can be found in Attachment G of the Plan
Eligible Activities and Projected Costs
The “eligible activities” that are intended to be carried out at the Property are considered
“eligible activities” as defined by Sec 2 of Act 381, because they include baseline
environmental site assessment activities, due care and additional response activities,
demolition, lead and asbestos abatement, site preparation, infrastructure improvements,
and preparation of a brownfield plan and/or work plan. The eligible activities and budgeted
costs are intended as part of the development of the Property and will be financed solely
by the Developer. The Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and
will incur no debt. The eligible activities are estimated to begin in fall/winter of 2016 and
complete within eighteen (18) months.
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Capture
The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax increment
revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse
the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property after approval of this Plan
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement with the DBRA.

governed by the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.
Other Development Incentives
The Developer of this Plan will seek additional support through an Obsolete Property
Rehabilitation Act Abatement (PA 146).
Attached for the board’s review is a resolution authorizing the Packard Administration
Building Brownfield Plan for submittal to the Community Advisory Committee for
consideration and comment within 30 days of their receipt of the proposed Plan. In
addition, it authorizes the President of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation or any
person designated by him, as a representative of the DBRA, to conduct a public hearing
in the area to which the Proposed Plan applies within the next 30 days. This public
hearing may be held jointly with any public hearing conducted by the Community Advisory

Community Advisory Committee as well as to conduct a public hearing for the Plan for
