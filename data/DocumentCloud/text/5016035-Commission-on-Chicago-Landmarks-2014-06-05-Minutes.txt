Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The new 1-story rooftop addition and trellis structures are approved as

addition shall be a darker, non-reflective finish and samples of the

approved as submitted on plans dated May 19, 2014, in terms of size,
location and overall design. The skylight glass, however, shall be
clear glass and a sample as well as connection details shall be
submitted to Historic Preservation staff for review and approval with
the permit application;
3. The proposed plans shall be modified to show either that the existing
courtyard fountain and pool shall be retained in place in their entirety,
or alternatively, the fountain pool and pedestal shall be retained in
place and the upper non-original sculpture may be replaced with a new
sculptural element of a similar scale that may be more compatible with
the design intent for the proposed café;

 4. As proposed, two windows on south elevation are proposed to be
modified to allow for deliveries. Existing and proposed window
details, metal railing details and movable ramp installation details
showing how the windows and masonry openings will be protected
during deliveries shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval;
5. The proposed plans shall be modified to retain the arched soffits, the
concrete fountain, and the decorative wall and ceiling finishes and
stencils at the first floor historic dining room;
6. The existing historic light fixtures located on the first floor may be
removed after each fixture is documented/catalogued and one of each
different fixture shall be saved and reinstalled within the building. The
final locations of the fixtures to be retained shall be reviewed and
approved by Historic Preservation staff;
7. The following shall be submitted to Historic Preservation staff for
review and approval with the permit application:

material samples;

and MSDS sheet shall be submitted with the permit application;
2. The bare galvanized metal perforated panels and exposed structural
elements of the windbreak structures that are proposed to be located on
the platform over the public right-of-way should be factory-painted
white to match the railings. Alternately, the windbreak structures
could be relocated in a different part of the platform so that they will
not be visible from the public rights-of-way; and,

 3. The housing of the light fixtures proposed to be mounted on the
underside of the CTA tracks in front of the historic station should be
factory painted in a color to match the tracks.

3.

approved by Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
3. The new rooftop addition should not be clad with corrugated metal
siding as proposed, but shall be clad in a material more compatible
with the architectural character of the historic building such as stucco
or flat metal/fiber-cement panels painted in a color to match the color
of the terra cotta street facades with a non-reflective finish. Material
and color samples to be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff prior to order and installation;
4. To minimize the impact of the rooftop addition’s visibility from the
public way, the existing non-historic brick parapet shall be painted,
coated, or stained in a color and finish to match the cleaned terra cotta
facades. A mock-up and samples shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff prior to order and installation; and,
5. The proposed scope of work to the parapet coping units and the
design, materials, locations, and installation details of any new canopy,
new interior partitions, and proposed alterations within the designated
historic interior spaces shall be reviewed by the Committee at a future
meeting.

4.

4840 S. Dorchester
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

 1. Detailed masonry restoration plans and typical repair details shall be
included in the permit plans for staff review and approval.
Replacement material samples shall be provided on-site for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval which shall match historic size,
color, texture and profiles;
2. Existing and proposed window and door details for all new and
replacement windows and doors shall be included in the permit plans;

Preservation staff review and approval;
6. The applicant shall provide grading and section details of the driveway

7. A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing the proposed
structural modifications, relative to how the building should be braced
and protected during construction, shall be submitted for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval, as part of the permit plans. The
recommended measures, sequencing, and protections shall be
incorporated in the structural and architectural drawings.
In addition, the Committee finds that the amount of demolition involved
with the project, based upon the submitted information, does not trigger
the requirements of Section 2-120-825 governing the demolition of 40%
or more of landmark buildings.

5.

existing and proposed window details shall be included in the permit
plans. The new window profiles shall match the historic window
profiles; and,
