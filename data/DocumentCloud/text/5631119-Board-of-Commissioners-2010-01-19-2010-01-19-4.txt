 EXPLANATION
On October 16, 2008, Resident Services released a Request for Proposal (No. 08-01608) for
maintenance and application support for CHA’s case management database, Salesforce.com.
Model Metrics was the sole respondent. CHA subsequently entered into Contract Number 8094
(the “Contract”) with Model Metrics to provide the necessary support and maintenance services
for a base term of one (1) year, in an amount not to exceed $86,400, with one (1) one-year
option. Resident Services is requesting authorization to exercise the one-year option with Model
Metrics to increase the Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed $86,400.
As a partner of Salesforce.com, Model Metrics performed the initial implementation of CHA’s
service provider database in 2004. Since that time, Model Metrics has been procured to provide
database support and maintenance including data migration, creation of reports and a
comprehensive data dictionary, redesign of the initial tracking modules, and implementation of
new modules based on the needs of Resident Services contracts. Model Metrics has designed the
tracking modules for Resident Services programs including Transitional Jobs, Good Neighbor,
FamilyWorks, and City Colleges of Chicago. This customization allows Resident Services to
provide management and oversight of the specific contract deliverables for each program, and
allows Resident Services to gather critical information to create and modify existing services.
In 2010, Model Metrics will continue to provide support and maintenance of Salesforce.com,
including enhancements to reflect new FamilyWorks program goals and tracking of the Section 3
job order process. Additionally, Model Metrics will provide on-call data and application support
as needed.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer or his designee to exercise the one-year option of the Contract’s term and increase the
Contract’s funding by an amount not-to-exceed $86,400. The Contract’s new aggregate not-toexceed amount will be $172,800.
