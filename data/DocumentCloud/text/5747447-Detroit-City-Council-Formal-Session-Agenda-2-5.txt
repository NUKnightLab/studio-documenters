RE: Impact of Proposal 18-1 on Criminal Prosecutions

Council Member Ayershas asked the Legislative Policy Division (LPD) to ?provide an analysis
of which violations will be changed from crimes to civil infractions under the new law from
Proposal 18-1,? as well as to address Whether the changes will be retroactive or make prior
convictions eli-giblefor expungement.

Enaetment and Implementation

Michigan Proposal 18-1 was adopted by Michigan voters on November 6, 2018, and took effect
on December 6, 2018, as Initiated law 1 of 2018, Michigan Regulation and Taxation of
Marihuana Act (?the Act?). (Attached) While recreational marijuana cannot be legally sold or
purchased in Michigan prior to the adoption of administrative rules by the Michigan Department
of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), it can be grown and exchanged without
remuneration as of December 6, 2018. LARA has one year from the effective date of the
legislation to establish its guidelines. MCL 333.27958.

Permissible Activity

Brie?y, as enumerated under section 5 of the Act, people 21 or older are allowed to possess up
to 2.5 ounces of marijuana on their person or in their homes and up to 10 ounces in their homes
provided the excess (over 2.5 ounces) is secured. It also allows individuals to grow up to 12
plants in their homes for personal use, provided the plants are not visible from a public place
without the use of binoculars (MCL Section 5 speci?cally states that possession,
as well as the other marijuana related acts listed, are authorized, not unlawful, not offenses,
not grounds for seizing or forfeiting property, not grounds for arrest, prosecution, or

II



9.23

penalty in any manner, and not grounds to deny any other right or privilege, including
custody or visitation with a minor. See, MCL 333.27955.

Prohibited Activitv

However, as enumerated under section 4 of the Act, it remains unlawful to: operate a vehicle
(or boat, aircraft, snowmobile, etc.) while under the in?uence of marijuana; give or sell
marijuana to a person under 21; to possess or consume marijuana if under age 21; to consume
marijuana in public; to cultivate marijuana plants in a location visible to the public; etc. See
section 4 of the Act, MCL 333.27954. The statute addresses a number of other unlawful
practices speci?c to marijuana processing, as well as other conditions and limitations.

Penalties

Section 15 of the newly adopted state law (MCL 33327965) speci?cally addresses changes in
State law as to penalties for marijuana related offenses, reducing and limiting most violations
to civil infractions or, at most, misdemeanors. The penalties delineated in section 15 of the Act
do not apply to the prohibited conduct described in section 4, which conduct includes operating
a vehicle while under the in?uence of, or while consuming, marijuana; transferring marijuana to
a person under the age of 21; possessing marijuana if under 21; possessing marijuana/accessories
on the grounds of a school or correctional facility; etc.

33327965 Violations; penalties.

Sec.15.

A person who commits any of the following acts, and is not otherwise authorized
by this act to conduct such activities, may be punished only as provided in this
section and is not subject to any other form of punishment or

forfeiture of the marihuana.

2. Except for a person who engaged in conduct described in section 4, a person
who possesses not more than twice the amount of marihuana allowed by
section 5, cultivates not more than twice the amount of marihuana allowed by
section 5, delivers without receiving any remuneration to a person who is at least
21 years of age not more than twice the amount of marihuana allowed by section
5, or possesses with intent to deliver not more than twice the amount of

3. Except for a person who engaged in conduct described by section 
or a person under 21 years of age who possesses not more
than 2.5 ounces of marihuana or who cultivates not more than 12 marihuana
plants:

for a ?rst violation, is responsible for a civil infraction and may be
punished as follows:
(1) if the person is less than 18 years of age, by a fine of not more than $100
or community service, forfeiture of the marihuana, and completion of 4

4. Except for a person who engaged in conduct described in section 4, a person

years of age more than twice the amount of marihuana allowed by section 5, shall
be responsible for a misdemeanor, but shall not be subject to imprisonment
unless the violation was habitual, willful, and for a commercial purpose or
the violation involved violence.

(Emphasis added.)

Retroactivitv and Expungement

Changes to the Michigan criminal code under the Initiated Law are not retroactive.l However,
the Legislature can create prospective relief for those convicted under previous law. Legislation
was introduced in the 2017?2018 legislative session to enhance the existing provisions of State
law for setting aside convictions in criminal cases, if the conviction(s) was related to marijuana
possession or related offenses that are now no longer criminalized.2 For example, Senate Bill
1200 and House Bill 6227, if it had been adopted before the conclusion of the legislative term,
would have amended MCL 780.621, and would have provided for the setting aside of multiple
misdemeanor marihuana offenses. House Bill 4798, while not speci?c to marihuana offenses,
would have permitted the expungement of multiple felonies if arising from the same criminal

 

The Michigan Constitution prohibits retroactive, or ex post facto, laws. Section 10 states, ?No bill of attainder, ex
post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contract shall be enacted.

2 With respect to criminal penalties, it is essential to recognize that marijuana remains a ?scheduled? narcotic under
federal law, and therefore remains technically illegal, subjecting those in possession to prosecution under federal
law.

transaction. Similarly, House Bill 6508 (introduced on November 27, 2018), entitled the
?marihuana violation sentence reduction act?, would have provided a means for currently
incarcerated individuals to petition the parole board for immediate release if convicted of a now
decriminalized marihuana offense.

The above-described proposed legislative actions were not adopted by the State Legislature
prior to the end-of the year; therefore, each of them died at the end of the last legislative term,
requiring reintroduction in the new term. Governor Whitmer campaigned on a platform that
included support for expungement of criminal records for marijuana offenses that are no longer
illegal, making it highly likely that similar legislation will be reintroduced. To date, however,
nothing has been proposed. Also of note, current Michigan law limits expungement to one
felony and two misdemeanors. MCL Hopefully, this limitation will be addressed
by the Legislature in response to decriminalization of applicable marihuana related offenses.
However, proposed legislation to amend MCL did not increase the number of
felonies that could be expunged.

According to recent reporting, in the past ?ve years, 117,123 Michigan citizens have been
arrested and charged with misdemeanor marijuana violations, with over 49,000 convictions, per
Michigan State Police statistics.3 In addition, according to FBI crime statistics, African-
Americans were three as likely to be arrested for marijuana crimes as whites. It is well known
that arrest records for marijuana offenses often result in harmful, long~term consequences for
individuals and their families, resulting in barriers to employment, affordable housing, and
student loans.- For all of these reasons, addressing issues associated with the decriminalization of
marijuana possession should be of high priority.

Should the Council have further questions, please advise LPD.

Honorable City Council:

Re: Petition No. 296 PM Environmental on behalf of Barriek Enterprises 40,
request for installation of two permanent monitoring wells and two soil gas
sampling points within the alley south of 1830 East 8 mile Road.

Petition No. 296 of PM Environmental on behalf of Barrick Enterprises #40 whose
address is 1830 East 8 mile Road, Detroit, Michigan, request permission to install and
maintain two (2) monitoring wells, and two (2) soil gas sampling points. The
encroachments will be in the east-west alley, 20 feet wide, and the no; :n-south alley, 16
feet wide in the block of Winchester Avenue, 50 feet wide, East Eight Mile Road, 204
feet wide, Marx Avenue, 75 feet wide and Dequindre Street, 66 feet wide. The purpose of
the bored well is to monitor the existence or extent of soil contamination from leaking
underground fuel storage tanks 

The encroachment petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for
investigation and report. This is our report:

The Division of Environmental Affairs Of the Buildings, Safety Engineering and
Environmental Department (BSEED) is responsible for developing and implementing a
coordinated and comprehensive environmental policy for the City of Detroit, including
soil remediation from leaking underground fuel storage tanks. To ensure public safety
BSEED will review the petitioner?s environmental activities prior to the issuance of city
permits. A Right-of-Entry is required by BSEED prior to contractor ?eld activity.

Soil borings and monitoring well installations are equivalent to an "open on in a public
street or alley. Necessary permits have to be obtained for any street or alley opening,
back?ll, surface restoration, barricade, or occupancy of city rights-of-way to install
monitoring wells. The City Engineering Division - DPW will require the permit applicant
to secure a right-of-entry approval from the Division of Environmental Affairs of
BSEED.

It is the responsibility of Environmental? to give reasonable and proper notice to
any abutting property owner(s) before commencing any open cut or boring operations
within public rights-of-way.

The enforcement of ?re safety regulations and building codes is the responsibility of the
Fire Marshal and BSEED. Generally, the Fire Marshal and BSEED report no objections

to the placement and maintenance of permanent L.U.S.T. monitoring well encroachments

 

 

within 

DTE Energy MichCon Gas Company reports involvement but no objections provided
that the installer contact MISS DIG at 1 800 482-7171; and provided that any removal or
relocation of gas facilities be done at project expense.

The Public Lighting Department (PLD) and Public Lighting Authority (PLA) report no
involvement.

Traf?c Engineering Division DPW reports involvement, but no objections provided
that the grade shall be maintained in original condition with ?ush covers on the
monitoring wells.

The Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) reports involvement, but no objections to

the proposed encroachments for monitoring well installation provided that the petitioner
follow DWSD provisions for encroachments. The DWSD encroachment provisions are a
part of the attached resolution.

All other involved City departments and privately owned utility companies request the
petitioner(s) make use of "Miss Dig" facilities before any soil borings or permanent
monitoring wells are installed in public (street or alley) rights-of?way.

Finally, the City Engineering Division - DPW requires Environmental" to submit
certi?ed "as built" drawings, a map and survey, showing the exact location of the
petitioner's completed permanent L.U.S.T. monitoring well installations within public
rights-of-way.

In accord with Detroit Code (Sec. 50-1-9), there is an appropriate resolution, granting the
encroachment petition, attached for consideration by your Honorable Body.

RE: Request to Install One Groundwater Monitoring Well and Two Soil Gas Sampling
Points Within the Alley South of 1830 East 8 Mile Road, Detroit, Wayne County,

Michigan
Dear Honorable City Council,

PM Environmental, Inc. (PM) is under contract with Barrick Enterprises, Inc. (Owner) to
investigate the extent of impact resulting from an open leaking underground storage tank (LUST)
gasoline release (C-O191-17) at the BP gasoline dispensing station located at 1830 East 8 Mile
Road in Detroit, Wayne County, Michigan (herein referred to as the Site).

PM is requesting approval to conduct subsurface work within the alley south of 1830 East 8 Mile
Road as shown in the attached Figure 1. PM will install three soil borings to a total depth of 20
feet below ground surface to collect soil samples. Should groundwater be encountered, two of
the soil boring locations will be converted to permanent groundwater monitoring wells. In addition,
two in-boring soil gas sampling points will be installed adjacent to the soil boring locations (Figure
1). The investigation will begin as soon as the permit has been granted and will continue until
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality regulatory closure is achieved. Following closure,
all well and vapor point materials will be removed from the ground and the area returned to normal

conditions.

If you have any questions related to this petition, please do not hesitate to contact our office at
(248) 336-9988 or via email at pappas@pmenv.com.

Sincerely,
PM Environmental, Inc.

RE: Request for 1400 Woodward Hotel Encroachment into the Woodward Avenue, John Street, Farmer
Avenue, and E. Grand River Avenue Public Right?of?Ways

On behalf of Bedrock Detroit, 630 Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan, 48226, the Mannik Smith Group Inc. is
respectfully requesting an encroachment approval for the 1400 Woodward Hotel into the Woodward Avenue, John 
Street, Farmer Avenue and E. Grand River Avenue public right-of?ways with the installation of canopies and cafe
sea?ng.

We are requesting an 17.4 foot wide 7 150 feet in length encroachment into the Woodward Avenue right-of?way, an
5.0 foot wide 22.1 feet in length encroachment into the John Street right-of?way, a 5 foot wide 221.3 feet in
length encroachment into the Farmer Avenue right-of-way, and a 7.7 foot wide 99.1 feet in length encroachment
into the E. Grand River Avenue right-of-way; all encroachments mentioned in this paragraph will begin at grade and
extend to the height of the building.

Additionally, we are requesting a 3.5 foot wide 22.1 feet in length encroachment and a 8.5 foot wide 9.7 feet in
length encroachment into the John Street right-of-way, a 8.5 foot wide 14.1 feet in length encroachment and a
3.5 foot wide 90.1 feet in length encroachment into the Farmer Avenue right-of?way, a 7.7 foot wide 18.3 feet in
length encroachment into the E. Grand River right-of?way; all encroachments mentioned in this paragraph will begin 8
feet above grade and extend to the height of the building.

In addition, we are requesting a 7.8 foot wide 10.7 feet in length encroachment into the Farmer Avenue right-of-
way, a 15.0 foot wide 27.6 feet in length encroachment into the E. Grand River right-of?way; all encroachments
mentioned in this paragraph will begin 10 feet above grade and extend to the height of the building.

These encroachments will neither impede pedestrian nor vehicular traffic, nor will they interfere with the maintenance
of the public rights-of?way, including utility company and Fire Department access. The requested encroachments
maintain at minimum, a 6 foot wide access way within the sidewalk for pedestrian use. Obtaining these
encroachments is critical to fully utilize this property as a commercial establishment and will promote activity along
the streets. A drawing of the proposed location of the encroachments is included. If you should have any questions,
please do not hesitate to contact our office at (313) 961-9500.
