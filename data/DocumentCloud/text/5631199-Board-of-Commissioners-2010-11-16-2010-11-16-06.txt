RATIFICATION OF ACCEPTANCE OF A GRANT AWARD FROM THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT
OF COMMERCE AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY (DCEO) AND INCREASE TO THE FY2010
COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners ratify the acceptance of a grant award from the Illinois
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”) in the amount of $11,700,000.00 for
implementation of the LeClaire Courts Demolition and Environmental Cleanup Project and increase to the FY 2010
comprehensive budget by the same amount.
EXPLANATION
On October 1, 2010, the CHA received official written notice of a grant award of $11,700,000.00 from the Illinois
Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO). The purpose of the funding is to implement the
demolition of 55 low rise buildings at LeClaire Courts, which are located within the Garfield Ridge community on
the southwest side of Chicago. The property, which was developed in 1950, has been deteriorating as a result of
decades of reduced resources and is in need of revitalization to better integrate and complement this middle-class
enclave within the city. The LeClaire Courts residents, consisting of 68% single-parent households, were relocated
to other housing units in 2009 to prepare for the demolition and transformation of the project. The grant funds will
be used for the demolition of the LeClaire Courts buildings, site cleanup, and the re-establishment of the property
site in preparation for future development. Additional funding will be sought for future housing development within
the project site
Grant-funded activities during the period of October 1, 2010 through the ending date of September 30, 2012 will
specifically include: securing site fencing and on-site security management, as mandated; proper legal abatement and
disposal of hazardous materials; removal and disposal of all trash and debris; site extermination prior to and during
demolition; coordination of all utility terminations with utility firms and capping all utilities at the site lot line,
structural demolition; removal and disposal of all surface/attached pavements and other site features associated with
the referenced buildings, as well as removal of terminated and abandoned underground utilities; removal and
disposal of all demolition debris; filling, grading and restoration of the site; and hydro-seeding for new grass. Costs
associated with this project are directly related to the demolition of buildings and construction of site improvements,
as noted, include Design/Engineering; Construction Management/Oversight to encompass site fencing and security
management activities; excavation/site-prep/demolition; and other construction expenses that include site
remediation, green space removal and replacement, construction of slabs, footings, roads and parking areas, and all
related appurtenances.
Completion of this project will benefit the public by removing structures that pose a threat to health and safety, and
also by preparing the site for future housing development opportunities.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to ratify the acceptance of the DCEO grant in the
amount of $11,700,000 for implementation of the LeClaire Courts Demolition and Environmental Cleanup Project
and increase to the FY 2010 comprehensive budget by the same amount.
