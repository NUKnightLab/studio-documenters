5-7

 BACKGROUND
NOACA tracks & provides regular updates on Northeast
Ohio’s air quality

• Publishes annual Air Quality Trends report
• Provides updates on region’s status for National Ambient Air
Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Air quality continues to improve overall in the region

• Concentrations of all pollutants continue to decline, though
there is year-to-year variation
• Region in nonattainment for two of six NAAQS

5-7

 BACKGROUND
• U.S. EPA strengthened NAAQS to
70 ppb from 75 ppb on October 26,
2015
• U.S. EPA issued nonattainment
designations on April 30, 2018
• Northeast Ohio designated as
marginal nonattainment area

5-7

• Lake County (75 ppb) & Geauga
County (71 ppb) had values above the
NAAQS
• Attainment Date: August 3, 2021

 BACKGROUND

• Lake County had highest O3 value in 2018 (76
ppb)

• Lake (75 ppb) Geauga (74 ppb), and Cuyahoga (71
ppb) 3-year average O3 values above NAAQS
• Region experienced 13 exceedance days in 2018

5-7

3-year average of 8-hour maximum O3 levels ((2006-2008)-(2016-2018))

 BACKGROUND
• Cuyahoga & Lorain designated nonattainment for
2012 annual PM2.5 NAAQS in 2015

• Annual NAAQS set at 12 µg/m3 averaged over 3 years
• Cuyahoga had level of 12.5 µg/m3 from 2011-2013

• Cuyahoga's 2018 level was 11.1 µg/m3, down slightly
from 11.2 µg/m3 in 2017
• Lowered 2016-2018 average to 11 µg/m3
• U.S. EPA redesignated region to maintenance status

NAAQS (75 ppb) in July 2013
• Lake County annual concentration was 53 ppb in 2018
• 3-year average SO2 value from 2016-2018 was 54 ppb
