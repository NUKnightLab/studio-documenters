 RENAISSANCE PARTNERS
Renaissance Partners Limited Partnership is a 101-unit
SRO property located in the Douglas community. The
Renaissance Collaborative Inc was incorporated in 1992
by four local churches to save the historic Bronzeville
YMCA from foreclosure. The building has participated
in CHA’s Moderate Rehabilitation (Mod Rehab) portfolio
since October, 2000.
•

Renaissance Partners has applied to the US
Department of Housing & Urban Development
(HUD) to convert the existing Mod Rehab contract
to Project Based Vouchers (PBV) under the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program - Second
Component (RAD2). Subject to HUD and CHA approvals, 100 new RAD2 vouchers will be assigned
to CHA to administer. While Mod Rehab is a 1-year, renewable rental subsidy contract, RAD2
provides a 20-year rental subsidy contract to preserve affordable housing for special needs
households. RAD2 allows the opportunity to secure financing for repairs and long-term viability.
Renaissance Partners will complete several repairs, including masonry, lintels, and a new roof.
Tenants are able to remain in the building during repairs.

•

RAD2 will assist 100 studio units, each approximately 185-220 square feet. All units include an
individual bathroom, as well as a kitchen with refrigerator and range. All utilities are provided by
the building. Eight (8) studios units are accessible, and eleven (11) units are adaptable.

•

Property amenities include onsite management, supportive services, maintenance and janitorial
staff, a laundry room, and 24-hour front desk service. Supportive services are provided by The
Renaissance Collaborative Inc, a 501-C-3 non-profit. Wrap-around services support housing
stability through health and wellness, employment, education, and life skills development
programs.

•

RAD2 units will continue to serve households that have experienced homelessness. As such, the
target population come from the City’s Coordinated Entry System (CES) which is cross-matched
with the CHA waitlists.

Property Owner /Manager
Renaissance Partners Limited Partnership is the ownership entity of The Renaissance Collaborative
(TRC). TRC provides property management and supportive services to the building. TRC also owns
the TRC Senior Village I, a 71-unit senior building utilizing HUD 202 vouchers.
