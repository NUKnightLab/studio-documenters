Introduction

Outer Limits Party will take place at Founders Brewing Co. in Detroit, Michigan.
The goal of the event safety plan is to consolidate all information to ensure
proper planning and coordination between Grand Circus Founders Brewing
Co., select staffing providers, and the City of Detroit. Four specific plans are
included below to summarize each area.

Security Plan

Event security staff will consist of private non?commissioned security guards
who are licensed and certified in the State of Michigan by Prostar Professional
Services Group. Grand Circus and Founders Brewing Co. will manage and
oversee security management services to implement the security plan.

Entry Exits

Upon entry into the event, each patron will be processed through
secure perimeter and a search of their personal effects for prohibited
items. A list of prohibited items is posted on the website and at each
entrance. No weapons or alcoholic beverages are permitted. The
contracted private security company will do all patron searches. When
deemed necessary, blowout gates can be opened to increase the
number of exit points throughout the event footprint.

Security Response Teams

Teams comprised of mobile security guards that maintain radio
communication with Grand Circus Founders Brewing Co. and other
essential departments. They are tasked with responding to any situation
requiring their attention throughout the event grounds. The security
response teams will monitor suspicious activities, check fence lines, and
other tasks as designated. Response teams will be equipped to
dispatch immediate medical or law enforcement assistance at all times.

Perimeter Fencing

The venue perimeter fence will be established and secured by 6? or 8'
chain link fence panels or existing cast iron permanent fence; temporary
fence panel segments are high 12? wide. This panel fencing
can be opened at each connecting point should the need arise. Event

security staff patrols the fence line. Portion of the fence line will act as
working gates and all working gates will be manned during all event
hours.

Restricted Areas and Back of House

The event grounds are general admission for all patrons. Barricades,
bike rack, and fence are used to delineate between patron areas and
back of house secured areas. Security staff is also utilized at
checkpoint entrances to back of house. Staff members are instructed to
display appropriate badges and/or wristbands to security for their
inspection to gain access.

Weather Plan

The event weather plan describes the responsibilities of key event staff and
city officials in the event of an emergency. The event is subject to all types of
emergency situations, including, but not limited to weather, fire and civil
disturbance. Township officials are in overall command of any emergency. A
command post will be set up inside the orchard offices.

Emergency Team
The event emergency team will be made up of the following persons,
who will report to the Command Post in the event of an emergency.

Outer Limits Neighborhood Notification

Joe Choma in?? u: com

Hello from Founders Detroit Taprooml

We are hosting our ?rst annual Founders Detroit: Outer Limits Party on Saturday, September 28th
from 12pm-12am and wanted to share details with our community neighbors. The event
footprint will include our Taproom, Beer Garden, and parking lot with live music in the parking lot
from 2pm-11pm, games, grilled food, and of course lots of special beers we have saved for this
occasion. This event isn?t just about beer and music, however, and we are excited to announce
our of?cial charity partner for the Outer Limits Party: Gleaners Community Food Bank. Because
we support their mission to provide households with access to sufficient, nutritious food, and
related resources to achieve a hunger?free community in southeast Michigan, our Big Pitcher
program will be making a donation to Gleaners Community Food Bank.

We will be sharing some tickets with each of you closer to the event, and will be announcing the

full lineup and taplist details when tickets go on sale August 23rd. Our hope is that this event will
grow each year and be an experience the Midtown community can take part in, so please feel
free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns you may have, and I?ll send everyone a
more detailed message once we announce further details. Thanks!

Honda Super Quiet Series Generator

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

 

Honda Power Equipment sets a new standard in portable power with the introduction of an all-
new inverter generator. Part of Honda Power

Equipment's Super Quiet Series of generators, the new
lineup is the perfect portable generator for

work, home or play.

The all-new Honda inverter generator offers
tremendous value to users, delivering 10 percent more
power (200 watts) than the outgoing model, the
company?s most popular portable model for the same
price. The heart of the additional power the new
generator delivers is the Honda GXR120 engine. With
more power, better performance and improved ease of

 

use and maintenance, the all-new Honda is the perfect choice for consumers to power
what they need for work, home or play.

In addition to more wattage, the all-new delivers consumers additional user-friendly
features including a fuel shut off valve that allows the engine to run with the fuel supply off,
helping prevent issues related to stale fuel; a large spout and oil drain gutter for cleaner, easier
oil changes; a smooth, light effort recoil; a user-friendly design that incorporates color-coded
startup points to start the generator; and increased ventilation that improves airflow resulting in
better cooling of key components.

Commitment Letter for City of Detroit Of?ce of Sustainability

I am writing on behalf of the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation to express that, subject
to board approval, we are committed to providing up to I 00,000 in funding as a 121 match should
the City of Detroit?s grant application, ?Improving Health and Safety in Detroit Homes,? be selected

for a Partners for Places grant award.

We greatly appreciate the past Pi? support that helped create Detroit's Of?ce of Sustainability
(008). The 008 has made incredible progress engaging more than 6,000 residents across the city in
creating a Sustainability Action Agenda for Detroit, and it would be very impact?Jl to be able to
announce a project that addresses the Agenda?s top priorities.

A $300 million foundation, the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation?s mission is to
nurture environmentally healthy and culturally vibrant communities in metropolitan Detroit,
consistent with sustainable business models, and support initiatives to restore the Great Lakes
ecosystem. We are focused on improving water quality; promoting environmental health, justice and
equitable deveIOpment; and supporting the arts as a means to strengthen the metropolitan Detroit

region.

Over the past two years, the foundation has been developing an increasing focus within its
Environmental Health Justice area on lead and asthma. Lead and asthma are the two largest
environmental health problems in the city of Detroit. Detroit accounts for almost one?half
Michigan?s cases of child lead poisoning and more than twice the number of asthma related deaths
statewide. Affordability of housing is another issue. The proposed program offers an elegant solution
to these issues, and we are excited at the opportunity to deepen our partnership with the 005 by
working together in assuring its success.

I have been impressed by the collaborative and creative Spirit that has animated the planning of this

program. Only recently emerged from bankruptcy, the city is still rebuilding its administrative
infrastructure and untangling an outdated web of bureaucracy. This program de?ly weaves together
the work of multiple departments and connects them with some of our most effective community-

based organizations?improving systems while directly addressing serious environmental, social and

economic issues. What better way to demonstrate the power of sustainability in moving Detroit
orward'?

RE: Correction - Request to accept an increase in appropriation for the FY 2019,
Local Health Opioid Response grant

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has awarded an
increase in appropriation to the City of Detroit Health Department for the FY 2019 Local
Health Opioid Response Grant, in the amount of $28,000.00. There is no match
requirement for this grant. The total increase is $28,000.00. This funding will increase
appropriation 20646, previously approved in the amount of $40,000.00. by council on
May 5. 2019, to a total of $68,000.00. This request will correct and replace a previous
City Council request to increase appropriation 20627, in the amount of $28,000.00,
previously approved July 23, 2019.

The objective of the grant is to expand the Health Department's Opioid Academic
Detailing Initiative. The grant will enable the department to increase the number of
pharmacies registered under the standing order to distribute Naloxone. and
conduct a continuing education event to train pharmacists on opioid misuse and
Naloxone administration. This is a reimbursement grant.

I respectfully ask your approval to accept the correction to increase appropriation
funding in accordance with the attached resolution.

Sincerely.
