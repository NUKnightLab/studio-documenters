2014 Chica 0 Infrastructure Trust Annual Re ort

 

August 14, 2014

This annual report for the Chicago Infrastructure Trust the ?Trust?) has been prepared in
accordance with Section 1 1.2 of the Trust's Bylaws.

The Trust?s purpose is to assist the people of the City of Chicago, the City, and its sister agencies in
providing alternative financing and project delivery options for transformative infrastructure
projects.

In 2014-, key milestones for the Trust included the following:

The construction of the Trust?s first project, Retrofit One, in which the Trust facilitated the

design and financing of energy upgrades in 60 public buildings in the City of Chicago, with

the cost savings from such upgrades being used to repay the loans advanced by the private
sector to fund such upgrades.

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) engaged the Trust to study and arrange alternative
financing methods for the capital-intensive technological and structural upgrade of the
subway system to 4G?service capabilities. Construction has begun and Chicago will
become the largest North American city to deploy full 4G services in its subway system.

Introduced a new public finance tool in the form of an Energy Services Agreement 
The ESA allows the City of Chicago to participate in infrastructure financing that remains
off-credit and off-balance sheet, thereby maintaining the City?s credit rating and
borrowing capacity. The ESA is also replicable for a wide variety of public financings.

The adoption of all internal policies required by the Trust's Bylaws.

The implementation of detailed Contacting Manual that provides a transparent,
comprehensive guide to doing business with the Trust.

The Trust?s audited financial statements and project descriptions for 2014 are attached.

Independent Auditor's Report

To the Board of Directors
Chicago Infrastructure Trust

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust,
which comprise the statements of financial position as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and
the related statements of activities and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 and
the period April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013, and the
related notes to the financial statements.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles general accepted in the United States of
America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant
to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an Opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Chicago Infrastructure Trust as of December 31, 2014 and 2013
and the changes in its net assets and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 and
the period April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013, in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Emphasis of Matter

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Chicago
Infrastructure Trust will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements, the Trust is pursuing plans to fund ongoing operations. If the Trust is unable to
successfully implement these plans, there is substantial doubt about the ability of Chicago
infrastructure Trust to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Chicago Infrastructure Trust

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014 and 2013

Note 1 - Organization
The Chicago Infrastructure Trust (the "Trust") was incorporated as a non-profit organization
on April 24, 2012 under executive order of the Mayor and City Council resolution. The Trust
operates exclusively for civic and charitable purposes in the Chicago Metropolitan area and
is a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Trust assists the people of the City of Chicago, the City government and its sister
agencies in providing alternative financing and project delivery options for transformative
infrastructure projects. To accomplish this, the Trust hopes to structure innovative financing
strategies and attract capital from diverse groups of investors. The Trust also hopes to
achieve and demonstrate real risk transfer to third-party investors, and to stimulate cross-
agency financing while creating efficient capital structures.

Note 2 - Status of operations
The Trust was established in 2012 under the support of the City of Chicago, who agreed to
supply the initial funding to commence operations. The initial funding was set at $2.5 million
in grants, after which the Trust was expected to procure alternative sources of revenue. As
of December 31, 2014, the Trust has drawn a total of $1.4 million of the initial funding.

Should the City of Chicago discontinue funding the Trust, and the Trust not receive other
awarded grants, the Trust will require additional sources of financing. This factor indicates
that the Trust may be unable to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of
time. The accompanying financial statements do not include adjustments, if any, that might
be necessary, should the Trust be unable to continue as a going concern.

Note 3 - Summary of significant accounting policies

Basis of presentation

The Trust presents its financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for
nonprofit entities. Under this guidance, the Trust is required to report information regarding
its financial position and activities according to three classes of net assets: unrestricted net
assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets.
Furthermore, information is required to segregate program service expenses from support
and fundraising expenses.

Use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue recognition

Grants received are recorded as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently
restricted support, depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor restrictions.
Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional: that is,

Chicago Infrastructure Trust

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014 and 2013

when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met. Service revenues are
recognized at project completion.

Accounts receivable

Receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, if any. Management's
estimate of the allowance is based on historical collection experience and a review of the
current status of tenant accounts receivable. It is reasonably possible that management?s
estimate of the allowance will change.

Capitalization and depreciation

Fixed assets are recorded at cost. Improvements are capitalized, while expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are expensed. The assets are depreciated over their estimated
service lives. The estimated service lives of the assets for depreciation purposes may be
different than their actual economic useful lives.

 

Estimated

Useful Life Method
Furniture and fixtures 5 years Straight-line
Machinery and eqiupment 3 years Straight-line

Impairment of long-lived assets

The Trust reviews its property for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the
fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for
the difference. No impairment losses were recognized during 2014.

Prepaid expenses
Advance payments for expenses related to subscriptions and insurance policies are
classified as prepaid expenses.

Net assets
The Trust classifies net assets as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or permanently
restricted.

Unrestricted net assets are neither permanently restricted nor temporarily restricted by
donor-imposed stipulations.

Temporarily restricted net assets represent resources for which use has been temporarily
restricted by the donor as to its usage or by the passage of time. When a donor restriction
has been satisfied, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net
assets.

Permanently restricted net assets represent resources that are limited by donor-imposed
stipulations that neither expire by passage of time nor can be fulfilled or otherwise removed
by actions of the Company. The Trust has no permanently restricted net assets.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2014 and 2013

Leases

Lease expenses are recorded based on the payments required by the lease agreement.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the
lease payments be straight-lined over the life of the lease; however, the effect of using
actual lease payments is not materially different from the results that would have been
obtained under the straight-line method.

Income taxes

The Trust has applied for and received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service to be treated as a tax exempt entity pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code and did not have any unrelated business income for the year ended
December 31, 2014 and the period April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through
December 31, 2013. Due to its tax exempt status, the Trust is not subject to income taxes,
but is required to file and does file tax returns with the and other taxing authorities.
Accordingly, these financial statements do not reflect a provision for income taxes and the
Trust has no other tax positions which must be considered for disclosure. Income tax
returns filed by the company are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for
a period of three years. While no income tax returns are currently being examined by the
Internal Revenue Service, tax years since inception remain open.

Note 4 - Grants

In 2012, the City of Chicago issued an ordinance establishing the Trust. The ordinance
included grants of funds for infrastructure projects subject to the availability of funds duly
appropriated, in a total amount not to exceed $2,500,000. During the year ended December
31, 2014, the Trust was awarded cost reimbursement grants in the amount of $1,000,000,
of which $900,000 was received. As of December 31, 2014, grant funds of $113,035
remain receivable, of which $100,000 was approved by the City of Chicago and $13,035
represents accrued compensated absences.

During the period April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31,
2013, the Trust was awarded grants from the City of Chicago in the amount of $653,350, of
which $450,000 was received by December 31, 2013 and $63,729 was received by
December 31, 2014. A portion of the remaining 2012 2013 award, totaling $139,621, was
to be postponed until 2014. Ultimately, this amount went unfunded during 2014. As of
December 31, 2013, grant funds of $77,806 remained receivable, of which $63,729 was
approved by the City of Chicago and $14,077 represents accrued compensated absences.

Note 5 - Concentration
A substantial portion of the Trust's revenue was received from the City of Chicago.
Substantial revenue is defined as revenue earned from any source that is in excess of 10%
of the total revenue of the company. For the period ended December 31, 2014 and the
period April 24, 2012 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2013, revenue
earned from the City of Chicago was $1,000,000 and $522,751, respectively, or 87% and
100%, respectively, of total revenue.

Note 6 - Leases
The Trust leases office space in Chicago, Illinois in the amount of $2,558 per month, which
escalates annually on August 1. The lease expires on July 31, 2017. The Trust also leases
office equipment under one capital lease and one operating lease, both with initial lease
terms in excess of one year. Accumulated amortization on the capital lease as of
December 31, 2014 was $6,332.

Future minimum lease payments under these commitments are as follows:

Years ending

 

 

December 31 Office space Equipment Total
2015 32,661 21,831 54,491
2016 38,366 21,831 60,197
2017 24,791 19,296 44,087
2018 - 6,624 6,624
2019 - 3,864 3,864

95,817 73,446 169,263

 

Note 7 - Subsequent events

Events that occur after the statement of financial position date, but before the financial
statements were available to be issued, must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure.
The effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about conditions that existed at the
statement of financial position date are recognized in the accompanying financial
statements. Subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions that existed after
the statement of financial position date require disclosure in the accompanying notes.
Management evaluated the activity of Chicago Infrastructure Trust through DATE (the date
the financial statements were available to be issued) and concluded that no subsequent
events have occurred that would require recognition in the financial statements or
disclosure in the notes to financial statements.
