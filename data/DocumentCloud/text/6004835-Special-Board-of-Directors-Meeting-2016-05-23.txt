Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A.

Strategic planning discussion

Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an introduction to the presentation. He also introduced
Richard Sewell, Associate Dean of Community and Public Health Practice at UIC School of Public Health, who will
be moderating the strategic planning discussions.
Dr. Shannon stated that the preliminary timeline anticipates a draft strategic plan presented to the Directors and public
to comment on around the 3rd week of June. There is an “exoskeleton” of the strategic plan - meaning the strategies
and sub-strategies in categorical and bulleted form - with the expectation that there will be large strategies, substrategies, and milestones and metrics to know whether progress is being made. Time will be spent at the end of the
meeting today to talk in a little bit more detail on next steps on that, because the administration will need to get some
more feedback from the Board.

Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion (continued)
Dr. Shannon stated that, at the June 24th Board Meeting, the plan is to have a draft written document out to the Board;
this is tentatively the time that the administration would like to put out as the marker to put a draft plan out for public
comment. In response to a question regarding whether senior staff will embrace the strategic plan, Dr. Shannon
stated that the executive team will absolutely need to review the draft strategic plan and give him their input,
pushback and modifications. Director Richardson-Lowry commented that she is unaccustomed to having the Board
comment on a draft before the executive ranks have weighed in on it. Dr. Shannon responded that what will be
presented as the options will have been already filtered through the executive team. Director Lerner requested that
the executive team vet the strategies and prioritize them for the Board.

 Behavioral Health
Integration in Primary Care
Why and where?
• Most individuals seeking “behavioral health” treatment for
depression/anxiety or substances are seen in an emergency
department or by their Primary Care Physician (PCP) first.
• A fully integrated, comprehensive, structured, care coordinated model
works best to address psychosocial determinants in primary care
How?
• Effective Screening/Diagnosing
• Effective Intervention
• Warm Handoff/Co-managing
• Interventions (Problem-Solving Treatment, Behavioral Activation
• Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Referral (Care
Coordination and Enabling Services)

Behavioral Health Consortium
• CCHHS already established (3/2016) a Consortium of
Behavioral Health providers who collaborate to achieve:

– A single point of contact (telephone 24/7) for behavioral health
patients (not only CountyCare).
– A network of resources available to provide a diverse array of
Behavioral Health services

• The consortium is led by Community Counseling Centers of
Chicago (C4) and will include these partners:
–
–
–
–
–
–

Metropolitan Family Services
Human Resources Development Institute (HRDI)
Habilitative Systems, Inc. (HIS)

 Crisis Expansion 1
Community Triage Center (CTC Pilot)

• A 24/7 triage center to evaluate and refer
individuals who are in an active behavioral health
crisis will open in July, 2016
• Primary services offered: mental health crisis
assessments, brief health assessments, and
referrals for treatment, case management and
follow-up
Page 20 of 86

16

 Crisis Expansion 2
DOP to enter Stroger Emergency Department
• Spring of 2013 DOP moved out of ED. DOP will return to the ED to
perform crisis evaluations
• Increased oversight and guidance to the emergency room team
• Direct control of triage and referral to the most appropriate level of care
• Quicker administration of emergent and non-emergent treatment to
improve patient care
• 24/7 coverage to the emergency department with ability to cover the
hospital for emergencies as well
• Enable patients in care to be completely documented in CCHHS electronic
medical record (currently minimally done by outside agency)
Page 21 of 86

17

 Specialty Expansion in DOP
• Historically, the DOP has been a psychiatristdriven model with an insufficient number of
therapists
• Patients require expanded acute outpatient
services
• Outpatient psychiatric social workers can
extend services, preferred model
• Psychiatric trained, LCSW social workers will
be hired
Page 22 of 86

18

 Substance Abuse Treatment Expansion
March 2015
Naloxone training conducted at the Stroger ED.
December 2015:
Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program established in Fantus Clinic to treat
patients with substance addiction problems.
March 2016
3 local FQHC’s (Federally Qualified Health Clinics) were awarded 3 separate Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) MAT grants. CCHHS has partnered with
these clinics to train and implement MAT clinics at those locations.
Summer 2016:
We are well under way to expand Naloxone training into the jail.
FY2017:
DOP will partner with Family Community Medicine to implement MAT in most ACHN
clinics.

opportunity?”

Benefit/Cost – Do the expected benefits of the strategy appear to exceed the
cost?
Draft
Page 60 of 86

 High Priority Strategies
Strategy Ranking Criteria
Consider:
Need - Is there a need in the System and/or in the County of Cook for an effort in this area? Is
this a serious problem when mortality, years of potential life lost, activity limitations, and quality
of life are considered?
