These contracts are the first set of the JAC’s annual Violence Prevention, Intervention, and Reduction
Grant Awards. Additional awards in the amounts of $100,000 (7), $40,000 (8), and $10,000 (8) will be
submitted to the Board later this fiscal year.
Brighton Park Neighborhood Council: This program will operate in Kelly High School, Davis
Elementary, and Shields Middle School. It will serve 80 13 -19 year old at risk youth. The program will
offer mentoring, restorative justice, trauma-informed counseling, afterschool tutoring and civic
engagement and case management. The goal is to decrease truancy, conflict with the law and decrease
violence involvement. Additionally, the program seeks to increase protective factors for the youth such
as positive decision-making, academic performance, and leadership. Youth will only enter the program
if they meet certain risk requirements including: chronic truancy, criminal justice or probation
involvement, and chronic disciplinary or behavioral problems at school. The program serves the
Brighton Park neighborhood.
Enlace Chicago: The program is called the “Little Village Youth Safety Network.” It is a prevention
targeted program for youth in 5th through 8th grade. Program components include parental engagement,
mental health treatment, mentoring, after school mentoring, and leadership development. The
partnership includes a large amount of smaller community based organizations to create the “Little
Village Youth Safety Network” which includes a shared database between all agencies. Youth will be
identified using CPS early indicator data. The program will serve the Little Village community. The
identified partner agencies are: (1) Beyond the Ball; (2) Central States SER; (3) Chicago Youth Boxing
Club; (4) Sinai Health System; (5) St. Agnes of Bohemia; (6) Saint Anthony Hospital; (7) Telpochcalli
Community Education Project; (8)Universidad Popular; and, (9) YMCA of Metro Chicago’s Youth
Safety and Violence Prevention Program.
Youth Advocacy Programs (YAP): YAP is a national organization with local offices in jurisdictions
across the country. The local Chicago office has been in operation for many years and has a history of
working with high risk gang involved youth on probation, parole, and in Chicago Public Schools. This
program will specifically target 50 juveniles on probation for gun charges. The program consists of a
small caseload “Youth Advocate” being assigned to each youth to support them throughout the probation
in all aspects of the youths life. Advocates will help the youth identify personal goals and work towards
them while also staying in compliance with probation. Advocates accompany the youth to court, help
them enroll in school, take them to appointments and whatever else is necessary to keep the youth safe
and on track. There is a no eject no reject policy, meaning every youth referred by probation will be
accepted and none will be ejected regardless of behavior. The program proposal is to serve youth
County-wide, but referrals will be determined by Juvenile Probation and, therefore, may be concentrated
in a certain area.
Illinois African American Coalition for Prevention: The program is titled the “Youth Asset
Development Project.” With three partner agencies the program will provide Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (evidence based practice), mentoring, and balanced and restorative justice training for 117 youth
ages 14-18, who are at risk of violence involvement. The program will serve the communities of
Roseland, Auburn-Gresham, Englewood, and Greater Grand Crossing. The identified partner agencies
are: (1) South Side Drill Team & Performing Arts Ensemble; (2) Target Area Development Corporation;
and, (3) Teamwork Englewood.

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property Assessment

and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned property, the
municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special circumstances may exist that
justify finding that the property is abandoned for purpose of Class 6b; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of less than 24 months and purchase for value, by a purchaser
in whom the seller has no direct financial interest, the County may determine that special circumstances
justify finding the property is deemed abandoned; and
WHEREAS, Class 6b requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of qualifying
abandonment in cases where the facility has been abandoned for less than 24 consecutive months upon

from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the
market value for 10 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: The Bureau of Technology requests that this Board approve an extension and increase to
contract No. 09-41-276 with Sentinel Technologies, Inc. The requested increase and extension will
allow the vendor to continue providing operational support, proactive network performance monitoring,
project staffing and management, tier one help desk through tier four escalation/problem resolution
services, security analyses, and firewall administration for the Countywide Local Area Network (“LAN”)
and Wide Area Network (“WAN”). Without this service, communication throughout Cook County will
be greatly impacted and key customers to the Bureau of Technology, such as Public Safety, Life Safety,
and elected official agencies would be adversely affected. This extension will allow a smooth transition
between the current support team and the future support team upon conclusion of a corresponding RFP
process.
In 2009, Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code.
