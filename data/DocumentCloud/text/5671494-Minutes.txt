10. Remarks
A. Chairperson's Remarks
Chairman Hendrix reflected on the life of Kathleen Leavey, who had a long
tenure in city government. She worked in the Law Department, as well as
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD), and had the opportunity to
work directly with Ms. Leavey in various capacities in city government over
the years, and her passing made him reflect and look back on the many
encounters he had working together. Chairman Hendrix stated that Ms.

Leavey was an outstanding, excellent, very loyal and dedicated Detroiter and
took her work very seriously. Chairman Hendrix further stated that Kathy
would take anyone on if she felt you were wrong and she was right, and she
was a fighter for the people who worked under her charge, no matter where
she was in the chain and the hierarchy, and she would speak up on behalf of
the workers at DWSD. Chairman Hendrix stated that she was a good person,
she loved this city very much and will be missed.
Chairman Hendrix also gave remarks regarding the public comments made
by several members from the local union, who came before the Board and
spoke passionately about what is going on with the negotiations of their
contract. Chairman Hendrix stated the Board is no place to negotiate
contracts and that there are people at the appropriate level to do that, but
there were some recurring things that were said having to do with medical
deductibles and co-pays, salaries below market rate, and the comparison of
many of these employees and union members and how they stack up with
their counterparts in Oakland and Macomb Counties. Chairman Hendrix
stated he is not sure what kind of comparison they're making, but he would
like, at some point when it's appropriate, to hear how things are being
handled and negotiated with the various bargaining unions within the
Authority; the comparisons they seem to be making with positions of their
counterparts in other areas throughout the region; and also being asked to
train people coming in being paid more than them.

B. Board Members' Remarks
There were no Board Members' remarks.
