Re:
Adoption of Actuarial Assumptions for purposes of determining optional forms of
benefits for Component I and Component II of the Retirement System
Motion by: Trustee Cowan– Supported by Trustee Naglick,
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit is
vested with the authority and fiduciary responsibility for the administration, management, and
operation of the Retirement System, and
WHEREAS, the provisions of the plan are subject to the applicable provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code, applicable state law, the applicable charter and ordinance provisions of the City

WHEREAS, the Retirement System’s actuary, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, in its
correspondence dated May 4, 2017, has provided guidance and requested
clarification/confirmation from the Board and the Retirement System’s Investment
Committee with respect to the actuarial assumptions to be utilized for the optional forms of

MEETING NO. 4184
MAY 31, 2017

Re:
Adoption of Actuarial Assumptions for purposes of determining optional forms of
benefits for Component I and Component II of the Retirement System
determining optional forms of benefits for Component I and Component II are hereby adopted:
1. Component I & II. While the assumption factors for optional forms of benefits may be
different between Component I and Component II, at this time the factors between both
Component Plans should be the same except the COLA assumption as noted below. At
such time as greater historical experience and data is generated on the new Component
I (Hybrid Plan), different assumption factors may be appropriate.
2. Mortality. For contingent options (i.e., 100% J&S, 50% J&S, etc., paid to a beneficiary),
annuitization of voluntary contributions and early retirements, both Component Plans
shall utilize the RP-2014 with Blue Collar Adjustment (BCA) mortality table, with an
eleven (11) year static projection of mortality improvement.
3. Interest Rates. For contingent options and early retirements, both Component Plans
shall utilize a 6.75% interest rate. For the annuitization of voluntary contributions, both
Component Plans shall utilize 5.25% interest.
4. Unisex Blends. For contingent options both Component Plans shall utilize a unisex mix
of 80% male/20% female. For early retirements and the annuitization of voluntary
contributions both plans shall utilize a unisex mix of 60% male/40% female.
5. COLA. The potential COLA in Component I shall be reflected in the Component I
assumption factors at 1/2%. There shall continue be no COLA assumption reflected in
the Component II calculations.
6. Overpayments/Underpayments. These updated assumptions and factors shall also be
utilized for any calculations with respect to overpayments or underpayments of benefits.
7. Anti-Selection. No adjustments shall be made for anti-selection.
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the RSCD Staff shall prepare a recommended implementation
process and timeline for Board approval which shall include a recommendation as to an
implementation date which is administratively feasible for the new assumptions to be applied to
future benefit calculations, and
FURTER RESOLVED, that these revised actuarial assumptions shall be utilized by the Actuary
after approval of an implementation date by the Board, and
FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution shall be provided to the GRS Investment
Committee, the Retirement System’s actuary and appropriate RSCD staff, and
FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution shall be maintained in the Retirement
System’s records.

Investment Committee recommended assumption of optional benefit. The motion
passed by a unanimous vote.
