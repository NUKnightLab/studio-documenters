Re: Proposed Amendment of Chapter 27 of the 1984 Detroit City Code, Human
Rights, by amending Article X, Municipal Identy?ication Card Program.

Honorable City Council:

Attached please ?nd an updated version of the ordinance requested by Council Member
Casta?eda-Lopez which is currently being considered in the Internal Operations Standing
Committee (108). The updated version is dated November 1, 2018; the previous version is dated
October 5, 2018. The difference between the two versions can be found on page 3, line 22 to re?ect
a timeframe of 60 days instead of 30 days. This change is consistent with the modi?cation on the
t0p of page 9 regarding the Proof of Residency documents.

Additionally, the updated version that is attached incorporates the recent ordinance to
increase point totals proffered by Council Member Ayers and approved by City Council at the
formal session of October 23, 2018 (line item 1 on New Business Agenda). Please note the Clerk?s
Of?ce has indicated that this ordinance has been approved by the Mayor and will be published in
the Detroit Legal News on Monday, November 5, 2018. More speci?cally, the recently enacted
ordinance increased the following:

Criminal Record check (AFIS) with photograph is now 300 points;

Offender Tracking Information System (OTIS) record is now 300 points;

Criminal Record check (AF IS) without photo is now 200 points; and

Michigan Department of Corrections prisoner identi?cation card is now 200 points.



Lastly, the public hearing on the attached ordinance dated November 1, 2018, is scheduled
to be held in the Internal Operations Standing Committee on Wednesday, November 14, 2018 at
11:00 am. The ordinance currently pending in 108 contains the following proposed amendments:

Adds the ability for applicants to list a preferred ?rst name on the card;

Identi?es certain documents that will automatically satisfy the proof of identity and
residency requirements to obtain a card;

Increases point totals for existing documentation to prove identity;

 

Honorable City Council
Re: Proposed Amendment of Municipal ID ordinance
November 2, 2018

Adds categories of acceptable documentation to prove identity and corresponding point
totals;

Modi?es the requirements for an af?davit of identifying witness;

Extends the timeframe by which documents for proof of residency can be considered valid;
Removes the age limit of 14 for eligibility to receive a card; and

Adds language that the fee for replacement cards will not exceed $10.00.







I look forward to discussing this important legislation at the public hearing in 108.
