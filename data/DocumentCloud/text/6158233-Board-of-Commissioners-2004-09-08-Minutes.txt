requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Encounter Medical Group,
P.C., Oak Park, Illinois, to provide clinical consulting services and a full range of residential and
outpatient services for minors in the Juvenile Court Drug Treatment Program.

2389

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Reason:

The Juvenile Court Drug Treatment Program services minors with drug-related offenses who
are identified by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to be in need of
intervention, treatment services, and supervision. The program targets nonviolent delinquent
minors residing in and around the Austin and Lawndale communities in Chicago. The
objective of the program is to help minors break the cycle of drug dependency. Program
services include substance abuse assessment and treatment, health care, counseling, education,
vocational training, and housing placements. Services are provided within a framework of
sanctions and substance abuse testing.
Encounter will provide services through four (4) subcontractor agencies. The subcontractors

intervention services.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $11 2,000.00. Contract period: October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005.
(326-249 Account). Requisition Nos. 43260026 and 5326000 I.

Transmitting a Communication from
TIMOTHY C. EV ANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Lexis-Nexis, a Division of
Reed Elsvier, Inc., Dayton, Ohio, for online legal research services for Cook County. This request is
made on behalf of all seventeen (17) Cook County departments and agencies that use these services as set
forth on the submitted schedule. Lexis-Nexis currently provides these services to Cook County under
Contract No. 0 1-4 1-491, which expires January 31, 2005.
Reason:

For the past several months, a committee comprising representatives from the Office of the
Chief Judge, the Office of the State's Attorney, the Office of the Public Defender, and the
Bureau of Information Technology and Automation evaluated proposals submitted by both
Lexis-Nexis and Westlaw. These proposals were submitted in response to a Request for
Proposals (RFPs) issued by the committee. This committee unanimously recommends that
the County maintain its relationship with Lexis-Nexis for online legal research services. The
committee' s recommendation is based on several factors, which include lower pricing,
significant price discounts on hard copy publications, the high quality of service provided by
Lexis-Nexis over the past several years, and the Lexis-Nexis commitment to customized
services.
The proposed contract provides unlimited access to the most frequently used research
libraries, unlimited training support, printing, cite checking and customized services, as well
as expanded use of investigatory tools. The fixed price for these services is $38,500.00 per
month, or $1,386,000.00 for the three year period for all seventeen (17) departments and
agencies listed on the submitted schedule. The contract proposal also significantly increases
the percentage of discount the County currently receives on book publications. Overall,
measured against the County's current annual billings from Lexis-Nexis of approximately
$960,000.00 for on-line services and hard copy publications, this proposed contract will save
approximately $610,000.00, for the three-year contract period.

principles of restorative justice as an alternative to juvenile court. Through the Neighborhood Restorative
Justice Conferencing Project, young offenders come face to face with victims and engage in structured
discussion that instills a real world understanding of the impact for the victim, the j uvenile and the
community. The primary goals are to hold the youth accountable for his/her conduct, address the harm to
the victim and to prevent future offenses by changing the juvenile 's attitude towards the behavior that led
to his/her arrest.
Reason:

The project has been implementing, supervising and developing victim/ offender conferencing
services in partnership with the State's Attorney 's Office since its inception with the pilot in
the 6th Municipal District approximately four years ago. As the project has expanded and
evolved, the model has been tailored and modified to responsibly and appropriately meet the
needs of the respective community, its resources and volunteer base. Because the program
involves all five suburban municipal districts the Institute whose programs run throughout
Cook County would be best suited to this program. To date, the project has trained
approximately 300 volunteers and conducted approximately 1200 conferences.

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ChoicePoint Business and
Government Services, Inc. (ChoicePoint), Boca Raton, Florida, for online investigative research services
for Cook County. This request is made on behalf of the four (4) County agencies that must contact or
locate missing individuals or those difficult to find in the course of official County business: the State's
Attorney's Office, the Office of the Public Defender, the Sheriffs Office and the Sheriff' s Chicago High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). Presently, the County does not have a contract with
ChoicePoint.

2413

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Reason:

During the past year, representatives from the Office of the Chief Judge, the Office of the
State's Attorney, the Office of the Public Defender, and the Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation issued a Request for Proposals (RFPs) and evaluated
submissions from vendors for on-line legal research services including investigative services.
The committee has unanimously recommended that the County renew its contract with LexisNexis, Inc. for online legal research services. During this evaluation process, the committee
also concluded that the market for online investigative research services has vastly expanded
and improved in the past three years. The committee detennined that ChoicePoint offers
comprehensive infonnation that effectively meets the needs of County investigators.
Consequently, the committee unanimously recommended that the County enter into a contract
with ChoicePoint to supplement its online investigative research services.
The committee's recommendation of ChoicePoint is based on several key factors, which,
include its large and comprehensive database of public records, County investigators
satisfaction with this service, and the cost savings that will be provided to the County.
ChoicePoint is recognized as one of the premier public record database companies in the
nation. The proposed contract provides for unlimited access for up to I 00 users to over 17
billion public records, training and technical support. The fixed price for these services is
$3,100.00 per month or $37,200.00 for one year beginning December I, 2004.
The committee has determined that the State's Attorney's Office, the Public Defender' s
Office, and Sheriffs Chicago HIDTA have spent on average approximately $62,000.00 a year
to utilize ChoicePoint's online investigative research services. Consequently, this proposed
contract will save the County approximately $24,500.00 a year while allowing investigators
from the Sheriffs Office to use the service for the first time.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $29,450.00. [$ 15,500.00 - (250-353 Account); $4,263.00 - (260-353 Account);
$9,687.00 - (210-353 Account); and Grant funded amount: $7,750.00 - (655-220 Account)]. Contract
period: December 1, 2004 through November 30, 2005. Requisition No. 42500042.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

Agent be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

AMENDING CHAPTER 18 OF THE COOK COUNTY ORDINANCES (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Carl R. Hansen, County
Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by Joan Patricia Murphy and Larry Suffredin, County
Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AMENDING CHAPTER 18 OF THE COOK COUNTY ORDINANCES
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, section 6(e) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power and
perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has adopted an ordinance entitled The Children's
Curfew Ordinance for the protection of minors residing within Cook County and for the
overall protection of the public health, safety, comfort and welfare; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County desires to amend The Children's
Curfew Ordinance by adding provisions which establish certain defenses to prosecution
under The Children 's C urfew Ordinance that the Board of Commissioners deems necessary
and appropriate.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED THAT:
Section 4, Enforcement of The Children's Curfew Ordinance 1s hereby deleted m its

Chainnan Maldonado asked the Secretary to read the Notice.
Commissioner Butler moved Communication No. 266177 for purposes of discussion, seconded by
Commissioner Quigley.
Chainnan Maldonado asked Commissioner Hansen to explain the proposed ordinance.

2607

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDTNGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Commissioner Hansen explained that the purpose of the amendment is to bring the ordinance into
confonnity with the United States Court of Appeals in Hodgkins v. Peterson in Indiana, which sets forth a
number of desiderata which must be met in any action to find a violator of the curfew ordinance in such
violation. The ordinance removes Section 18-4 Enforcement and substitutes for 18-4 Defenses;
Enforcement and it lists a number of things which constitutes, for anyone under 17, legal presence after
the curfew hour, which are described in Section 18-3. This came about by the Sheriff and the State 's
Attorney bringing to the Board's attention the fact that the current ordinance is unenforceable because of
the U.S. Court of Appeals' findings. There are two subsequent amendments; one is important because of
the fine involved . The City of Chicago has already approved this as a change to their earlier curfew
ordinance. The other two amendments are as follows: The penalty section calls for a fine between $5 and
$ 100. This language should be amended to " not to exceed $500." The second amendment takes out a
redundancy which was brought to the Board's attention by the State's Attorney.
Commissioner Butler voiced hi s dismay that the Board is asked to approve an ordinance that the state and
city approved instead of all three government agencies meeting to discuss the issue. He finds the
ordinance unenforceable as it is written and additionally he stated the amendment is unenforceable.
Commissioner Moreno stated that the amendment and ordinance should be constitutional. He stated that
it would be good to have the amendments all on one sheet next to the old text for presentation at the next
Board Meeting. He agrees with the amendments, because parents need to be responsible for their
children.
Chainnan Maldonado stated that the second and third amendments came after the first; that is why they
are not all laid out together.
Commissioner Hansen agreed with Commissioner Moreno.
Commissioner Moreno and Si lvestri asked to be listed as a co-sponsor.

Commissioner Butler withdrew the motion to discuss.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved the approval of
Communication No. 266177. The motion carried. Commissioner Butler voted Nay.

Attest: DA YID ORR, County Clerk
Commissioner Moreno stated that in misdemeanor cases the Cook County State's Attorney' s Office is
used as a clerk to fill out orders assessing fines, fees and costs. Thi s creates a burden on the State' s
Attorney's Office and the Courts. Also, the fees escalate from several hundred to several thousand.
These fees are difficult to collect from an indigent person. He would like to have the State's Attorney's
Office, the Public Defender' s Office, and the Sheriffs Office appear at the next meeting to examine this,
and to discuss where these millions of dollars are going. The inability of the indigent to pay fees will then
lead to their dri ving privileges being re-suspended and to having warrants issued for their arrest for failure
to pay.
Chairman Maldonado suggested that Commissioner Moreno write the Chair a letter requesting an
informational meeting with the various agencies.

Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Stroger & Cennak Hospitals Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, July 7, 2004 at the hour of 2:30 P.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following item:
I.

To hear a presentation by the Bureau of Health Services on the hiring process of nurses.

Following the call of the meeting, Chairman Maldonado stated that the purpose of this meeting is to hear
a presentation by the Bureau of Health Services on the hiring process of nurses. This meeting is for
informational purposes only.
Chainnan Maldonado stated that in January 2003, a hearing was held in regards to the recruiting process
of nurses and the problem that the Bureau of Health Services is facing. It also addressed the possibility of
recruiting nurses from Puerto Rico and the problem that the Bureau of Health Services was facing with
respect to the hiring time that it took to recruit a nurse. However, the Chainnan stated that from January
2003 until today the Bureau of Health Services has made major progress in that respect.
Chainnan Maldonado called on Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, to comment on the
recruitment initiatives in their entirety and what progress has been made; and the success that the Bureau
of Health Services has had in reducing the hiring time frame from as much as nine months down to 32
days.
Ruth M. Rothstein, Chief, Bureau of Health Services, introduced Linda Strickland, who will be giving the
report to the committee from the Bureau of Health Services. In terms of the process Ms. Rothstein stated
that the Bureau could have not changed or shortened the time frame for hiring if the Bureau of Health
Services had not been able to convince the Human Resources Department in the County to work with the
Bureau of Health Services. Ms. Rothstein further stated that the time frame for hiring nurses went down
from up to nine months to 32 days. In conclusion, she stated that with the help of Linda Strickland, Mark
Kilgallon and the staff of the Bureau of Human Resources, the Bureau of Health Services was able to be
successful.

2612

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Ms. Rothstein stated that after Linda Strickland leaves, Martina Harrison, Associate Administrator will be
taking her place and will be working with all of the nursing directors and all of the Bureau institutions and
will pursue the work as it has been set up. The other individual who will be working with Ms. Harrison
will be Magali Moreno, who will be specifically responsible for the actual recruitment. In conclusion,
Ms. Rothstein stated that between Ms. Harrison and Ms. Moreno, they will do a fabulous job.
Ms. Rothstein then called on Linda Strickland to do the presentation on the report.
Linda Strickland, Consultant, Bureau of Health Services, stated that in the document that was distributed
to the Commissioners is a report dated September 2003 entitled Nurse Recruitment and Retention
Initiatives for the Cook County Bureau of Health Services. Ms. Strickland stated that the first part of the
document speaks to the overall worldwide nursing shortage. She stated that nursing services will be
increasing for many reasons: aging population, citizens who will be more in need of health care services
and also a decline in availability of nurses for various reasons. Many nurses are retiring in all fields, not
just in bedside medical but also in the education field. Ms. Strickland briefly reviewed some of the
initiatives. I) Attend recruitment fairs and career days to emphasize the uniqueness of the Cook County
Bureau of Health Services including our multi cultural diversity of patients as well as staff, competitive
salaries, great benefits, tuition reimbursement, system mobility within seven affiliates in the Bureau so
that the nurses are able to move to different hospitals and still remain within the County system. 2)
Streamline the hiring process by recruiting nurses who are not actively working, recruiting culturally and
gender diverse nurses, investigate hiring nurses from Puerto Rico so that the Bureau can match our staff
to the patients that the Bureau services, and reviewing work processes and work loads. 3) Partner with
schools of nursing to provide clinical training environments for students, so that not only would the
Bureau be carrying out our mission of insuring that nurses, no matter where they practice, are clinically
competent, but also recruiting those students who come to the Bureau for their clinical practice and upon
completion of their nursing program, encourage them to remain working for the Bureau. 4) Finally,
attend education fairs with middle and high school students to plant the seed of focusing their education
on a career in nursing. Also, have varying partnerships with high schools to include observation
internships, work programs and scholarship opportunities.
Ms. Strickland stated that the Bureau is reaching out to the South Suburban schools to institute some of
the Country's pre-existing programs. Letters were sent out prior to the end of the school year and the
Bureau was able to schedule meetings. Ms. Harrison and Ms. Moreno will continue this outreach in the
fall. Three career days have been held in the South Suburban schools this past year.
Ms. Strickland stated that since April 2003, the Bureau has hired over 30 Hispanic nurses. She also stated
that the Bureau finalized a bid document to request authorization to bid a contract to recruit nurses from
Puerto Rico. This request will appear on the July 13, 2004 agenda. Ms. Strickland stated that in FY
2002, the Bureau hired 38 nurses, in FY 2003 173 nurses and from December 2003 to May 2004 another
130 nurses were hired. In regards to the recruitment of LPN's, there still are some challe nges there, but
the Bureau is working in collaboration with the State LPN Association. Fortunately the President, Vice
President and many of the other officers of the State LPN Association are also members of the Bureau's
nursing staff.
Chainnan Maldonado asked if it is possible to bring the 32 business days down to 32 calendar days.
Ms. Strickland stated that there is always an opportunity for the Bureau to continue to improve.
In response to Commissioner Steele's question regarding nurses from Puerto Rico, Ms. Strickland stated
that before the nurses from Puerto Rico are hired, they are required to have passed the State Board exam
to be fully licensed for the State of Illinois.

2613

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Chairman Maldonado stated that the RN's from Puerto Rico did take a test in Puerto Rico, i.e., the Puerto
Rican or local nursing exam, which happens to be in Spanish. However, in order for them to be able to
practice here they need to take the NCLEX test. They currently are being prepared to take the NCLEX
test so that they are able to come to the United States. Further, Chairman Maldonado stated that there is
no issue of accreditation of their curriculum because their curriculum in Puerto Rico is the same
curriculum that nurses pursue here in the United States.
Chairman Maldonado asked if the funding for the part time nurses comes from the private registry line
item.

Jeffrey S. Blumenthal, of Slutzky & Blumenthal, stated that he represents the Village of Midlothian in
connection with its acquisition of the above properties through the no cash bid procedure. He stated that
he also had with him Bill Sipowicz, the principal of Heartland Development, which is working with the
Village of Midlothian on the town home development.
Commissioner Peraica asked if Mr. Sipowicz's plan is to develop town homes.
Mr. Sipowicz replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Peraica asked how many are planned.
Mr. Sipowicz replied 68 but that number might be less based on the Federal Insurance and Mitigation
Administration (FlMA) structural issues necessary to prevent the residents from having to pay flood
insurance. This is considered an AH flood plane. This is why the area hasn' t been developed for fortyfi fty years.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether there is low-income housing as part of the 68 units.
Mr. Sipowicz replied 20% on Madison A venue, although this project did not require it. He thinks the
units will be priced under market value, for example a 1700 square foot unit goes for $149,900.
Chainnan Sims asked Mr. Sipowicz to confirm that there are no residents living on the property in
question because it is a flood plain.

26 16

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

Mr. Sipowicz confirmed this. People who live on the edge of the property on Ridgeway and Springfield
pay flood insurance. He paid approximately $35,000 for a private study conducted by Landmark
Engineering to see whether the whole area could be lifted as required by the Village of Midlothian; it
turned out the area could not be lifted. What can be done is to give up additional units for retention; then
by proximity the residents on Ridgeway and Springfield may be relieved of having to pay for flood
msurance.
Commissioner Sims asked if basements are being built.
Mr. Sipowicz replied that the FIMA requirement is to build crawl space or slab on grate. They are
building crawl space.
Commissioner Collins asked for clarification on the term " lifting" from the fl ood plain and whether it
floods there.
Mr. Sipowicz replied that while it has never flooded, the property is in the Midlothian River flood plain
and further he stated that they plan to bring in fill and build up the area. He stated that by the time the
engineering plan is through, they may be down to 64 or 62 units.
Chairman Sims stated that some of the people in the South Suburbs are paying astronomical flood
insurance premiums, but FIMA will not lift the residents.
Commissioner Collins wanted it stated for the record that this development would minimize the chance of
flooding to its residents.

Commissioner Moreno, seconded by Commissioner
Communication No. 265624. The motion carried.

of

THORN CREEK BASIN SANITARY DISTRICT (NO CASH BID REQUEST).
Transmitting a Communication from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Finance Tax Delinquency
Subcommittee, submitting a request from Kathleen Field Orr & Associates, Attorney.
I serve as Special Counsel to the Thom Creek Basin Sanitary District (the " District") and I
am writing to you on behalf of its Board of Trustees. The District is a duly organized and
existing governmental entity created under the provisions of the lllinois Sanitary District Act
of 1917. The District provides sanitary and waste water services to the City of Chicago
Heights, the Village of Crete, the Village of Homewood, the Village of Park Forest, the
Village of Steger and the Village of South Chicago Heights. The District is authorized by
law to levy ad valorem real estate taxes to accomplish its mission.
The District is attempting to obtain title on the Subject Properties in order to complete its
Wet Weather Retention Facility (the " Facility") that will temporarily store water during
heavy rainstonns. The EPA requires construction of wet weather retention facilities to
prevent overflow problems into streams and rivers in adverse weather conditions. The
Facility will be built on District property but the Subject Properties are required to bring
underground lines from the Facility to the District's main treatment faci lity at 700 West End
Avenue.

2617

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

The Facility will benefit several municipalities and citizens of the District by preventing
overflow problems. Preventing pollutants from entering into natural waterways while
simultaneously preventing unnecessary flooding throughout the area will serve to
compliment and enhance ongoing redevelopment efforts within the south suburban region.
Acquisition of the Subject Properties is imperative to meet current environmental standards
imposed by the EPA and to acquire available grant funds for the overall project.
The District is hereby submitting its application to the Cook County No Cash Bid Program,
and is including the following documents for your review.
I.

An original copy of Resolution Number 03-04 adopted by the Board of Trustees of the
Thorn Creek Basin Sanitary District requesting a no-cash bid on the Subject Properties
by the County of Cook; and

2.

Resolution Number 2003-08 adopted by the Town of Bloom supporting the
submission of the District's application to the County of Cook; and

3.

A title commitment for each of the Subject Properties; and

4.

A Sidwell Map of the area identifying the Subject Properties; and

5.

Photographs depicting each of the Subject Properties.

As required under the program, the District will provide for legal counsel, will bear all cost
associated with acquisition of the Subject Properties and will meet all necessary reporting
requirements.
Robert Marisco, Assistant State' s Attorney, State's Attorney's Office, stated that the Thorn Creek Basin
Sanitary District does not fall within the County 's definition off! municipality. Bloom Township can
acquire the property for Thom Creek and it can be turned over to Thom Creek as a third party. The Board
needs to contingently approve Thorn Creek' s no-cash bid.
Commissioner Collins asked if the Sanitary District is a public entity.
Mr. Marisco replied in the affinnative, but clarified that Cook County' s ordinance states it is not a
municipality.
Joseph Montana, of Kathleen Field Orr & Associates, stated that he serves as special counsel to the Thorn
Creek Basin Sanitary District. The Sanitary District has put in the request for these three parcels of
property because they lie next to its wet water retention facility and treatment plant. They need this
property to lay piping to divert overflow water from the sewers and to separate the wet water from the
sewage water (set up a stonn water treatment facility). This is an EPA requirement. The lllinois EPA has
agreed to provide a low-interest loan to build the facility and lay the pipe. Bloom Township passed a
resolution in 2003 supporting the Sanitary District's application, but they have since learned that Bloom
Township needs to make the application. Bloom Township has agreed to pass a resolution when they
meet this Tuesday, passing the No Cash Bid on behalf of the third-party, the Thorn Creek Basin Sanitary
District. They would then convey the title to the Thom Creek Basin Sanitary District.
Chainnan Sims asked whether Chicago Heights would be affected.

2618

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004
Mr. Montana replied in the affirmative, adding also that Crete, Homewood, Park Forest, Steger, and
South Chicago Heights would be affected.
Chainnan Sims asked whether Ford Heights and Robbins would be affected.
Mr. Montana replied in the negative, saying he believed they lie in the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District's jurisdictional plan.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether the County 's ordinance states that these entities must be listed.
Mr. Montana replied in the affinnative.
Commissioner Murphy suggested that perhaps the County 's definition of municipality should be
broadened.
Commissioner Butler asked whether Bloom Township defines the sanitary district as a municipality.
Commissioner Murphy replied that townships are included in Cook County's definition of municipality,
and they have the authority to turn over the property to the Thorn Creek Basin Sanitary District.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved the approval of
Communication No. 265625. Commissioner Peraica amended the motion pending approval by the
Bloom Township Board of Trustees passing a resolution supporting the third-party application for
the Thorn Creek Basin Sanitary District at their July 13th meeting. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called one of our nation' s legendary AfricanAmerican entrepreneurs from our midst, Paul Joseph King, Sr. ; and

2643

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 8, 2004

WHEREAS, born in 1915, and faced with the death of his father at just the age of three, Paul learned
early in life that life is not always fair; and
WHEREAS, after the passing of his father, Paul, along with his mother, Olivia, and twin sister, Marie,
moved to Chicago and settled on the city' s South Side; and
WHEREAS, the relocation sparked a rich legacy of hands-on community involvement and c1v1c
leadership that endures to this day. Moreover, it also planted the seeds for a relentless work ethic and
astute entrepreneurship in Paul; and
WHEREAS, when Paul ' s widowed mother married Charles Brown, Sr., the family expanded, with Paul
gaining three additional siblings: Charles Brown, Jr., Janet Brown and Vernon Brown. Paul 's position as
the eldest son in a large family contributed to his drive to be successful, for he felt that it was his
obligation to contribute to the fami ly's livelihood; and
WHEREAS, history would be made in 1935 when, at the age just twenty, Mr. King founded P.K.
Produce, C hicago's first African-American owned produce company. The demands mental and physical
were Herculean, requiring Paul to be "up and running" at 3:00 am each morning to purchase fruits and
vegetables from select farmers in Northern Indiana and from Chicago' s South Water Market. The
produce would be sold to households and stores on Chicago's South Side. Mr. King's timing was perfect
and he was able to address the needs of a large potential market that had previously been ignored; and
WHEREAS, another smart decision came in 1937 when Mr. King married Frances Ruth Lindsey, a
union that would last a remarkable 67 years, until Mr. King's passing. The marriage produced two
children, Paul Jr. and Claudia; and
WHEREAS, another turning point in Mr. King' s li fe came in 1944, with World War II ; as a result of Mr.
King' s valor and exceptional leadership ability, he would attain the rank of Corporal Sergeant; and
WHEREAS, when Mr. King returned from the war, he worked around-the-clock to nurture his business.
Realizing that he had an excellent idea, Mr. King expanded upon his concept and approached Chicago's
major food chains to see if they would be interested in carrying specialty produce items that were popular
in African-American households, items such as mustard and turnip greens, turnip tops, okra and Crowder
peas. He countered their reluctance by making them an offer too good to refuse: King promised to
provide the retailers with three units of each vegetable on Thursday, only requiring payment if the
products were sold by Monday. National Tea and A&P Food Stores accepted the offer and P.K. Produce
quickly became the exclusive supplier of produce for their stores located in African-American
communities; and
WHEREAS, with the passing of Paul Joseph King, Sr., we have lost a pioneering entrepreneur, civic
leader and role model. Mr. King was a man who served his country with distinction and helped to expand
opportunity for African-Americans and others in the business arena. His remarkable legacy of
achievement will forever resonate.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and
most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as the many friends and loved ones of Paul Joseph King,
Sr.; and
