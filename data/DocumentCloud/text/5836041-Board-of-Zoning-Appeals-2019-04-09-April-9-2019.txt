LEGAL DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY:

PROPOSAL:

Northland Provisioning Center, LLC appeals the decision of the Buildings
Safety Engineering and Environmental Department’s Special Land Use
Review dated October 31, 2018 which DENIED and states; the proposed
Medical Marihuana Provisioning Center facility site is located within 920 feet
of a “Religious Center” known as Greater Olivet Baptist Church located at
20201 Southfield in a B4 Zone (General Business District). This case is appealed
because appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person,
firm, partnership or corporation, or by any City department, commission,
board or other City agency which is aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing
officer, or 2) by any decision made by the Buildings and Safety Engineering
Department involving Conditional Uses. A medical Marihuana Provisioning
Center Facility must not be located within one thousand (1000) radial feet of
the zoning lot occupied by a Religious Institution, per section 61-3355(b)(3)(A). Also, the Medical Marihuana Provisioning Center facility site is
located within 920 feet of a “Religious Center” known as Greater Olivet Baptist
Church located at 20201 Southfield. (Sections 61-4-72 Appeals and Sec. 61-3355. Permitted districts for medical marihuana facilities; Conditional Uses;

Growrite Medical Supplies appeals the decision of the Buildings Safety
Engineering and Environmental Department’s Special Land Use Review dated
December 6, 2018 which DENIED and states; the subject property has been
identified as being within 1000 radial feet of a Drug Free Zone in a M4 Zone
(Intensive Industrial District). This case is appealed because appeals to the Board
of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person, firm, partnership or corporation,
or by any City department, commission, board or other City agency which is
aggrieved 1) by a decision of an enforcing officer, or 2) by any decision made by
the Buildings and Safety Engineering Department involving Conditional Uses.
Also, the Buildings, Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department shall not
approve any request under this Chapter for a medical marihuana caregiver
center in a Drug Free Zone. The locational specifications related to drug-free
zones of subsection 354(b)(1) of this section may not be waived or modified by
the Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department, nor the Board
of Zoning Appeals. Applications that are not consistent with the locational
specifications of subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be considered ineligible
and shall be dismissed. Also, the proposed MMCC located at 4505 Oakman Blvd.
has been identified as being in a Drug Free Zone (DFZ) based on its proximity to
Generators Club of Detroit located at 4244 Oakman. Generators Club of Detroit
is a legally, operating, youth center/school located within 1000 radial feet of the
subject property at 4505 Oakman, therefore becomes ineligible to establish a
Medical Marihuana Growers Faculty. (Sections 61-4-72 Appeals and 61-3354(b)(1) Sec. 61-3-354. Medical marihuana caregiver center procedures.).AP
