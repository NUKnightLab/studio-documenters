p. 6

 The trustees discussed whether the Fund has ever reviewed the accounts from members that might
never be paid out annuity benefits and, if refunds were issued, whether it would impact the unfunded
liability. It was noted that the actuary had already reviewed and adjusted the handling of this group
and that any additional modifications would likely have little to no impact on the unfunded liability.
The Board also discussed the need for obtaining additional hearing officers for the administrative
hearings the members requested.
The Executive Director stated that Trustee Robert Janura, the Forest Preserve annuitant member, had
submitted his resignation that morning and that it had been accepted. The Board would need to plan
for filling the vacancy as permitted by Section 9-187 of the Penions Code.
