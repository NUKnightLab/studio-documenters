Discussion: FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan

Background: In accordance with service agreements with Great Lakes Water Authority
(GLWA) member partners, charges for the next fiscal year are annually presented at the
end of January each year. To accommodate that schedule, the budget process for the GLWA
begins early in the fiscal year.
Analysis: At the Audit Committee meeting on a December 21, 2018, staff presented a
discussion draft of the FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan. This draft
focused on a) overall strategy of key budget elements including system-wide service
charges and b) proposed operating group budgets.
For continued discussion, the following materials are attached.

MEMORANDUM
FY 2020 Budget/Charge Planning Update
Executive Summary
To:

January 2, 2019

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
This memorandum has been prepared to summarize our updated observations regarding the
planning parameters and open issues impacting potential GLWA proposed budgets, cost of
service allocations, and water and sewer charges for FY 2020. Our initial perspectives on these
matters were set forth in a memorandum dated December 19, 2018, and reflected the status of
the budget request and analysis as of December 18, 2018. That document also provided some
background and history which remains pertinent. We’ll not repeat that material in this
discussion, but rather focus on introducing updated exhibits and discussing recent analyses and
developments.
Our analyses and presentation reflects the current version of the FY 2020 budget and financial
plan as of January 2, 2019. In effect, this produces a fifth scenario (Scenario “E”) that appends
the four sequential scenarios presented in the prior memorandum. The principal focus areas of
the review over the past two weeks have included:
•
•
•
•

Ongoing due diligence on the original budget request;
Detailed analyses of budget responsibility for the Water and Sewer funds for
Centralized Services and Administrative Services operating expenses;
Modifications to the capital outlay budget, including the funding source;
Incorporation of additional capital improvement program financing plan analyses.

As a reminder, here are the scenarios.
A. Original plan from 2nd year of the FY 2019 Biennial Budget
B. Updated forecast resulting from the Series 2018 bond sale results
C. Initial planning level budget targets
D. Working version of budget as of 12/18/18
E. Working version of budget as of 1/2/2019

As indicated in the exhibit, the additional review has not produced material changes between
Scenarios D and E. The total FY 2020 GLWA operating expense budget request has not
changed, and the allocation between Water and Sewer has only resulted in a minor shift of
approximately $150,000. This minor adjustment in total should not be interpreted as an
indication that “no changes” were made as a result of the ongoing review. Rather, the detailed
review of Water and Sewer expenses produced adjustments that went “both ways” and that
netted in a total change of $150,000 compared to the prior version. The shift in operating
expense between Scenarios D and E is directly accommodated with a corresponding shift in
planned I&E / reserve deposits, as none of the other elements, including the overall revenue
requirement increase of 3.5%, have been adjusted as part of the additional review to date.
To summarize, the current version of the budget request (expressed as Scenario E) compared
to the original, baseline scenario, assumes:
• 3.5% revenue requirement increase;
• 4% O&M budget increase;
o Overall increase from 2.0% to 4.0% attributable to lower shared services credit
from DWSD and new projects in the Planning Group

o Differential Water / Sewer increases reflecting the detailed review of specific
Centralized and Administrative Services programs
Lower charge increases than revenue requirement increases due to recognition of
higher forecasted investment income.
o Direct result of recognizing benefits of active investment strategies
Recognition of debt service savings achieved via the Series 2018 bond sales.
o Resulting increase in “bottom line” results
Slight reduction in Sewer charge increase of lower impact of Highland Park bad
debt requirements.
Slight reduction in overall combined charge increase
o Lower overall reduction in forecasted “bottom line” results, and a reallocation
between Water and Sewer.
o These figures are approximately $5 million higher (for both Water and Sewer)
than those in the feasibility forecasts established at the creation of the Authority

As noted above, significant review efforts have been applied towards refining the manner by
which budgeted operating expenses of the Centralized Services group have been assigned to
Water and Sewer. This group includes major planning and asset management activities, some
of which are discretely related to one utility or the other. For instance, the budget request for
the Systems Analytics cost center includes several contracts to support sewer collection system
modelling and wastewater metering analyses. These costs are appropriately directly assigned
to the Sewer Fund. Similarly, the budget request for the Field Service Operations cost center
includes specific contracts to address investigation and repair of Water transmission mains,
and other contracts to address investigation and repair of Sewer interceptors. The costs of
those specific contracts should also be directly assigned to the appropriate fund. Together with
the Financial Planning and Analysis team we have conducted a detailed investigation of each
of the major cost centers, and have assigned discrete activities directly to Water and Sewer
budget responsibilities based on our review. All other “general” Centralized Services budgeted
costs have been assigned 50% to Water and 50% to Sewer1. All Administrative Services
budgeted costs have also been assigned 50% to Water and 50% to Sewer. The table below
compares the operating budget request for Scenarios D and E.

The System Control Center budgeted costs are assigned 55% to Water and 45% to Sewer based on discussions
with System Control Center managers.

FY 2020 Planning – Ongoing Review
The current “working version” scenario introduced above remains under review, including
specific departmental budget requests. In addition, several parallel investigations regarding
cost of service allocations that could impact how the proposed budget / charges impact
individual Customers remain ongoing. These include:
• Ongoing review of the most appropriate assignment of “Centralized Services” and
“Administrative Services” support costs to the Water and Sewer funds, and to cost
pools within those funds;
o Effectively complete pending final review
• The potential operating agreement with OMID, and the impact of such on the GLWA
revenue requirements and revenue requirement allocations to OMID and to other Sewer
Customers;
• Updated capital financing plans, including the aforementioned modifications to the
capital outlay budget;

Incorporation of additional capital improvement program financing plan analyses;
The impact on Water cost of service allocations and charges of:
o The contract alignment project (CAP) and the impact on suburban wholesale
master metered units of service;
o The incorporation of the UoS study phase 2 findings regarding units of service
for non-master metered Customers (Detroit, Dearborn, Highland Park)
Incorporation of DWSD Local System budgets and financial plans;
Budget and cost allocation impacts of potential changes in the GLWA / DWSD
definitions of:
o Transmission / distribution main responsibility; and
o Service provided by DWSD to GLWA facilities

We continue diligent review on each of these issues and in our preparation of the FY 2020
Cost of Service Study and the accompanying proposed wholesale service charges for FY 2020.
We are prepared to discuss this matter at your convenience.

 Discussion Draft
Budget & Five-Year Plan One Pager
FY 2020 through FY 2024
As of January 3, 2019
FY 2020 Budget Year Highlights
The proposed revenue requirement (i.e.
budget) overall increase is 3.5%. The impact
of that budget increase on service charges is
partially offset by an improved investment
earnings program. The result water supply
charges increase estimated at 1.6% and
sewer system service charges at 2.1% on a
system-wide basis.1

Combined Sewer Overflow Condition
Assessment, Calibration, and Preventative
Maintenance Program ($470k) for various
meters in each of the CSO facilities.
Reduced Shared Services ($3.1 million)
information technology reimbursement due
to planned separation of systems. The staff
and contractual resources will be reassigned
to meet GLWA’s growing technology needs.

New FY 2020 Budget Items

Long-term Financial Plan

The Operations & Maintenance budget
increase of $12.5 million includes several new
initiatives.

Commitment to sound financial planning
requires a long-term focus. The GLWA Board
adopts a biennial budget with the added
insight of an accompanying five-year financial
plan. This supports financial stability and
reduces surprises. The long-term plan’s goal
is to limit overall operations and maintenance
expenses increases to no more than 2%.

One Water Institute ($1.2 million) to expand
educational opportunities and service sector
expertise for GLWA and its Member-Partners
throughout the region.
Comprehensive Corrosion Control Optimization
Study ($1.1 million) at each of the five water
treatment plants demonstrating GLWA’s
proactive approach to providing water of
unquestionable quality.
Capital Program Management process,
technology, and staff development project
($1.3 million). Potential award of a contract
in February 2019 will also provide capital
project delivery support services.
Transmission System Pipe Integrity Program
(TSIP) ($2.0 million) for the water system to
minimize both the probability and
consequence of pipeline failures with a
strategic risk-based approach to pipe
renewal.
Collection System Modeling and Monitoring
($1.5 million) to create alternative control
strategies in the wastewater collection
system.

1

Capital Improvement Program
GLWA’s five-year capital improvement
program (CIP) is available on GLWA’s
website. The CIP cycle aligns with the timing
of the five-year financial plan by design. The
CIP is the outcome of extensive staff effort
and stakeholder participation.
To fund the CIP, GLWA’s annual revenue
requirement includes a contribution of $56.6
million or 7% of customer charges to fund a
partial pay-as-you go approach. This strategy
is designed to lower GLWA’s debt burden,
improve affordability, and lower the cost of
debt in the future. To provide perspective, FY
2020 budgeted debt service of $354.7 million
is equal to 44% of service charges. It is not
expected that GLWA will need to return to the
market for water system borrowing until FY
2022 and the latter half of FY 2020 for the
sewer system.

Individual member partner charges will vary.

 Shared Services
Budget & Five-Year Plan
FY 2020 through FY 2024

Shared Services
The GLWA and DWSD leverage economies of scale, assets, technology, and expertise by sharing
services. The shared services agreement, dated December 1, 2015, is available at
http://www.glwater.org/board/organizational-documents/ .
The shared services billing process began in FY 2016 and was new to both entities. The process is
subject to manual tabulation until appropriate systems are in place. To best facilitate the tracking
of expenses, the GLWA has designed its general ledger system to manage the budget and
accumulate costs via a “contra” account in each cost center that matches the source of the expense
(hence the contra amounts are shown as negative amounts). The net effect on the cost center
expense is zero which preserves the basis appropriate cost allocation. Amounts charged to DWSD
for services are recorded in a manner consistent with other vendor expenses.
Biennial Budget Request
The biennial budget reflects an overall decrease in FY 2020 as a result of several shared services
nearing completion in the information technology and systems analytics areas. The GLWA and
DWSD are continuing to evaluate operational goals.

 Capital Outlay
Budget & Five-Year Plan
FY 2020 through FY 2024

The Great Lakes Water Authority assures effective operational flexibility, while controlling
spending and optimizing the cost of capital. This is accomplished by utilizing four categories in
GLWA’s Capital Financial Plan for funding both “Capital Outlay” and the “Capital Improvement Plan”
(CIP) which are listed below.

Items identified as “capital outlay” are assets that are purchased and are both above the dollar
threshold for capitalizing on the financial statements (i.e. over $5,000) and are an asset that should
be tagged and tracked for internal control purposes. In both instances, the assets have an estimated
useful life of more than one year.
Capital outlay includes vehicles, shop, lab, plant and field equipment, office furniture and
equipment, as well as software and hardware. Generally capital outlay items have a life of less than
20 years. Capital Outlay items are not included in the “Capital Improvement Program” (CIP). The
CIP focuses on longer lived constructed assets with a useful life greater than 20 years.
Many of the tables in this section present an entity-wide view of GLWA’s capital outlay. This is
because some capital outlay is subject to cost sharing between the water and sewer systems.
Examples of this include fleet, centralized services and facilities, and information technology.

 Capital Outlay
Budget & Five-Year Plan
FY 2020 through FY 2024

Since assets are replaced on a periodic basis, annual expenditures may not be consistent. In
addition, some capital outlay projects span several years and five-year planning documents.
Examples of these projects include the following.
 The replacement of the security perimeter fencing and electronic components around all
GLWA facilities. This project is scheduled to run from FY 2018 through FY 2022 replacing
approximately 20% of these assets each year at an average annual projected cost of $1.4
million.
 Instrumentation & control hardware and software for the wastewater system. This project
is forecast for FY 2019 through FY 2022 at an average annual cost of $4.0 million.
 GLWA enterprise wide software systems. The forecast replacement of these systems is
scheduled from FY 2019 through FY 2022 at an average annual cost of $3.1 million.
 Facility renovations such as the data center move. This project is expected to run from FY
2020 through FY 2022 at an average annual cost of $1.0 million.
Funding Sources
The Capital Outlay expenditures are proposed to be $35.1 million for FY 2020, and $33.6 million for
FY 2021. As shown in Table 1, Capital Outlay is funded by two primary sources: Operations &
Maintenance (O&M) and Improvement & Extension (I&E) funds.
Operations & Maintenance: Capital outlay items funded by the O&M Fund are paid for with
current year revenues. The nature of these items is recurring so the impact on charges from yearto-year is not significant.
Improvement & Extension: Capital outlay items funded by the I&E Fund are paid for with
revenue financed capital carried over from prior years. The nature of these items is not necessarily
recurring each year. They are instead replaced on a longer-term cycle or are unique to a three to
five-year planning horizon.

BACKGROUND
Both Michigan Law, MCL 141.434 and Section 7.02 of the GLWA Model Water Contract

Section 7.02 provides:

Page 25

 “Notification of Rates. As soon as possible in the ratemaking process, the
Board shall provide information on proposed rates and the draft data and
information used in the calculation of proposed rates in a format that will
enable Customer to assist in the ratemaking process. Not less than thirty
calendar days prior to the hearing required by Act 279, the Board shall
provide Customer with written notice of a proposed rate and the
underlying data used to calculate the rate. The Board shall meet with
Customer to review the rate and the data.”
JUSTIFICATION
Act 279 provides that a water or sewerage system which serves more than 40% of the
population must hold at least one public hearing at least 120 days before a proposed rate
increase is scheduled to take effect. The hearing(s) must be conducted in compliance
with the Open Meetings Act (OMA). Notice of the time, date and place of each hearing
must be in compliance with the OMA and must be mailed to each city, village or township
served by the system not less than 30 days before each hearing.
Although Act 279 does not currently apply to GLWA operations, counsel has advised that
GLWA should continue to abide by the notice requirements of Act 279 as the most faithful
interpretation of the contract requirements.
BUDGET IMPACT
A Public Hearings on a Proposed FY 2020 Schedule of Charges and FY 2020 & FY 2021
Biennial Budget Request are necessary for the establishment of a current budget and
schedule of charges effective July 1, 2019.

2018, with discussions to be held at subsequent Audit Committee meetings. In addition,
