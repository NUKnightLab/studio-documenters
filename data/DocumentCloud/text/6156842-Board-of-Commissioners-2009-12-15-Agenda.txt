RESOLUTION
SCHOOL SOUND INSULATION PROGRAM
WHEREAS, quality education is crucial for the future of not only a free and democratic society but also
of the very community in which a school is located; and
WHEREAS, Ridgewood High School has spent 50 years being dedicated to serving the youth of
Norridge and Harwood Heights and instilling in all of its students the desire to succeed in their future
endeavors by emphasizing that every student can learn and become a productive member of society; and
WHEREAS, a proper learning environment is essential to the productivity of a classroom, and that
protection from external noise is a reasonable expectation for such an environment; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is a member of the O’Hare Noise Compatibility Commission (ONCC), and is
aware that Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School and Carpenter Elementary School in Park
Ridge, qualified for sound insulation in 2004, and that despite the continuing noise imposed on them by
the air traffic from O’Hare International Airport (O’Hare), none of those schools has joined the ranks of
the 117 schools that have been awarded the benefit of sound insulation under the ONCC School Sound
Insulation Program; and
WHEREAS, the eligibility rules for sound insulation were changed in 2005 from an 8-hour 45 Leq (8)
(Equivalent Continuous Sound Level) to 60 DNL (a 24-hour day-night noise average) and, Ridgewood
High School, despite having qualified for sound insulation under the requirements that existed at the time
they were tested, was pushed off of the eligibility list by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); and
WHEREAS, since that time, the members of the ONCC have consistently and diligently worked for the
reinstatement to the insulation program of Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School, and
Carpenter Elementary School and believe that the students of these schools deserve the same learning
environment provided to the 117 schools around O’Hare that benefit from sound-insulation.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, urge that the FAA reverse its rulings and grant Ridgewood High School, Elk Grove High School
and Carpenter Elementary School in Park Ridge sound insulation so that their students can learn under the
same advantageous conditions as the 117 schools that have received this work.

RESOLUTION
VETERAN PTSD SCREENING AND BENEFIT FAIRS
WHEREAS, it is estimated that more than 300,000 of the nearly 2 million U.S. servicemen and women
deployed since 9/11 suffer from the often debilitating condition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
with symptoms that include feelings of intense distress, nightmares, emotional numbness, relationship
problems, trouble sleeping, sudden anger, and drug and alcohol abuse; and
WHEREAS, the number of cases of PTSD is expected to climb as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
continue, and could ultimately exceed 500,000, according to a new study by researchers at Stanford
University; and
WHEREAS, mental health experts say PTSD is the primary reason suicides in the military are at an alltime high; 256 soldiers took their own lives in 2008, the highest number since that data was first tracked,
in 1980; and
WHEREAS, the economic downturn is hitting Iraq and Afghanistan veterans harder than other workers,
as one in nine are now unemployed; and
WHEREAS, in April 2009, the jobless rate for veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was 11.2%
while the corresponding rate for non-veterans was 8.8%; and
WHEREAS, there is a crisis with our young veterans who are in need of metal health services and
employment assistance; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been aggressively building “collaborative
relationships” with non-profits, veterans organizations, doctors and hospitals to reach out to veterans to
offer information and services and Cook County should join in the national effort by reaching out to local
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, does
hereby direct the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission to work with Cook County
Commissioners, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans organizations, area hospitals and notfor profit organizations to organize PTSD screening and benefit fairs for veterans, in each of the 17
districts of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission shall
coordinate PTSD screening and benefit fairs in each Commissioner district every two years. The
fairs should include employers seeking candidates for employment, assistance with developing
resumes, mental health screenings, information on follow-up mental health services, and
information regarding veterans insurance and other benefits; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the PTSD screening and benefit fairs shall be located at Illinois
National Guard armories. If there is no armory in a commissioner’s district or if the armory is
unavailable, the Cook County Veterans Assistance Commission shall work with the specific
commissioner’s staff to find a suitable location.

RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the largest flood in over 50 years has caused human anguish and material devastation to
County Cork, Ireland; and
WHEREAS, the flooding has caused businesses to close; destroyed homes; washed out roadways and
deluged farmland; and
WHEREAS, parts of several newly constructed buildings and their contents, including the Cork County
Hall, the Cork County Library, the Western Gateway and the Glucksman Gallery at University College
Cork, have been waterlogged and ruined; and
WHEREAS, over the course of eleven years, County Cork has been Cook County’s Sister County; and
WHEREAS, the Cork County Council and Cook County Government have conducted many successful
business and cultural trade missions which have generated significant advances in business development
in the IT, biotechnology, government, tourism, family business and craft sectors; and
WHEREAS, stories of County Cork’s civic leaders and residents pulling together to face, with resolve,
the challenges of coping with the damage and coordinating reconstruction efforts are an inspiration to all.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Todd H. Stroger, President of the Cook County
Board of Commissioners, on behalf of the more than five million residents of Cook County, do hereby
express my deep sympathy to our Sister County, County Cork at the human upheaval and material ruin
that this deluge has wrought upon their residents, and do so wish County Cork great strength, endurance

COMMISSIONERS BEAVERS AND STEELE VOTED "NO".
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 18, 2009 from
EARL L. DUNLAP, Transitional Administrator, Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Isaac Ray Center (IRC),
Chicago, Illinois, for mental health services for residents of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
(JTDC) in a manner that is consistent with the National Commission on Correction Health Care
(NCCHC), the American Correctional Association (ACA) and the requirements set forth in a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) approved by the Federal District Court in the case of Doe v. Cook
County, Case No. 99 C 3945, and in the extension of the Memorandum of Agreement through the
Modified Implementation Plan (MIP). Services rendered shall be performed in accordance with the
requirements of the MIP and shall include intake screening, management of acute and chronic mental
health conditions, referrals to psychiatric hospitals, mental health treatment for JTDC residents and
administrative functions. IRC personnel assigned to the JTDC shall include a Director of Services,
psychiatrists and clinical psychologists and may include advanced practice nurses, physician assistants,
registered nurses, psychometricians, social workers, information technology specialists, support staff,
Fellows engaged in post-graduate clinical training programs under appropriate supervision and any other
appropriate personnel. In addition, IRC shall continue to prepare appropriate policies and procedures for
services at the JTDC which comply with the changing requirements of the Juvenile Standards of the
NCCHC and ACA accreditation standards.
Reason:

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the Agreed Order appointing a Transitional Administrator, Doe v.
Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its
authority as established in the Court Order entered on August 14, 2007, has selected Isaac Ray
Center (IRC) to provide mental health services to residents of the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC). Currently, IRC provides mental health services to JTDC residents
in conjunction with the Mental Health Services for Cermak Health Services of Cook County,
Contract No. 06-45-574. Cermak Health Services of Cook County is in the process of making
changes to its Mental Health Services program, and intends to do a Request for Proposal
(RFP) for mental health services. Because of the existing relationship that IRC currently has
with the JTDC, the Office of the Transitional Administrator, in its authority, has chosen to
retain Isaac Ray Center as its mental health services provider for JTDC residents. This
decision was made in an effort to avoid any disruption in mental health services to the JTDC
residents. The current contract with Cermak Health Services of Cook County is scheduled to
end on August 31, 2010; however, this contract does not currently provide the necessary level
of services as required by the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and the Modified
Implementation Plan (MIP) in the Doe v. Cook County, Case No. 99 C 3945. The new
contract will provide the appropriate level of staffing to enable the Cook County Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center to come into compliance with mental health care objectives as
outlined in the MOA and MIP. The contract will be performance based, and will be renewed
annually if performance requirements are achieved. The performance measurements will be
determined collaboratively by the Office of the Transitional Administrator and Isaac Ray
Center, and will be outlined in the contractual agreement.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $16,319,621.00 (FY 2010: $3,905,747.00; FY 2011: $4,019,559.00; FY 2012:
$4,136,786.00; and FY 2013: $4,257,529.00). Contract period: December March 1, 2009 2010 through
November 30, 2013. (440-272 Account). Requisition No. 04400003.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Years 2011, 2012 and 2013 funds.
