EMORANDUM

TO: Mr. David Whitaker, Director, Legislative Policy Division

THROUGH: Council President Brenda Jones

FROM: Council President Pro Tempore Mary She?iel 5N7
DATE: March 13, 2019
RE:

Resolution in Support of the House Bill No. 4326 and expanding ?Ban the
Box? Legislation Statewide

 

I have been a vocal advocate for putting our citizens to work and creating job opportunities for
Detroiters. Our returning citizens deserve a chance to ?nd gain?Jl employment without the
impediment of the criminal history question during the application process.

On March 7?h State Representative Johnson introduced House Bill No.4326 also known
as the ?Job Applicant Criminal History Act.? The bill would prohibit both public and private
employers from inquiring about an applicant?s criminal history during the application process.
Enacting ?Ban the Box? legislation on the state level would expand employment and employment

training opportunities for Detroiters. Therefore, I am requesting that a resolution be drafted in
support of House Bill No. 4326.

Thank you.
