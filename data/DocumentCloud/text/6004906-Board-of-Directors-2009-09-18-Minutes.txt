Directors Meeting of August 26, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, September 4, 2009
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Lyne, moved the approval of the minutes of the Finance
Committee Meeting of September 4, 2009.
During the discussion of the minutes, Director Carvalho stated that there was an additional amendment
needed for request number 18, contained within the Contracts and Procurement Approvals. At that
meeting, the Finance Committee had recommended approval of a request to increase and amend the
contract with David Gomez & Associates for executive search firm services. There is an additional
position for which their recruitment services are needed, therefore, Director Carvalho stated that he would
be making a motion to amend request number 18 to reflect this change.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved to separate request number 18, under the
Contracts and Procurement Approvals, from the minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting of September
4, 2009. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved the approval of the minutes of the Finance
Committee Meeting of September 4, 2009, with the exception of request number 18 under the Contracts
and Procurement Approvals. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Ansell, moved the approval of request number 18 under the
Contracts and Procurement Approvals with the following amendments: to amend the total amount of the
increase requested from $80,000.00 to $100,000.00; and to include the recruitment of a Director of Internal

VI. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Proposed Severance Policy for certain executive level positions
Mr. Foley provided the Board with a summary of the proposed Severance Policy. In this policy, they are
proposing that a three-month severance payment be provided to eligible key executive employees in order
to facilitate the recruitment and retention of qualified, experienced individuals for critical leadership
positions.
Director Lyne, seconded by Director Greenspan, moved to approve the proposed Severance Policy. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
VII. Action Items
A. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
It was noted that request number 4 was being withdrawn from consideration, and Mr. Foley stated that
request number 5 would be discussed in closed session.
Ms. Duffy provided information on the other requests submitted for the Board’s consideration. Stephen
Locke, Project Director for the Cermak information technology project, presented information on request
number 3.
Mr. Ayres presented information on request number 7. This request is presented as an alternative to
request number 4, which was withdrawn. Both requests relate to the performance of eligibility services for
the System. Initially, MedAssets was going to subcontract with Chamberlin Edmonds & Associates, Inc.
for the provision of those services, however, difficulties arose in the negotiations. As a result of this, the
request presented for the Board’s consideration is for the System to contract directly with Chamberlin
Edmonds & Associates, Inc. for these services.
Director Carvalho stated that this issue will be reviewed further in the Finance Committee at the next
meeting. Additionally, he stated that one of the current eligibility vendors, Great Lakes Medicaid Inc.,
would be presenting an update on their efforts at the next Finance Committee meeting.
Director Carvalho, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of the Contract and Procurement
Items with the following conditions and exceptions: approval of request number 7 is conditional, pending
review by the County’s Office of Contract Compliance; with the exception of request number 4, which was
withdrawn; and with the exception of request number 5, which will be discussed in closed session. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

permits closed meetings for consideration of “the appointment, employment, compensation, discipline,
performance, or dismissal of specific employees of the public body or legal counsel for the public body,
