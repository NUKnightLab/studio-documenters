 Auditor Communications
To the Board of Directors
Chicago Infrastructure Trust

We have audited the financial statements of Chicago Infrastructure Trust

for the period ended December 31, 2013 and have issued our report thereon dated July 17,
2014. Professional standards require that we provide you with information about our
responsibilities under general accepted accounting standards, as well as certain information
related to the planned scope and timing of our audit. We have communicated such
information in our letter to you dated April 28, 2014. Professional standards also require that
we communicate to you the information in the following pages that is related to our audit.

 Auditor Communications (Continued)

Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices
Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant
accounting policies used by the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (“CIT”) are described in Note 2 to the
financial statements. We noted no transactions entered into by CIT during the year for which there is a

lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. All significant transactions have been recognized in the
financial statements in the proper period.

8

 Auditor Communications (Continued)

Management Judgment and Estimates
Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are
based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance
to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ
significantly from those expected.

We have evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop these estimates in determining
that they are reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.

9

 Auditor Communications (Continued)

Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management in performing and completing our
audit.

Disagreements with Management
For purposes of this communication, a disagreement with management is a financial accounting,
reporting, or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the
financial statements or the auditor’s report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose
during the course of our audit.

10

 Auditor Communications (Continued)

Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements
Professional standards require us to accumulate all misstatements identified during the audit, other than
those that are clearly trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. No such
material misstatements were noted.

In addition, none of the uncorrected misstatements detected as a result of the audit procedures were
material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole.
Management has passed on these adjustments, which are listed in the packet provided.

11

 Auditor Communications (Continued)

Other Audit Findings or Issues
We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing
standards, with management on an on-going basis. These discussions occur in the normal course of our
professional relationship and there were no matters of significant discussion that affected our retention as CIT’s

auditors.

Management Representations
We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management
representation letter.

 Retrofit 2.0: Aquatic Centers

Pool Efficiency Retrofit
Program
description

Catalyst

• Perform comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades for up to 141 aquatic centers
managed by Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Park District

• Aquatic centers consume a substantial amount of energy, both in the form of
natural gas and electricity, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year in
order to maintain the appropriate operating conditions
• Managing an indoor pool area is very complex and requires ongoing monitoring
and adjustment between the internal and external temperatures, humidity levels,
structure types, ventilation, pool water chemistry and equipment
• Obtaining the most effective equipment requires a high up-front capital cost

CIT’s
Value

• CIT attracted an unsolicited proposal that includes an innovative idea as well as
private sector capital and implementation
• CIT completed an Open Bidding Process (OBP) with private firms and negotiated
best value, including off-credit financing
• CIT can work across City Departments and Sister Agencies to aggregate pools

Impact

• Achieves Mayor’s 2015 Sustainability Goal #4 – Improve overall energy
efficiency in municipal buildings by 10%
• Reduced operating costs and enhanced reliability of operations

• Leads by example in energy efficiency for other sectors across the city
• Demonstrates value of unsolicited proposal process

• Leverage lighting system as a platform to provide additional public good and City
revenue opportunities

BEFORE

• Privately finance the project through energy and operational savings
• City seeks to reduce structural costs and energy consumption

Catalyst

• Cost and quality of LED lights have improved dramatically in recent years, and
lighting companies like Philips and others are providing lighting-as-a-service
• CDOT sponsored a “White Light LED” pilot and requested equipment
demonstrations

CIT’s
Value

AFTER

• CIT will pursue a Lighting-as-a-Service Agreement, reducing overall City costs
• CIT will evaluate other platform opportunities for their costs and benefits and
develop a business case for attractive opportunities
• CIT will work across City Departments, Chicago Park District, and possibly CPS
• All outdoor lighting – street, walkway, and traffic – will be looked at
comprehensively
• CIT will negotiate with LED and network control firms to provide all of the upfront
capital and manage the installation process
• Achieve energy savings between 50% and 80% and reduce CO2 emissions

Impact

• Reduce outdoor lighting’s lifecycle costs (i.e., maintenance and energy)
• Improve ambient lighting
• Increase and enhance public good provision through platform technologies

STREET LIGHT AS A
PLATFORM
• Video
• Sound
• Security
• Meter-reading
• Etc.

 Infrastructure Trust Role in CTA 4G
DAS Project
Program
description

• Obtain cost-effective financing for the construction of a Next Generation Distributed
Antennae System “NG-DAS” in order to provide state-of-the-art 4G wireless service
for the CTA Red and Blue line Subway Stations and Tunnels
• Negotiate long-term 4G annual licensing contracts

Catalyst

• Mayor Emanuel has made full 4G wireless availability in Chicago’s subway system a
top transit policy objective
• CTA is currently negotiating with qualified respondents to design/build/install system
• The CTA currently projects to fund the entirety of the project through its annual
capital program, but cannot afford it

CIT’s
Value

Impact

• The Trust is identifying private financing models that will prove more cost-effective
for the CTA versus paying directly out of their capital improvement budget
• The Trust will work with wireless providers in developing new partnerships as part of
a 4G licensing contract with the CTA.
• Provide a superior transit experience for the 360,000+ daily riders on Chicago’s red
and blue lines by offering wireless services capable of supporting high-speed mobile
devices

• Address system safety by providing more reliable communication between CTA
personnel and emergency responders.
• Reduce capital outlays for CTA and preserve their budget dollars for other projects
• Pursue new hi-tech digital advertising platforms, including, touch screen interactive
and near field communication (NFC) advertising to enlarge revenue potential for the
CTA

Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)
Initiative
Description

• Implement a proven collections model for commercial clean energy finance that will
rapidly increase adoption within the City’s not-for-profit, commercial, and industrial
sectors

Catalyst

• City seeks to increase competitiveness by lowering the cost of conducting business
within City-limits
• City is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
• Market for commercial PACE booming elsewhere, helping Chicago become a fast
follower in opening market for longer-term EE and RE finance that stays with the
property
• Managing State, City, and County process to activate PACE collections

CIT’s Value

• Providing marketing and ongoing vetting of PACE projects
• Using a single, emerging financial instrument to reduce barriers and finance municipal,
not-for-profit/cultural institution, commercial, and home energy efficiency projects
• Aggregating retrofit projects across the city to increase scale, improve economics,
quicken pace, and heighten impact
• Achieve Mayor’s 2015 Sustainability Goal #3 – Improve Citywide energy efficiency by 5%

Impact

• Enables better private sector financing for private sector energy solutions without affecting
City taxes or credit
• Opens market for cost-effective capital investments that have longer paybacks
• Reduces exposure to natural gas and electricity price increases

 PACE Assessment Basics
• Backed directly by opt-in PACE assessments on individual property owners
‒ Cash flow neutral to City and County, does not impact credit or balance sheet
‒ Also off-Balance Sheet for property owners

• Resolves landlord / tenant split incentive problems
‒ Since PACE assessments are considered “property taxes,” payment of the PACE
assessment generally flows to the same party that benefits from the cost savings (in
most triple net or full service gross leases)
‒ Modified gross leases often need to append an energy-aligned lease provision first

• PACE lien takes a senior position to the mortgage
‒ Transfers automatically to the next property owner in case of sale
‒ Financiers are better secured in case of delinquency or default

‒ Lenders willing to offer lower interest rates for longer terms
‒ Mortgage lender must approve PACE lien
•

81 banks have approved senior PACE liens on their properties, and the list continues to grow

•

Ben Jackson, VP of Government Relations for the Illinois Bankers Association, confirmed his
group’s support for a commercial PACE program during a recent legislative meeting with the
Illinois Attorney General’s Office
