Opening remarks

meeting.
Approval of 7/12/2017 minutes
The 7/12/2017 MP SSA #14 meeting minutes were emailed to all Commissioners prior to the
meeting. Chair Patricia Nelson informed that copies of the Minutes from previous meeting are
available to all attendees. It was brought to the chairs attention, that during the July 12, 2017 meeting
a motion to approve the Lithuanian Human Services as a sole provider of SSA#14 was mad and
seconded. However no vote was taken. Therefore, voting has to be taken during this meeting.
Patricia Nelson recommended to approve the 7/12/2017 meeting minutes, as corrected with respect
to the sole service provider. A motion to accept the 7/12/2017 minutes, as corrected. Was made by
Stephanie Sherman-Ratliff and seconded by Cynthia Young. Minutes, as corrected, were accepted
unanimously by all commissioners in attendance.

 Approval of SSA#14 Sole-service provider for 2018.
Stephanie Sherman-Ratliff made a motion to approve Lithuanian Human Service Council of the
USA, Inc. as a sole service provider for Marquette Park SSA#14 for the year 2018. It was seconded
by Cynthia Young. The motion was approved unanimously by commissioners.
Incident Report
Incident Report was read by Ina Stankeviciene. During the months of July, August and
September, the Illinois Homeland Security addressed 966 security events of varied nature: there
were 315 security events in July, 313 – in August and 338 in September. 307 requests for assistance
came directly from the SSA#14 dispatch central, 635 calls – from the CPD dispatch. From July 1st
through September 30th, the Illinois Homeland Security addressed 422 (44%) calls regarding
loitering and disturbances of varied nature alone. Some were minor spats that were settled quickly
and amicably. Loitering seems to generate other more serious problems and the age group in many
instances is getting younger. Domestic violence is the second largest problem in this area – 94 (10%)
calls came in for help. Mostly, it is a violent confrontation between family or household members.
Assault was reported 7 times. Burglary alarm reported 68 times for all three months, burglary – 13
times. Battery – 25 times, robbery – 12 times, theft – 10. Suspicious activity, person or auto were
reported 48 times. Laud reports/Shots fired – 27. Weapons offence or person with a gun was
reported 35 times, person shot – 6 in July, 2 in August and 2 in September. The same three zones (3,
4 and 5) always require the greatest amount of effort, with zone 3 being the highest with 309 (32%)
incidents for the past three months. In many events, the Illinois Homeland Security assisted Chicago
Police, Fire Department as well as citizens of the area.

Financial Report
Financial report was presented by Joe Polikaitis. As of 10/17/2017, Money Market account
has $126,444.53 and Checking account has $50,448.96. for a total of $176,893.49. We estimate that
we will need approx. $61,000 for the security by the end of the year, in addtion to other expenses of
nearly $15,000. Before we start receiving collection in 2018, we need available cas in the amount of
$50,000. Thus, our financials are good to cover expenses by the time we start receiving 2018 first
tax collection revenue.
Expiration of SSA#14 Ordinance – re-establishment process
The present Marquette Park SSA#14 Ordinance expires at the end of 2018. Joe Polikaitis
explained that, in order to complete the application for renewal, extensive preparation is needed.
Thus, consultants are needed to assist in the preparation, studies and completion of the reports.
Today, we have such consultants and they will explain the process of renewal.
Presentation of community engagement strategy – Gina Caruso and Kimberly Bares of
PLACE Consulting, Inc.
Kimberly Bares explained, how the city changed legislation of expiration and termination of
the SSA. Previously, the City considered the SSA to be renewed in the last year. Now, the SSA
needs to do it in the third year. The SSA#14 already submitted to the City their Feasibility Study
requesting a renewal. The City will review and give an approval or denial. And the SSA needs

 Aldermen's support too. That is the first step. Signature collection can be done in the year when
renewal starts - in 2018. Kimberly also explained how the amount of money is calculated from
property taxes for the SSA. The SSA#14 renewal is not increasing any taxes for property owners of
this area.
Gina Caruso introduced herself and explained about the community engagement strategy.
PLACE has assisted numerous Chicago business districts with the process of creating and
reconstituting their Business Improvement Districts, known as Special Service Areas (SSAs) in
Chicago. PLACE Consulting will coordinate with LHS, the SSA#14 Commission and elected
officials to identity and enlist the participation of people in key leadership positions. Teams will be
created to guide and support the engagement strategy. She explained that there is a lot more that can
be done in this SSA#14, not only security. Place Consulting is looking forward to working with the
SSA#14.
Status of Surveillance Cameras
Surveillance camera status was updated by Joe Polikaitis. He informed how many operating
cameras we have and how it helped to catch intruders.
Comments by 8-th District Commander Ronald Pontecore
8-th District Commander Ronald Pontecore provided several facts about the 8-th District
police activities in the SSA#14 area. Commander urged everyone to call 911 if they see suspicious
activity or suspicious person. It will help to reduce crime in the area.
Comments by 17th Ward Aldermen
Aldermen David Moore commented that if the SSA#14 expands to some different area of
activity as PLACE Consulting is talking, they will be duplicating Alderman’s office job.
Community Input
The area residents expressed their view to what is going on in the Market Park area and
what can be done with the SSA#14.
Next Governing Commissioners Meeting
Next meeting is tentatively scheduled for February 7th, 2017.
Meeting closed at 8:55 pm.

Respectfully submitted by Ina Stankeviciene
