VETOES
ITEM #1
RECEIVED AND FILED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 22, 2009 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
In accordance with the authority granted to me by section 2-6008 of the Counties Code and for the
reasons stated herein, I hereby transmit to you my veto of an amendment made to the Home Rule County
Retailers' Occupation Tax (Chapter 74 Taxation, Article IV, Sections 74-150 through 74-152) passed by
the Board of Commissioners on May 19, 2009. Please place my veto message on the agenda for the next
meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, June 2, 2009.
Please be advised that I am exercising my veto authority as President of the Board of Commissioners and
hereby veto Item No. 5 from the May 19, 2009, Cook County Board Meeting Agenda wherein the Cook
County Board of Commissioners amended the Home Rule County Retailers' Occupation Tax reducing the
retailers' occupation tax to 1% effective, January 1, 2010 and further reducing said tax to .75% effective,
January 1, 2011.
As indicated to the Board of Commissioners on May 19, 2009 and evidenced by my own proposal, I
support reducing the County’s sales tax; however I object to radical reductions without understanding the
ramifications of such action. While I hereby veto the action of the Board of Commissioners on May 19,
2009, I continue to urge the Board of Commissioners to work with me and pass a reduction in the
County’s sales tax that is viable and made at the appropriate intervals with a complete understanding of
the revenues needed to fund County services.
I remain committed to continue to address this issue and reconsider reductions in the sales tax in a
responsible manner before the October 1, 2009 statutory deadline to alter the sales tax rate beginning
January 1, 2010.
For these reasons I urge you to reconsider your support of the repeal of the Cook County Retailers'
Occupation Tax.

WHEREAS, Cook County offers comprehensive benefits packages that include medical, dental, vision

performed, such as the State of North Carolina, the State of Ohio, the State of West Virginia, Orange
County, California, the City of Louisville, Kentucky, and the City of Raleigh, North Carolina, to name a
few; and
WHEREAS, Cook County could achieve savings of up to $2000 per ineligible dependent on an annual
basis.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that the Department of Risk Management conduct a no-cost to the County contingency
based comprehensive Dependent Eligibility Verification (DEV) review with the goal of identifying
dependents covered by the County’s healthcare and dental plans, who are no longer eligible and/or who
may qualify for Federal healthcare coverage in order to improve compliance with the County’s benefit
plans and realize significant savings.

respect to such sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States
Treasury, pursuant to which the County’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is

requirements to qualify to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury.
“Qualified Build America Bonds” means Build America Bonds that are “qualified bonds” within

price of Compound Accreted Value calculated to the date fixed for redemption, on November 15 (or such
other date as may be provided in the relevant Bond Order) of the years and in the amounts and subject to
such provisions as shall be set forth in the relevant Bond Order. The County covenants that it will redeem
Term Bonds pursuant to the mandatory redemption requirement for such Term Bonds and provide
Pledged Taxes accordingly.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earlier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of such Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in such order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds shall be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of such payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if
directed by the Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not
exceeding the amount of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a
price not exceeding par plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the
principal amount thereof shall be credited against the payment required on such next mandatory
redemption date.
The County shall provide the Trustee with written notice of such reduction, which notice shall be
given within thirty (30) days after such redemption or purchase, and the Trustee shall promptly give
written notice of the same to the Bondholders, in the manner hereinafter provided.
B.
Optional Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any Bonds
may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part on any date, at such
times and at such optional redemption prices (to as shall be determined by the Chief Financial Officer at
the time of the sale thereof. Such optional redemption prices shall be expressed as (i) a percentage of the
principal amount of Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds to be redeemed and or as a percentage
of the Compound Accreted Value of Capital Appreciation Bonds to be redeemed), provided that such
percentage shall not to exceed one hundred three percent (103.00%), plus, in the case of Current Interest
Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, accrued interest to the date of redemption, as determined by the Chief
Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof or (ii) the “Make-Whole Redemption Price” hereinafter
provided, or (iii) the “Extraordinary Optional Redemption Price” hereinafter provided. If less than all of

County and within any maturity by in the manner hereinafter provided. The terms and provisions for any

Make-Whole Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, any
Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part, on any
Business Day, at the “Make-Whole Redemption Price,” which is the greater of (i) one hundred percent
(100%) of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present value of the
remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Stated Maturity of the Bonds to be
redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on
which the Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Bonds are to be redeemed on a
semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at a rate which is equal
to or in excess of the adjusted Treasury Rate, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the Bonds
to be redeemed on the redemption date. The Chief Financial Officer shall confirm and transmit the MakeWhole Redemption Price on such dates and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such makewhole redemption.
D.
Extraordinary Optional Redemption. If so provided in the relevant Bond Order or
Indenture, the Bonds may be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the County, in whole or in part,
upon the occurrence of an Extraordinary Event, at the “Extraordinary Optional Redemption Price,” which
is the greater of: (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed and

Financial Officer shall confirm and transmit the Extraordinary Optional Redemption Price on such dates
and to such parties as shall be necessary to effectuate such extraordinary optional redemption.
E.
Redemption Procedure. The Bonds subject to redemption shall be identified, notice
given, and paid and redeemed pursuant to the procedures as follows.
1.

Redemption Notice. For a mandatory redemption of Term Bonds, unless otherwise
notified by the County, the Trustee shall proceed to redeem the Term Bonds without any
further order or direction from the County hereunder or otherwise. For an optional
redemption, the County shall, at least forty-five (45) days prior to any optional
redemption date (unless a shorter time period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such redemption date and of the principal amount and maturities of Bonds
to be redeemed.

2.

Selection of Bonds within a Maturity. Current Interest Bonds shall be redeemed only in
the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral multiples thereof, and Capital
Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000 Maturity
Amount and integral multiples thereof. For purposes of any redemption of less than all of
the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or portions of Bonds to be redeemed
shall be selected by lot by the Trustee for the Bonds of such maturity by such method of
lottery as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate; provided, that such lottery shall
provide for the selection for redemption of Bonds or portions thereof so that each $5,000
principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such Bond shall be as likely to
be called for redemption as any other such $5,000 Bond or $5,000 portion. The Trustee
shall make such selection (a) upon or prior to the time of the giving of official notice of
redemption, or (b) in the event of a refunding or defeasance, upon advice from the
County that certain Bonds have been refunded or defeased and are no longer Outstanding
as defined.

ITEM #21 cont’d
Alternatively, if so provided in the relevant Bond Order or Indenture, for purposes of any
redemption of less than all of the Bonds of a single maturity, the particular Bonds or
portions of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the Trustee pro-rata based upon the
aggregate principal amount thereof then Outstanding; provided, however, that the portion
of any Bond of a denomination of more than the minimum Authorized Denomination to
be redeemed shall be in the principal amount of an Authorized Denomination and that, in
selecting portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond
as representing that number of Bonds of said minimum Authorized Denomination which
is obtained by dividing the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed in part by said
minimum Authorized Denomination. If the Bonds are held in Book Entry Form at the
time of such redemption, the County shall direct the Trustee to instruct the Depository to
select the specific Bonds within such maturity for redemption pro-rata among such
Bonds. The County and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to insure
that the Depository properly selects such Bonds for redemption.
3.

4.

Official Notice of Redemption. The Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing
of the Bonds or portions of Bonds selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Unless
waived by the registered owner of Bonds to be redeemed, official notice of any such
redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the County by mailing the
redemption notice by first class U.S. mail not less than thirty (30) days and not more than
sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the
Bond or Bonds to be redeemed at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such
other address as is furnished in writing by such registered owner to the Trustee. All
official notices of redemption shall include the name of the Bonds and at least the
information as follows:
(a)

the redemption date;

(b)

the redemption price;, or in the case of a make-whole or extraordinary
optional redemption, a description of the formula by which the
redemption price shall be determined;

(c)

if less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a Series and of a particular
maturity are to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial
redemption of Bonds of a Series within such maturity, the respective
principal amounts) of the Bonds to be redeemed;

(d)

a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price will become
due and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for
redemption and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue from and after
said date; and

(e)

the place where such Bonds are to be surrendered for payment of the
redemption price, which place of payment shall be the office designated
for that purpose of the Trustee.

Conditional Redemption. Unless moneys sufficient to pay the redemption price of the
Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of such
notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said
redemption shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or
prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall
be of no force and effect, the County shall not redeem such Bonds, and the Trustee shall
give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such
moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.

5.

Bonds Shall Become Due. Official notice of redemption having been given as described,
the Bonds or portions of Bonds so to be redeemed shall, subject to the stated condition in
paragraph 4. immediately preceding, on the redemption date, become due and payable at
the redemption price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the County
shall default in the payment of the redemption price) such Bonds or portions of Bonds
shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Bonds for redemption in accordance
with said notice, such Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. The
procedure for the payment of interest due as part of the redemption price shall be as
herein provided for payment of interest otherwise due.

6.

Insufficiency in Notice Not Affecting Other Bonds; Failure to Receive Notice; Waiver.
Neither the failure to mail such redemption notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed,
to any particular registered owner of a Bond, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice
with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been properly given, failure of a
registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to invalidate, limit
or delay the effect of the notice or redemption action described in the notice. Such notice
may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond entitled to receive such notice,
either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by registered owners shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing
shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such
waiver. In lieu of the foregoing official notice, so long as the Bonds are held in book
entry form, notice may be given as provided in the Representation Letter, and the giving
of such notice shall constitute a waiver by the Depository and the book entry owner, as
registered owner, of the foregoing notice. After giving proper notification of redemption
to the Trustee, as applicable, the County shall not be liable for any failure to give or
defect in notice.

7.

New Bond in Amount Not Redeemed. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there shall be prepared for the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of like
Series and tenor, of Authorized Denominations, of the same maturity, and bearing the
same rate of interest in the amount of the unpaid principal.

8.

Effect of Nonpayment upon Redemption. If any Bond or portion of Bond called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, in the case of
Current Interest Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the redemption
date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so called for redemption; in the case
of Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a
relevant Indenture; and, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound
Accreted Value at such redemption date shall continue to accrue interest from such
redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital Appreciation Bond, or
portion thereof, so called for redemption.

9.

Bonds to Be Cancelled; Payment to Identify Bonds. All Bonds which have been
redeemed shall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.
Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other
transfer of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identifying, by
issue and maturity, the Bonds being redeemed with the proceeds of such check or other
transfer.

10.

Additional Notice. The County agrees to provide such additional notice of redemption as
it may deem advisable at such time as it determines to redeem Bonds, taking into account
any requirements or guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the Government Accounting Standards Board, or any other
federal or state agency having jurisdiction or authority in such matters; provided,
however, that such additional notice shall be (a) advisory in nature, (b) solely in the
discretion of the County (unless a separate agreement shall be made), (c) not be a
condition precedent of a valid redemption or a part of the Bond contract, and (d) any
failure or defect in such notice shall not delay or invalidate the redemption of Bonds for
which proper official notice shall have been given. Reference is also made to the
provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Undertaking of the County with respect to the
Bonds, which may contain other provisions relating to notice of redemption of Bonds.
