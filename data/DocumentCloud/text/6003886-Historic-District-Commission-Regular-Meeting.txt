APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6187
ADDRESS: 700 SEWARD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: NEW CENTER
APPLICANT: BRIAN HURTTIENNE / CH ARCHITECTS
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 05-02-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building located at 700 Seward Street is a 7-story, apartment building designed by Albert Kahn and
constructed in 1926. The “U-Shaped” building sits on the north side of the street, mid-block, in the midst
of several multi-story, multi-family residential buildings. The façade is composed of brick and
limestone. The structure of the building is typical of many Albert Kahn buildings: a poured-in-place
concrete structure of floor slab, columns, and integrated beams and joists. The roof is also concrete. The
7-story bay windows that project from the U-Shaped plan currently have a wooden siding that
covers the original stucco material. The windows were replaced in the 2000’s with aluminum units.
Staff was unable to find any information about the window replacement in our HDC records. Each
residential unit has a HVAC unit visible from the exterior.
There have been several additions to the building over the years. A parking structure adjacent to the
west side of the building was added in 1957, as well as a wood-framed connector that links the parking
structure to the apartment building, added in 1966. A one-story s t u c c o addition to the east side of
the building was also added in the 1960’s to enlarge the kitchen. On the east side of the building is a
surface parking lot. The front of the building has landscaping features in the space between the building
wings and the right-of-way. A black metal picketed fence restricts access from public right of way to the
court yard. Planting beds filled with shrubs and ornamental trees are arranged around the perimeter of
the courtyard.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the
following work associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN – NEW CENTER
(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Porches, window frames, cornices,
dormers and gables are frequently treated. Neo-Georgian and colonial revival buildings display classic details in wood;
buildings influenced by the arts-and-crafts movement have wood details such as half-timbering, heavy vergeboards, and
other wood elements. The vernacular "four-square" buildings usually show restraint in detail. In general, the houses on
Virginia Park are more ornate than those in the rest of the district. Some of the apartment buildings display carved
stone ornament set in panels, string courses, spandrels and cornices.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of individual properties is
a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf subdivided by a concrete or brick walk leading to the front
entrance; a side walk sometimes leads to the rear. On sufficiently graded lots, steps lead up the earthwork terraces to
the front steps. Some straight side driveways, primarily in concrete but a few in brick, leading from the street to the
rear garages exist on Virginia Park, Bethune, and Lothrop. Where front lawns are uninterrupted by driveways, a unity

 REPORT
to the succession of front lawns is achieved. Foundation plantings of an evergreen and deciduous character are present
on individual lawns. Hedges between properties along the side lot lines are common; properties on corner lots
frequently have hedges along the north south street. Trees are evenly spaced on the tree lawn; on Pallister where the
tree lawn has been widened, trees are planted close to the public side walk and upright lighting standards are evenly
spaced near the brick paving of the street. Public sidewalks throughout the district are concrete; brownstone and some
bluestone curbs remain on Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and Seward. Virginia Park is
paved in brick; traffic off Woodward enters and exits through a horseshoe with wrought iron gates and brick piers with
stone cresting and foundations. A grassy turf, hedges, and young trees are planted inside the court created by the
horseshoe. Newer gates at the entrances of other blocks are of the same materials. Side and rear yard wooden fences,
either painted brown or left in a natural state, exist throughout New Center Commons. Side yard fences generally do
not extend beyond the face line of the front porch, except where they fence in side lots or comer properties. Fencing in
public view through the district, the fluted designed to compliment the style, design, material, and date of the residence.
Pallister between Second and Third Streets is a pedestrian street; it is paved in brick with concrete around its
perimeter. Street furniture and upright iron light standards are placed at regular intervals. Ornamental poles (O.P.type, Detroit Public Lighting) are located on Delaware between Woodward and Second, Virginia Park and Seward. On
Second Boulevard and Third Avenue, where they run throughout the district, are fluted steel lighting standards with
crane-neck pendants (Union Manufacturing Company No. 4700). Alleys are paved in either asphalt or concrete, the
exception being the alley north of Delaware east of Second, which is brick. Parking areas off the alleys next to the
alley-facing garages in New Center Commons are also either asphalt or concrete. Alleys are entered and exited on
Bethune Court; they do not have outlets on Third Avenue. Bethune Court, Bethune Street, and the alleys have tall,
modern light standards. Ornamental light posts on Pallister Commons are Union Metal Manufacturing No. SP874-Yl.

RECOMMENDATION
The project is applying for Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives. As such, the scope of rehabilitation for
the building should be expected to conform with the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation
Number 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall
be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictoral evidence. Much of the proposed changes are
substantiated through the original architectural plans drawn by Albert Kahn, which were attached with the
application. Much of the detailed photographic documentation regarding damaged features was missing from
the application. For instance, it is unclear exactly how many of the balusters at top of the bay windows need
replacement or what is the extent of damage at limestone cap at the parapet and how much replacement is
necessary. It is unclear to staff where or how much brick masonry will be replaced. The application could have
also benefited from more detail regarding replacement windows and doors, as stated “The penthouse will get new
windows and doors to be fashioned after the original doors based on the Albert Kahn drawings.” A spec
sheet with specific information regarding the proposed doors and windows would have been beneficial to staff
when reviewing the application.
It is staff’s opinion that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work based on the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 6) Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather
than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictoral evidence.
… with the condition that the applicant submits further documentation of all areas of deterioration, final specs
for all replacement materials be provided, and HDC staff (with assistance from Planning and Development
landscape architects), be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final landscape plan prior to the
issuance of the permit.

 REPORT
Motion DRAFT

•

I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work items proposed
in application number 19-6187 because the work as described does meet the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation Number 6) Deteriorated features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture and other visual qualities and where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictoral evidence.

… with the condition that the applicant submits further documentation of all areas of deterioration, final specs for
all replacement materials be provided, and HDC staff (with assistance from Planning and Development landscape
architects), be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the final landscape plan prior to the issuance of the
permit.
