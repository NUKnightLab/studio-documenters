Report Title: Tree Mitigation Plan
Report Period: N/A

Page 13 of 28

 FPD Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

June 7, 2016

Summary: The Board of Commissioners approved the Forest Preserve District of Cook County’s (the
“Preserves”) Tree Mitigation Plan on 3/21/2007. The Tree Mitigation Plan is utilized as a tool to
determine the value of trees that are lost due to license and easement requests affecting Forest Preserve
property. The valuation formula is driven by a dollar amount for the cross sectional area of the tree in
square inches. The current standardized value of $71/sq2 was set by the Illinois Chapter of the
International Society of Arboriculture for the northern section of Illinois, and has not been updated since
2007.
In response to changing markets over the last near decade, it is recommended that the cross-sectional cost
per square inch be amended to a valuation more consistent with today’s rates. An industry-recognized
method is to utilize the average cost of similarly priced trees procured through the Preserves’ existing
tree planting contracts to extrapolate per square inch costs. Using this method, the new value comes out
to $107.54/sq2.
It is recommended that the Tree Mitigation Plan be updated to reflect this new value, with the option to
amend this value on an annual basis according to changes in the Consumer Price Index.
