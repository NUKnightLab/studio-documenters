A regional 24-hour mentally ill crisis center shall be established to be utilized by local law
enforcement when there is no available service in the impact area. The crisis center shall be
funded and governed by the intergovernmental agreement established in accordance with
provisions set forth in Article III, Section 3.5, Subsection C of this Ordinance.

D.

In those cases where a detainee has been diagnosed by the appropriate clinician as being mentally

ill and/or alcohol and substance dependent and who is not on Medicaid/Medicare, the Cook
County Bureau of Health Services shall make every concerted effort to process their application
with the appropriate governmental body and any other third party reimbursement that the detainee
is entitled.

Section 3.2

Target Population

Cook County's Jail Diversion Pilot Program shall focus on diverting the following categories:

A.

The mentally ill and/or alcohol and substance dependent arrestees detained for Class B and C
misdemeanors.

courts, and other alternatives to incarceration.
A.

This program will be composed of four levels each of which will have agreed-upon conditions by
all invol ved parties, tailored to particular circumstances, for which arrestees shall be held
accountable. The four levels are as follows:

1898

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

(1) Pre-booking Diversion:
This level shall be sought for mentally ill and alcohol and substance dependent detainees for
Class B and C misdemeanors as often as possible. The arresting officer shall be the first line of
contact and shall take, but not be limited to the following basic steps prior to any official charges
for minor and/or nuisance crimes:
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.

g.
h.
1.

Attempt to resolve any crisis without hann to the suspect, general public, or Jaw enforcement
officials.
Refer directly to a hospital or treatment center when necessary.
Contact parent or guardian if mentally ill detainee is under seventeen.
Evaluate the situation and detennine ifthe suspect is potentially divertible.
Determine if detainee can be sent to his or her residence under conditions agreed upon by law
enforcement, detainee, parent(s) or guardian, and the victim of the crime.
Contact the participating mental health community service providers when necessary for
proper assessments and referrals for service intervention in accordance with provisions set
forth in Article III, Section 3.4, Sub-Section B of this Ordinance.
If local service is not available contact the 24-hour regional crisis center for service
intervention.
In cases where there is an injured party or damage to someone's property, all efforts for
restitution shall be explored and agreed upon by all parties involved.
Complete a detailed incident report.

(2) Post-Booking Diversion:
This level shall be sought at the State' s Attorney level for persons with a history of mental illness
and/or alcohol and substance abuse dependency who are detained for crimes that constitute Class
A misdemeanors and Class 4 felonies. The pre-arraignment investigation must include
immediate assessment by the appropriate clinicians as defined in accordance with provisions set
forth in Article III, Section 3.4, Subsection B of this Ordinance to determine if the suspect was
mentally ill or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time the crime was committed. A
preliminary hearing shall be conducted prior to arraignment to detennine whether or not the
suspect can be diverted rather than incarcerated. If a diversionary plan is agreed upon by all
parties involved, an individualized treatment and service plan shall be developed by the
appropriate clinician as defined in accordance wi th provisions set forth in Article III, Section 3.4,
Subsection B of this Ordinance. In cases where there is an injured party or damage to someone' s
property, all efforts for restitution shall be explored and agreed upon by all parties involved. The
case shall be referred to the appropriate participating community service provider when possible.
A case manager shall be assigned and report periodically to the State's Attorney's Office as to the
defendant's progress.
(3) Pre-Trial Arraignment Level:

who have been diagnosed by the appropriate clinicians as being mentally ill and/or alcohol and
substance dependent. If a defendant has been diagnosed as being mentally ill and/or alcohol and
substance dependent and is held over for trial, the Judge should immediately request the
appropriate service intervention. The case should be referred to the appropriate special court for
the mentally ill or drug addicted for trial with a specific timeframe for the trial to proceed.

1899

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 2 I, 2005

(4) Trial Level:

alcohol and substance dependent defendants from the Cook County Jail. In cases where the
defendant has been found guilty of a Class A misdemeanor or a Class 4 felony and above and it
has been detennined by the courts that the defendant was mentally ill and/or alcohol and
substance dependent at the time the crime was committed, the diversion plan shall be developed
in collaboration with the appropriate clinician in accordance with provisions set forth in Article
III, Section 3.4, Subsection B of this Ordinance. A case manager should be assigned to the case
and report periodically back to the State's Attorney the status of the defendant ' s conduct in
accordance with his/her individualized service plans. In cases where the defendant is
institutionalized the arresting law enforcement agency shall be notified prior to the defendant
returning back to the community.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Mandatory Garbage Service Ordinance

W HEREAS, Cook County currently has no ordinance requiring residents to have a refuse removal
service; and

1903

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

WHEREAS, municipalities throughout Cook County require their residents to use the services of a waste
disposal firm licensed with their respective municipality; and
WHEREAS, numerous incidents have arisen in which residents of unincorporated Cook County have
refused to dispose of their garbage in a safe and timely manner; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has had no recourse to address these situations as they arise.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, that Cook County will institute the Mandatory Garbage
Service Ordinance requiring all residents in unincorporated Cook County to dispose of their garbage in
the following methods:
Section 1

(a) Lawful methods of disposal. All refuse produced on the premises of any residential dwelling
shall be disposed of by the person in possession of the premises by the acquisition of a refuse
removal service for each such residential dwelling from a waste disposal firm with pickup and
removal of such refuse by such waste disposal finn to be only from the premises on which the
refuse is generated and not from any location other than the premises on which the refuse is
generated. It shall be presumed that all residential dwellings in unincorporated Cook County
generate refuse. The Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook County Department of
Public Health may waive the requirement of this section for a particular property only upon
receipt of a written request from the owner of the premises therefore, supported by clear and
convincing evidence, as detennined by the Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook
County Department of Public Health, at their absolute discretion, that no refuse other than
recyclable materials are and will be generated by the occupants of the premises. The decision of
the Cook County Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Service Unit, to grant, or
deny, such a waiver request shall be final. Refuse produced on the premises of any residential
dwelling may be disposed of pursuant only to those specific additional methods of disposal
expressly authorized by, and approved pursuant to this Ordinance.
(b) Preparation of garbage. It shall be the duty of every person in possession of any premises to
cause all garbage produced on the premises to be thoroughly drained of all surplus liquid,
securely wrapped or bagged in paper or packed in a covered box or carton of such dimension as
will pennit its free passage into and out of the waste containers, and finally deposited after such
wrapping or bagging in such a waste container as soon as practicable after the same is produced
thereon. Materials of every character shall be securely wrapped or bound in such a manner as
may be necessary to prevent scattering and shall be deposited in a waste container or otherwise
deposited herein.
Section 2
(a) Penalties and Fines. The Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook County Department of
Public Health shall have the authority to levy fines and issue citations to persons occupying
premises that fail to comply with Cook County ' s Mandatory Garbage Service Ordinance. The
Environmental Health Service Unit shall have the discretion of issuing a warning for a first
offense, $50 for a second offense and up to $250 for subsequent offenses.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
JOHN H. STROGER, JR., PRESIDENT, ELIZABETH ANN DOODY GORMAN
and DEBORAH SIMS, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY
(PAAC) TASK FORCE AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK COUNTY TO
REDUCE AND PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL
VIOLENCE
WHEREAS, criminal profiling experts associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation have
identified a strong correlation between animal abuse and violence against humans and have documented
cruelty to animals as one of the traits which indicates the characteristics of a violent personality which is
demonstrated by the disproportionately high number of violent killers in the prison system, virtually every
serial killer, and recent cases of school violence; all of which have involved persons with a history of
animal abuse; and
WHEREAS, a strong correlation exists between animal abuse in a household and violence by the
offender against their spouse and their children and since intentional animal abuse is an early signal that
individuals, including young people, may perpetrate violent crimes against other individuals and since
many young children through their parents, friends or relatives have been exposed to Dog Fights,
witnessing and even participating, which desensitizes children to acts of violence, it is likely that children
exposed to Dog Fighting will commit acts of violence against humans and other crimes in the future as
studies have shown that the crimes attendant to Dog Fighting include organized gambling, narcotics
possession and/or distribution, and weapons violations; and
WHEREAS, Dog Fighting masked as "entertainment" is a fonn of violence against animals and a serious
problem throughout the United States, including Cook County, crossing all racial, ethnic and
socioeconomic lines. The State has enacted laws providing for the forfeiture of money, proceeds,
vehicles and real property acquired in whole or in part as a result of Dog Fighting, or the facilitation of
Dog Fighting, which require that the proceeds from the sale of properties forfeited and sold upon
conviction of Dog Fighting be utilized in the investigation and enforcement of laws including Dog
Fighting and animal cruelty; and

1905

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21 , 2005

WHEREAS, the Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC) Task Force was formed in September, 2004,
to coordinate a county-wide effort to abolish cruelty, neglect and violence involving animals in order to
improve the quality and safety of their lives as well as the lives and safety of the citizens of our
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners recognizes
the establishment of Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC), a volunteer organization governed by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners, comprised of an advisory board of fi ve to seven members, one
appointee from each of the seventeen ( 17) Commissioner Districts, and a representative from each of the
thirty (30) townships as well as law enforcement, animal control wardens, animal organizations, and
shelters; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners:

I.

Recognizes that individuals who abuse animals are more likely to commit more serious violent
crimes against humans.

2.

Urges social workers, teachers, mental health professionals, and others to be aware of the
connection between animal cruelty and human violence and to evaluate carefully and to monitor
closely individuals who have a history of abusing animals since this may indicate a propensity to
commit violence against other humans.

3.

Urges appropriate local and county agencies to encourage and support research to increase the
understanding of the connection between cruelty to animals and violence against humans in order
to utilize instances of animal abuse to identify and intervene with potentially violent individuals
and to assist in identifying and protecting children at risk of abuse and neglect.

4.

Urges agencies which are undertaking research on violent crime and its causes to incorporate
examination of the link between violence against animals and violence against humans.

5.

Urges local law enforcement officials, particularly prosecutors and judges, to treat cases of
animal cruelty seriously both because such cruelty is a reliable indicator of the potential for
domestic violence and other fonns of violence against humans.

6.

Commends the fine work of local animal control officials and humane investigators who help
enforce laws against animal abuse and urges these professionals to work more closely with local
law enfo rcement personnel to identify and prevent potential violence agai nst humans.

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Public Health Subcommittee. (Comm. No. 271733). The motion carried unanimously.

JUDICIAL ADVISORY COUNCIL
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June l, 2005 from
DANIEL J. COUGHLIN, Executive Director, Judicial Advisory Council
On December 14, 2004, the Board granted authority to the Judicial Advisory Council to enter into thirtytwo intergovernmental participation agreements with municipalities within Cook County. These
participation agreements establish the framework pursuant to which the entities will be permitted to
participate in the Cook County Wireless Communication System. This project, a continuation of
President Stroger's efforts to provide a state of art wireless video and data interoperable communication
capabilities for first responders throughout Cook County, is funded through a grant from the United States
Department of Homeland Security Office of Domestic Preparedness and the Illinois Emergency
Management Agency. Phase I is approaching completion and the County is preparing to embark on
Phase II, which will involve the roll-out of equipment and network access to additional public entities
within Cook County.
At this time, the Judicial Advisory Council requests authorization to enter into additional
intergovernmental participation agreements with the remaining ninety-three municipalities of Cook
County which were not previously included in the communication presented to the Board on December
14, 2004, and amended on April 6, 2005. The authorization requested is intended to be flexible, allowing
the Judicial Advisory Council to enter into agreements with municipalities when the County is ready to
begin implementation within their jurisdictions, which will depend upon both funding and strategic
implementation considerations. Some of the agreements will not be entered into until additional funding
is received for Phase III.
I respectfully request that the Executive Director of the Cook County Judicial Advisory Council, or his
designee, on behalf of Cook County, be authorized to execute any and all documents necessary to further
the Interoperable Communication System project approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Roberto Maldonado,
County Commissioner; co-sponsored by Larry Suffredin and Joseph Mario Moreno, County
Commissioner~.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners has instituted the
"Cook County Equal Employment Opportunity Plan" for offices under the President, and has
appointed an Equal Employment Opportunity Officer (EEOP officer) to promote equal
employment opportunity principles throughout the Cook County workforce; and
WHEREAS, in order to give such policy and procedure the full force of the County's
lawmaking powers and to ensure equal employment opportunities for persons from all
segments of the County community without regard to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual
orientation or any other protected category established by law, statute or ordinance, it is
essential to codify the affirmative action policy and procedure of the County; and
WHEREAS, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council's
Policy Statement on Affinnative Action, 41 C.F.R. § 60-3.17, the first step in the
establishment of an affinnative action plan is an analysis of the employer's work force to
detennine whether the percentages of persons within race, ethnic, gender or sexual
orientation groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the percentages
of persons within those groups who are available in the relevant job market and who possess
the basic job-related qualifications; and
WHEREAS, if substantial disparities are found, the next step in the establishment of an
affirmative action program is to examine each element of the overall selection process to
detennine which elements operate to exclude persons on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender,
or sexual orientation, and also to detennine the validity of the element in predicting job
performance; and
WHEREAS, a preliminary statistical analysis known as the "Cook County Employee
Diversity Representation Report," demonstrates a striking disparity in minority hiring among
many of Cook County's public offices; and
WHEREAS, a more comprehensive analysis of the County's work force is necessary to
substantiate these hiring disparities before codifying a Cook County affinnative action plan.

1994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Chief of the Bureau of Human
Resources and the County ' s EEOP officer are directed to prepare a four year retroactive
analysis of the County' s work force to determine whether percentages ofrace, ethnic, gender,
or sexual orientation groups in individual job classifications are substantially similar to the
percentages of those groups available in the relevant job market who possess the basic jobrelated qualifications and to provide a report to the Board sixty days subsequent to the
enactment of this Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if a substantial disparity is found through statistical
analysis, the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the County's EEOP officer are
further directed to examine each element of the overall selection process to determine which
elements operate to exclude persons on the basis of race, ethnic, gender, or sexual orientation
and also to determine the validity of the element in predictingjob performance; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the heads of departments and agencies under authority
of the President are directed to cooperate fully with the Chief of the Bureau of Human
Resources and the County's EEOP officer in their efforts to prepare these studies; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the separately Elected Officials of the County,
including the Assessor, the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court, the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the
Commissioners of the Board of Review, the County Clerk, the Recorder of Deeds, the Sheriff, the
State' s Attorney and the Treasurer are directed to prepare similar studies for personnel directly
employed within their offices and to provide a report to the Board sixty days subsequent to
the enactment of this Resolution.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 06/07/05.
Commissioner Maldonado stated the following: The Plan' s analysis would cover the past four years. At
the next Board Meeting he would supply the Committee with a list of minority groups that are protected
by the federal government. He will obtain this list from the Bureau of Human Resources. These minority
groups would be analyzed in the Plan.
Commissioner Hansen inquired how the Plan would categorize Cook County institutionally.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that the Plan would be organized by departments and agencies.
Commissioner Moreno requested that he be added as a Co-Sponsor. He voiced the concern that any
affinnative action plan advanced by the Committee must be consistent with the United States
Constitution.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that the State's Attorney' s Office has been consulted extensively
during the preliminary analysis to ensure Constitutionality.
Vice Chainnan Steele stated that a similar study was completed in 1987 which utilized yearly EEOC
reports submitted by Cook County entities.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Vice Chairman Steele, moved that the Resolution
(Communication No. 271503) be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

COUNTY CLERK, David Orr, by Clem Balanoff, Director of Elections, transmitting a
Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Sequoia
Voting Systems, Inc., Oakland, California, for the purchase of election equipment. The
contract is for 2,650 in-precinct optical scan ballot readers, 3,000 touch-screen direct
recording electronic (DRE) voting machines with a voter verifiable paper audit trial
(VVPAT) and two (2) high-speed ballot readers; as well as election management software,
support, supplemental equipment and maintenance provisions.
Reason:

The County Clerk issued a request for proposals (RFP), to which it received
eleven (11) responses. The County Clerk' s office selected four (4) vendors to be
finalists. The proposal of Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. had the lowest price of
any of the best and final offers that the County Clerk received from these
vendors. Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. has had great success with its DRE
system, which includes a voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT). They are
the only company to have deployed a VVP AT in an election. Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc. has a time-tested, widely-used optical scan system.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $23,754,630.00. One time purchase.
Account established contingent upon acceptance of grant.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

The Chicago Board of Elections and the Office of the Cook County Clerk have spent two years in the
selection process of an election-equipment vendor. The following criteria were u sed in the selection
process: company reliability; ease of voter use; technological sophistication; and the ability to implement
equipment gradually to accommodate the learning curve of voters. Top-level management and staff
conducted separate reviews of the vendors; each chose the same vendor, Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc.
The election equipment chosen utilizes a dual system of "optical scan" and " direct recording electronic"
("DRE"). A solely DRE system was considered, but the majority of voting systems purchased by
governments nationwide was not consistent with the selection of a solely DRE system. However, a future
move to a DRE system is predicted.
Unlike a solely DRE system, the paper-based, optical scan/DRE system retains the following advantages
of the punch card system: security, verifiability and the ability to remake an election.
Currently the optical scan/DRE system is being tested, and negotiations with Sequoia are underway.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether the City of Chicago and Cook County would have the same
equipment and whether, as a result, the compilation and addition of data would be made easier.
Mr. Neal replied in the affirmative to both inquiries. He added that the resources of both governments
could be combined to achieve efficiencies.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether Sequoia would have a local presence.
Mr. Neal replied: A strong presence of Sequoia in the City of Chicago and in Cook County is an
important point of negotiation. " Presence", as defined by the City of Chicago and Cook County, includes
the following: office, top management, employees and a diversity of employees reflecting the diverse
populations of the City of Chicago and Cook County.
Commissioner Moreno inquired whether Sequoia would be required to issue any perfonnance bonds
during the time of its contract.
Mr. Neal replied that this is a current negotiation point, as are indemnifications, warranties and guarantees
among the corporate entities.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the City of Chicago and Cook County are holding separate
negotiations with Sequoia.
Mr. Neal replied in the affinnative and added that the City of Chicago, in consultation with the State's
Attorney's Office, is developing a template upon which the County can build.
Chainnan Daley introduced David Orr, Cook County Clerk, who delivered the following presentation:
The following summarizes the vendor-selection process: The process took two years. In October of
2003, prior to the issuance of the RFP, thirty equipment manufacturers from around the world participated
in a vendor fair. In March of 2004 a two-day demo session was held involving the fo ur finalists; the
Commissioners were invited to this demo session. An advocacy community was consulted periodically to
review equipment, and the Clerk's Office provided this community with updates. This community
included local civic and voting rights organizations.

1998

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

$24 million in Federal funds has been allocated to suburban Cook County by the " Help America Vote
Act" ("HA VA"). The City of Chicago has been allocated separate funds. The purpose of the HA VA
funding is to purchase equipment to replace punch-card systems and to purchase equipment that would
allow disabled voters to cast ballots privately and without assistance.
The goal of the Clerk's Office is to implement the optical scan/DRE touch-screen machines by March of
2006, in time for the primary elections. These touch-screen machines would serve the disabled as well as
anyone else who would prefer to use them. The touch-screen machines would be equipped with voter
verifiable paper audit trails as required by Illinois law. Most Midwestern states have switched to this type
of machine. The optical scan machines would be bi-lingual. The touch-screen machines, however, would
be programmed in several languages. The touch-screen machines would be utilized for " Early Voting," a
new Illinois law. A fully touch-screen machine was considered, but it was determined that the cost of
these machines would not be entirely covered by the federal funding.
The optical-scan system possesses the following advantages: It is very intuitive. It is equipped with error
detection; the system alerts a voter to his errors, which he can then fix before his ballot is cast. It registers
low rates of unrecorded residual votes. It reduces the disparities of unrecorded and residual votes among
communities at variance with each other with regard to, for example, race and income. (Detroit reduced
its falloff rate of 3.1 % (when punch cards were in use) to .7% (when the switch was made to an optical
scan system during the 2004 elections).
The Clerk's Office is recommending Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc., for the following reasons:
Sequoia was the lowest respondent of those vendors who replied to the best and final offer.
Sequoia is the only vendor, and this is extremely important, to have produced a touch-screen machine
with a voter verifiable paper audit trail. They produced, certified and implemented this machine in the
Nevada elections of 2004. Sequoia is the only vendor yet to have accomplished this. Due to the use of
Sequoia' s equipment, the Clark County, Nevada, falloff (unrecorded votes) rate for the 2004 presidential
election declined significantly.
Sequoia is the only vendor to have successfully deployed two concurrent systems: They deployed two
optical scan and DRE systems to comply with accessibility standards for disabled voters during the
December of 2004 elections in Washington, D.C.
Sequoia has been at the forefront of technology: ln 2000, the company helped Riverside, California,
become the first large-scale jurisdiction to successfully convert to an entire touch-screen-based system.
ln a comprehensive client-satisfaction survey that the Clerk's Office undertook of all vendors, Sequoia
received the highest ratings and the most glowing reviews of all finalists, particularly with regard to
service and management.
During its selection process for an election equipment vendor, Nevada' s Gaming Authority was directed
by the Nevada Secretary of State's Office to analyze the security features of both Sequoia and those of the
other finalists. The Nevada Gaming Authority concluded that the security applications of Sequoia were
superior to those of its competitors.
Sequoia has been in business for approximately 115 years. It is a United States-owned corporation based
in Oakland, California. Unlike some of its competitors, Sequoia has a longstanding policy that forbids
donations to elected officials and politicians.

1999

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21 , 2005

Sequoia has successfully manufactured and deployed new voting systems in large jurisdictions under
significant time pressure. For example, the company produced and deployed 5500 units in Santa Clara,
California in five months. Additionally, the company provided 7500 units for the State of Nevada in only
six months. This celerity is important given the County's time deadlines.
Commissioner Sims inquired when the machines that involve paper are expected to be phased out.
Clerk Orr replied: Federal law requires that disabled people must be provided with equipment enabling
them to vote; to this end every Cook County and Chicago precinct possesses one DRE machine. DRE
machines will be in use by the City of Chicago and the County for the foreseeable future.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to the status of curbside voting technology.
Clerk Orr replied: Only four percent of polling locations are currently non-accessible to the disabled.
The disabled population has had two exhaustive meetings with Sequoia, during which they provided
extensive input regarding the availability and development of curbside voting equipment.
Chainnan Daley requested that a letter from Commissioner Silvestri addressed to Cook County Clerk
David Orr be entered into the record and that, additionally, a letter from Daniel W. White, Executive
Director, lllinois State Board of Elections, addressed to Cook County Clerk David Orr be entered into the
record. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether it is customary for a contract to be negotiated before
certification is sought.
Clerk Orr replied that this is customary and that, further, it is essential to the current process.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the federal funds would be paid directly to Sequoia or whether
the funds would be distributed to the County to then be paid to Sequoia.
Clerk Orr replied: The federal funds would be presented to the County, but it would be necessary to
follow a specific process. For example, regarding the punch-card buyout, upon finalization of the
contract the County would receive half of the funds, and when implementation was finished the County
would receive the other half of the funds. Both the City of Chicago and the County are in the process of
negotiating a "statement of work" with Sequoia to delineate the payment process.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the federal funds would be available to pay Sequoia on time.
Clerk Orr replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether any other counties certified by the Illinois Board of Elections
are working with Sequoia.
Clerk Orr replied in the negative. He noted that most lllinois counties do not approach the size of Cook
County; therefore, they do not need to work with a company the size of Sequoia.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired who owns Sequoia.
Clerk Orr replied: Smartmatic International owns Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. A Dutch company owns
Smartmatic International. Some of the key investors in the Dutch company are Venezuelan.

2000

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk, provided the following additional information: Sequoia Voting
Systems, Inc., is a United States company which has been in existence under various names for many
years. During this time it has provided election services and election equipment to counties throughout
the United States. It was recently acquired by Smartmatic International. Smartmatic International is
incorporated in the United States. It is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. Smartmatic International
has a significant amount of Venezuelan investment. Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc., is very much an
internally managed company; its employees and management were not altered when it was acquired by
Smartmatic International.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the product being delivered by Sequoia currently meets the
specifications put forth in the initial RFP.
Clerk Orr replied in the negative. He explained: As the project has developed and as the funding
amounts and equipment needs have changed, the RFP has evolved. All four finalists were requested to
provide additional information regarding optical scan equipment.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired why the City of Chicago and the County are negotiating separate
contracts.
Clerk Orr replied that these two governments are separate legal entities.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the contracts would be identical.
Clerk Orr replied: The contracts would be similar. Sequoia has guaranteed, as a result of the dual
contracts that they would provide the City of Chicago and the County with the lowest-priced contracts
available on the market.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Clerk Orr provide information regarding his plans for
community outreach and voter education.
Clerk Orr replied: Sequoia has significant experience in developing community outreach and voter
education plans. Negotiations are currently underway regarding the following: use of major and free
media; church-group outreach; community-group outreach; and demonstrations. Also under negotiation
is the training plan. Currently, the plan specifies that Sequoia will develop the training and educating
capabilities of the City of Chicago and Cook County staffs.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado's question regarding the budget for community outreach and
voter education, Mr. Neese replied: HA VA funding is expected to cover all capital costs and some
additional costs as well. The RFP contains a line item for $150,000 for staff training and education. The
majority of community-outreach and voter-education funding, however, will be supplied by the Clerk's
Office. There may be additional one-time costs, including: redesigning all materials; redoing the judges'
manual; and travel cost associated with perfonning additional demonstrations.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired as to the expected time interval between when Illinois certification
would be applied for and when it would be granted.
Clerk Orr replied that it is difficult to specify this time interval because the Illinois Board of Elections
would have to test the equipment, and the Clerk's Office would have no control over how Jong this would
take. He further stated that he is confident that certification would be granted within the next several
months; this would be on schedule.

2001

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether manufacturing would begin before certification.
Clerk Orr replied in the affirmative and added that this is the industry-wide practice.
In response to Commissioner Maldonado' s inquiry regarding MBE/WBE subcontractor participation,
Clerk Orr agreed to provide the Commissioners with specific information before the final vote.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether voting results would still be available in the polling places.
Clerk Orr replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Hansen inquired what funds the four vendor finalists had allotted to community outreach
and voter education.
Clerk Orr replied: Sequoia allotted $150,000. The second-lowest bidder allotted $290,000. The thirdlowest bidder allotted $ 153,000 and the fourth-lowest bidder allotted zero.
Jn response to Commissioner Hansen's inquiries concerning equipment specifications, Clerk Orr provided
the following information: Most voters would stand in booths. In each booth a top screen would tilt to
accommodate varying voter heights as well as the disabled. There would be a canvas in each booth to
protect privacy. Paper ballots could be filled out in these booths or on tables that would have privacy
screens. The "Votomatic" machines would still be used.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether there are jurisdictions scheduled to receive more HAVA funds
per capita than Cook County.
Clerk Orr replied that the majority of a jurisdiction's HA VA funding allotment is calculated according to
the size of the voting-age population. Additionally, any jurisdiction that utilized punch cards on or after
November of 2000 and is currently switching to another voting system is eligible to receive additional
funds. This funding is referred to as a " punch-card buyout." Cook County is eligible for a punch-card
buyout.
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State' s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, State's Attorney's Office,
reassured Commissioner Hansen that foreign corporate investment in Sequoia poses no threat of
compromising the integrity of the elections system, provided that the equipment works. He further added
that the County Clerk's Office controls the integrity of the elections system in suburban Cook County and
that, additionally, this system would be purchased with Federal funds.
Vice Chainnan Steele inquired according to what timeline the Clerk's Office plans to operate to train the
12,500 election judges.
Clerk Orr replied that his Office is developing a training plan; this plan currently contains the following
components: an early launching; formal as well as infonnal training; working with political parties,
providing more advanced technical training to one judge so that he or she can train four additional judges;
and offering smaller classes. Clerk Orr further added that there will be thousands of hands-on
demonstrations.
Vice Chairman Steele suggested that the Clerk' s Office conduct demonstrations at locations that are more
accessible than polling locations, for example, schools.

2002

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

In response to Vice Chairman Steele's concern about possible pervasive equipment breakdown, Clerk Orr
replied Sequoia client satisfaction surveys revealed no such problem.
In response to Vice Chairman Steele's concern about voting accessibility for the blind, Clerk Orr replied:
With respect to equipment for the disabled, Sequoia has won several awards. Sequoia would produce a
hand-held device with earphones, through which voting ballots are read. This device would be in
compliance with the new federal Jaw that requires that blind voters be enabled to vote independently. The
blind community has provided significant input to Sequoia on this issue.
Vice Chairman Steele asked whether the new equipment would alter the time it takes to report election
results.
Clerk Orr replied in the negative, however, he offered the caveat that this is a new system.
Commissioner Moreno asked for reassurance both that the Sequoia presence would be as responsive to
the County as it would be to the City of Chicago, and that the expertise of the County Clerk's Office
would be utilized in the implementation and management processes.
Clerk Orr provided this reassurance.
Commissioner Moreno asked whether performance bonds would be issued.
Clerk Orr replied in the affirmative.
Thomas J. Glaser, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance, provided the following financial overview:
He has had no conversations with the Clerk's Office regarding cash flows related to this project. His
Bureau has neither previously nor currently budgeted funds to pay for this project. In the event that the
federal government were to fail to fully reimburse the County for the cost of this project, the County's
Capital Budget or Operating Budget would be accessed to provide funds.
There are several financing options: In the past, a special-equipment levy has been added to the election
levy and has mirrored the project' s cash flow . Proceeds from the bond issue completed in 2004 could be
reallocated to the capital project; this would require the involvement of the County's Bond Counsel.
It is not an option to advance money from the Working Cash Fund to cover this project. Because the
timing of the collection of the second installment has yet to be determined, it is his Bureau' s plan to
utilize the Working Cash Fund to cover current operations.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that, according to the State Legislature, were the cost of this project to
exceed available Federal funding, additional funds from the State would not be forthcoming.
As requested by Commissioner Suffredin, Clerk Orr confirmed the following: This contract would be
funded as a grant contract under the federal funds currently being held by the State. The contract that
would be negotiated would show the payouts as the funds were received from the State to be paid to the
vendor. At this point the County, regardless of what financial instruments have been utilized in the past,
should not contemplate using working cash funds, bond proceeds or special levies. The Clerk's Office
has no indication that the County would need funds in addition to the federal funding.
Clerk Orr stated that as a result of Sequoia' s low proposal, he expects that the County would be able to
successfully complete the project within the federal funding parameters.

2003

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Vice Chairman Steele, moved that the approval of the
contract be contingent upon receiving full funding from the State of Illinois. The motion carried.
Commissioner Maldonado requested that Tracey Graham, President, Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc.,
provide infonnation regarding the age of Sequoia's optical scan technology and how recently it has been
updated.
Ms. Graham replied: Sequoia's optical scan reader is the newest in the marketplace. It was first federally
certified in August 2003 for use in Michigan, Missouri and Nevada, it is currently being certified in
California. The 1985 model was significantly enhanced in 2003. The enhancements include: lighter
weight for easier transport; new read heads which can read a much greater variety of pencil and pen
marks and colors; and an expanded memory pack for much greater and varied retaining of ballot styles,
this is particularly important for multi-lingual ballots.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired whether Sequoia plans to wait to begin manufacturing until it is state
certified. He also inquired whether Ms. Graham has concerns regarding manufacturing deadlines
including the 2006 primary elections deadline.
Ms. Graham cited Sequoia's recent manufacturing achievements: Sequoia manufactured 12,000 units
within the contract timeframe for Florida in 2002. Sequoia manufactured 15,000 units within the contract
timeframe for California in 2003. Sequoia manufactured 7,500 units within the contract timeframe for
Nevada in 2004. Nevada's manufacturing was completed on schedule even though Sequoia was the first
vendor ever in certification for a WPAT, voter verifiable paper audit trail.
Ms. Graham detailed Sequoia's manufacturing capabilities: Sequoia has a contract-manufacturing plant
based in Oswego, New York, a contingency plant in Virginia and manufacturing capability in Taiwan.
All optical scan products are manufactured in the United States. Sequoia is considering manufacturing its
touch screen product in both Taiwan and the United States.
Ms. Graham provided the following infonnation regarding certification: Sequoia's products are already
either 2002 certified or in the process of 2002 certification: The touch screen unit, the WPAT and the
software that runs the system are 2002 certified. Sequoia's touch screen is currently in Federal testing at
WILY Laboratories, which is the Independent Testing Authority. Sequoia hopes to complete this
certification by the end of June. The Insight Optical Scan Reader is in the process of certification by
WILY Laboratories. Sequoia hopes to complete this certification in August. Sequoia should have no
difficulty manufacturing hardware product to the standard to which it has recently been tested by the
Federal Elections Authority in independent laboratories.
Sequoia will monitor manufacturing closely; it has already made significant advancements.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Ms. Graham to address the issue of the equipment's ability to count
Spanish ballots.
Ms. Graham replied: Sequoia was the first company to provide five languages on a touch screen; this
took place in November of 2003 in Santa Clara County, California. That County has a requirement that it
provide five languages on its touch screens. This was the first multi-lingual, touch-screen implementation
in a jurisdiction of that size. In terms of the issue that Commissioner Maldonado raised with Ms.
Graham, the instance referred to involved a Sequoia press team member setting up a touch screen
incorrectly. Sequoia has never utilized software uncertified at the federal and state level. It has the
capability to provide product in nine languages, including Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean and
English. All nine languages are also available in audio ballot for use by the sight-impaired.

2004

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21 , 2005
Commissioner Gonnan inquired whether any clients have voiced concern over the large size of the ballot.
Ms. Graham replied that the above-mentioned ballot is not typical in size. It is meant to demonstrate
Sequoia's capability in designing long and complex ballots. Beginning next week Sequoia will work with
the County and City of Chicago to conduct usability tests to detennine the shape of the ballot markings.

WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 7 of the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for the Fiscal Year 2005, approved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
Februal)' 24, 2005, in which it states that "the Director of Budget & Management Services is

purpose," and
WHEREAS, in accordance with Section 33 of the Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill
for the Fiscal Year 2005, approved by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on
February 24, 2005, in which it states that "the Director of the Department of Budget and

any monies taken pursuant to Amendment ·N umbers 33 and 35 from tl'lese Commissioners'
Grade 016 110 Aeeounts to transfer the amount by which the Grade 016 positions at issue

WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classification 8 that provides an applicant a reduction in the assessment level for
a commercial facility; and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an application
from Pulaski Partners, LLC and the Resolution from the Village of Midlothian for an
abandoned commercial facility located at 14441-45 South Cicero Avenue, Midlothian, Cook
County, Illinois, Property Index Number 28-10-108-035-0000; and
WHEREAS, Class 8 requires the validation by the County Board of the shortened period of
qualifying abandonment in cases where the commercial facility has been abandoned for Jess
than 24 consecutive months upon purchase; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building was
abandoned for 12 months at the time of application, and that special circumstances are

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of Commissioners
of the County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of Commissioners

Commissioner Gorman stated that she is concerned with the type of businesses, auto parts and computer
retail, that Pulaski Partners is trying to put into the strip mall where there are many retailers already
established in the same type of business.
Commissioner Murphy replied that she had spoken to the Village President of Midlothian, Thomas J.
Murawski regarding the new retail shops that Pulaski Partners is bringing in, and he is in favor of the
project and feels that the new retail shops will be viable for the Village of Midlothian.
Commissioner Claypool stated that he thinks it is not Cook County's business to take tax dollars to give
an unfair competitive advantage to one business over another, which doesn' t help create new jobs it
simply shifts jobs from one subsidized retailer to one that is not subsidized over time. Further,
Commissioner Claypool stated that he questions as good public policy whether that is an appropriate
thing to do, although the Ordinance may allow technically for the application to be approved, the County
does have the discretion to object to the application.
Chairman Collins replied that she trusts that the local municipalities would be aware whether they are
putting a business out-of-business in order to create another business. Further, Chairman Collins stated
that once the application goes to the Assessor' s Office, the office looks at the application to see if the new
business stimulates the economy.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Commissioner Maldonado pointed out that there are certain areas in the County that are economically
deprived, and some of the incentive programs to attract businesses into an area is one of the few
mechanisms that the County has to be able to attract businesses to some areas. Further, Commissioner
Maldonado suggested that a study should be done to see the effect that the Classification Ordinance has
had since it was originally approved in the late 70s or early 80s, to assess the actual economic benefits
that this type of incentive program has brought into the communities.

Commissioner Gorman asked how many new jobs will be created.

2051

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Ryan Hesch, Partner, MLRP Realty Partners, replied that currently the facility is vacant and falls under
the two year abandonment clause and that is why MLRP Realty Partners are before the Committee today.
Further, Mr. Hesch stated that at this time he was not able to give the Committee a direct answer, but that
type of facility lends itself to a light manufacturing assembly which typically run a couple of shifts; and
with that size of facility you can have from twenty to potentially sixty to sixty-five jobs depending upon
the number of shifts.
David Dweyer, Attorney, Amari & Locallo, stated that at this time MLRP Realty Partners intentions are
to get a light manufacturing tenant in the facility, but unfortunately without the Class 6B it is not a viable
opportunity and the deal will fall through and the building will remain vacant. Mr. Dweyer, further stated
that the only way MLRP Realty Partners can get a tenant into the building at this time would be with the
incentive, and with the size of the building and with the market as it is MLRP Realty Partners is looking
to create between thirty-five to sixty jobs once the building is fully occupied.
Mr. Dweyer stated that the building is in need of repairs and MLRP Realty Partners is looking to spend
$350,000.00 to $400,000.00 on repairing the building. In conclusion, Mr. Dweyer stated that the final use
of the building will be industrial.
Commissioner Maldonado asked who will receive the incentive.
Commissioner Murphy asked if the Committee can hear from Jacquelyn Harder, Economic Development
Project Director, Department of Planning and Development.
Jacquelyn Harder replied that the incentive will go to the owner. Ms. Harder stated that with an
abandonment provision there has to be a purchase, or in another words a new owner. She stated that
MLRP Realty Partners is purchasing the building, which at this time is abandoned and they intend to put
in a manufacturing business that will be their tenant.
Chainnan Collins asked whether the business will also qualify for tax incentives from the County.
Ms. Harder replied that the owner would pass through the property tax benefit to the tenant.
Chainnan Collins asked if this procedure was consistent with the County' s Ordinance and if it had ever
been done.
Ms. Harder replied that it has been done before, but at this time she does not have the actual numbers.
Further, Ms. Harder stated that the Ordinance requires a purchase of a building.
Commissioner Claypool asked what happens if the buyer does not get a tenant for the building.
Ms. Harder replied that the owner will not receive the incentive. The incentive is only activated with full
occupancy.

Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved

the poor and uninsured; and

2059

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21 , 2005

WHEREAS, in June of 2005, non-profit hospitals will begin filing an annual report known
as a " Community Benefits Plan," in accordance with state law which will include the amount
of charity care and other community benefits the hospital provides; and
WHEREAS, in addition to receiving exemptions from Cook County property taxes (which
according to independent research accounts for approximately 20% of the total annual value
of the hospital 's preferential tax status), non-profit hospitals in Cook County also may receive
exemptions from various federal and state income taxes, state and local sales and use taxes,
tax-exempt bond financing, and tax-deductible donations; and
WHEREAS, in order to qualify for property tax exempt status in Cook County, the property
utilized by the non-profit hospital must be exclusively used in a charitable manner, as
detennined by the Illinois Department of Revenue during its review of certificates of
exemption; and
WHEREAS, currently, the Assessor' s Office cannot calculate an approximate assessed value
for tax exempt non-profit hospitals and, therefore, there is no information to gauge the
monetary savings non-profit hospitals accrue through their tax exempt status; and
WHEREAS, unlike a typical homeowner who receives an exemption based on a percentage
of the home's assessed value through the Homeowner's Exemption, a non-profit hospital
receives a total exemption from the hospital's assessed value; and
WHEREAS, in order to fairly and accurately weigh the monetary value of the non-profit
hospitals' property tax exemption against the dollar amount given back to the community
through charity care and other community benefits, it is necessary to analyze the hospital's
Community Benefits Plan along with a report from the Assessor's Office that details each
hospital' s estimated assessed value and the estimated exempt dollar amount.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
does hereby require the Cook County Assessor' s Office to provide an annual report to the
Board listing the estimated assessed value and the estimated exempt dollar amount of each
non-profit hospital in Cook County beginning with the current year's tri-ann ual reassessment.

* Referred to the Tax and Revenue Subcommittee on 04/06/05.
John M . Fallon, Special Assistant to the Assessor, Office of the Cook County Assessor, presented the
following infonnation:
Most hospitals currently receive tax-exempt status because they are considered "charitable" under the
Illinois Property Tax Code. However, Illinois law has never explicitly defined exemption qualifications;
they merely have provided outlines of a definition of "charitable." Add itionally, the Department of
Revenue has not defined how much charitable care a hospital must donate to qualify for a tax exemption.
The tax-exempt status of two Champaign County hospitals, Resurrection and Provena Covenant, are
being challenged. The Provena Covenant case is expected to be decided this summer. These cases raise
issues for over one hundred hospitals in Illinois.
The Cook County Assessor' s Office has been holdi ng discussions with groups including the following:
AFSCME, the Illinois Hospital Association, the Illinois Catholic Health Association, the Metropolitan
Chicago Healthcare Council and the Illinois Department of Revenue.

2060

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

The next presenter was David F. Buysse, Assistant Attorney General, Special Litigation Bureau, Chicago
Office of the Illinois Attorney General. He provided the following infonnation:
During the past two years the Attorney General 's Office has evaluated the effect of both hospital and
charity-care policies in relation to Illinois tax-exemption policy. The Office has conducted an
investigation of pricing, billing, collections and charity-care practices under the Consumer Fraud Act.
There was a legal challenge to the application of the Consumer Fraud Act to hospital practices. As a
result, the Attorney General 's Office has prepared "Friend of the Court" briefs in several pending civil
court cases against the Cook County hospital system. The Attorney General ' s Office has also prepared a
"Friend of the Court" brief in the Provena Covenant case. The Attorney General's brief supports the
position taken by the Department of Revenue. The Attorney General's Office has also been collaborating
with organizations throughout Illinois to create a legislative solution to problems facing Illinois hospitals
and consumers.
The Attorney General's Office has focused on the following public policy questions: How do pricing,
billing collections and charity care affect the 1.8 million uninsured people in Illinois? (1.2 million of
these uninsured people earn less than 200% of the Federal poverty level.) How do pricing, billing
collection and charity care affect the charitable tax-exempt status of not-for-profit Illinois hospitals? How
do the above-mentioned practices impact the cost of Illinois healthcare?
The Attorney General's Office has endeavored to obtain accurate data concerning the following: The
location, economic status and health-care needs of uninsured people in Illinois; IIJinois hospitals' current
policies on pricing, billing collection and charity care; and the financial health of Illinois hospitals.
(Considerable variance in financial health exists among Illinois hospitals.)
The case of Eden! Retirement Center v. the Department of Revenue is of pre-eminent importance in
shaping public policy. This verdict, a unanimous decision handed down in December of 2004 by the
Illinois Supreme Court, confirmed that the criteria for granting tax-exempt status are grounded in the
Illinois Constitution and, therefore, cannot be altered by changing the statutory requirements of the
Illinois Property Tax Code.
Commissioner Suffredin asked questions concerning how the County becomes aware of for-profit leases
on exempt land and stated that he believes county and local governments have had a significant loss of
revenue from such leases.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the County needs to do a better job defining charitable care.
Stan Jenkins, C.l.A.O., Member, Champaign County, Illinois Board of Review, made the following
presentation:
In 200 l the two major hospitals in Champaign County were tax exempt in status; today these hospitals are
on the tax roll. These hospitals are good neighbors, great employers and possess cutting edge medical
technology.
The Champaign County Board of Review analyzed hundreds of court records to determine ex1stmg
standards for the following: charity care in the community, standards for community benefits reporting,
statutes; and current case law. The handout enumerates the six criteria for granting tax-exempt status.
These criteria were confirmed by the Methodist Old People 's Home case. Additionally, the Property Tax
Code contains a basis for current tax-exempt standards.

2061

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

The Illinois Constitution, State Statutes and case law address the standard to which a charitable institution
must adhere in order to qualify for tax-exempt status. The Illinois Constitution and State statutes specify
that any institution that seeks tax-exempt status must be exclusively charitable; the institution cannot be
leased or otherwise utilized for profit. Case law further defines the term "exclusive," specifying that an
institution seeking tax-exempt status must be primarily used for a charitable purpose; this charitable
purpose cannot be secondary or incidental. The standard derived from these three sources is very difficult
for most hospitals to meet.
In order for property to be tax exempt in Illinois, the property must be " in exempt use" and " in exempt
ownership." An example of a property not being in exempt use is a physician's group leasing space from
a not-for-profit hospital. Such an institution can, however, claim partial tax-exempt status. An example
of an institution violating the tax-exempt ownership standard is when it charges an uninsured patient a
higher price for care than it charges an insured patient. Another example is when a hospital sues
hundreds of its own patients over uncollected funds instead of working with these patients to structure
reasonable payment plans. Additionally, for a hospital to be "in exempt use" it should be returning
financially to its community, in the fonn of charity care, at least as much money as it is saving in taxes.
Nor should a tax-exempt institution be allowed to use the loopholes of corporate law to achieve profit
goals, for example, transferring funds from a not-for-profit hospital into a for-profit subsidiary.
James J. Unland, President of the Chicago-based Health Capital Group and Editor of the Health Care
Finance Journal, delivered the following presentation:
In 2003, community groups began to challenge the tax-exempt status of hospitals by issuing reports
addressing the following: excessive pricing; unfair collection practices; and low charity care. The Wall
Street Journal and other press organizations ran articles concerning this topic. Recently, legislative
bodies, from city councils up through the United States Senate - have been addressing these controversies.
There are 50 million uninsured people in the United States and between 50 to 70 million underinsured
people - collectively this comprises one third of the population. At least one third of the Cook County
population is also uninsured or underinsured. These uninsured and underinsured may begin to file classaction suits against culpable hospitals.
Many people do not visit emergency rooms for fear of being overcharged and, as a result, their medical
condition deteriorates. A result of this deterioration is that the cost of their care rises significantly.
The precipitous rise in pricing and over-aggressive collection activity is a result of the financial
relationship between hospitals and insurers. An insurer is paid a percentage of the fees that a hospital
recoups. Because of this arrangement, a hospital charges higher-than-fair rates so that it can recoup more
money. Mr. Unland has interviewed almost 500 hospitals during the past two years and it is his opinion
that hospitals are not overcharging patients because of malicious intent.
Mr. Unland voiced his support for the concept of a charity-care pool; Massachusetts has implemented
such a pool, whereby hospitals with more insured patients subsidize hospitals which have both fewer
insured patients and/or greater financial exposure. In his analysis, Mr. Unland did not encounter any
hospital that recouped more than 5% of fees from its uninsured patients. In his experience, hospital
executives believe that they can collect more money from the uninsured and underinsured through fair
pricing and fair payment plans.

2062

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 21, 2005

Mr. Unland voiced his greatest concern regarding this issue, that hospitals are focusing primarily on their
legal rights and are suing a large percentage of their patients. As a more fair and successful alternative,
Mr. Unland cited Provena Hospital's work with a local community group. Together these two entities
were able to implement fair billing and collections practices. As a result, Provena Hospital is collecting a
significantly higher percentage of fees and sued only one patient last year. During the past two years,
various state hospital associations have focused neither on fair pricing for the uninsured and underinsured
nor on fair medical-debt-repayment plans. In this regard, it is Mr. Unland's opinion that these state
hospital associations have been severely remiss in their duties. Another consideration is that if only a
portion of hospitals practice fair pricing and billing, that portion runs the risk, unfairly, of attracting a
higher portion of the uninsured and underinsured population.
