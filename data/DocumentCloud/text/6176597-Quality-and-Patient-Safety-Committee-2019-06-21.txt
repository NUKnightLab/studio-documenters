 Press Ganey Surveys
Reasons for low response rates?
Many variables impact so virtually impossible to be definitive.
• Written reminder to “please” fill out survey/we want your feedback” if you get one on depart/discharge forms
• Repeat message verbally by every staff person at the care transition
• Include messaging in routine follow-up phone calls post-depart/discharge
• Posters/other displays/rounding mentioning the surveys

Feedback from Press Ganey on specifics
• No external research on response-rates for safety-net or low-literacy organizations that does not violate proper survey
communication in some way

• Safety net organizations might experience greater language barriers and health literacy issues that prevent response, but
this is only an inference and there is no definitive cause and effect data.
• Lower scores tend to result in lower response rates, again an inference.
• The PG research team is also doing analysis related to return rates for different survey modes and looking at other variables
like race and language. No conclusions have been made.

 ACHN: Representative Comments
Voice of the Patient

 Trying to reach the clinic is very difficult since one of their phone numbers doesn’t work and they
don’t pick up.
 Had to schedule the appointment 3 months in advance; our previous appointment was not placed in
the system after we called and told we had it.
 Always a good experience with my doctor. He is thorough and understanding.
 Because I don’t know how to speak English, they do not treat me well and it is difficult to make
appointments.
 It’s like watching a family/community in action. I enjoy coming to the office.
 During my last appointment, I waited in line to check-in for 45 minutes and then was told I was
already checked as a “no show”.
 The times I have had an appointment they have attended to me very well

 Provident Hospital – Representative Comments
Voice of the Patient
8 West Med/Surg unit
•

Nurses were very professional (1 comment out of 5 processed)

•

I experienced one error regarding the IV (1 of 5)

• The doctor that discharged me was extraordinarily kind. I do not speak English so he took me to the
pharmacy and helped me process my order.
Emergency Department

•

Triage took too long after waiting 3 hours (1 of 6)

•

The doctor didn’t want to listen to me; just wanted to give me his own input. I haven’t heard
test results for 3 weeks (1 of 4)

•

Provident Hospital is a very good community hospital. I have nothing but it's all aces in my
book. I recommend to anyone and to anybody. There's a caring staff, caring check in staff. The
doctors are concerned. The emergency room is very efficient and to the point.

 Stroger Hospital: Representative Comments
Voice of the Patient
Med/Surg
• Discharge took too long to get all the right papers
• The rooms were dirty and I had to keep telling them to clean
• I was admitted by a very friendly person
OB
• After I delivered my baby, a nurse made my spouse leave because I was in a double room, even though there was no other patient there
• I had pain from stitches after birth and didn’t get enough “numbing medicine”
• The physicians were very professional. I rate you 9 plus.
ED
• My legs were extremely weak and no wheel chair was offered; average wait time to see doctor was 4-8 hours
• The front desk people should be more professional and friendly
• I was very well taken care of, and I think the staff was excellent in what they did.
CCU
• Doctors caring for me never introduced themselves before talking to me
• Nurses complained of working overtime and said it was because they were taking care of patients without insurance
• Care was immediate and I was having a heart attack

 What Are We Trying to Accomplish?
Current HCAHPs scores for Stroger Hospital are well below
the national average. We hope to improve these by specifically
targeting changes in routine activities that effect our
HCAHPs scores in areas of communication, cleanliness, and
patient assistance.

18

 Project Description
Improving as a Place of Caring
We will focus on improving areas related to Caring For The Patient
• Communicating about side effects of medicines patients may
never have taken
• Keeping the care areas clean and quiet
• Responding to our patients’ needs in a timely fashion

19

 AIM Statement
Within one year, we will increase our HCAHPs scores
to be on par with national averages in eight measures
(Recommend, COMP 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, Quiet and Clean,
through Quick Test of Change Projects on the
Med/Surg floors, ER, Units, 4 Flex and Post Partum).

20

 Expected Outcomes
We expect that improvement as a Place of Caring will lead to
a greater patient satisfaction and create an improved work
environment for our employees. As an organization this
should improve our patient volumes and reduce employee
turnover. This should also lead to improved HCAHPs scores.

 HEDIS Metrics
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)
•  Comprehensive set of standardized performance measures designed to provide purchasers and
consumers with the information they need for reliable comparison of health plan performance.
•  Widely used performance improvement tools with over 190 million people, enrolled in Medical insurance
plans that report HEDIS results.   
•  Relate to many significant public health issues, such as cancer, heart disease, smoking, asthma, diabetes,
early detection and prevention
•  For our Primary Care settings at CCH
•  Data allow identification of performance gaps and establishment of realistic targets for improvement
and to track progress
•  Benchmark data with other providers
•  Opportunity to partner with County Care and other Managed Care Health plans to improve care and
capture additional financial incentives for CCH.

What are we trying to Accomplish?
•  Help improve patient outcomes in areas of significant health disparity: HEDIS metrics.
•  Capture additional Pay for Performance incentives in areas publicly reported.
•  Align and build on ongoing improvement efforts already underway, using IHI model.
•  Standardize, spread the team based care processes that demonstrate value and quality.

 Diabetes Care (DM) and Childhood Immunizations (CIM)
Project Aim Statement
•  Improve Primary Care for CCH patients with Diabetes age 18-75 and Children age 0-5.
•  Specifically, meet (or exceed) performance targets in all of the DM/CIM identified priority HEDIS
measures by December 31, 2019.
•  Among the many DM and CIM metrics those highest yield for patients were selected as initial focus
areas.

 Primary Focus Areas for PDSA Cycles
High Yield Goals
•  Outreach - for patients not in care or not up to date with care
•  Process Improvement - gaps in care in the care delivery for every patient seen, every time
•  Team Effectiveness– optimize roles/ responsibilities via appropriate training and support
•  Patient Engagement - optimize portal usage and use of self-management goals
•  Social determinants – processes to actively address those needed to improve patient outcomes
•  Data Analytics - continuous monitoring, sharing and response to performance data for each site
•  Learning Health system - Continuous learning and use of PDSA into site specific PI activities
•  Data Consistency and Capture - HEDIS Metrics
