action against the person on behalf of the County.

2660

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
A person may bring a civil action for a violation of Section 4 for the person and for the County. Civil
actions instituted under this ordinance shall be governed by the Illinois Rules of Civil Procedure and shall
be brought in the name of Cook County.
The complaint shall be identified on its face as a qui tam action and shall be filed under seal in the circuit
court of the First Judicial Circuit, in and for Cook County. Immediately upon filing of a complaint by a
person, a copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and
information the person possesses shall be served on the Cook County State's Attorney by registered mail,
return receipt requested. The Cook County State's Attorney may elect to proceed with the action, in lieu
of the qui tam plaintiff, on behalf of Cook County, within 60 days after he or she receives both the
complaint and the material evidence and information.
The Cook County State's Attorney, for good cause shown, may petition the court to extend the time
during which the complaint remains under seal under subsection (1). Any such motion may be supported
by affidavits or other submissions in camera. The defendant is not required to respond to any complaint
filed under this section until twenty (20) days after the complaint is unsealed and served upon the
defendant in accordance with law.
Before the expiration of the 60-day period or any extensions obtained under subsection (2), the Cook
County State's Attorney shall:
proceed with the action; or
notify the court that Cook County declines to take over the action, in which case the person
bringing the action has the right to conduct the action.
When a person files an action under this section, no person other than the Cook County State's Attorney
on behalf of Cook County may intervene or bring an action under this ordinance based on the facts
underlying the pending action.
Section 6. Rights of the parties in civil actions.
If the Cook County State's Attorney, on behalf of Cook County, elects to proceed with the action, he or
she has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and is not bound by any prior or subsequent
act(s) of the person bringing the action. Cook County may also voluntarily dismiss the action
notwithstanding the objections of the person bringing the action.
If the Cook County State's Attorney elects not to proceed with the action, the person bringing the action
has the right to conduct the action. If the Cook County State's Attorney so requests, he or she shall be
served with copies of all pleadings and motions filed in the action and copies of all deposition transcripts.

When the person bringing the action proceeds with the claim, the court may permit Cook County to take
over the action on behalf of Cook County at a later date upon a showing of good cause.
Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to limit the authority of Cook County or the qui tam plaintiff,
proceeding pursuant to Section 5(b), to compromise a claim brought in a complaint filed under this
ordinance if the court detennines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and
reasonable under all the circumstances.

2661

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003

Whether or not the Cook County State's Attorney proceeds with the action, upon a showing by the Cook
County State's Attorney that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the action would
interfere with the Cook County State's Attorney's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter
arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days.
Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60-day period upon a further
showing in camera that the Cook County State's Attorney has pursued the criminal or civil investigation
or proceedings with reasonable diligence and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with
the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings.
Notwithstanding Section 5(b), the Cook County State's Attorney may elect to pursue its claim through
any alternate remedy available to the Cook County State's Attorney, including any administrative
proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another
proceeding, the person initiating the action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person
would have had if the action had continued under this section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law
made in such other proceeding that has become final shall be conclusive on all parties to an action under
this section. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a finding or conclusion is final if it has been finally
determined on appeal to the appropriate court of the State of Illinois, if all time for filing such an appeal
with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to
judicial review.
Section 7. Awards to plaintiffs bringing action.
If Cook County proceeds with and prevails in an action brought by a person under this ordinance, except
as provided in subsection (b), the court shall order the distribution to the person of at least 15 percent but
not more than 25 percent of the proceeds recovered under any judgment obtained by Cook County in an
action under Section 4 or of the proceeds of any settlement of the claim.
If Cook County proceeds with an action which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of
specific information, other than that provided by the person initiating the action, relating to allegations or
transactions in a criminal, civil, or administration hearing; a legislative, administrative, or inspector
general report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or from the news media, the court may award such sums as
it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds recovered under a judgment
or received in settlement of a claim under this ordinance, taking into account the significance of the
information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation.
If Cook County does not proceed with an action under this ordinance, the person bringing the action or
settling the claim shall receive an amount not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the
proceeds recovered under a judgment rendered in an action under this ordinance or in settlement of a
claim under this ordinance.

Any payment under this section to the person bringing the action shall be paid only out of the proceeds
recovered from the defendant.
Whether or not Cook County proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a
person who planned, initiated, or furthered the violation of Section 4 upon which the action was brought,
the person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the
action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of Cook County to continue the action.

2662

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
Section 8. Expenses; attorney's fees and costs.
If Cook County initiates an action under this ordinance or assumes control of an action brought by a
person under this ordinance, and Cook County prevails in such action, Cook County shall be awarded its
reasonable attorney's fees, expenses, and costs.
If the court awards the person bringing the action proceeds under this ordinance, the person shall also be
awarded an amount for reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Payment for reasonable attorney's fees and
costs shall be made from the recovered proceeds before the distribution of any award.
If Cook County does not proceed with an action under this ordinance and the defendant is the prevailing
party, the court shall award the defendant reasonable attorney's fees and costs against the person bringing
the action.

No liability shall be incurred by Cook County for any expenses, attorney's fees, or other costs incurred by
any person in bringing or defending an action under this ordinance, except as otherwise specifically
provided by law.
Section 9. Exemptions to civil actions.

In no event may a person bring an action under Section 4 based upon allegations or transactions that are
the subject of a civil action or an administrative proceeding in which Cook County is already a party.
No court shall have jurisdiction over an action brought under this ordinance based upon the public
disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; in a legislative,
administrative, or inspector general report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or from the news media,
unless the action is brought by Cook County, or unless the person bringing the action is an original source
of the information. For purposes of this subsection, the term "original source" means an individual who
has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has
voluntarily provided the information to the Cook County State' Attorney before filing an action under this
ordinance based on the information.
Section 10. Protection for participating employees.

Any employee of Cook County who is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any
other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment by his or her employer
because of lawful acts done by the employee on behalf of the employee or others in furtherance of an
action under this article, including investigation for, initiation of, testimony for, or assistance in an action
filed or to be filed under this article, shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the employee whole.
Such relief shall include reinstatement with the seniority status such employee would have had but for the
discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on the back pay, and compensation for any
special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable

by
DAVID S. DEVANE, Executive Director, Department of Community Supervision and Intervention
PATRICK M. DURKIN, Boot Camp Director, Sheriffs Impact Incarceration Department
TERRIE McDERMOTT, Executive Director, Department of Women's Justice Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with ADT Security Services,

commercial means. Also, no other company in North America distributes the EMS 2000IU
equipment. Therefore, ADT Security Services, Inc. is the only company that can provide

supervision for up to 450 minors annually in Chicago's Lawndale community. This new grant, if
approved, would supplement the court's current grant program by providing additional funds to research
treatment methodologies with the goal of improving behavioral health care.
The effective date of the grant is not yet known, although it is tentatively scheduled to begin December
15, 2003 to December 14, 2004.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003

W Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit the County department from (1) asking for
additional information from individuals in order to verify a current address or other facts that
would enable the department to fulfill its responsibilities, except that this section does not
permit the department to require additional information solely because the Matricula
Consular is the form of identification presented, (2) using fingerprints for identification
purposes under circumstances where the department also requires fingerprints from persons
who have a driver's license or State identification card.
Section 2. This ordinance shall take effect immediately upon approval.
Referred to the Committee on Finance on 12/17/02.
At the request of Chairman Daley, Michelle Harris, Secretary to the Board of Commissioners, announced
two documents from Commissioner Hansen were distributed to the Commissioners earlier.
Chairman Daley entered into the record the correspondence from Commissioner Hansen, which is
submitted herewith and made a part hereof. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the
County Clerk).
Chairman Daley announced that the order of the meeting would be as follows: the public would speak
first, followed by Commissioner Maldonado who would present the amended ordinance, then general
discussion/debate among the commissioners.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the Ordinance
(Communication Number 256565) be approved and adopted.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.
The following people offered public testimony:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Alexandre Addor-Neto - Consul General of Brazil. Written statement also distributed.
Jose E. Lopez - Executive Director, Puerto Rican Cultural Center
Patricia Mendoza-Civil Rights Bureau Chief, Illinois Attorney General's Office
Jorge Burbano - President, Latinos Unidos En El Nuevo Milenio
Shary E. Mijangos-Thiel - Consul General of Guatemala
Peter Garza - President, Hispanic Illinois State Law Enforcement Association

Commissioner Maldonado clarified that the ordinance amendment would expand acceptance of the
Matricula Consular to include all Latin American countries. He noted that Section 5-4 (d) of the proposed
ordinance amendment defends the use of this identification card under federal or state law. He clarified
that counterfeiting the Matricula Consular is extremely difficult because of the technology used in
manufacturing it and also because of the fingerprinting requirement, as referenced in Section 5-4 (e) of
the proposed ordinance amendment. He also noted that any U.S. document, including currency has been
counterfeited.
Commissioner Maldonado referred to remarks made by several witnesses at a series of congressional
hearings before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration. Commissioner Maldonado said that
testimony from Steve McCraw of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Craig Nelsen, Executive
Director of Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement, has been taken out of context in the debate over
Matricula Consular.

2729

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
Commissioner Maldonado also referred to a published report from several weeks ago, in which a janitor
was accused of illegally obtaining matricula consular cards. The story was later determined to be
unfounded.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that there is no need to prohibit the Matricula Consular with respect to
banking because it is not in violation of the RICO Act. Commissioner Maldonado further noted that no
court has ruled against the constitutionality of the Matricula Consular. He further noted that there are 30
states that accept it, 14 states that accept it in the obtaining of drivers licenses, 943 sheriffs and police
departments that accept it, as well as 36 counties and 119 cities. Lastly, Commissioner Maldonado noted
that 38,000 troops in the Iraq war, mostly Hispanic, were non-citizens.
President Stroger asked to be listed as a sponsor of the proposed ordinance amendment.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the following three Commissioners have asked to be added as
co-sponsors of the proposed ordinance amendment: Chairman Daley and Commissioners Murphy
and Collins.

Commissioner Maldonado stated that at the appropriate time, he would introduce amendments to the item,
which will further clarify the security requirements and the role of the Chief Administrative Officer.
At the request of Chairman Daley, Commissioner Maldonado distributed three (3) amendments to
Communication Number 256565.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Vice Chairman Steele, moved approval of the following
amendments to Communication Number 256565:

Ch. 5-4 (b ). Line 6. . .. nationals if the issuing country' s consulate bas certified to the County ...
Ch. 5-4 (b) (iii). The card has a photograph of the person, and the person's date of birth and the
person's current local address; and
Ch. 5-4 (c). The Chief Administrative Officer ("Officer") shall develop procedures and compile
and make available to the Board of Commissioners and Countv deoartments a list of the identification
cru·ds and the ·is uing co untri es that have certified to the Officer that theiJ' identification card hiWe
been determined to meets the requirements of this section.
The motion to approve the amendments carried unanimously.

Commissioner Hansen made the distinction that the representatives of the Latin American countries are
members of the consular core, as opposed to being members of the diplomatic core, which is authorized
by the U.S. State Department. He noted that Stroger Hospital does not turn away any person because of
lack of documentation. He stated that by giving the Matricula Consular to only certain countries in the
Western Hemisphere, the ordinance is exclusionary. He stated that the issue of the Matricula Consular is
an issue that should be resolved at the federal level and noted that the United States Department of Justice
is clearly against the issuance of the Matricula Consular. Commissioner Hansen believes there is a
national and international security risk in issuing the Matricula Consular. From the testimony of Steve
McCraw, Commissioner Hansen noted that the government of Mexico has no centralized database for the
Matricula Consular, and this allows multiple cards to be made under the same name. Further, the
Mexican government requires a Mexican birth certificate, which is easy to counterfeit, or other unreliable
documents. Commissioner Hansen said a valid passport is a better alternative to a matricula consular
card.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003

basis according to the eligibility criteria of the act and provide to the Cook County Clerk the
information necessary to calculate the exemption in accordance with the provisions set forth
in this Ordinance. The Cook County Clerk shall then remove the exempt value from the
calculation of the property tax and the Cook County Treasurer shall state on the tax bill the
amount of the tax saved by the exemption.

After calling the meeting to order, Chairman Daley explained that the agenda contained two items for
informational purposes only, and noted that members of the public have registered to testify at this
meeting. Chairman Daley then called upon Commissioner Claypool to provide a summary of the two
items on the agenda.
Commissioners Goslin, Hansen, Gorman and President Stroger asked that their names be removed
as co-sponsors on Communication Number 261214.
Commissioner Claypool commented that his intention for this meeting is to work on any corrections to
the items before they are considered during future public hearings. He observed that representatives are
present from the Assessor's Office, the Treasurer's Office and the State's Attorney's Office, and he noted
that his staff would soon distribute additional information regarding Communication Numbers 261213
and 261214.
With respect to the proposed amendment to the Longtime Homeowner Exemption Ordinance,
Commissioner Claypool stated that the current ordinance provides that people who fall under certain
income guidelines and have lived in their homes more than ten years can receive tax relief in the form of a
cap which is 50% higher than the city average or, in the suburbs, 50% higher than the average in their
zone (there is a northern suburban and southern suburban zone). This gives relief to neighborhoods
experiencing radical increases in property value and/or gentrification. The goal is to protect longtime
homeowners who have roots in the neighborhood, have raised children there and who do not want to be
forced out by escalating property taxes. This amendment would remove the income ceiling and
application requirements, thereby making tax relief automatic. This amendment goes to the limit of what
is allowed by state statute.
Commissioner Claypool cited the example of Enid Becker, a police widow with two autistic children who
does not wish to leave her neighborhood. Commissioner Claypool believes the proposed amendment
would assist her in remaining in her present neighborhood.
Commissioner Maldonado explained that the original intent of the ordinance was to give property relief to
moderate-income households. If all income requirements were removed, as is suggested in the
amendment, tax relief could feasibly extend to someone living on the Gold Coast. It is Commissioner
Maldonado's recommendation that the board consider adjusting, but not totally deleting, the means test.
Commissioner Collins expressed her view that the amendment being considered goes against the intent of
the law passed by the General Assembly. She stated that the current ordinance is adequate, and that the
County should not intervene. Further she noted that it is inconsistent to allow homeowners who receive
government assistance to qualify after five years, whereas everyone else is required to own their home ten
years.

2736

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
Commissioner Claypool stated that to the extent that the original ordinance covers all of Cook County,
this amended ordinance does as well.
Chairman Daley recognized Mr. Michael Prinzi, Supervisor of the Real Estate Taxation Section of the
State's Attorney's Office.
Mr. Prinzi stated that under the original ordinance, certain municipalities and school districts could opt
out, with the exception of the City of Chicago and the Chicago Board of Education. He stated that the
current amendment preserves this right.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that property taxes are regressive and do not reflect the individual's ability
to pay. Until property tax reform is adopted, ordinances such as this are band-aids. He stated that
perhaps the means test needs to be higher, but not removed altogether. He recently met with 18 units of
local government to discuss the effect of the proposed ordinance amendment. He feared that the burden
would be unfairly shifted to people who do not qualify for this tax break.
Commissioner Quigley stated state government does not meet its responsibility to fund public education
and that there is a huge disparity in funding per pupil among districts. The commissioners are trying to
deal with equality in an inherently inequitable system. This amendment is a second attempt to make the
situation more equitable.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that as of the end of July, over 16,000 homeowners have received
assistance from the H.E.L.P. program, according to information provided by the Assessor's office.
Commissioner Claypool clarified that he expects to have a more detailed discussion during a future public
hearing. He stated that all the information is not present today to have a full substantive debate.
Chairman Daley stated that this meeting is an informative meeting where questions are being brought to
Commissioner Claypool, and the intent is also to hear from the public who have registered to testify.
President Stroger noted that the present property tax system is outdated and in need of reform. The state
must assume a greater role in supporting education and local government. Instead of helping schools, the
state imposed PTAB upon local government, which has caused hardship to school districts.
Chairman Daley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

Chairman Daley called upon Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, to
address the Committee with respect to correspondence from the State's Attorney's Office to the Cook
County Treasurer, dated September 29, 2003, which is submitted herewith and made a part hereof.
Chairman Daley also entered into the record the letter from Treasurer Pappas dated September 29, 2003
regarding Communication Number 261213, and the letter from The Civic Federation. (The referenced
documents document is on file in the County Clerk's Office).
Mr. Driscoll stated that the opinions expressed in the correspondence to the Treasurer are appropriate and
legally correct. Mr. Driscoll noted that any comparisons to the Citizens' Utility Board are not useful,
because the Citizens' Utility Board was created by state statute, not by county ordinance.
Chairman Daley reminded the Committee that this meeting was intended for informational purposes only,
and no vote would be taken. He pointed out that the text of the ordinance can be viewed on the county
website.
Commissioner Claypool said he has two revisions he would like to submit: one revision corrects a typo
regarding the assessment year, and the other revision addresses the state's attorney's opinion.
Commissioner Murphy asked to be listed as a co-sponsor on Communication Number 261213.
Commissioner Sims asked if the means test is lifted, where will the burden be shifted? Commissioner
Claypool responded that by eliminating the means test, it simplifies the process, because it becomes
automatic. It also allows for privacy by not having to disclose your income.
Commissioner Goslin noted that soaring home values have benefits as well as disadvantages.
education is funded is the issue that needs to be addressed.

How

Commissioner Hansen stated that approximately 65 percent of real estate taxes collected are from the
suburban parcels. He further stated the tax structure in the state needs to be overhauled and changed, and
other revenue sources such as the sales tax must be considered.
Chairman Daley thanked all of the members of the Committee for their thoughtful deliberation of these
matters, and for the input from those who testified.
Commissioner Claypool moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado.
The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Systems (CCICJIS) Strategic Plan. The CCICJIS Committee, which was established by the

consider in achieving the goals of an integrated criminal justice enterprise for Cook County.
Recommendations are made for each issue.
The members of the CCICJIS Committee urge your thoughtful consideration for the ideas
and strategies expressed in this Strategic Plan. I respectfully submit this report to you, and
the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and look forward to building upon the vision of
Cook County by providing the citizens of Cook County with an integrated criminal justice
system that provides accurate, timely and complete information, while protecting the rights
and safety of our citizens.

Chairman Daley called the meeting to order. He then introduced Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit
Court.
Clerk Brown stated that approximately one year ago, the Cook County Board commissioned the Cook
County Integrated Criminal Justice Information Systems Committee (CCICJIS) to create a strategic plan
for integrating criminal justice systems in Cook County. She acknowledged the members of the
CCICJIS: State's Attorney Richard A. Devine; Public Defender Edwin A. Burnette; Cook County Sheriff
Michael F. Sheahan; former Chicago Police Superintendent Terry G. Hillard; Chief Judge Timothy
Evans; Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White; Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts
Cynthia Cobbs; Deputy Director of Information Technology for the Illinois State Police Ken Bouche;
President of the North Suburban Chiefs of Police Association Stephen Schmidt; President of the West
Suburban Chiefs of Police Association Gregory Moore; President of the Fifth District Police Chiefs
Association Tim Baldermann; and President of the South Suburban Association of Police Chiefs Timothy
McCarthy.
Clerk Brown stated that the mission of the CCICJIS is to improve the public safety and protect civil
liberties of the citizens of Cook County by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Cook County
criminal justice system; through providing judges, prosecutors, public defenders, law enforcement, policy
makers, and other related agencies with accurate, timely and complete criminal history information.
Clerk Brown further stated better data management can help the criminal justice system avoid improper
detention due to misidentification, and can prevent known offenders from hiding their criminal
background for fraudulent reasons.
Referring to page 23 of the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Information Systems report, Clerk
Brown outlined the concept of integration: sharing information among criminal justice agencies, using
current technologies, avoiding duplicative data entry and achieving efficient work flow.
Clerk Brown stated that the guiding principals of the system, noted on page 25, are as follows: capability
for wide sharing, ability to capture core data, creation of an audit trail, compliance with laws and
regulations, strict security, and protection of privacy.
Clerk Brown noted that the committee created eight strategic issues, which begin on page 29 of the report.
She highlighted "data custodianship," which is the idea that only certain users should have access to
certain data. Clerk Brown distinguished the differences between core data, shared data, and restricted
data. As an example of the latter, she cited the fact that Assistant State's Attorneys and Public Defenders
should not have access to each other's work product.
Clerk Brown highlighted the four stages of creating the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice
Information System: 1) integrating the Illinois Strategic Plan, 2) creating a Cook County Strategic Plan,
3) creating the High Level Plan which was presented to the Board today, and 4) creation of a Detailed
Plan.
Clerk Brown noted that beginning on page 77 of the report is a list of every data exchange point within
the various systems of Cook County, and listed on pages 119-123 is the current computer structure for
county agencies and local law enforcement agencies.
Clerk Brown noted that the appendices include a gap analysis, and on page 127, a funding implementation
strategy.
Clerk Brown introduced the Cook County State's Attorney, Richard A. Devine.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
State's Attorney Devine lauded Clerk Brown's ability to bring together disparate sections of Cook County
to work on the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Information Systems Strategic Plan.
He noted that the goal of the project is to consolidate all appropriate common information to facilitate
shared access. He supports the project's objective of maintaining confidentiality and safeguarding the
protection of proprietary information.
State's Attorney Devine noted that the system being created would protect suspects and defendants in
addition to the general public.
Clerk Brown introduced the Public Defender, Edwin A. Burnette.
Public Defender Burnette noted that in developing the plan for the Integrated Criminal Justice
Information Systems, Cook County is at the forefront of counties. He stated that the Plan would impact
the running of offices on a day-to-day basis in a positive way. He also noted that the collaboration among
the various departments of Cook County government in the planning of this new system is impressive.
Following the presentation, Chairman Daley thanked Clerk Brown for her leadership as Chair of the
Committee, as well as the Co-Chairs and members. Chairman Daley expressed the need for an integrated
criminal justice system. The Chairman referenced a recent newspaper article wherein the judge and
prosecutors were unaware of prior DUI convictions in the case of a drunk driver, who killed a mother of
seven children.
Commissioner Gorman asked if there is any funding obligation embedded in the report?
Clerk Brown replied that there is no funding being requested at this time. She stated that funding would
be presented in the next report, which will be more detailed. She indicated that on page 131 there is a list
of funding that the various agencies have already received. Clerk Brown indicated that grant sources
include state and federal agencies. Further, there is a subcommittee specifically responsible for obtaining
funding. Also, the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office is applying to Grant Locators, a national
organization that assists in obtaining grants. The Illinois State Police can obtain funding from the United
States Justice Department, and the Federal Office of Homeland Security also may have funding available.
Commissioner Hansen asked if there are any other counties that have implemented this type of system?
Clerk Brown replied that Minnesota has been able to garner $76 million in funding for an integrated
criminal justice information system and that Maricopa County, Arizona has fully funded their integrated
criminal justice information system. Referring to other counties, costs range from $3 million to $25
million. Other counties that have obtained funding include the California counties of Kern, Los Angeles
and Marin, and Dade County in Florida.
Commissioner Sims asked what is the financial impact of the plan?
Clerk Brown repeated her statement that no funding was being requested in this plan; the next step will
assess funding needs and disclose any fiscal impact. Clerk Brown restated applications for grant funding
for the respective projects would be sought from state and federal agencies.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether computer hardware and software was the only requirement for
municipalities to participate in this new system?

2741

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 7, 2003
Clerk Brown replied local governmental agencies and the Clerk's office work together to ensure their
technology is consistent with the County's current system.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether municipalities needed to apply for grant money to ensure these
processes are compatible with the system as a whole.
Clerk Brown replied in the affirmative, that municipalities will have to apply for grant money.
Commissioner Peraica commented that integration between county, state, and federal agencies is
fundamental to the success of a project of this nature. He further commented that the public's ability to
access information, which is not confidential, should be included as part of the strategic plan.
Vice Chairman Steele, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved to receive and file
Communication No. 259131. The motion carried.
Commissioner Maldonado moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin.
The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Director, transmitting a Communication, dated September 9, 2003.
Re: Cal-Sag Enterprise Zone Ordinance Amending the Ordinance Establishing the
Enterprise Zone Benefits and the Boundaries Thereof
Submitting an Ordinance amending the Ordinance for your consideration and approval.
Please see the letter of request from the Mayor of Alsip, Chairman of the Cal-Sag Enterprise
Zone, and the table of zone projects submitted.
The State of Illinois Enterprise Zone legislation administered by the Illinois Department of
Commerce and Economic Opportunity (formerly named Commerce and Community Affairs)
now allows zones to apply for a ten year extension. The Cal-Sag Zone was established in
1985 and Cook County joined the zone in 1991. The member communities in the zone
including Alsip, Blue Island, Dixmoor, Robbins and Calumet Park wish to extend the life of
the zone by ten years to 2015. Alsip is also amending its territory in the zone by adding acres
that will house a proposed development of l million square feet.
The additional changes in the amended ordinance include a reduction of the zoning permit fee
instead of a waiver, and changes to the sales tax provision to reflect changes in the Retailers'
Occupation Tax Act.
The amended Ordinance has been reviewed and approved by the State's Attorney. This
amended Ordinance will be submitted to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic
Opportunity for their review and approval.
Respectfully request the approval of this Honorable Body of the amended Ordinance.

AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING THE ENTERPRISE ZONE BENEFITS
AND THE BOUNDARIES THEREOF
WHEREAS, Cook County designated an area as an Enterprise Zone on June 17, 1991
(Ordinance No. 91-0-34) pursuant to the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act (20 ILCS 655/1 et.
seq.) as amended; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs now
known as the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO)
certified the Cal-Sag Historic Waterways Enterprise Zone on July 1, 1985; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity
amended the boundaries of the Cal-Sag Historic Waterways Enterprise Zone to include
portions of unincorporated Cook County on November 15, 1991; and
WHEREAS, Cook County entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the other CalSag communities of Alsip, Blue Island, Calumet Park, Dixmoor and Robbins to expand the
Cal-Sag Enterprise Zone to include portions of unincorporated Cook County on June
17,1991; and
WHEREAS, a public hearing has been held with respect to extending the term of the
Enterprise Zone and the expansion of the Enterprise Zone territories and make technical
corrections on August 6, 2003; and
WHEREAS, Section 5.4 (i), (iii) and (iv) of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act, Ill. Rev. Stat.
provides that local governments with certified Enterprise Zones may adopt and amend
ordinances to (i) alter the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone, (iii) alter the termination date of
the zone, and (iv) make technical corrections; and
WHEREAS, it is the finding of the Board of Commissioners that the amendment of the
ordinances to alter the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone, alter the termination date of the
Enterprise Zone and make technical corrections hereinafter described is in the best interest of
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, it is necessary that a formal application be made for approval of the said
amendment to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO) in

EFFECTIVE DATE

This ordinance shall be in full force and effective from and after its passage, approval and
publication in accordance with statute.
*Referred to the Business and Economic Development Committee on 9/16/03.

Chairman Collins asked if the State's Attorney's Office would explain to the commissioners what is
happening from a legal perspective. Further, Chairman Collins stated that the ordinance needs to be
amended to reflect that the Business and Economic Development Committee members be sponsors of the
ordinance, because state statute states ordinances have to be introduced by elected officials.
James Beligratis, State's Attorney's Office, stated that the ordinance is already in existence. There are
three basic changes that are taking place: 1. there are many technical changes, changes to correct
citations of the statute to eliminate references to the Illinois Revised Statutes and incorporate references to
the Illinois Compiled Statutes; 2. expanding the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone, Mr. Beligratis stated
that the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act imposes certain maximum restrictions on the size of the Enterprise
Zone, and in this case the Enterprise Zone does not exceed the permitted maximum limit; and 3. the
Enterprise Zone term has been extended from twenty years to thirty years.
Mr. Beligratis stated that the programs established under the Enterprise Zone are going to expire thirty
years from the original certification of the Enterprise Zone, which was 1985. Further, Mr. Beligratis
stated that changes will be made to programs established under the Enterprise Zone: 1. Sales tax - the
language that is contained in the proposed ordinance is taken directly from the Illinois Retailers
Occupation Tax Act and it deals with a retailer being able to deduct certain receipts from sales tax on
certain types of building materials that sells within the zone; and 2. a fee reduction for zoning
applications. Individuals applying for a zoning application within the enterprise zone will be charged
one-half of the normal zoning application fee than a business outside of the zone would be paying.
In conclusion, James Beligratis stated that in writing he informed Gwendolyn Clemons, Director of the
Department of Planning and Development that the State's Attorney's Office had no legal objection to the
ordinance nor to the intergovernmental agreement that was also reviewed.
Chairman Collins asked how does the county justify saying that individuals outside the zone would pay
the full zoning permit fee and the individuals inside the zone will not.
James Beligratis responded that his understanding on the enterprise zones is that several governmental
entities have decided that a particular area is in need of economic revitalization and for that reason the
county makes economic concessions within the enterprise zone area to individuals who apply for them
and that is why those individuals receive the benefits and those outside the zone do not.

WHEREAS, in the ice skating arena, champion athlete Rory Flack Burghart is viewed as supremely
gifted often referred to as the Serena Williams of the sport; and
WHEREAS, as one of the few African-Americans in the sport of figure skating, Rory decided to form
her own company, EBONYONICE, to highlight the rich history of African-Americans and to give much
needed exposure to the legacies of blacks in the sport, people such as Mabel Fairbanks, considered by
many to be the first prominent African-American figure skater; and
WHEREAS, even in the new millennium, we often find that figure skaters of color are often relegated to
roles where their ethnicity is hidden under makeup or a full-body costume; and
WHEREAS, this historically-significant spectacle for the eyes and ears is tightly choreographed by Rory
Flack Burghart and her husband Ralph Burghart who, as a team, have garnered worldwide recognition
and are viewed as international authorities on the art of figure skating. Their production features a wide
range of music from gospel, to jazz to even hip-hop; and
WHEREAS, a former athlete, Tony L. Shaw met Rory Flack Burghart and quickly embraced her unique
concept; they then forged ahead with their mission to present this engaging show to the African-American
community and to other communities throughout the world; and
WHEREAS, never one to shy away from a challenge Tony L. Shaw persevered in the face of adversity.
Even when confronted with a lack of initial financial support, they have succeeded against the odds and
managed to produce a consciousness-expanding program featuring extraordinary athletes who get a
unique opportunity to demonstrate their discipline and skills within an extraordinarily entertaining and
educational venue.
