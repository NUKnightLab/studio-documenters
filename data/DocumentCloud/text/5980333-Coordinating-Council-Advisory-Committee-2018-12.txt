December 13, 2018, Coordinating Council Advisory Committee Meeting Overview

The next Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC) meeting will be held on Thursday,
December 13, from 1:00 -3:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
The meeting will begin with committee member updates on upcoming activities and events. Updates will
include a discussion of recent Notices of Funding Opportunities issued by Adult Redeploy Illinois and
VAWA multidisciplinary teams, along with other ICJIA grant opportunities of relevance to local
coordinating groups.
Next, we will have a discussion on using data for criminal justice planning projects in local coordinating
groups. This will focus on dashboard development for county stakeholders and how to access more timely
state and local data through ICJIA or other agencies.
Finally, we will walk through the draft Illinois Criminal Justice Coordinating Council website. The
website is intended as a platform to host CJCC site updates, connect sites to relevant public and private
funding opportunities and research on local crime challenges and interventions, and facilitate the
expansion of CJCC programming across the state. This will be an opportunity to give critical feedback on
the project before website launch in mid-to-late December.
We look forward to your participation.

Executive Director,
