HISTORIC DISTRICT: JAM HANDY/NORTH END-EAST
APPLICANT: JAN DIJKERS, D-TOWN GRAND LLC
STAFF SITE VISIT: 07-16-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

PROPOSAL
The building located at 3040 E Grand Boulevard is a 2½-story structure originally built as a single-family residence
ca. 1900 and appears to have most recently been used for commercial purposes. The stone building features three
porches – one at the front, one at the west (John R Street) elevation and one at the north (rear) elevation. Stone
horizontal and vertical mullions at the window openings are particularly noteworthy. The multi-gable roof is covered
in red asphalt shingles. The building is situated at the northeast corner of E Grand Boulevard and John R Street and
includes a masonry fence at the rear perimeter of the property in addition to paved areas to the north and east of the
building.

With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to perform a general rehabilitation
of the building and its site per the attached drawings. The project will rehabilitate the building into commercial
space at the first floor, two residential units at the second floor, and one residential unit at the third floor. The proposal
includes the following scope items:
• Cleaning and restoration of all facades
• Reconstruction of the front porch and stairs
• Demolition of the west porch and erection of new, larger porch to serve as entrance to residential units
• Potential addition of ADA ramp at the location of the existing rear porch (dependent upon tenant), including
the demolition of the existing rear porch
• All windows (some original but most vinyl replacement) to be replaced with aluminum clad wood windows –
operation and design unknown
• New glass block at all basement windows

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
There are significant gaps in the application detail regarding the specific scope items listed below. The applicant has
been made aware of the gaps and is prepared to respond to the following questions, and provide the requested
documentation at the meeting.
WINDOWS
• Which windows are original and what is their condition, operation, and profile design?
• What are the specific replacement windows you are proposing and what is their operation and light
configuration?
• What is being proposed for the existing stone mullion condition and how do the proposed replacement
windows interact with the mullions?
TRASH ENCLOSURE
• What is the design of the trash enclosure (detailed drawings)?
MASONRY CLEANING & REPAIR
• What is the proposed cleaning method? (see Masonry Cleaning Guidelines attached)
• Approximately how much (% of building) and what scope of repair is needed (re-pointing, stone
replacement, etc.)?
• What are the locations of the proposed repairs?
Additional staff observations/issues:
• Because the building is located on a corner, both the south (front) and west (John R Street) facades are
equally visible from the right-of-way and the porches on this building may be considered character-defining
features. For this reason, staff is concerned about the proposed removal of the porch at the west façade and
the construction of a new larger porch in its place.
ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) Height. The forty-seven buildings in the district range in height from one (1) to nine (9) stories tall; the average
being two (2) stories tall. The single story buildings are typically religious and small retail buildings while the
two and three story structures tend to be either commercial buildings or single and multi-family residences.
Buildings constructed to serve industrial or warehousing purposes make up the taller buildings in the district.
such as the nine (9) story Scheiwe Storage Building at 2937 East Grand Boulevard and the four (4) story Boyer­
Campbell Building at 6540 St. Antoine.
(2) Proportion of Building's Front Facades. The proportion of front facades varies greatly within the district. Most
individual buildings have front facades that are wider than tall, with the exception of taller buildings located on
corners of blocks such as the nine (9) story Scheiwe Storage Building at 2937 East Grand Boulevard and the
eight (8) story Ford Motor Company Sales Building at 7300 Woodward Avenue. Residential buildings within
the district also tend to be taller than they are wide.
(3) Proportion of Openings Within the Facades. The proportion of openings within the Jam Handy/North EndEast Grand Boulevard Historic District vary considerably, but can be categorized by building type. Single and

 (4)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

multi-family residential buildings tend to have double-hung windows, individually placed or grouped into twos
or threes, with a proportion of roughly twenty-five (25) to thirty-five (35) percent openings within their facades.
Both single and multi­family residences typically have single entry doors centrally located within the primary
facade. Religious and commercial buildings within the district tend to have fifty (50) to sixty (60) percent
opening within their facades, such as the former Marantha Baptist Church at 2900 East Grand Boulevard, with
its large ground level store front windows and grouped windows on the second floor and St. Philip's Evangelical
Lutheran Church at 2884 East Grand Boulevard, with its long horizontal band of replacement windows.
Religious buildings within the district have ornate double door entrances, while commercial buildings in the
district tend to have either double door entrances or multiple single doors along their primary facades. Buildings
erected for industrial and warehousing purposes have fifty (50) to sixty (60) percent opening within their
primary facades with individual window openings that are typically taller than wide, such as the Boyer­Campbell
building at 6540 St. Antoine with its fixed factory windows and metal sashes, with glass block windows on the
lower level.
Rhythm of Solids to Voids in the Front Facade. Although the district has a variety of building types, openings
within the facades are generally regularly arranged, horizontally by floor and vertically by bay.
Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings on Streets. Where commercial and industrial buildings abut each other along
East Grand Boulevard and the other streets comprising the district, there tends to be a continuous frontage. The
rhythm is periodically broken by vacant lots used for parking or left undeveloped, and at the location of
residential buildings which have side lot set backs. There are a few examples of buildings whose front set back
is deep enough to accommodate parking between the front facade and the sidewalk, such as Vanguard
Community Development located at 2785-95 East Grand Boulevard at the eastern edge of the district.
Rhythm of Entrance and/or Porch Projections. Most primary entrances are prominently centered on their front
facades, but variations do exist throughout the district. The placement of entrances in retail buildings is not
consistent, but is usually associated with the number of retail spaces. Awnings and porch projections are
common throughout the district. Most of the single-family residential houses have a porch that spans the entire
width of the primary facade, while fabric awnings are located above the main entry door of most of the
commercial buildings, with a few examples of awnings that span the entire storefront. The religious buildings in
the district have recessed double door entryways, while the main entries for most of the industrial buildings are
emphasized by stone pilasters with pediments.
Relationship of Materials. The major materials in the district are brick with cast stone details. Other materials
include limestone, ceramic tile, granite, concrete block, wood shingles, stone, stucco, and vinyl siding. Common
brick appears on many side elevations that were not intended to be visible. Window frames and sashes are
mostly wood, vinyl, steel or metal with a few buildings that have glass block infill. Major entries are often
covered by fabric awnings, or emphasized by stone pilasters with pediments. Parapet roofs are typically brick,
limestone, or corrugated metal, while gabled roofs tend to be asphalt shingle. A few eave overhangs have wood
or stone brackets placed singly or in pairs.
Relationship of Textures. A variety of textural relationships exist within the district, the most common being
textured or pressed brick with mortar joints juxtaposed against cast stone trim. Additional textural effects are
created by smooth limestone and granite panels, coarse stucco cladding, aluminum siding, decorative ceramic
tile, and wood shingles. Brick and stone pilasters are common the district and provide a great deal of textural
interest, as well as wood and metal columns which typically support the porch overhangs of the single family
residences. Windows come in a variety of types, including fixed factory windows with metal sashes, glass block
replacement windows, and wood and vinyl double bung windows either placed singly or arranged into groups of
twos or threes, horizontal bands of ribbon windows, and narrow window columns. Fabric awnings above major
entries provide additional textural variety.
Relationship of Colors. The natural brick colors of red, orange, brown, and buff are contrasted with beige or
light gray trim, elements and details. Brick and concrete block buildings typically retain their natural color, but a
few are painted white, burnt orange, and green with window trim in contrasting colors. Limestone and stone
buildings in the district also tend to retain their natural buff color with contrast provided by decorative multicolored tiles and brightly painted foundation walls. Single family residential buildings clad in wood or vinyl
siding are painted in a variety of colors including grey, beige , white, pink, and red and are typically contrast by
red, brown, or grey asphalt shingle roofs. Color applied to window frames, sash, and mullions range from green,
brown, gray, putty and black.

 (10) Relationship of Architectural Details. The district features commercial, religious, industrial, and residential
buildings dating from the late eighteen-hundreds. Characteristics of this period of American architecture within
the district include references to Queen Anne, Arts and Crafts, and early industrial architecture, as well as the
colorful and geometric motives of Art Deco. Architectural details vary throughout the district, but buildings are
generally detailed according to the characteristics of their individual architectural styles. Details include cast
stone or brick pilasters, pediments, decorative brick soldier courses, geometrical shapes, eyebrow and gabled
dormers, horizontal banding, projecting cornices, turrets, lentils, and brackets.
(11) Relationship of Roof Shapes. Roof shapes vary throughout the district and can generally be classified by
building type. Commercial and industrial brick, limestone and concrete buildings tend to have parapets, while
single family residential buildings have a variety of roof shapes including gabled and hipped roofs. Most singlefamily residences also have gabled, eyebrow or shed dormers and porches with shed roofs. A few residential
buildings within the district have corner turrets.
(12) Walls of Continuity. Walls of continuity are created by the continuous flow of abutting buildings. This
continuity is broken by the frequent location of vacant lots, and where the building type changes to
accommodate residential buildings which have side yard setbacks. Secondary walls of continuity are created by
sidewalks, and chain link fences around lots and alleys.
(13) Relationship of Significant Landscape Features and Surface Treatments. The major surface directly in front
of buildings facing East Grand Boulevard is the concrete sidewalk with a grass median between the sidewalk
and the curb. The grass median is occasionally intersected by curb cuts accessing alleys, surface parking lots,
and vacant lots where buildings have been demolished. Several buildings have concrete planters artistically
arranged around their primary entrance, but these landscaping features are not consistently placed throughout the
district. A continuous narrow median sits in the middle of East Grand Boulevard, and its surface material varies
from a grass area with trees and bushes, to a flat concrete pad. The center median has several low-lying planters
running parallel to the road.
(14) Relationship of Open Space to Structures. Open space generally exists in the form of public right-of-ways in
front of buildings and the side when the building is on a corner lot. Residential buildings have side lot set backs,
as well as front and rear, that provide open space on all four sides of the building. There are several vacant lots
in the district, which are either used for surface parking or left unimproved. Vacant lots are frequently enclosed
with chain link fences of varying heights. Where the upper part of the brick side elevation of a building is
visible, an old painted advertising sign may still be extant.
(15) Scale of Façade and Façade Elements. The scale of facade elements is appropriate to the style and size of the
building and ranges greatly from building to building. Large elements, such as pilasters and window units, are
often balanced with ornamental, repetitive small-scaled detail.
(16) Directional Expression of Front Elevations. The direction expression of individual front elevations varies
throughout the district, but generally, the expression of buildings tend to be horizontal, with the exception of the
nine-story Schwiwe Storage Building at 2937 East Grand Boulevard which is vertical in expression.
(17) Rhythm of Building Setbacks. A consistency of building setback is created, except where demolition has
occurred, due to the placement of most buildings on the front lot lines along East Grand Boulevard and the other
major streets within the district including St. Antoine, East Milwaukee Avenue, and Hastings Street. Singlefamily residential buildings typically observe similar setbacks through the placement of their front porches.
(18) Relationship of lot Coverage. Most of the commercial and industrial buildings in the district abut adjacent
buildings and therefore occupy their entire lots, with occasional space allotted in the front or the rear for surface
parking. Single-family and multi-family residential buildings have side lot set backs and therefore provide less
lot coverage. The placement of religious buildings within the district vary, with some occupying their entire lots,
while others have front and side yard set backs.
(19) Degree of Complexity Within the Facades. The degree of complexity ranges from the simple to moderately
complex. Arrangements of windows, elements and details are typically regular and repetitive in nature.
(20) Orientation, Vistas, Overviews. The primary orientation is toward East Grand Boulevard, except for the portion
of the district that jogs south to East Milwaukee Avenue. Buildings within this portion of the district are
orientated toward St. Antoine Street, Hastings Street and East Milwaukee Avenue. East Grand Boulevard has six
lanes of roadway with a middle median which creates an expansive vista and large divide from one side of the
thoroughfare to the other. The wide, uninterrupted sweep of East Grand Boulevard lined with buildings of fairly
uniform heights results in a consistent but varied silhouette.

 (21) Symmetric or Asymmetric Appearance. While most building facades above the first story are symmetrical, the
district as a whole is asymmetrical in appearance due to the variety of architectural styles.
(22) General Environmental Character. The Jam Handy/North End-East Grand Boulevard Historic District is a
mixed use commercial, residential, and industrial district with a diverse building stock that offers prime
redevelopment opportunities. The proposed district is five miles north of the National Register listed East Grand
Boulevard Historic District. It is ideally situated in close proximity to several other locally and nationally
designated districts, including the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant Historic District, New Amsterdam Historic
District, New Center Area Historic District, and the General Motors Research Labs/Argonaut Building Historic
District.
RECOMMENDATION
Due to the lack of information regarding multiple scope items, staff is refraining from proffering a recommendation
for this proposal.
To reiterate, see staff issues listed below:
• Windows – What’s being proposed?
• Porches – The (3) porches are character-defining features of the building, therefore, are there alternative
solutions for the residential entrance and the ADA ramp?
• Masonry Cleaning and Repair – What’s the location and extent?
• Trash Enclosure – What’s the design?

 REPORT
Masonry Cleaning Guidelines

"The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the -gentlest means possible."1

The Historic District Commission generally approves of the inclusion of exterior masonry
cleaning for the rehabilitation or restoration of an historic structure, provided that the cleaning
technique used will not cause damage or permanent alteration to the historic structure. The
natural weathering and discoloration of masonry materials, patina2, is to be respected as the
appearance achieved as a result of the original designers selection of exterior materials. The
Commission discourages the use of any cleaning technique that would totally remove this
natural patina from an original building material. The Commission does not discourage the
removal of surface grime (airborne dirt and pollutants), or stains resulting from failure of
drainage systems, graffiti, etc.

Definitions

I. For the purposes of this policy, the term "masonry" is understood to include all brick, stone,
stucco, terra cotta, ceramic tile and cement exterior finish materials.

II. The term "cleaning technique" is meant to encompass all aspects of a masonry cleaning
method including; type of cleaning agent, type of rinse, method and/or pressure of cleaning agent
and rinse applications, and all other actions or precautions taken to insure the proper and safe
utilization of a particular cleaning method.

III. For the purposes of this policy, the term "abrasive cleaning" is meant to include all cleaning
techniques that physically abrade the building surface to remove soils, discolorations, or
coatings. Such techniques involve the use of certain materials which impact or abrade a masonry
surface under pressure, or abrasive tools and equipment. The following materials are some
examples of abrasive substances that are applied through a stream of high pressure water or air:

 REPORT
sand
ground slag or volcanic ash
crushed walnut or almond shells
rice husks
ground corncobs
ground coconut shells
crushed eggshells
silica flour
synthetic particles
glass beads
micro balloons baking soda
The use of water under high pressure can also be an abrasive material under certain
circumstances.
The following are some examples of tools and equipment which are abrasive to masonry
surfaces3:
wire brushes
rotary wheels
power sanding disks
rotary or belt sanders

 REPORT
Purpose

The Historic District Commission sets forth this policy statement for the purpose of assisting
property owners and building contractors in planning an appropriate rehabilitation of structures
located within an historic district.
Building Permit Applications

The Historic District Commission shall review all building permit applications proposing the
cleaning of a masonry surface as individual cases. No person should interpret any Commission
approval of a cleaning technique for an individual structure as being precedent setting, thereby
allowing the unrestricted use of that cleaning technique. Each building permit application for
masonry cleaning shall be reviewed and decided on the basis of the cleaning technique proposed,
and the type and condition of the exterior material to be cleaned.

In all cases where masonry cleaning is proposed, the following information is required as part of
the application for a building permit:
A. The property owner shall submit an explanation as to the pur-pose for desiring to clean the
masonry surface(s) of their building.

B. The property owner or building contractor shall submit a de-tailed written description of the
cleaning technique to be used. This description is to include:
1. An exact description of the cleaning agent to be applied. If a chemical cleaner is proposed,
then the proper nomenclature of the chemical must be specified (in addition to brand name). The
pressure and/or method in which the cleaning agent will be applied must be specified.
2. If a rinse is called for, a description of the rinse, and the pressure and/or method in which the
rinse will be applied, must be specified.
3. Pressure specification are to be expressed in pounds per square inch (PSI) exerted at the
nozzle of the instrument (wand).

 REPORT
C. An exact description and location of the exterior materials that are to be cleaned and photos of
the existing condition are required. This description should include an analysis of the existing
condition of the exterior materials to be cleaned (i.e. cracked, spalling, open joints, patched, etc.).

D. A test patch, located on a small area ( maximum of 9 sq. feet in an inconspicuous spot, is
required to be performed prior to processing of an application for masonry cleaning. This test
patch is required regardless of the cleaning technique being proposed. Approval of a building
permit application can only be obtained after this test area has been inspected by the
Commission's staff, and the cleaning technique has been found to be non-detrimental to the
structure.

In those cases where more than one type of material is to be cleaned, or where different textures
exist on the same material, a test patch will be required for each of the materials and/or textured
surfaces involved.
The Commission's staff shall review all submissions and shall only process an application once
all of the above described information has been submitted and the staff has determined that the
application sub-mission is complete.

Guidelines

Any proposal for masonry cleaning shall meet the following appli-cable conditions:
A. Abrasive cleaning will not be permitted on exterior masonry surface.
B. Chemical cleaning is permissible provided:
1. That the cleaning contractor submit written guarantees stating that any damage that might be
caused to adjacent glass, stone, brick, stucco, wood, paint, foundation plantings (landscaping) or
other building or plant materials, shall be repaired in an appropriate manner as deter-mined by
the Historic District Commission. If the con-tractor gives financial remuneration to the property
owner in lieu of making physical repairs, the property owner will then be responsible for making
those repairs. A set time limit for completing these repairs may be given by the Commission.
2. That the cleaning method proposed is not one that is known to cause damage to the type of
material that is intended to be cleaned.

 REPORT
C. High pressure liquid cleaning will be permitted if it is shown (by means of a test patch) that
the proposed amount of pressure will not cause abrasive damage to the materials it is to clean.

D. Any cleaning technique that involves the use of pressure applied water as a cleaning agent or
rinse, shall not be scheduled for performance during periods of weather where freezing
temperatures are prevalent. Scheduling of such work should allow at least two calendar weeks
for the proper "drying out" of the cleaned masonry surfaces prior to the onset of freezing weather
conditions.

Generally, wet cleaning should only take place between April 15 and November 1 of any given
year.

E. Necessary masonry repairs (i.e. tuckpointing, stucco patching, crack repairs, etc.) are to be
satisfactorily completed prior to cleaning the masonry surface. This measure will help safe-guard
against possible damages that could be caused by the cleaning technique. A masonry surface
must be in a state of good repair before cleaning is attempted.

F. In preparing to repaint masonry, stripping should only occur where the paint can be easily
removed, without damaging the underlying masonry. In any other instance where paint stripping
can not be performed without causing damage to the underlying ma-sonry surface, repainting is
the only appropriate solution.

Recommended Techniques

A. Abrasive cleaning will not be permitted for use on exterior masonry,

B. With the exception of certain detergents, chemical cleaning is not recommended for most
stone and stucco surfaces. Some stone tends to be stained by chemical cleaners, while the fragile
nature of stucco re-stricts the use of chemical cleaners to only those areas that are in good
condition and not showing signs of deterioration. A water rinse is required whenever a chemical
cleaner is to be used.

 REPORT

C. Stucco or stone surfaces are best cleaned by use of a mild detergent and a low pressure water
rinse, or with the use of plain water applied at low pressure. This method can also be used on
most masonry surfaces where harsher methods of masonry cleaning could cause damage to the
masonry.

D. Where approved masonry cleaning techniques do not achieve the desired results on painted
stucco, repainting is recommended.

E. High temperature water or steam cleaning can usually be used successfully on all masonry
surfaces. Appropriate repairs should be made, where needed, on the masonry surface prior to
employing this cleaning technique.

F. It is recommended that the required test patch be allowed to weather through a complete cycle
of seasons (one year) in order to determine the long range effects of a cleaning technique.

F. Proper safety precautions should always be taken to protect equipment operators, surrounding
building materials, surround-ing landscape materials and the general public from the hazards
inherent to the specific cleaning technique being used.

H. Paint stripping from masonry surfaces that were either painted originally, or early in the
building's history, should not occur unless removing damaged or deteriorated paint to the next
sound layer in preparation for repainting. Painting of masonry buildings was usually done to
conform to the style influences of the period, or to assist in weather-proofing and protecting a
poor quality masonry material. Either or both of these reasons is adequate cause to not
permanently remove paint from the surface of a building.

I. A poultice can be used for spot stain removal. Made of a chemical specific for the type of stain
or water and a binder such as fuller’s earth or sawdust, a poultice is applied directly to the area.
The stain is drawn into the poultice as it dries and pulls away from the wall.
