Development for verification prior to filing of the application with the Assessor.
In addition, the letter from the authorized officer shall:
1. Describe the redevelopment objective of the municipality;

conditions of Subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) of this Section are present within 30 days, and upon further
application of the requesting party, the Assessor may review the application, supporting data, and other
appropriate facts and certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7c treatment and grant

assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property and the commercial
development property would not go forward without the full incentive offered under Class 7c;

expected to ultimately result in an increase in real property tax revenue and employment
opportunities of the property.

eligibility application with the Assessor, but must be filed with the Assessor no later than the

is filed with the application, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the Secretary of the

abuse treatment services to NSDCSEP participants, based on the organization’s qualifications and
understanding of the current enhancement programs, goals and objectives.
McDermott Center will provide substance use disorders detoxification, residential, intensive outpatient,
outpatient treatment; and recovery home services. Haymarket Center is the only provider of this full
continuum of substance use disorders care that has experience: (1) working with the Cook County
Problem-Solving Court teams, (2) internally enrolling clients in Medicaid and billing all possible services
first to Medicaid or other insurance before billing to grants, and, (3) also can provide co-occurring mental
health treatment to program participants with co-occurring substance use and mental health disorders.
Based on McDermott Center’s longstanding role in Illinois’ treatment court programs, the organization is
well versed in responding to needs of clients, family members, and court partners, as well as adapting to
specific needs based on presenting health, safety, or administrative issues. McDermott Center has been
involved in all phases of planning, launch and implementation of the programs and requires minimal
additional education on the new grant and/or infrastructure-building components to ensure service delivery
and processes are upheld to the highest standards.
This was a sole source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary:
The Circuit Court proposes to amend and increase the current contract with Gateway
Foundation, Inc. to provide a full range of substance abuse and aftercare services, pursuant to a new
federally-funded enhancement grant. Gateway services currently provided to drug treatment court clients
in Municipal Districts Two and Three would be extended to all Mental Health Court clients at all court
locations.

The Circuit Court of Cook County serves as the Implementing Agency for the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT)
funded Circuit Court of Cook County North Suburban Municipal Districts Drug Court Service
Enhancement Program (NSDCSEP). The Court proposes to contract with Gateway to deliver substance
use disorder treatment services to NSDCSEP participants, as proposed to SAMHSA, due to the
organization’s qualifications and understanding of the current enhancement programs’ goals and
objectives. Services will include individual and group counseling, recovery housing and medication-assisted
treatment, provided at two locations in Chicago.
Over the years, Gateway has served as a member of several Cook County Problem-Solving Court teams,
providing substance use disorder treatment services in both community and correctional residential and
outpatient settings that serve diverse populations, including adults with substance use and co-occurring
mental health disorders. Due to Gateway's longstanding role in Illinois’ treatment court programs, they are
well versed in responding to defined needs of clients, family members, and court partners, as well as
adapting to specific program requirements. Specific to NSDCSEP, Gateway has been involved in all
phases of program planning, launch and implementation and thus will require minimal additional education
on the new grant and/or infrastructure-building components to ensure service delivery and processes are
upheld to the highest standards.
This is a sole source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

Presented by: AMY CAMPANELLI, Public Defender of Cook County
PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Cook County Public Defender’s Office
Grantee: Cook County Public Defender’s Office
Grantor: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department of Justice
Request: Authorization to accept grant
Purpose: The goal of the Cook County Juvenile Defender Educational Advocacy Program is to reduce
the educational collateral consequences of juvenile adjudication on low-income youth in Cook County. The
program will provide indigent youth with the civil legal services necessary to reenroll in school, obtain
needed services and avoid unnecessary or unfair suspensions and expulsions, all of which are protective
factors against reoffending and recidivism.
Grant Amount: $353,770
Grant Period: 10/1/2019 - 9/30/2022
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences: The Budget Department has received all the requisite documents and determined the
fiscal impact on Cook County, if any.
Summary:
Educational disengagement is one of the most significant collateral consequences of juvenile
justice system involvement for young people. Court-involved minors are less likely to complete high school
or continue their education beyond high school, which dramatically curtails employment opportunities and
ultimately increases likelihood of recidivism. In addition to navigating school reentry and suspension and
expulsion hearings, children with court involvement need support that only attorneys can provide, including
accessing needed - and often legally mandated - social and educational services. However, this work is
rarely taken on by public defender’s offices, as limited resources demand a focus on their primary
objective: defending minors in their criminal cases.

The Cook County Juvenile Defender Educational Advocacy Program will provide a critical bridge

Page 71 of 86

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

October 24, 2019

between juvenile justice and civil representation for minors and will enable the Cook County Public
Defender’s Office to provide our young clients with more holistic and coordinated advocacy at every
stage of their justice system involvement. The Cook County Juvenile Defender Educational Advocacy
Program will further OJJDP’s mission of reducing violent crime by providing indigent youth with the civil
legal services necessary to reenroll in school, obtain needed services and avoid unnecessary or unfair
suspensions and expulsions, all of which are protective factors against reoffending and recidivism. The
proposed program will expand upon what CCPD has learned from past efforts to bridge the gap in
educational advocacy services in a lasting way. Rather than relying on short-lived fellowships or
intermittent partnerships with nonprofit organizations, this effort will build the infrastructure necessary to
integrate education advocacy services into the operations of the Juvenile Justice Division’s
multidisciplinary teams of lawyers, case managers and support staff.
The primary goal of the Cook County Juvenile Defender Educational Advocacy Program is to reduce the
educational collateral consequences of juvenile adjudication on low-income youth in Cook County. Central
to the achievement of this project’s goals is the creation of a new, full-time position in the Juvenile Justice
Division of the CCPD, the Education Attorney. Completing the civil legal services side of JJD’s
multidisciplinary representation teams, the education attorney will: 1) represent CCPD juvenile clients at
school disciplinary hearings; 2) obtain IEPs and other needed - and often legally mandated - services for
minors; 3) assist minors and their families with school reentry. Finally, the program develops an
Educational Advocacy for Public Defenders Toolkit to extend lessons learned beyond Cook County.
