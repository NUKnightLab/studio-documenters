* EXECUTIVE SESSION MAY BE HELD PURSUANT TO OHIO REVISED CODE (ORC) 121.22(G)
ORC 121.22(G)(5), a public body may hold an executive session to consider “matters required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulations or state statues.”
ORC 121.22(G)(6) provides that consideration of “[d]etails relative to the security arrangements and emergency response protocols for a public body or a public office, if
disclosure of the matters discussed could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the security of the public body or a public office.” Under this exception, both conditions must
be met:
(1) the subject of the meeting must relate to the security arrangements and emergency response protocols for a public body or a public office; and,
(2) public disclosure of the matters discussed could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the security of that public body or public office.
