GENERAL BACKGROUND

The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD)
procurement laws.

In 2004, the CHA issued RFS 04-01309-01 to replace its existing system applications for
?nance, human resources, payroll and purchasing to 53 pre-quali?ed vendors in the management
consulting category and received 4 responses. Upon review and after an extensive and thorough
competitive negotiation process, the CHA selected the joint proposal of Blackwell Consulting
and Lawson Software for award under the procurement. As joint awardees, Blackwell and
Lawson cooperatively supplied and implemented the Lawson Enterprise Resource Planning
system under Contract No. 9777. As a component of the implementation, Lawson Software, Inc.
(?Lawson?) provided its copyrighted ERP software platform, system and applications
(collectively, the ?Lawson System?) to the CHA under a perpetual license term. At the time of
procurement and award, the CHA negotiated annual support and maintenance pricing for up to
?ve (5) years from the acceptance of the Lawson System. The CHA previously exercised its
rights to annual support and maintenance under Contract 9777 for each of the ?ve (5) years since
the completed implementation, and previously negotiated pricing and terms for extended
maintenance and support with Lawson under for the two-year term from January 1, 2011 through
December 31, 2012.

The CHA now seeks to secure maintenance and support services for an additional one (1) year
period by entering into a renewable support and maintenance services contract with Infor, Inc.
(formerly Lawson Software, Inc.) to continue to support the Lawson System implemented and in
use at the CHA. It was originally envisioned that the selected ERP system contemplated under
RFS 04?01309-01 would suit the agency?s needs for a period between seven to ten years
(presuming no signi?cant changes in market conditions), and the Lawson System has performed
to those expectations since implementation. The Lawson System continues to serve valuable
operations and functions for the CHA, and its continued maintenance and support was approved
for sole source procurement for the requested one (1) year contract term.

The EVP of Finance concurs with the recommendation to enter into a contract with Infor, Inc. for
a one (1) year term to support and maintain the Lawson System, which serves as the Chicago
Housing Authority?s Enterprise Resource Planning system, for compensation not to
exceed, $255,794.67 for the one (1) year term.

The CEO/Presidents recommends the approval to enter into a contract with Infor, Inc. for a one
(1) year term to support and maintain the Lawson ERP System for compensation not to exceed
$255,794.67 for the one (1) year term.

RE 0L I NNO.2012-CHA-107

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated December 12,

compensation not to exceed $255,794.67 for the one (1) year term.
