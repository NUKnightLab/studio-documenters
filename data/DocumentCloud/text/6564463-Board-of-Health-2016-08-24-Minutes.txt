introduced by State Senator Hite to regulate Construction and Demolition Debris (C&DD) temporary

legislative staff and C&DD industry representatives. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the
draft of SB 333 including any objections or recommended changes. He reported that the meeting was
well attended; that Ohio EPA hopes to attach SB 333 to the biennium budget bill for the Ohio EPA
which gives it a good chance of success at passage. The bill is supported by the C&DD industry who
seeks to level the playing field with the unregulated part of the industry. Many suggestion for change
were presented and the Ohio EPA agreed to prepare another draft with the generally agreed to
modifications. They hope to get into hearings in November and passage in December. As a result, Mr.
O’Donnell advised the Board that he did not place on the agenda the prospered Rules and Regulations
that staff have been working on that mimic SB 333.
HB 390 – Section 501.10 (ref. enclosed) John Sobolewski provided information on Ohio Substitute House Bill 390. One section of the bill deals
with lead in school drinking water and establishes the Lead Plumbing Fixture Replacement Assistance
Grant Program. This program will be in effect from September 27, 2016 through June 30, 2018 and
will make a total of $12,000,000 available on a first-come first-served basis for traditional public
schools, community schools, and chartered non-public schools to help cover the costs associated with
drinking water lab sampling and analysis, along with the replacement of plumbing fixtures that deliver
drinking water and some limited connecting piping associated with the replacement of eligible fixtures.
School systems will be able to apply for a total of $15,000 per eligible school. The grant program will
be administered by the Ohio School Facilities Commission, with technical assistance from the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency. CCBH is in the process of identifying the most appropriate role we
can play in assisting the school administrators in the process. Several school systems, including
Beachwood and Rocky River, have already contacted our office requesting guidance in how they
should respond to water samples with elevated lead levels.
