Vice Chairman Murphy asked if it could be changed to “acreage”, and if you had a certain
amount of acreage if it would be allowed.
Donald Wlodarski, Commissioner, Building and Zoning Department replied the County Board
can make changes to this amendment. The only problem the Department of Building and
Zoning would have with enforcing lot sizes is when inspectors go out to the site it would be hard
for them to determine exactly the lot size so it would be an enforcement concern to the
department.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the amendment should not usurp the authority of the townships in
Cook County. The townships are more familiar with the residential districts. So, it is appropriate
for the amendment to allow the township boards the authority to approve or disapprove the
parking of commercial vehicles in residential districts.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
