Plan which is located on the site of the former Tiger Stadium at 1620 Michigan Avenue, also

neighborhood. The original Plan contemplated that the EDC would complete demolition and
some utility and site preparation activities in order to prepare for a future, to be determined,
developer and development plan. Eligible activities were to have been completed within three
(“3”) years of the execution of the Reimbursement Agreement. The MEDC had a similar three
(‘3”) year eligible activities completion requirement. Due to the national economic and real estate
recession, the future development was delayed.
The EDC has selected Tiger Stadium Partners, LLC (the “TSP”), a Larson Realty Group affiliate,
as the developer of a portion of the Tiger Stadium site. A closing and construction start by TSP
and/or other entities involved in the development is anticipated to occur in the late Summer or
