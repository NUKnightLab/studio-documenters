PROPOSED LICENSE REQUEST
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”), as
Licensor to grant a License to 13500 S. Harlem Ave., LLC, Grantee, to locate, operate and maintain an
existing steel and wood retaining wall, pavement, light poles and appurtenances. The existing wall and
improvements were inadvertently installed at an angle to the property line approximately 15 years ago,
resulting in much of the wall encroaching on FPCC property. The 15.5 foot high wall supports FPCC
land behind it; removal would leave an unstable slope subject to erosion and collapse, and the land
containing mature oak trees unsupported. No additional land other than what is occupied by the
encroachment is requested. In addition to the Licensing Fees, the applicant will contribute $20,000.00
toward restoration activities in the FPCC.
Term: 10 Years
License Fee:

$3,500.00 (minimum license fee)

Concurrence(s):
The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
