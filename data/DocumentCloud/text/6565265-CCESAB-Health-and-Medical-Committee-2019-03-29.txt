5. REVIEW OF CCESAB MEETING/OUTSTANDING PROJECTS-CCESAB meeting review-The
new mass notification system CodeRED for Cuyahoga County has been implemented and tested. Users
need to resign up-should have gotten an email and test. New Vice Chair for committee-Mark Christie
from County OEM. All committees reviewed their funding requests for 2019 Homeland Security and
Executive Committee made their recommendations and cuts. Health and Medical had no projects
approved. Different funding approval for the last couple of years-goes through the 5 county EMAs. This
year more counties had project requests so less approved for Cuyahoga.
Projects outstanding for Health and Medical are the FY17 UASI PPE project for $135,000. ME Office for
Mass Fatality Storage $50,000. Working with grants-out for bid for PPE and filters. IDCon kits did not
need a bid. Hopefully PPE will come in by summer.
