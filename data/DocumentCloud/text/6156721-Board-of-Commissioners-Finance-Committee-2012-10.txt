Historical Summary
•

Dedicated on August 7, 1907, the three story Chicago Juvenile Court building at 202 Ewing
Street in Chicago was the first of its kind in the nation, providing detention housing for 53
delinquent boys, as well as housing for 50 dependent boys and girls.

•

In 1973, a five-story facility was completed and named the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center (JTDC). The facility has 30 separate housing pods each accommodating 16
to 18 residents with a total capacity of 498 residents.

•

In 1999, the ACLU filed a class action lawsuit, Doe v. Cook County: No 99 C 3945,
regarding inadequate conditions of confinement at the JTDC. After a series of federal court
orders, including the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), the Agreed Supplemental Order
(ASO) and the Modified Implementation Plan (MIP), Cook County entered into a settlement
agreement in the lawsuit.

•

In 2007, the Illinois Legislature passed Public Act 095-0194 (House Bill 236) allowing for
the administrative control of the JTDC from the Cook County Board to the Chief Judge of
the Circuit Court of Cook County, effective January 1, 2008.

•

On August 14, 2007 the U S District Court, Northern District-Eastern Division appointed a
Transitional Administrator (TA) and created the Office of the Transitional Administrator
(OTA) to bring the JTDC into substantial compliance with the aforementioned court orders
and foster an efficient and orderly transition of administrative and operational authority to the
Office of the Chief Judge Circuit Court.

•

On June 23, 2010 the United States District Court, Northern District-Eastern Division,
approved the “proposed staffing plan” for the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center. The Court upheld the TA’s hiring plan proposed in the Second Report of the
Transitional Administrator dated May 8, 2008.

•

Currently there is an appeal pending in the 7th Circuit, filed by Teamsters 700, that
challenges the August 14, 2007 order appointing the Transitional Administrator and
specifically objecting to the ‘”Staffing Plan.”

 Staffing Plan Chronology
•

October 9, 2009, a Staffing Plan was submitted to the Court by the Transitional
Administrator as a part of the “Second Report of the Transitional Administrator Pursuant to
the Court’s May 8, 2008 Order.” Detailed were the proposed Staffing Plan for the veteran
JTDC staff in the classifications of Juvenile Detention Counselors (JDC), Recreation
Workers, and Supervisors.

•

June 23, 2010, the Staffing Plan as proposed by the Transitional Administrator was approved
by the Federal Court.

•

June 25, 2010, the Transitional Administrator issued a bulletin to all staff apprising them of
the Court’s ruling.

•

Between September 8, 2010 and September 15, 2010 held several optional informational
sessions for affected staff to discuss the transition of the JTDC, provide sample resume and
cover letters, and to provide a context for the JTDC’s current approach towards resident
behavior modification. Unfortunately, a very small number of affected staff elected to
participate. Finally, the Transitional Administrator scheduled mandatory informational
meetings in order to ensure affected staff understood the requirements.

•

October 13, 2010, a bulletin was issued to impacted staff notifying them of the process to
retain employment in the new classifications as outlined in the Transitional Administrator’s
“Second Report” to the Court.

•

The Staffing Plan as filed in Federal Court required the affected staff to: 1) apply online and
fill out an application through CareerBuilder’s website, 2) participate in an extensive
telephone screen, 3) take the IMPACT and/or PROMOTE test one time, 4) interview with a
panel of interviewers which required a written component as well as extensive interview
questionnaire, 5) successfully complete an extensive background check. This process
essentially mirrored the requirements set forth for all new hires.

•

The testing instrument known as the IMPACT test, and as filed in Federal Court, required
affected staff to obtain no less than 70% in the Human Relations and 70% in the Reading
portions as well as be in the 50th percentile overall. The PROMOTE test, for those seeking
supervisory positions, required affected staff to obtain no less than a 66% score.

•

Prior to the process being implemented the Transitional Administrator made several
adjustments to the Staffing Plan in order to give affected staff every opportunity to succeed:
1) affected staff would submit a cover letter and resume to one of the recruiters instead of
applying online and filling out the lengthy on-line application, 2) the telephone screen
consisted of five objective questions instead of the fifteen minute intense phone screen, 3)
provide two opportunities to take the IMPACT and PROMOTE tests, 4) eliminate the 50th
percentile requirement, 5) the written portion of the interview tool was eliminated, 6) the
interview questionnaire was simplified and shortened.

 Staffing Plan Chronology
(Continued)
•

May 10, 2011 Status: Of the 202 affected employees; fourteen (14) employees retired,
seven (7) resigned, ten (10) employees were terminated for cause, one (1) passed away, one
(1) is on military leave, and nine (9) did not complete the process.

•

Of the affected staff who tested: 121 passed and 56 failed. Those who failed had an
opportunity to retest. Of the employees who retested, over half passed on the second
opportunity.

•

All testing was completed by March 2011. Affected staff who have completed the process,
have been selected to be a part of two “new” Centers (Legacy and Omega)

•

The anticipated completion date for the staffing plan was June 2011 however, since the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has not rendered a decision, employees who failed the
testing have not yet been made aware of the results.

•

On August 2, 2011, JTDC and Teamsters jointly held a “college fair” in which 9 (nine)
nationally accredited colleges participated. The goal for JTDC was to assist staff in
identifying colleges that meet the Administrative Offices of the Illinois Courts (AOIC)
criteria.

•

March, 2012: Of the 49 affected employees allowed to test for the second time, test results
were communicated to those employees. Those employees that did not pass the test were
allowed to test for the 3rd time. Test results were communicated to employees June, 2012. A
panel interviewed those employees that passed the test and employees were assigned to
appropriate positions. After the third testing opportunity, nine (9) employees were terminated
and three (3) employees will be demoted to lower positions.

 Legal Activity Highlights
(Continued)
Significant Cases:
1) 7th Circuit Court of Appeals:
  Rickey Coleman v. Earl Dunlap. 11-2669. Coleman sued for wrongful discharge. The
case was before the Appellate Court on an interlocutory appeal filed by Defendant
Dunlap regarding whether or not the order appointing Mr. Dunlap as the Transitional
Administrator of the JTDC, afforded him absolute immunity against causes of actions
like the one filed by Plaintiff Coleman. The 7th Circuit Court held that Mr. Dunlap’s
administrative acts of hiring and firing JTDC employees are not protected by absolute
immunity.
2) 7th Circuit Court of Appeals:
  Doe v. Cook County. 10-2746. Challenges the August 14, 2007 order appointing the
Transitional Administrator and the “Staffing Plan.”
3) Illinois Labor Relations Board:
  Perkins v. Office of the Chief Judge/JTDC S-CA-09225. Complainant claimed unfair

 Nancy B. Jefferson School
“Schools within a School” A Culture of Caring and Learning
(Operated by Chicago Public Schools)
Mission: To operate, through an integrative and collaborative process with the Chicago
Public Schools (CPS) system, an educational program for residents that embraces and
balances the need for safety and security with a creative learning environment and the
opportunity to advance academic, social and behavior competencies.

The school program design unites detention education and detention programming into a true
collaboration by incorporating best practices currently utilized in the field. It combines the
learning theory and design of David Kolb and Madeline Hunter with the research-based "Safe
School", "schools within a school" concept, and the cognitive behavioral approach to changing
delinquent behavior.
Goals:
1. To maximize the assurance for the SAFETY of all residents and staff by implementing an
objective classification system.
2. To ensure that every resident receives educational programs and services consistent with
federal, state and local laws/regulation.
3. To eliminate the need for resident suspension and/or expulsion from the educational
setting at the JTDC facility.
4. To establish and implement a behavior program that reinforces positive resident behavior
and achievement in the educational setting.
5. To establish a continuum of sanctions for inappropriate resident behavior that minimizes
disruption and promotes every opportunity for the resident to continue in or return to the
learning environment in a timely manner.
6. To "bridge" the role and the relationship of the CPS Instructor and the JTDC Youth
Development Specialist in the classroom.
7. To develop strategies that recognize and respond to the "unique" environment that the
JTDC/CPS educational program represents in a manner that offers an alternative to the
"traditional" educational structure and approach.
8. To maximize learning and transition of residents through the development and
implementation of Individualized Success Plans for each resident.
Over the 2012 calendar year, the school continued its partnership with Old Town School of
Folk Music provided by the Arts Infusion Grant funding to enhance the educational curriculum.
In addition, the curriculum will offer elective courses including music, art, dance and computer
courses. The new curriculum will engage residents by focusing on arts and music to enhance
creativity and problem-solving skills as a vehicle to redirect aggressive behavior. The five (5)
year “Arts Infusion” grant is provided by the Chicago Community Trust Company.
