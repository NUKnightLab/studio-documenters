 Journal of Proceedings

and is home to several locally rare and conservative plant species. Building upon restoration efforts in the
northern half of the preserve, the Forest Preserve District of Cook County has been awarded a grant by
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service via the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to conduct an additional 17.5
acres of timber stand improvements and invasive species removal at the site. Work is expected to be
completed within one to two winter work seasons, depending on ground conditions. Thinning of invasive
and over-abundant trees will restore natural oak savanna and marsh tree densities, increase the amount of
sunlight reaching the ground-layer, and improve wildlife habitat. As a condition of the grant award, the
Preserves are obligated to maintain the project area through a habitat retention period which is in effect
until 7/11/2028. Total project costs are $67,000.00, with a 50-50 match being contributed by each partner.

restore fallow land wherever possible and these farming practices are a good method to keep these lands
in a more manageable condition until a restoration project can take place on the site. The contract term for
hay cutting is a period of one (1) year, with four (4) one-year renewal options to be exercised by the
General Superintendent or his/her designee, which gives the Preserves the option to discontinue farming
practices in order to restore these lands to a natural condition.
Mark Hansen was the highest responsible bidder for the two (2) locations listed below, for a total

PROPOSED PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ITEM AMENDMENT
Department: Planning & Development
Request: Approval of permanent and temporary easement areas as revised.
Item Number: Approved on the 7/16/2013 Board Agenda as item 6; Approved on the 7/16/2013 Real
Estate Estate Committee Report as item 13REAL0001.
Fiscal Impact: IDOT will pay the appraised value of $12,300.00 for the permanent easements and
$11,700.00 for the temporary easement.
Account(s): N/A
Summary: Based on preliminary plans, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) requested 0.25
acres of Permanent Easement and 0.14 acres of Temporary Easement for removal, replacement and
maintenance of an existing culvert and outfall of the Middle Fork North Branch Chicago River through
the intersection of Dundee Road and Lee Road in Northbrook. Due to subsequent final engineering plans,
IDOT requests that the previously approved easement be amended to 0.335 acres for the Permanent
Easement and 0.25 acres for the Temporary Easement. The additional easement area eliminates the use
of unsightly gabions and will result in a more natural slope. The Forest Preserves staff has reviewed this
request and plans and has found them to be acceptable; therefore, it is recommended that the Forest
Preserve District Board of Commissioners approve the easement areas as amended.

13REAL0001
ARNOLD L. RANDALL, General Superintendent, requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County (the “Preserves”) to grant permanent and temporary easements to the Illinois
Department of Transportation (IDOT) for removal, replacement and maintenance of an existing culvert
and outfall of the Middle Fork North Branch Chicago River through the intersection of Dundee Road (IL
68) and Lee Road in Northbrook. The area for the permanent easements is 0.25335 acres. The area for
the temporary easement is 0.1425 acres. IDOT indicates that 67 live and 10 dead trees will be removed
on the Preserves’ property for the project.
Reason: The existing storm water culvert at this major intersection is badly deteriorated and needs
replacement. The northernmost end of the existing culvert already extends onto the Preserves’ property
but there are no records of an existing easement. The new culvert will eliminate the middle wall of the
existing structure where debris accumulates and impedes the flow. IDOT will be responsible for future
maintenance and debris removal at the structure.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: Revenue of $231,627.03 $186,000.00 to District for Tree Mitigation Fee.
Easement Fee: To be determined by appraised value. IDOT has agreed to pay fair market value for the
easements.
