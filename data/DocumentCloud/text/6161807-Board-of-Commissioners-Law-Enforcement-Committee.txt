Mark Kilgallon, Director of Human Resources, stated that it is his understanding that individuals who
will be part of the Re-Entry Employment Project would be hired by the County as employees and then
they would be paid to go to the training program. Upon satisfactory completion of the training program,
community-based organizations such as the Safer Foundation, as well as other organizations, should
be directly involved with the selection process.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Article III.,
Section 3-1a and 3-1b. The motion carried.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Article IV.,
Section 4-1c. The motion carried.
Commissioner Gorman asked whether the County currently hires ex-offenders.
Mr. Kilgallon replied that the original ordinance was introduced to focus on the other constitutionally
elected officials because President John H. Stroger, Jr., currently hires ex-offenders who meet the
necessary requirements for the job and taking into consideration their past criminal record.
Commissioner Gorman asked Mr. Kilgallon whether he could provide statistics regarding this issue.

Mr. Kilgallon replied that such statistics would be difficult to obtain, but that he would look into the
matter.
Camela Gardner, Assistant State’s Attorney, cited the “Proposed Revised Ordinance” and stated that it
provides that “The Review Panel will enter into a memorandum of understanding with selected
“community-Based Organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network and Safer
Foundation, to provide the serviced contained in “, Proposed Revised Ordinance, sect. 5-1.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that the new language in Article V, Section 5-1 should be more
inclusive in reference to community-based organizations, that specifically the amended sentence would
read “…community-based organizations, such as North Lawndale Employment Network…”
Ms. Gardner stated that the State’s Attorney’s Office recommends deleting all references to the specific
entities referenced, or alternatively, indicating that these organizations are not an exhaustive list of
possible organizations. This would ensure that the County has the flexibility to enter a memorandum of
understanding in the future without need for a further revision to the Ordinance.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to add new language to
Article V. Section 5-1. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Article V. Section
5-2. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Article V. Section
5-4. The motion carried.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica moved to delete Article VI. Section
6-1d. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica asked why a participant in this program would be subject to a Class A
misdemeanor.
Ms. Gardner referred to following: The Proposed Revised Ordinance provides that “a person who
knowingly uses or attempts to use a revoked Certificate of Completion in order to obtain or to exercise
any right or privilege that they would not be entitled to obtain or to exercise without a valid Certificate of
Completion is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.”…Proposed Revised Ordinance, sect 7.1(c).
Ms. Gardner stated that that the State’s Attorney’s Office recommends that this provision be revised to
provide for a Class B or a Class C misdemeanors rather than a Class A misdemeanor, in order to
conform with Article 7, Section 6(e) of the Illinois Constitution. She further stated that Class A
misdemeanors are punishable by imprisonment terms of up to a year. The County of Cook, as a home
rule entity, may not punish by imprisonment for more than six months unless authorized by the General
Assembly, which has not occurred in this instance.
Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Article VII.
Section 7-1. The motion carried.
Commissioner Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved the approval of
Communication No. 268698 as amended. The motion carried.
