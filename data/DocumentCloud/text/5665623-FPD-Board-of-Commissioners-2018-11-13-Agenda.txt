Through negotiations, the Owner of Record (the “Seller”), has agreed to sell the Property to the Preserves
for the sum of TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND 00/100 ($220,000.00) plus
closing costs up to $10,000 (up to $230,000.00 in total). The purchase price is based upon two M.A.I.
appraisals obtained by the Forest Preserves and is subject to the Forest Preserves’ satisfactory completion
of its due diligence.
Permission is now sought, upon satisfactory completion of all due diligence and negotiation of any and all
required documentation as determined by the Forest Preserves legal department, to remit a check in the
amount of the Purchase Price plus closing costs as full compensation for the acquisition of the Property.
This land acquisition advances the goals of the Next Century Conservation Plan.
