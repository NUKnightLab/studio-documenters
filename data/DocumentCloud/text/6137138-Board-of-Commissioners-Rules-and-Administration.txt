WHEREAS, the Board of Ethics opined on this matter and concluded that
the use of the County’s wireless internet for said purpose may be construed
as a prohibited political activity and a misuse of County owned property
under Sections 2-571 and 2-576 of the Cook County Ethics Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Ethics Board also recommended that said use be
discontinued in the future; and
WHEREAS, presently Article III, Division 2 concerning Rules of
Organization does not address the issue of using social networking sites
and electronic communication devices during deliberations of the County
Board; and
WHEREAS, because the absence of any guidelines or policies pertaining to
this matter may undermine transparency and the public confidence in Cook
County government, the Board of Ethics also recommended that the use of
social networking sites and other like electronic communications should be
addressed in the framework of the Rules & Administration Committee; and
WHEREAS, Article III, Division 2, Section 2-108, (g) (2) states: The Board
may grant members of the public leave to speak on items pending before

 RULES & ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE REPORT
SEPTEMBER 28, 2010
PAGE 4
Chairman Moreno stated that the above Proposed Ordinance Amendment was drafted in early
January 2010 due to a letter Commissioner Sims had received from the Ethics Board; a copy of
that letter dated December 23, 2009, has been distributed to all the Commissioners. The letter
stated that the Commissioners should revisit the Cook County Code and perhaps amend the
rules. The amendments to the rules were submitted to the State’s Attorney’s Office for their
review. The State’s Attorney gave the Board a lengthy opinion after much research and
deliberation and found that it does not impact the first amendment.
Chairman Moreno asked Patrick Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions
Bureau, to address the Commissioners.
Mr. Driscoll stated that the State’s Attorney’s Office looked at the issue and found that there are
no cases directly in point, but in the analysis the State’s Attorney’s Office does not believe that
there is a legal impediment. The State’s Attorney does not have a legal opinion on whether it
should be adopted or not; that is not the State’s Attorney’s role.
Commissioner Suffredin asked for a roll call when time is appropriate.
Vice Chairman Gorman, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed
Ordinance Amendment (Communication No. 304531) be approved. Commissioner
Suffredin called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:
ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO APPROVE
COMMUNICATION NO. 304531
Yeas:

Chairman Moreno (1)

Nays:

Commissioners Daley, Vice Chairman Gorman, Schneider, Silvestri and Suffredin
(5)

Absent:

Commissioners Beavers, Sims and Steele (3)

The motion to APPROVE the Proposed Ordinance Amendment (Comm. No. 304531)
FAILED.
Chairman Moreno asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers,
in accordance with Cook County Code, Sec. 2-108(dd):
1. George Blakemore – Concerned Citizen
Commissioner Silvestri moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner
Daley. The motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
