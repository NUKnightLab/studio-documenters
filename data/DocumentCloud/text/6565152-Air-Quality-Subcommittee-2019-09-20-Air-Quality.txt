Mr. Kovach mentioned that NOACA staff worked with RideAmigos and Mid-Ohio Regional
Planning Commission (MORPC) to develop the Specialized Mobility Search function.
Mr. Kovach stated that in May, NOACA partnered with Bike Cleveland and uGO to host a bike
challenge. Participants logged 1,454 trips and saved over 3.3 tons of CO2. Weekly raffle winners
and top performers received gift cards to local bike shops.
Mr. Kovach stated that staff will continue to promote Gohio Commute to interested organizations,
work with RideAmigos to improve the platform, launch the Specialized Mobility Search function,
and create new events on the platform.
CY 2018 Air Quality Trends Update
Mr. Kovach stated that NOACA tracks and provides regular updates on Northeast Ohio’s air
quality, publishes an annual Air Quality Trends Report, and the region’s status for the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Mr. Kovach mentioned that air quality continues to
improve overall in the region and concentrations of all pollutants continue to decline, though there
is year-to-year variation. The region is in nonattainment for two of six NAAQS.

3082b

1-2

 Mr. Kovach stated that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)
strengthened NAAQS to 70 ppb from 75 ppb on October 26, 2015, and issued nonattainment
designations on April 30, 2018. Mr. Kovach noted that Northeast Ohio is designated as a
marginal nonattainment area and Lake County (75 ppb) and Geauga County (71 ppb) both had
values above the NAAQS. The attainment date is August 3, 2021.
Mr. Kovach stated that Lake County had the highest O3 value in 2018 (76 ppb). For the 3-year
average, O3 values were above NAAQS for Lake (75 ppb), Geauga (74 ppb), and Cuyahoga (71
ppb). The region experienced 13 exceedance days in 2018, but none so far in 2019.
Cuyahoga and Lorain Counties were designated as nonattainment for 2012 annual PM2.5
NAAQS in 2015. In 2018, Cuyahoga's PM2.5 level was 11.1 µg/m3, down slightly from 11.2 µg/m3
in 2017 (second straight year below 12 µg/m3 standard). The 3-year averages of annual PM2.5
concentration for Northeast Ohio ((2006-2008)-(2016-2018)) dropped for all counties in the
region. Based on these declines, US EPA officially redesignated the region from nonattainment
to maintenance status on April 12, 2019. Lake County was designated as nonattainment for
2010 SO2 annual NAAQS (75 ppb) in July 2013. Ohio EPA filed a redesignation request on
April 8, 2018.
Mr. Kovach stated that staff is in the process of finalizing the draft CY 2018 Air Quality Trends
Report and the draft document will be completed in the first half of FY 2020.
Air Quality Forecast Accuracy (through May 31, 2019)
Mr. Joe MacDonald stated that NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level ozone
concentrations and fine particulate matter concentrations. In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone
began on March 1 and will conclude on October 31, while daily forecasts for fine particulate
matter are year-round. The air quality forecasts are posted through AirNowTech in affiliation with
U.S. EPA.
Mr. MacDonald stated that NOACA’s ground-level ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
forecasts are based on a review of several meteorological variables and model guidance.
Mr. MacDonald reviewed the 2019 PM2.5 forecast performance for the NOACA region. He stated
that NOACA’s forecasts for good/moderate threshold were correct 68% of the time and the
forecasts for moderate/unhealthy threshold were correct 100% of the time.
Mr. MacDonald stated that the forecast performance of ozone was as follows for the period of
March 1-May 31, 2019:
Agency
NOACA
NOAA (6Z/12Z)

50 ppb
85%
(89/89)%

70 ppb
100%
(100/100)%

Mr. MacDonald stated that NOACA staff will continue to track the forecast performance of ozone
for NOACA and NOAA; track the forecast performance of particulate matter for NOACA only;
collaborate with NOAA personnel to report model performance in Northeast Ohio; and provide
an update at the Air Quality Subcommittee meeting on September 20, 2019.

RE:

Update on Development of Air Quality Implementation Strategy

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is for information only.
BACKGROUND
In June 2017, the NOACA Board approved a contract with Markey Group, a communications consulting firm,
to develop an Air Quality Public Education and Outreach Strategy, and an accompanying Communications
Plan. These documents will guide NOACA’s air quality public outreach activities over the next 5-10 years.
Most importantly, these documents will guide implementation of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan, and help
bring the region into compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (U.S. EPA’s)
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
The Strategy identifies gaps in existing air quality programming in the region and will engage the community
(individuals, employers, health care organizations, and educational institutions) in actions aimed to improve
air quality through their implementation. The Communications Plan, in conjunction with the Strategy, provides
specific direction to NOACA staff regarding air quality messaging to the public – via NOACA’s website, social
media, special events, paid advertising, and other forms of communication.
At the AQS December 2018 meeting, Markey Group presented an overview of both the Strategy and
Communications plan. Subsequently, the consultant delivered final drafts of both documents to NOACA’s air
quality staff. These documents have undergone internal peer review at NOACA.
The final drafts of the documents will be presented, along with initial plans for implementation, during the
Subcommittee’s September meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact related to this presentation.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will provide updates on pertinent information regarding the Air Quality Public Education and
Outreach Strategy Implementation Work Plan.

RE:

2019 Commuter Choice Awards

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND
Since 2014, NOACA’s annual Commuter Choice Awards have recognized organizations in Northeast Ohio
that promote alternative transportation modes and foster behavioral change in their employees’ commute
choices. NOACA and its partners award top employers with Gold, Silver, or Bronze ratings based on
employer support (policies, facilities, and incentives), employer location, and (starting in 2017) employee
commuter behavior. NOACA also recognizes “best in category” winners: large business, small business,
large government entity or non-profit, small government entity or non-profit.
In 2019, NOACA partnered with Sustainable Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
(GCRTA), and Laketran to sponsor the awards. NOACA accepted applications for the 2019 Commuter
Choice Awards from May 2 through July 24, and a record 37 organizations entered the competition,
including five (5) new participants. Throughout August, the participating organizations competed in a monthlong challenge on Gohio Commute called the NEO Clean Air Challenge – to measure and rank employee
alternative commutes. Organizations whose employees logged the most alternative commutes in August
(per capita) boosted their overall scores. A record 30 organizations participated, up from 20 during 2018.
In July and August, staff scored the Commuter Choice Awards applications. In September, NOACA and
partner staff reviewed scores and determined winners. On October 16, NOACA and its partners will
announce the winners and distribute awards at the annual Sustainable Cleveland Summit.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
NOACA staff will provide updates on the 2019 Commuter Choice Awards as necessary.

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

RE:

Gohio Commute Update and Performance Measures

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
In partnership with the six (6) other largest Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in Ohio,
NOACA manages Gohio Commute, a multi-regional transportation demand management (TDM)
platform. Gohio Commute, which launched in April 2017, serves as a one-stop-shop trip planner
for the NOACA region, with connectivity throughout Ohio. NOACA has worked to engage
businesses, local governments, colleges, and other organizations to create their own subsites
through the platform. These subsites enable organizations to offer their employees (or students)
targeted incentives to choose healthier, more efficient modes of transportation.
In order to evaluate the success of Gohio Commute, NOACA staff have developed a set of
performance measures, which they track on a regular basis. These performance measures fall
within four categories:
1. User Metrics – e.g. number of registered users, number of logged trips
2. Outreach and Promotion Metrics – e.g. number of Gohio Commute workshops, number of
subsites created
3. Systemwide Performance Metrics – e.g. number of non-drive alone trips logged, amount
of carbon dioxide (CO2) saved
4. Platform Administration and Enhancement Metrics – e.g. number of map layers added,
number of events created
From June 1, 2019, through August 31, 2019, 521 new users joined Gohio Commute from the
NOACA region, bringing the total number of users to 6,461. During the previous three months,
users in the NOACA region logged over 13,313 trips, of which 92.1% were via alternative modes.
This count brings the total number of alternative trips to more than 66,500 since the platform
launched. Gohio Commute users saved more than $53,500 in commute costs and almost 42
metric tons of CO2 emissions during this period (more than $221,000 and nearly 175 metric tons
of CO2 saved since 2017). There are currently 92 subsites in the NOACA region, representing 53

5-5

 different organizations. Moreover, users have created 20 challenges, 46 incentives, and 105
events on the platform.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA will spend $7,500 on Gohio Commute during FY2020. Compared to OhioRideshare,
the agency will accrue a net savings in operational costs of about $4,000 per year.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will continue to promote Gohio Commute to interested organizations. Staff will also
continue to work with RideAmigos to make additions/improvements to the user experience.

RE:

CY 2019 Air Quality Forecast Accuracy (through August 31)

ACTION REQUESTED
No action requested. This item is included for information and presentation only.
BACKGROUND/INFORMATION
Each year, NOACA forecasts daily peak eight-hour ground-level ozone concentrations and fine
particulate matter concentrations. In 2019, daily forecasts for ozone began March 1 and will
conclude October 31, while daily forecasts for fine particulate matter continue year-round.
NOACA posts daily air quality forecasts through AirNowTech, in affiliation with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).
AirNowTech statistics show that NOACA staff categorical forecasts of fine particulate matter for
CY 2019 (through August 31) were 65% accurate (Good/Moderate threshold (12.5µm)) and
100% accurate (Moderate/Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG) threshold (35µm)).
AirNowTech verification statistics also show NOACA staff categorical forecasts of ozone were
slightly less accurate than those of the NOAA 6Z and 12Z model runs against the
Good/Moderate threshold (50ppb) and slightly more accurate compared to the NOAA model
runs against the exceedance threshold (70ppb). Against the Good/Moderate threshold, NOACA
staff predicted ozone levels with 80% accuracy compared to 82% accuracy for the NOAA model
runs. Against the exceedance threshold, NOACA staff predicted ozone levels with 97%
accuracy compared to 96% accuracy for the NOAA model runs. There have been six (6)
exceedances (uncertified) of the standard during this period.
For 2019, NOACA staff will provide NOAA personnel forecast verification statistics on NOAA
model performance throughout the ozone season (March 1-October 31). NOACA staff will also
monitor its own forecast performance and collaborate with others to improve.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Staff will consult with and update the Air Quality Subcommittee throughout this process.

RE:

STOP Update

ACTION REQUESTED
This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND
Since fiscal year 2017, NOACA has administered a consultant contract to provide technical assistance to
Northeast Ohio agencies to improve traffic signal operation on congested roadways. Since then, four
corridors have been improved by retiming a total of 96 traffic signals in 12 different communities. The
benefits of these projects over a five-year period are estimated as follows:
• Reduction of 12,630 metric tons of carbon dioxide
• Reduction of 1,637,000 hours of delay
• Reduction of 1,416,000 gallons of fuel
• Provided an average benefit-to-cost ratio of 28:1
Currently, NOACA’s consultant is in the process of studying Chester Avenue between East 13th Street and
Euclid Avenue, then along Euclid Avenue eastward to East 123rd Street, including a large number of
adjacent intersections. The implementation of recommended timing changes is scheduled to occur in the
month of October. Changes to traffic signal timings will be made in two groups, due to the large number of
signals involved, during the weeks of October 7 and October 28.
As discussed at last meeting, NOACA has moved forward with preparing a Request for Proposals for the
next STOP contract, which is currently being advertised on NOACA’s website under the “About” tab on the
“Doing Business with NOACA” page. (See link to RFP.) The deadline for submitting proposals is 12:00 PM
on Tuesday, October 8, 2019.
The project consists of Part I and Part II with Part II being “if authorized”.
Part I consists of two corridors:
• Bagley Road (from Lindbergh Rd. to Pearl Rd. 3.56 miles, 25 signalized intersections) in the Cities
of Berea and Middleburgh Heights.
• Ridge Road (from Pearl Rd. to Denison Ave., 3.47 miles, 20 signalized intersections) in the Cities of
Parma, Brooklyn, and Cleveland.
Part II will consist of two corridors of similar lengths and numbers of traffic signals.

5-9

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the STOP program is provided from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ)
program.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will work with the affected communities and selected consultant to
develop the STOP on Bagley Road and Ridge Road.
