Year 3: $3,407,519.00). Contract period: July 7, 2007 through July 6, 2010. (898-235
Account). Requisition No. 78980349.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 and future year funds.

Commissioner Gorman inquired how many RFPs were submitted.
Mr. Daley replied that although they contacted three other companies no other RFPs were submitted.
Commissioner Gorman inquired what savings would be entailed with the adoption of this Item.
Mr. Daley replied $4.5 million.
Commissioner Gorman inquired as to how many layoffs would occur under this RFP.
Mr. Daley replied that he is unclear as to a specific number. He noted that Oak Forest Hospital employees would
be considered for hiring by Crothall Healthcare, Inc.
Chairman Murphy made the following explanatory remarks: The savings to the County would be approximately
$1.5 million annually. 96 employees would be laid off. Crothall would consider hiring those who were laid off.
However, they would pay approximately $4 per hour less than Oak Forest currently pays for the same positions.
Crothall would offer a benefits package, however that benefit package would be more costly to the employees
than the benefit package Oak Forest Hospital currently provides, and might not include a pension. It is her
understanding that the Oak Forest employees concerned are not very interested in working for Crothall.
Chairman Murphy inquired how many employees would be cut by Crothall.
Mr. Daley replied that Crothall contends that it could accomplish the work with between 58-62 employees.
Commissioner Moreno stated: He is not convinced that the cost savings would be as extensive as that which
Crothall contends it would be. He is against the idea of 96 employees losing their jobs. Instead, the County could
work with the labor unions to “trim fat” and relocate some of the workers. He suggested that perhaps not enough
study has gone into this issue to justify 96 layoffs.
Commissioner Butler suggested that the Committee should focus on methods of raising $1.5 million annually so
that the Oak Forest Hospital workers do not have to be laid off.
Commissioner Moreno stated that savings soon should accrue to the County as a result of the Board’s decision to
move long-term care patients out of Oak Forest Hospital and into the Boys Home facility. He further stated that
as a result of the moving of these patients, all 96 employees may no longer be needed.
Vice Chairman Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The motion
carried and the meeting was adjourned.

Respectfully submitted,
Labor Subcommittee
