VIOLAITON HISTORY
The dwelling at 14620 Penrod is a 1 ½-story, Cape Cod-style home. The building features stone
veneer and plywood panel exterior wall cladding. Lapped wood siding is located at the gable ends.
The roof is cross gabled and covered by asphalt shingles. A partial width, recessed porch is
located at the building’s front elevation. Windows are currently horizontal-sliding units.
Please see the below designation photo which indicates that the building wood sash and steel
casement windows were originally located at the building’s front elevation. A review of HDC files
indicates that a resident had reported that vinyl slider windows had been installed at the home in
November 2017. Staff did forward the complaint to the Detroit Building, Safety, Engineering, and
Environmental Department (BSEED) for enforcement at that time (November 2017). In 4/2019, a
resident contacted HDC staff and requested that she following up with BSEED re: the existing
window violation. Staff contacted the BSEED court officer and he noted that they did issue a
violation order to the property in 2017, but that it had “…been returned undeliverable.” He further
noted that a new owner had since moved into the home. The below second photo depicts the
current conditions at the building. Finally, please note that a visit to the site on July 8, 2018 revealed
that vinyl windows were also located at the side elevations.
