PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COMPREHENSIVE GUN CONTROL

WHEREAS, According to national statistics, every year in our country, a ?rearm is used in nearly
500,000 crimes, resulting in the deaths and injuries of more than 1 10,000 people, and

WHEREAS, According to statistics from USA Today, between 2006 and 2017 there were mass
shootings approximately every 16 days in the United States, with the most recent incident in Parkland
Florida sparking a renewed and broad sweeping national conversation on the need for common-sense gun
solutions to keep our citizens safe while protecting the 2nd Amendment, and

WHEREAS, In Chicago and Cook County, particularly minority communities that often have the
greatest

economic needs, gun violence is a traumatic and daily occurrence that has reached a crisis point, prevents
economic growth and leads to increased incarceration and the perpetuation of the cycle of violence, and

WHEREAS, According to statistics in 2017, there were 743 homicides as a result ofgun violence in
Chicago and Cook County, and,

WHEREAS, Gun violence has taken a massive toll on Cook County, taking the lives of countless men
and women, many young, leaving physical, emotional scars for the victims and their families
that survive, and producing untreated and pervasive trauma in communities, individuals and children, and

WHEREAS, The effects and costs of gun violence can be seen throughout the county in our criminal
justice system, included but not limited to the of?ces of the Sheriff, State?s Attorney, and Public
Defenders, the hospital system, and Medical Examiner?s Of?ce.

WHEREAS, The time is now for comprehensive gun control laws. It is time for our federal and state
representatives to take a stand on this crisis, and

WHEREAS, Cook County echoes President Donald Trump?s call for strengthened background checks,
the ban of bump stocks and raising the age from 18 to 21 for the purchase of assault-style weapons, and

WHEREAS, Cook County calls upon its residents to reach out to their elected of?cials to urge the
passage of a variety of common-sense gun control policies in Spring?eld, including but not limited to
requiring gun dealers to be licensed, strengthened background checks, and banning the use of
military-style weapons, high capacity magazines and the civilian sale of body armor, and

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, A step toward more comprehensive gun safety laws is a step in
the right direction because every gun death, is one too many.
