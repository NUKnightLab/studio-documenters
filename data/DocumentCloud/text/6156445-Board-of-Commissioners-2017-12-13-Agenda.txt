PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CALLING FOR A MEETING OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS BILLING
AND COLLECTION PRACTICES AT THE COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS
SYSTEM
WHEREAS, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) sees more than 300,000 patients
annually, and
WHEREAS, many of those patients are insured, but CCHHS does most of the area’s charity care for
which it receives no compensation, and
WHEREAS, the billing and collections practices at CCHHS should be reviewed to ensure that County
taxpayers are receiving maximum benefit for the funding the County provides CCHHS, and
WHEREAS, CCHHS administration shall appear before the Finance Committee to better clarify the state
of the billing and collections practices within CCHHS.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the President and Board of Commissioners that the
Finance Committee shall meet for the purposes of reviewing the billing and collections practices at the

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING CONGRESS TO PROTECT ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
PROVIDED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND THOUSANDS OF COOK COUNTY RESIDENTS BY
THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
WHEREAS, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called the Affordable Care Act
(“ACA”) was adopted in 2010 to dramatically reduce the number of uninsured Americans and improve
overall public health for the American people; and
WHEREAS, the ACA protects our working families against health insurance discrimination and denial
for pre-existing conditions, provides subsidies to working families to offset the cost of health insurance,
incentivizes states to expand Medicaid coverage for the working poor, and requires coverage of basic

Page 8 of 50

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 13, 2017

family health care needs in health insurance plans; and
WHEREAS, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”), the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency,
estimated that between 2010-2019 the ACA would yield a projected reduction in the Country’s deficits of
more than $150 billion over that period; and
WHEREAS, the ACA, over the last six (6) years, has cut the overall uninsured rate in the United States
from 15.7% to 8.6% and, among those ages 18-64, from 22.3% to 11.9%, and reduced the number of
uninsured at our County health system from 70% to 30%; and
WHEREAS, thanks to the ACA, more than 1 million people in Illinois get insurance through the ACA
marketplace or the expansion of Medicaid, and through CountyCare, the Cook County Health & Hospital
System (“CCHHS”) which provides 140,000 Medicaid recipients with health care coverage, a number that
could double in 2018; and
WHEREAS, the repeal of ACA would lead to a significant negative economic impact for Illinois as the
Illinois Health & Hospital Association predicted the state could lose as much as $11.6 billion to $13.1
billion in annual economic activity, translating into a potential loss of 84,000 to 95,000 jobs, if Congress and
President Trump repeal coverage for those 1 million people without a viable and comprehensive
replacement plan; and
WHEREAS, thanks in large part to the ACA, the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“CCHHS”)
has been able to reduce its reliance on the annual taxpayer allocation by more than $370 million due to the
ACA and Medicaid expansion, a 75 percent decrease in local tax support since 2009, from $481 million to
$111.5 million; and
WHEREAS, should the ACA be repealed or severely diminished, the annual loss of revenue for care
provided by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System may likely exceed $300 million annually and
could be as high as $800 million. Additionally, other hospitals and providers in Cook County would stand to
lose more than $300 million in reimbursements from our CountyCare Health Plan, which is on top of the
hundreds of millions more dollars lost from other Medicaid health plans, and cuts mentioned in ACA repeal
proposals thus far are unsustainable, unfair, callous and would require increased state or local revenues to
meet the needs of the uninsured in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, a significant increase in the uninsured rate and amount of uncompensated care in the
County and the region due to the loss of health insurance coverage for working families because of any
repeal of the ACA would undermine the “patient mix” of the CCHHS, reducing the financial success of
the system and diminishing the quality of life of our residents; and
WHEREAS, the Republican-led Congress has made repeated efforts to repeal parts or all of the ACA,
with the Senate recently passing the elimination of the individual mandate, a central tenet of the ACA that
health policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work; and;

Page 9 of 50

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

December 13, 2017

WHEREAS, the CBO reported that repealing said mandate would increase the number of uninsured by
13 million by 2027 and that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over
the next decade in the individual market created by the Affordable Care Act; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, believes that access to quality, affordable health
care is a human right, not a privilege, and is essential to the quality of life of families and individuals in
Cook County and everywhere throughout our country; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of our federal, state and local officials to defend the issues and
interests of their constituents, including advocating for access to quality, affordable health care coverage
provided for by the Affordable Care Act;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with any alternative that
would not improve access to quality, affordable health care for all of our residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners oppose
any measure that results in a loss of health insurance coverage by any American, weakens the ACA’s
protection against health insurance discrimination or denial based on preexisting conditions, reduces the
ACA’s subsidies to individuals for buying health care, or reduces the incentives for states to cover
individuals through expanding Medicaid; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County urges the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Illinois
General Assembly, the Governor and members of the general public to oppose and resist any weakening
of the protections of the Affordable Care Act for working families; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the United
States, U.S. Speaker of the House, U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. House Minority Leader, U.S.
Senate Minority Leader, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Governor of Illinois, President of the Illinois
Senate, and Speaker of the Illinois House.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: This contract extension and increase will allow for continuation of unarmed security services
provided by G4S to ensure the safety of residents and employees of the Cook County Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center. Their services include: night watch, escorted movement and control, direct residential
supervision, and emergency staffing on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week basis.

The company’s services are necessary to maintain the appropriate staff to resident ratio (which varies
according to the activity and time of day) when security staffing levels drop due to unexpected absences,
terminations, and resignations. G4S employees are required to comply with the same educational and
training requirements regular JTDC staff.
On 10/25/2017, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer notified the court that the firm selected
through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process could not be awarded for failure to comply with the Cook
County Code of Ordinances related to a contract with the Cook County Health and Hospital Systems. As
such, the RFP results have been set aside, necessitating this contract amendment with G4S. This
extension will provide time for the stakeholders to evaluate what the next steps moving forward will be.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
G4S Secure Solutions (and its predecessor firm) was selected by the Office of the Transitional
Administrator of the JTDC pursuant to federal court order.
