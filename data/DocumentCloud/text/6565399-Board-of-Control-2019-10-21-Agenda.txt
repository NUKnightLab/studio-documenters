IV- CONTRACTS AND AWARDS
A. – Tabled Items
The following item was held at the request of the Board members.
BC2019-677
Department of Information Technology, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1200652 with
Rimini Street, Inc. for maintenance and support services for the SAP Human Capital Management R3
System for the period 11/6/2012 - 10/31/2019 to extend the time period to 10/30/2020 and for additional
funds in the amount not-to-exceed $78,302.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Dennis Sullivan and Jeanelle Greene, Department of Information Technology, presented. Dale Miller asked
why this item was initially tabled; asked Dennis Kennedy whether the Enterprise Resource Planning
Project (ERP) systems that are required to be in place which replaces this contract, are contained in what
is referred to as the core implementation scheduled to go live in April 1, 2020, and asked what required
elements are included in Phase 2 that will be implemented between April, 2020 and December of 2020;

14

 Dennis Kennedy said payroll will be included in Phase 2 due to the complexity and problems with GHR and
would most likely be implemented mid-year.
Mr. Miller asked if 10/30/2020 is realistic as we do not want to pay for another year of service
unnecessarily and asked if this amendment should go through 12/2020; asked the department to
communicate to the provider that it is difficult to forecast the ERP go live date and that a better
arrangement needs to be made to allow for flexibility and should be established up front before another
year of service is approved.
Mr. Kennedy stated that adding 2 months would affect pricing.
Nan Baker asked if this service will be required once ERP is in production and asked how the time period
of this amendment correlates with the first ERP go live date of April, 2020; asked if it is possible that these
services will be needed after 10/30/2020; asked if the requested not-to-exceed amount for additional
funds would all be required if ERP rolls out sooner and asked how the amount for the additional funds
was determined; asked what were the specific issues that were of concern regarding the contract
language; asked if the total amount of the amendment would need to be paid even if it is written in the
contract as a not-to-exceed amount; asked if the ERP Team agrees that this contract must continue until
10/30/2020; stated that costs must be tracked when there are delays to the ERP project; expressed her
concern about the payroll component of ERP not being ready by 4/1/2020, as anticipated and requested
follow up on the payroll implementation schedule.
Jerad Zibritosky, Department of Law, said that he would need to speak with his colleague that prepared
the contract amendment to address the questions regarding the contract language, amount and time
period and would follow up with Board members.
Dennis Kennedy stated that payroll will be the last component rolled out for ERP and all funds will most
likely be used.
Trevor McAleer asked if the County would be required to enter into another 1 year contract if ERP is
further delayed, as the current contract does not have a standard 30 day termination clause; stated that
he is surprised that this amendment moved forward without the standard 30 day termination clause;
asked if the amount of this amendment is the same as the prior year amount and asked if this covers any
staffing services; and recommended to hold the item to determine the appropriate end date. Mr. Kennedy
concurred with Mr. McAleer’s recommendation to hold the item, as well as the other Board members.
Jeanelle Greene returned after the item was held and indicated that she has spoken with the provider
who said that they are able to renew for whatever period of time is required by the County, as long as the
department checks in with the provider as to the project timeline status in the next 6 to 8 months to
determine the next renewal period.
Ms. Baker asked if there was any concession on the termination clause. Ms. Greene indicated there was
not.

15

 Mr. McAleer asked for confirmation that the provider was initially agreeable to a 6-month termination
clause but the administration was not. Ms. Greene said that further discussion with the provider lead to
the one-year clause. Mr. McAleer confirmed that the provider would not agree to anything less than one
year at the conclusion of the discussions.
The item remained on hold for one week.
B. – New Items for Review
BC2019-738
Fiscal Office/Office of the Treasurer, submitting an amendment to Contract No. CE1400319 with F&E
Check Protector Company dba F&E Payment Pros for licensing, support, training and maintenance services
on the Digital Remittance Processing System for the period 10/1/2014 – 9/30/2019 to extend the time
period to 9/30/2020 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $11,245.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Charnese Wilson, Office of the Treasurer, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if the Digital Remittance
Processing System produces receipts to customers who come in to pay their taxes and if this amendment
includes any software upgrades to remedy the Internal Auditor’s findings. Nan Baker asked if this system
will process checks and if it will assist with potential cash/check handling issues. Dennis Kennedy provided
clarification and stated that this system only generates images of a physical check for electronic transfer,
rather than taking them to the bank for deposit and that the physical document is retained until that
deposit clears. Ms. Baker asked if there was a time when checks were not being imaged during the
payment process and if this software will improve that process. Mr. Kennedy said that the Inspector
General’s report relayed concerns about the period of time between the receipt of the check and when it
was imaged and indicated that those controls were appropriately adjusted. Ms. Baker asked for a copy of
the cash handling policy that was updated, in response to the Inspector General’s report. Dennis Kennedy
motioned to approve the item; Dale Miller seconded. Item BC2019-738 was unanimously approved.
BC2019-739

not-to-exceed $65,975.00.
Funding Source: General Fund
Lenora Lockett, Office of Procurement and Diversity, presented. Dale Miller asked if this contract

unanimously approved.

Funding Source: Medical Examiner’s Crime Lab Fund
Hugh Shannon, Office of the Medical Examiner, presented. Trevor McAleer asked if Thermo Electron
North America, LLC was a sole source provider and why did the department not conduct a sole source

PASSAGES NON-SUPPORT CONTRACT - 2019-2021
The Common Pleas Court/Corrections Planning Board is requesting authority to apply Ohio Community
Corrections Act (CCA) Grant in the amount of $90,500.00 for Passages Connection Fathers and Sons Inc.
(commonly known as Passages, Inc.) to assist the Adult Probation Department by providing assessment
and specialized programming (including individual counseling) to address the needs of offenders in
meeting their child support obligations. This effort addresses Non-Support Specialized Caseloads by
providing an additional option in the continuum of sanctions for offenders. The aim is to reduce the need
for incarceration in local jails by delivering an effective sentencing alternative. The time period for services
is July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2021.
Funding Source: Ohio Community Corrections Act (CCA) Grant
An RFP exemption is needed as the Vendor is written into the Grant.
The reason this item is being submitted well after the contract start date of July 1, 2019 includes the
following issues influencing the submission date.
1. The State of Ohio did not pass the current two (2) year budget until July 15, 2019.
2. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction received confirmation as to their
community corrections funding availability on July 17, 2019.
41

 3. Although the contract would have already would be at least three (3) weeks late if the
Corrections Planning Board had the ability to move it forward at that time, we were unable to
do so because of the required appropriations underpinning the contract required approval
prior to this happening.
4. In August, there was only one (1) fiscal agenda (August 6th) Corrections Planning Board
potentially could have placed the appropriations item on. The August 6th meeting was not on
the original schedule released by OBM to include appropriations. By the time the Court
learned that appropriations were to be included in the August 6th meeting, the deadline to
submit required documents had passed (July 251h).
5. The next scheduled meeting with appropriations on the agenda did not take place until
September 101h, with funding becoming available September 11th.
6. Signed contracts were returned by the Vendor to the Corrections Planning Board midSeptember, 2019.
Little or nothing under the control of the Corrections Planning Board can be changed to avoid this
chain of events from happening in the future.
History – BC2018-30; BC2019-207
The Cuyahoga County Executive, the Common Pleas Court and Passages, Inc. entered into an Agreement
in 2015 (Resolution R2015-0010) whereby Passages Connecting Fathers and Sons, Inc. Was awarded
$744,000.00 to provide Thinking 4 A Change (T4C) an evidence-based cognitive behavior therapy designed
to reduce thinking errors and improve justice related outcomes for to all moderate and high risk offenders
engaged with the criminal justice system. The therapy program will assist offenders to recognize and
identify thinking errors that lead to high risk behavior. Three subsequent amendments to the agreement
occurred annually thereafter.

to award small repairs to various vendors, not-to-exceed $150,000.00 total for the period 7/29/201912/31/2020.
This request is to amend the alternate procurement approval to allow the Sheriff's Department to
establish not-to-exceed Department/Purchase Orders for each of the six approved vendors.
The goal of this amendment is to encumber the approved funds for each vendor and allow each payment
to be made from these Department/Purchase orders when such repairs are needed. This will allow for
better tracking of payments and service, as well as ensure the funds are available for repairs when needed.
Previously Approved Vendors
Astro Supply - $10,000.00
Belenky, Inc. - $13,000.00
Cleveland Communications - $35,000.00

General Parts, LLC - $60,000.00

This amendment will enable the funds for these repairs to be encumbered, ensuring that funds are
available when needed and allow for better tracking of repairs and payments.
