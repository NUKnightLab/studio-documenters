 EXPLANATION
The CHA is subject to the provisions of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (as amended
in 1988 by the Fair Housing Amendments Act, hereinafter referred to as “The Fair Housing
Act”) and its implementing regulations, as well as state and local laws and regulations, including,
but not limited to the Cook County Human Rights Ordinance, the Illinois Human Rights Act and
the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance. In addition, the CHA must comply with all
nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements and administer its programs and activities
in a manner that affirmatively furthers fair housing as outlined in the Amended and Restated
Moving to Work Agreement (hereafter “Amended MTW Agreement”). The Amended MTW
Agreement further stipulates that the CHA is required to conduct testing for fair housing
compliance in its public housing and Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) programs.
In order to conduct fair housing testing in a manner that does not lend itself to risks of conflicts
of interest, the CHA elected to contract with a third-party to perform the fair housing testing for
CHA Senior Developments and HCV landlords, as well as provide customer service feedback for
CHA Family Developments. It is the goal of the CHA to contract with a third-party contractor
possessing extensive experience in Fair Housing testing for public housing agencies. With the
assistance of the third-party contractor, the CHA will fulfill its Fair Housing testing requirements
under the Amended MTW Agreement.
The third-party contractor will be responsible for testing applicable CHA staff, PPMs, CHA’s
HCV contract administrators, and private landlords enrolled in the HCV program. The thirdparty contractor will also develop non-testing methods to survey and document fair housing
discrimination and customer service at applicable Senior and Family housing developments. At
Family Developments, the third-party contactor will be required to survey and document units
offered to people with mobility impairments, reasonable accommodation requests, and steering
of residents to particular developments or units within a development among other activities.
The third-party contractor will conduct fair housing testing for landlords currently enrolled in the
HCV program and Property Managers at CHA Senior Developments. Landlords will be tested to
determine whether steering HCV participants to buildings in certain neighborhoods has occurred
and/or whether housing to HCV participants in pre-determined ‘Opportunity’ neighborhoods is
being denied.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
RFP No. 10-00481 for Conducting Fair Housing Testing was released on February 8, 2010. The
RFP was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times on February 8, 2010, Chicago Defender on
February 10-16, 2010, and in El Dia Newspaper on February 12 -18, 2010. In addition to
advertising in the newspapers, the RFP was placed on the CHA’s website and in BuySpeed on
February 8, 2010. Nine firms were directly solicited. The notice was also sent to twenty (23)
assist agencies. Nineteen (19) firms downloaded the RFP from BuySpeed and four (4) firms
picked up copies of the RFP. A Pre-Proposal Conference was held at the CHA on February 17
at 2:00 p.m. Addendum Number One (1) was issued on March 3, 2010 to extend the proposal
due date and to respond to questions. The CHA received one proposal from the Chicago
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. (the “CLCCRUL”) on March 15, 2010.

 CLCCRUL’s submission was evaluated by a CHA Evaluation Committee comprised of five (5)
individuals.
After the evaluation committee completed its evaluation of the proposal, the Contracting Officer
invited The Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. to participate in
orals/discussions. After evaluating the oral presentation and considering the information given
in the written proposal and the firm’s best and final offers, the CHA selected the Chicago
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. as the awardee under RFP 10-00481 to
conduct Fair Housing Testing services. CLCCRUL has an extensive knowledge of fair housing
in the City of Chicago and many years of experience doing very similar work for HUD as the
recipient of several FHIP (Fair Housing Initiatives Program) grants.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA that the Board of Commissioners
authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to enter into a contract with The Chicago
Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Inc. to conduct fair housing testing for a term
of one year for the firm-fixed fee amount of $500,000.00.
