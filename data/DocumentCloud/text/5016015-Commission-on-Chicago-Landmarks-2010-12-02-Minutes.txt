 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
December 2, 2010
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on November 4, 2010, at 1:50 p.m. The meeting was
held at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
John Baird
Phyllis Ellin
Ernest Wong

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

25 E. Washington
(Jewelers Row District – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of remaining original double-hung wood windows
with aluminum picture windows on the north and east elevations to match
the majority of existing windows on the building.

Action:

Approximately 75% (510) of the windows were previously replaced, prior
to the designation of the district, with a non-historic window type, and the
applicant proposes to replace the remaining windows (174), scattered over
several floors, with the matching non-historic window so that the building
will have a uniform appearance.
The Committee unanimously found that the project, given these particular
circumstances and specific conditions, would not have an adverse effect
on the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark
district and approve the project, in this limited instance, subject to these
conditions and Historic Preservation staff review and approval:
1. As proposed, the remaining windows may be replaced with new
aluminum picture windows to match the previously-installed
replacement windows. Dimensioned details and finish information of
the proposed and previously-installed windows shall be submitted with
the permit application; and,
2. For documentation purposes, enlarged dimensioned elevation

 drawings, section details and photos of the historic double-hung wood
windows and brick mold shall be submitted as part of the permit
application.

2.

4401 S. Berkeley
(North Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of attached one-car masonry garage with roof deck
and alley access

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The façade treatment of the garage should be further studied to be
more compatible with the architectural character of the house and the
district, such as by incorporating a base treatment similar to that of the
house; and,
2. A cut sheet of the proposed garage door shall be submitted with the
permit application

3.

210 S. Canal
(Union Station – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed four new cooling towers with screen walls, to be mounted on the
roof on the north end of the building, and a new air conditioning system
within the Great Hall.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The existing twelve ducts with decorative metal grilles at the Great
Hall waiting room (ground-floor) level are proposed to be reused.
Subject to Historic Preservation staff review and approval, should any
of the decorative grilles be deteriorated beyond repair, they may be
replaced to match the historic design, profiles, pattern, materials, etc.
Repair and replacement details shall be submitted with the permit
application;
2. The preferred Option 1, to raise the floors of the north and south
balconies to construct a new mechanical plenum, is approved. The
proposed new glass railings are to be set back a minimum of 4’-10”
from the existing plaster parapet wall and be no taller than 3’ above
the existing parapet wall. The new railings shall be of clear glass with
a minimal banister and vertical supports to minimize its visual
appearance. Details shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff as part of the permit application. Also, staff shall
review proposed future balcony fixtures and furniture layouts prior to

 construction, order, and installation. In general, the height of any
fixtures, furniture, and free-standing décor/lighting should be no taller
than the railing height in order to minimize its visibility from within
the Great Hall; and,
3. The new louvered enclosure, proposed to screen the four new cooling
towers, shall be reduced in height if possible (e.g. by approximately
3’) to further reduce its visibility from the public rights-of-way. The
louvered enclosure shall be painted a non-reflective color to match the
color of the beige-brick of the existing penthouses.

4.

2128 W. Haddon
(Ukrainian Village District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of painted, damaged outer wythe of face brick on
the front façade with new brick and mortar to match the historic masonry.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following condition:
1. As proposed, the exterior wythe of face brick, which is painted, soft,
and badly pitted, may be replaced with new brick and mortar to match
the historic masonry in color, texture, finish, and joint profile. The
inner wythe and historic wood cornice, brackets, and stone water table
are all to remain in place. Brick and mortar samples, as well as a
control mock-up, shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff.

5.

2157 W. North
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 14’-long by 7’-tall off-premise advertising sign on the west
façade of an existing 3-story corner building.

Action:

Should the applicant not agree to withdraw Sign Application #100364210,
pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance, the
Committee voted unanimously on the following:
A) Found that, pursuant to the Wicker Park District Designation
Ordinance designating the Wicker Park District a Chicago Landmark
on April 12, 1991, the significant historical and architectural features
of the district are identified as all exteriors of the structures,
streetscapes, and landscapes; and,
B) Preliminarily found that the subject property, a 3-story corner masonry
building constructed in 1909 contributes to the character of the Wicker
Park District, which includes buildings in a wide variety of

 architectural styles built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries; and,
C) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance,
preliminarily found that the proposed billboard (off-premise
advertising) sign would not meet the Commission’s guidelines and
standards and would adversely affect and destroy significant historical
and architectural features of the building and the district; and
D) Issued a preliminary decision disapproving the sign application.
The applicant may withdraw the application or, pursuant to Section 2-120790 of the Municipal Code of Chicago, within ten days of receiving the
notice of preliminary disapproval request in writing an informal
conference to further discuss and reach an accord regarding the
application. If the Commission does not receive a request from the
applicant in writing to hold an informal conference, a public hearing on
the sign application must be held and concluded within 90 days after the
Commission has preliminarily disapproved the permit, pursuant to Section
2-120-800 of the Municipal Code of Chicago.
