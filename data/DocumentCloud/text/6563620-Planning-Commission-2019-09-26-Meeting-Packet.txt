Proposal: Located in Copley Township at the intersection of Heritage Woods Dr. and Medina Rd. The
applicant is proposing a vacation of a portion of Heritage Center Drive, with the re-dedication of the culde-sac of Heritage Center Drive and the Creation of Sublot C-R1 from sublots C-R and D 2 as well as
easements within C-R1.
Site Conditions: The lots being altered are currently vacant with no structures present, there are
structures present in lots A-R and B-R. Summit County GIS does not show any riparian or wetland features
on the site.
Township Zoning: This plan is within the PDD district of Copley.

Agency Comments: Italicized text indicates quotations from submitted agency comments.
Copley Township: No comments received by 09/19/2019.
SWCD: Stephanie Deibel, 09/19/2019: The plans are still under SWPPP otherwise no comments.
SCE: Andy Dunchuck, 09/20/2019: Our office has reviewed the revised resubmittal for the above
referenced replat and has the following comments:
1. Lot A-R1 is the only lot that is not changed in some way by this plat. Except for Lot A-R1,
remove all notes ‘No Change to this Parcel With This Plat’ from the replat.
2. The legend shows a symbol and verbiage stating ‘Iron Pin or Pipe found as described’. On
sheets 2 and 3, add monumentation descriptions to those symbols that need them.
3. On Sheet 2, where does the 10’ Extinguished Utility Easement on the N.E. side of Heritage
Center Drive end?

4. On sheets 4 and 5, add missing bearings and distances to the east end portion of Heritage
Center Drive.
5. On sheets 4 and 5, add ‘Group One Broadcasting, Parcel 1700492’ to the S.E. adjoiner
information.
6. The vacated portions of Heritage Center Drive are not apportioned to the adjoining
parcels. Nor is there documentation cited that the adjoining parcels have accepted this
arrangement. Show apportion to adjoining lots by normal reversion rights.
7. The adjoining parcels that will receive the vacated portion of Heritage Center Drive are then
dedicating land for the cul-de-sac, and therefore need to sign plat.
8. Parcel "B-R" may no longer have frontage along Heritage Center Drive. The property line and
the right of way line for the cul-de-sac seem to meet at the property corner. A landlocked
parcel cannot be created.
9. New easements seem to be added to Lot "B-R", a 50' Utility & Access easement and a
portion of a sanitary sewer easement.
10. Construction plans and a construction agreement will be required for the proposed work and
final plat approval will be dependent upon receipt and approval of construction plans.
11. Have the various property owners been notified?
12. A traffic impact study/traffic impact assessment will be required for this project.
13. Revised Drainage Maintenance Assessments will be required with this replat.
14. Due to the nature and number of comments provided our office is requesting a compliance
submittal of the replat.
Staff Comments: This site has come before the SCPC previously with other Replat requests which were
granted. Staff has no issues with this proposed Replat.
Recommendation: It is Staff’s recommendation that the Replat of Heritage Centre Allotment be
Conditionally Approved with the conditions of the full filling the comments from the Summit County
Engineer’s Office.
