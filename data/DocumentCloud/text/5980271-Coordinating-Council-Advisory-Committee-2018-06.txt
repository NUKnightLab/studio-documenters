Re:

June 14, 2018, Coordinating Council Advisory Committee Meeting Overview

This memo provides an overview of the Coordinating Council Advisory Committee (CCAC)
meeting on Thursday, June 14, from 1:00-3:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams,
Chicago, Suite 200. We look forward to your participation.
As the CCAC will have newly appointed committee members joining for the first time, we
would like to give an overview of the scope of ICJIA’s coordination work with local, state, and
federal partners. To that end, we will have short overviews of our programs including Criminal
Justice Coordinating Councils, Juvenile Justice Coordinating Councils, Family Violence
Coordinating Councils, Adult Redeploy Illinois, JAG Partnership Focused Deterrence sites, and
VAWA Multidisciplinary teams. Our hope is that representative of these programs on the CCAC
briefly describe and answer questions about the purpose and scope of their initiatives and
upcoming programing that may be of interest to the committee.
As discussed at our last meeting, ICJIA hosted “Data, Planning, and Impact: A Joint Adult
Redeploy Illinois and Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils” in Bloomington this May. We
leveraged the resources of ARI and CJCCs so that both groups would benefit from the chance to
collaborate and learn from each other. To memorialize the summit, ICJIA staff are drafting a
report summarizing summit activities, the feedback received, and how our takeaways will inform
ARI and CJCC programming moving forward. At our June meeting, we will present early highlevel insights from the summit that we intend to incorporate in the written report. In preparation,
we ask you to consider the following draft recommendations for the report:
•

ICJIA should develop strategies to sustain current CJCC partnerships and build
relationships with additional counties. This includes:
o Focusing on developing partnerships with colleges and universities to expand
research and evaluation work with local jurisdictions
o Incentivize local planning and coordination activities through ICJIA grantmaking
o Use planning grants to create a sustainable funding structure for coordination e.g.
last for terms of two-year or longer
o Offer analysis of local criminal justice trends and issues to any county on request

•

Use ICJIA’s board and board committees to better coordinate work of state criminal
justice and public health agencies
o Task board with working on concrete policy/coordination issue each year, with
progress reports given at each quarterly meeting
Ensure the views of smaller counties are actively solicited and that they are represented in
policymaking (e.g. boards, task forces, etc.). This includes:
o All task forces/ICJIA boards to have representation from Downstate Illinois

We appreciate the committee’s guidance on the project and any feedback or suggestions on how
to strengthen it.
We look forward to your participation.
