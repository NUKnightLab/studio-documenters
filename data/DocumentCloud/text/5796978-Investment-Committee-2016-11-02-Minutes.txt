MEETING NO. 4168
NOVEMBER 02, 2016

Re: 2015 GASB 68 Reports (Component I and II)
Trustee Naglick had questions and concerns as to the target completion date of October
31, 2016 and to his knowledge, this report is still outstanding. Target date of November
18, 2016 will further hold up the audit if not complete by the target date. According to
CIO Ryan Bigelow, the report will be available before the target date, and a special
meeting will more than likely be called with the investment committee to approve the
audit. Manager Lamonica Arrington-Cabean will do further follow-up.
General Counsel also had discussion with the Board of Trustees regarding contribution
rates/projected funding status and the timeline of when certain decisions should be
made by the Board of Trustees in relation to various issues.
The Board decided to ask Gabriel Roeder Smith& Company to attend the next meeting
to have a more in depth discussion.

ADJOURNMENT
There being no further business before the Board, Chairman Sheehan adjourned the
meeting at 12:46 p.m. The Board’s next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday,
November 16, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. in the Retirement Systems’ Conference Room, 500
Woodward Avenue Suite 3000; Detroit, Michigan 48226.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,

LAMONICA ARRINGTON-CABEAN
MANAGER II
