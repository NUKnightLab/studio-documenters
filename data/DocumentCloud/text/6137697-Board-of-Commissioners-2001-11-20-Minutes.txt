notice on Friday, November 16, 2001 at the hour of 9:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, lllinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
244830

COUNTY HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT, by Wally S. Kos, P.E., Superintendent of
Highways, transmitting a Comm unication, dated June 14, 200 I:
respectfuily requesting permission to discuss the following matter with the Board of
Commissioners or the appropriate committee thereof, pursuant to County Ordinance 95-0-7
regarding acquisition of real estate.
I.

Vollmer Road, Harlem Avenue to Central Avenue in the Villages of Matteson and
Tinley Park, Rich Township
Section: 98-B6625-03-RP
Plat: 937
Tract: 26-04

*Referred to the Finance Real Estate Subcommittee on July 10, 2001.
Chairman Steele asked Michael Griffin, representing the Highway Department, to give an explanation of
the department's request.
Mr. Griffin stated the Highway Department is currently improving Vollmer Road within several villages
and the existing road is not in a straight line. In order to reconstruct the road, it is necessary to purchase
property on the south side of the proposed alignment. Currently the only house in the area is an old
wooden house which sits on the property. The property was appraised along with an adjacent lot for
$99,000.00. He further commented that the property owners counter-offered a price of $225,000.00;
however, through the negotiation process, the agreed upon price was $115,000.00. Although this amount
was considerably less than the counter-offer, the owners did not ask for relocation expenses. The
Department of Highways is now requesting permission from the Committee to close the sale.
Commissioner Moran asked if any objections came from any townships and municipalities.
Mr. Griffin responded that the Village informed the owners that if they remained in the house, the County
would only purchase the property for improvements beginning at the front steps and the house would be
two feet from the right-of-way line. The Village also informed the owners that if they remai ned on the
property, they could not make any improvements.
Chairman Steele asked about the total compensation listed on the appraisal report and asked why the
figure is $94,000.00.
Michael Griffin said the house is being sold for $94,000.00 and the adjacent lot for $5,000.00.
Commissioner Moreno asked what would happen with the house if approval for acquisition of the
property is granted.

3924

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 20, 2001

Mr. Griffin stated the house will be tom down and the remaining property will be declared excess land.
Commissioner Moreno asked the cost of the removal of the house.
Mr. Griffin responded that he did not know the cost for the removal of the house.
Commissioner Moreno asked ifthe property is marketable.
Mr. Griffin replied that this property as well as thousands of other properties the County owns remain
vacant until a request is made to declare the property as excess and it is purchased. Once this occurs, the
property may become usable for another purpose.

Commissioner Moran, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved the approval of Communication
No. 244830. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moreno moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Vice Chairman Goslin. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.
Respectfully submitted,
