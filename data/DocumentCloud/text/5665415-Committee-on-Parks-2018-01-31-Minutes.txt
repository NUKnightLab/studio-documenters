perimeter, and that South Park BMX has all of the necessary insurance.
In response to a question from Ms. Means, Mr. McKain described the general parameters
of leases of this nature.
In response to a question from Ms. Kirk, Mr. Baechle noted that work on the track itself
generally performed by entities with specific expertise, and that improvements do not

communication with the County's employees when improvements are made.
A motion was made by Kirk, seconded by Prizio, that this matter be Affirmatively
Recommended. The motion carried by a unanimous vote.

Discussion Topic - Allegheny County Parks Foundation Update
At the request of the Chair, Ms. Glotfelty came to the table and gave a brief overview of
the projects recently undertaken and currently in process by the Foundation, highlighting,
inter alia, the chimney swift habitat installation project, the installation of improved and
standardized signage in Deer Lakes Park, the formulations of ecological assessment
and action plans for Boyce, Hartwood Acres, Settler's Cabin and South Parks, the
installation of new interpretive signage in Round Hill, North and South Parks, creation of
connector trails in Settler's Cabin and South Parks, sculpture restoration in Hartwood
Acres, the ongoing bench endowment program, mine runoff mitigation at Settler's Cabin
Park, and the South Park Cascades restoration and concepts for the adaptive re-use of
the Corrigan Drive pool.
The Chair noted that the County's relationship with the Foundation has continued to
evolve and improve, and that he senses a genuine enthusiasm for the County Parks.
Ms. Kirk and Ms. Glotfelty agreed.
Ms. Kirk suggested using the Council's social media presence to promote the County
Parks, and the Chair indicated that he would be inclined to recommend highlighting the
smaller parks first.
In response to a question from Ms. Kirk, Ms. Glotfelty discussed the composition and
durability of the new standardized signs.
In response to a question from Ms. Krik, Ms. Glotfelty described the notion of creating a
sculpture garden in Hartwood Acres, and what such a garden might look like.
In response to a question from Ms. Kirk, Ms. Glotfelty described the ecological
assessment process and noted that she would like to create assessments for all nine
County parks.
In response to a question from Ms. Means, Ms. Glotfelty discussed the Foundation's
efforts at surveying some of the Council members and other County parks stakeholders
with regard to their knowledge of the Foundation and its activities.
Ms. Glotfelty asked if any of the members had any particular visions for the County parks
in the next decade or so. The Chair suggested that maintaining effective public relations
is a concern of his, and noted that he would like to see the Foundation generate
materials to provide to the public regarding the parks and the Foundation' work. Ms.
Glotfelty and the Chair discussed how things like the South Park ice rink ribbon cutting
and 90th anniversary activities might serve that purpose. Ms. Kirk noted that she has
seen a tendency for social media posts to lead to coverage by more traditional media

outlets. Mr. McKain noted that the County has hired a new photographer/videographer
and a staff member to coordinate the County's social media activities, in part focusing on
the County Parks through individualized Facebook pages for each park and other
strategies involving emerging social media sources. Ms. Means noted that both the Post
Gazette and Trib have smaller staffs than they used to, and that there probably is
wisdom in making news about the parks as easily accessible as possible to those media
outlets.
Mr. McKain and Ms. Glotfelty discussed the importance of coordinating the activities of
the Foundation and the County.
Ms. Means expressed enthusiasm for several of the projects highlighted by Ms. Glotfelty
in South Park, and suggested that establishing a new nature center in the park might be
a wise idea.
Mr. Baker indicated that he would like to use the Special Committee on Marketing to help
provide information regarding the County Parks to the public.
The Chair suggested that having some sort of a community day in the parks on a rotating
basis from year to year in order to bolster public awareness. Ms. Glotfelty, Mr. McKain
and Mr. Baechle noted some of the special events that currently take place in a few of
the parks, and indicated that they would talk through the possibilities.
The Chair and Mr. Baechle discussed the upcoming winter hike, a 5-6 mile hike from the
Harmony Trail to North Park on Sunday, February 4, as a means of promoting the use of
the trails.
Ms. Kirk, Ms. Glotfelty and Mr. Baechle discussed the former water filtration facility in
North Park, and Mr. Baechle noted that the site could be spectacular if re-done correctly.
Mr. Baker suggested that pursuing additional arrangements like the Over the Bar Cafe
might make sense.
Ms. Kirk expressed appreciation for the Foundation's ability to secure funding for the
parks and the Foundation. Ms. Glotfelty described some of the Foundation's fundraising
activities for 2018.
