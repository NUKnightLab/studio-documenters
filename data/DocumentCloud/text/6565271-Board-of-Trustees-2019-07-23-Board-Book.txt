Director Morgan stated in the Public Library Fund (PLF) the month of May distribution was larger
than what we received last year. The collections moving forward should be slightly larger to bring us
back to budget. We will continue to monitor this account closely.
Director Morgan stated in the month of May we had three payrolls posted in the salaries account. It
is showing slightly over, which is normal, but that should smooth out in the months of June and July.
All other general fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
year.

received and paid the last invoice. This project has been closed out. The only projects open are
CCPL Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches. (See under FINANCE)

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S MESSAGE
Looking Ahead
August 2, 2019, will be my last day as Executive Director of Cuyahoga County
Public Library (CCPL). As I transition into retirement after 16 years of leading this
superb library system I am ﬁlled with pride for all that we have accomplished –
and excitement for what lies ahead.
During my tenure as CCPL Executive Director I have had the privilege of working
with the best library staff you will ﬁnd anywhere – and I do mean anywhere. My
work with the American Library Association (ALA) has given me opportunities
to visit outstanding libraries throughout the U.S. and all over the world. I have
experienced excellent library service from coast to coast and abroad. But the
best, most dedicated and innovative library staff resides right here in Cuyahoga
County. The future of this organization is in good hands.
On July 8, 2019, our Board of Trustees appointed long-time CCPL Deputy
Director Tracy Strobel to be my successor after having conducted a national
search that yielded several strong candidates. Tracy’s career in public libraries
began nearly 25 years ago at Medina County District Library. I ﬁrst met her
when we worked together at Cleveland Public Library. Tracy impressed me with
her intellect and dedication to the profession – so much so that after I became
executive director of CCPL I hired her to be my deputy director, a role she has
excelled in for the past 14 years.
Tracy’s major accomplishments at CCPL include leading the largest capital
improvement program in its history, replacing 10 branches and renovating
14 over seven years. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated a track
record of innovation, advocacy and collaboration. She served as the U.S.
representative to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s International Network
of Emerging Library Innovators (2011-2013) and recently completed a term on
the board of the Public Library Association (2016-2019) and ALA’s Ofﬁce for
Information Technology Policy Advisory Committee (2015-2019). She currently
Chairs ALA’s 2020 Census Library Outreach and Education Task Force (20182020). Tracy is also a member of the Leadership Cleveland Class of 2015.
I am thrilled for Tracy to have earned the opportunity to advance CCPL’s legacy
of excellence. I believe she is an excellent ﬁt for the position and I look forward
to cheering her and the entire CCPL family on from the sidelines.
As for me, I intend to stay active in the profession, particularly with the ALA
Washington Ofﬁce, as well as with publishers, aggregators and other literary
organizations. I hope to get more involved in library policy and to use the skills I
developed as a library director and as ALA president to advocate and articulate
the value of libraries to media, government and other stakeholders.
I will also continue to write for Publishers Weekly, which will give me a venue
to contribute more reﬂections on the work of libraries, my hopes and dreams
for libraries in the future, and, of course, to talk about some great books and
authors.
After August 2, I don’t intend to have an answer to the question, “Where do you
work?” But I will be back at ALA conferences in 2020 and beyond. And for the
rest of my life, I will always identify as a librarian.
Portions of this letter are excerpted from the Publishers Weekly column
“ALA 2019: Sari Feldman: So Long, Not Goodbye,” published June 7, 2019.

@ALA_PLA, June 24, 2019

Processing Department (PRO) staff helped make thousands of summer reading participants happy by assembling
more than 4,000 “Home of a Summer Reader” yard signs. The yard signs have been a hit with customers who
are participating in the Library’s Grand Slam Summer Reading Program. The PRO team was able to assemble
and package the yard signs for shipping in less than a week.
The culminating event for the Parma-Snow Branch’s P.A.L.S. (Programs for All Lives) yearlong Innovation Grant
programming was held in June. P.A.L.S. programs are designed for all abilities and may include accommodations
such as providing additional staff help, offering sensory (sound, light, etc.) alterations and making sure program
areas are wheelchair accessible. “P.A.L.S. Prom” was held in the Auditorium with a DJ, games, refreshments and
giveaways. More than 50 people from all ages and abilities came to this special prom and many wanted to know
when the next one would be held.

 11
During June, 99 kids took part in the Parma Branch’s “Summer Fun for Everyone” drop-in program. They wrote,
illustrated and bound their own autobiographies in the ﬁrst week. Over the next two weeks, they created terriﬁc
stop-motion animation videos using Play-Doh and LEGO blocks (which they watched on the “big” screen), and
made puppets, wrote scripts and performed puppet shows.
Staff member Joe Jones of the Brooklyn Branch used the Charlie Cart mobile kitchen to demonstrate how to “Beat
the Heat with Cool Summer Soups.” Twenty-two attendees sampled three different soups and learned how to
re-create the recipes at home.
Circulation staff from the Berea Branch attended new student orientations at Baldwin Wallace University. They
shared information with 85 students and parents about the beneﬁts of owning a CCPL card, passport services
and programs.
About 140 students from the neighboring Gemini Center day camp visited the Fairview Park Branch with their
counselors to check out books, talk to staff about their favorites and participate in the Grand Slam Summer
Reading Program.
Family Place Library at the Brook Park Branch drew 89 people for a puppet show of The Wizard of Oz by
Stevens Puppets, and an additional 84 people at the Berea City Schools’ summer backpack reading program.
Brecksville Branch customers participated in the Library’s Grand Slam Summer Reading Program in a fun way
by planting a summer reading yard sign in their front yard on Sprague Road and proudly standing beside it
waving at cars. They were happy to report that they counted more than 200 waves and more than 40 beeps
from passersby.
An elderly customer visited the Maple Heights Branch for computer assistance. Her doctor told her that she could
ﬁnd cheaper prescriptions online or with online coupons. She was prescribed 14 medications daily but could
only afford to buy half of them. Staff member Melissa Brown helped her navigate to goodrx.com, a website that
her doctor suggested. She typed in the medication she was looking for and there was a coupon for $22 at CVS.
That price was more than half off what she normally paid! She was so happy to know that she could save money
on her prescriptions.
Author Michael Dobbs visited the Beachwood Branch to talk about his new book, The Unwanted: America,
Auschwitz, and a Village Caught in Between. Published in association with the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum, the book tells the story of a small German village whose Jewish families desperately pursued American
visas to ﬂee the Nazis. Approximately 110 people attended.
Over a period of four weeks at the Orange Branch, tea connoisseur Judi Slack explored many different types of
tea enjoyed in various countries as well as their associated customs, rituals, ceremonies and legends. Seventyone participants tasted and shared more than 400 cups of tea, a half-pound of biscuits and a pint of cream, all
in service of lifelong learning and social engagement.
Case Western Reserve University professor and author Brad Ricca visited the Solon Branch to talk about his book
Mrs. Sherlock Holmes and its main character, New York lawyer Grace Humiston, who spent her down time in the
early 1900s assisting the New York Police Department in solving crimes. Ricca is a very entertaining speaker,
and an audience of 21 enjoyed his story of Humiston’s race against time to save 18-year-old kidnapping victim
Ruth Cruger. This program was supported by the Ohio Humanities Council and the Friends of the Solon Library.

 12
Bill Rubin and Katie Jackson of the Mayﬁeld Branch attended a meeting of the Highland Heights Green Task
Force (GTF) to tell them about the Library’s downloadable collection and Innovation Center services. The group
was very impressed that the Library uses recycled or biodegradable materials in many of its Innovation Center
programs and expressed interest in using the space to support their initiatives. The group’s leader asked Katie to
email her presentation so she could share it with all Highland Heights GTF members.
A Garﬁeld Heights’ teen is devoted to using the branch’s Innovation Center to its fullest! Recently, he designed
his own phone case to ﬁt his phone perfectly using the 3-D printer. He also printed out numbers to insert into the
phone case so the back looked like it had binary code on it. He also wants to use the heat press at the branch’s
next teen Innovation Center drop-in program to make pajamas with binary code on them. He has created a
brand name and is branding all his projects, hoping they catch on.
One June 22, the Warrensville Heights Branch hosted its third annual Juneteenth celebration. The program was
facilitated by the local nonproﬁt organization Uplyff, Inc. and funded by the Friends of the Warrensville Heights
Library. Nearly 90 customers attended the celebration, which commemorates the actual ending of physical
slavery in the United States. Attendees enjoyed live music, engaging discussions, food, art and a presentation
about the abolitionists who assisted with the American Underground Railroad.

Financial Statement Analysis
June 2019

Revenues
For General Property Taxes we received a very small amount for the first half of the
year settlement. We should begin to see in July our next large advance for the second
half of the year. With this distribution we are on budget for property taxes.
Our June distribution for the PLF was again larger than what we received last year. As I
mentioned last month, we believe the collections moving forward should be slightly
larger to bring us back to budget but, as we do every month, we will monitor this
account closely. With this larger distribution we are on budget for the PLF.
Interest is also exceeding our original estimates. The larger increase in rates than
expected has brought in additional revenue. Based on some of our recent maturities we
are beginning to see some of those increases leveling off.
Patron Fines and Fees in total are currently exceeding our estimates. Once again it is
passport fees and photos which are the reason for the increase. Sale of Resale
Supplies is also slightly exceeding our estimates.
All other revenue accounts are where we would expect them to be for the month and
the year.

Expenses
Expenses for Salaries and Benefits showed a slight increase over budget in May which
was expected because of three payrolls posted to the account, but for the month of
June we are once again back within our budget. Our next three pay month is later in
the year. And as we have mentioned since the beginning of the year, we see the
account for health insurance is much closer to being back in budget with those early
funding of the HSA accounts.
Many of the other expense accounts have higher than expected percentages for
expenses and encumbrances because many of these accounts have standing orders
encumbered against them to pay monthly and recurring expenses.
All other General Fund expense accounts are where we would expect them to be for the
month and the year.
In the Capital Fund projects the final expenses for the Maple Heights renovation were
paid. The only projects open are the Bay Village and Richmond Heights Branches.

Investments
We purchased one piece of commercial paper from Toronto Dominion Securities with a
yield of 2.44% and a four month maturity.
We also purchased a CD from Multi-Bank Securities/Ally Bk Midvale with a yield of
2.50% and a three maturity. Our advisor from RedTree Investments felt these yields
were good yields for us to look at some longer maturities for those securities.

Transfers
There was one transfer for the month in the amount of $71,400.00 from the General
Fund to the Adult Education Services (ASPIRE) fund for the Library match.

1.2.1.1 The invalidity of any provision of the Contract Documents shall not invalidate the Contract or its remaining
provisions. If it is determined that any provision of the Contract Documents violates any law, or is otherwise invalid or
unenforceable, then that provision shall be revised to the extent necessary to make that provision legal and
enforceable. In such case the Contract Documents shall be construed, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to give
effect to the parties' intentions and purposes in executing the Contract.

5 1.2.2 Organization of the Speci?cations into divisions, sections and articles, and arrangement of Drawings shall not

is substantially complete, the Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Architect a comprehensive list of items to be
completed or corrected prior to ?nal payment. Failure to include an item on such list does not alter the responsibility of
the Contractor to complete all Work in accordance with the Contract Documents.

Upon receipt of the Contractor?s list, the Architect will make an inspection to determine whether the Work or
designated portion thereof is substantially complete. If the Architect's inspection discloses any item, whether or not
included on the Contractor?s list, which is not suf?ciently complete in accordance with the Contract Documents so

9.8.4 When the Work or designated portion thereof is substantially complete, the Architect will prepare a Certi?cate
of Substantial Completion that shall establish the date of Substantial Completion; establish responsibilities of the
Owner and Contractor for security, maintenance, heat, utilities, damage to the Work and insurance; and ?x the time

the area to be occupied or portion of the Work to be used in order to determine and record the condition of the Work.

the Work acceptable under the Contract Documents and the Contract fully perfomied, the Architect will 
issue a ?nal Certi?cate for Payment stating that to the best of the Architect?s knowledge, information and belief, and
on the basis of the Architect?s on-site visits and inspectionsI the Work has been completed in accordance with the
Contract Documents and that the entire balance found to be due the Contractor and noted in the ?nal Certificate is due
and payable. The Architect?s ?nal Certi?cate for Payment will constitute a further representation that conditions listed
in Section 9.10.2 as precedent to the Contractor?s being entitled to ?nal payment have been ful?lled.

Documents to remain in force after ?nal payment is currently in effect, (3) a written statement that the Contractor
knows of no reason that the insurance will not be renewable to cover the period required by the Contract Documents,

warranties or speci?c Subcontractor warranties, and (6) if required by the Owner, other data establishing payment or
satisfaction of obligations, such as receipts and releases and waivers of liens, claims, security interests, or
encumbrances arising out of the Contract, to the extent and in such form as may be designated by the Owner. if a
Subcontractor refuses to furnish a release or waiver required by the Owner, the Contractor may furnish a bond
satisfactory to the Owner to indemnify the Owner against such lien, claim, security interest, or encumbrance. If a lien,
claim, security interest, or encumbrance remains unsatis?ed after payments are made, the Contractor shall refund to
the Owner all money that the Owner may be compelled to pay in discharging the lien, claim, security interest, or
encumbrance, including all costs and reasonable attorneys? fees.

9.10.3 If, after Substantial Completion of the Work, ?nal completion thereof is materially delayed through no fault of
the Contractor or by issuance of Change Orders affecting ?nal completion, and the Architect so con?rms, the Owner
shall, upon application by the Contractor and certi?cation by the Architect, and without terminating the Contract,
make payment of the balance due for that portion of the Work fully completed, corrected, and accepted. If the
remaining balance for Work not fully completed or corrected is less than retainage stipulated in the Contract
Documents, and if bonds have been furnished, the written consent of the surety to payment of the balance due for that
portion of the Work fully completed and accepted shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Architect prior to
certi?cation of such payment. Such payment shall be made under terms and conditions governing ?nal payment,
except that it shall not constitute a waiver of Claims.

9.10.4 The making of ?nal payment shall constitute a waiver of Claims by the Owner except those arising from
.1 liens, Claims, security interests, or encumbrances arising out of the Contract and unsettled;

The Contractor shall correct Work rejected by the Architect or failing to conform to the requirements of the
Contract Documents, discovered before Substantial Completion and whether or not fabricated, installed or completed.
Costs of correcting such rejected Work, including additional testing and inspections, the cost of uncovering and
replacement, and compensation for the Architect?s services and expenses made necessary thereby, shall be at the
Contractor?s expense.

5 12.2.2 After Substantial Completion

12.2.2.1 In addition to the Contractor?s obligations under Section 3.5, if, within one year after the date of Substantial
Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof or after the date for commencement of warranties established
under Section 9.9.1, or by terms of any applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the
Work is found to be not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall correct it
after receipt of notice from the Owner to do so, unless the Owner has previously given the Contractor a
written acceptance of such condition. The Owner shall give such notice after discovery of the condition.
During the one-year period for correction of Work, if the Owner fails to notify the Contractor and give the Contractor
an opportunity to make the correction, the Owner waives the rights to require correction by the Contractor and to make
a claim for breach of warranty. If the Contractor fails to correct nonconforming Work within a reasonable time during

Section 2.5.

other obligations the Contractor has under the Contract Documents. Establishment of the one-year period for
correction of Work as described in Section 12.2.2 relates only to the speci?c obligation of the Contractor to correct the
Work, and has no relationship to the time within which the obligation to comply with the Contract Documents may be
sought to be enforced, nor to the time within which proceedings may be commenced to establish the Contractor?s
liability with respect to the Contractor?s obligations other than speci?cally to correct the Work.

5 12.3 Acceptance of Nonconforming Work

If the Owner prefers to accept Work that is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, the
