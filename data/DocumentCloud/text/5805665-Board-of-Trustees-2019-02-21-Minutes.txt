January 24, 2019, Finance and Audit Committee Meeting Report and Recommendations
Ms. Mary Cavallaro, Deputy Executive Director, and Ms. Alise White, Chief Financial Officer, discussed
the recommended remediation plan for the FY 2018 AUP. They stated that staff will continue to meet with
key individuals from CPS to review AUP variances and will establish a remediation timeline for FY 2019.
Ms. Cavallaro and Ms. White stated that additional work meetings with CPS will be scheduled, as necessary, to complete remediation for FY 2018 variances. The Board discussed a plan to get correct data from
CPS and the issues regarding CPS/employee settlements.

Recommendation Regarding Moving Everest Delinquency Waiver Request
Moving Everest is requesting a waiver for pay period end date 8/31/18 in the amount of $604.91. The
employer is stating that the reason for untimely submission is due to the time it took CTPF staff to respond
to ERS questions.
Staff recommends denying the waiver request and billing Moving Everest. There is not sufficient evidence
to waive the late fee for the pay period end date 8/31/18. The employer did not reach out to CTPF on
8/10/18 in regard to a different pay period end date (7/15/18). There were no CTPF system impediments to
Moving Everest being able to submit timely payroll records and pension contributions. Moving Everest has
historically submitted untimely payroll during FY 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Recommendation Regarding CTU Delinquency Waiver Request
Chicago Teachers Union (“CTU”) submitted a formal waiver request for pay period end dates 6/22/18
through 8/31/18 in the amount of $37,381.18. CTU stated that payroll submissions were submitted untimely
due to employee turnover that resulted in lack of internal CTU communication regarding the CTU office’s
responsibilities. The employer also stated that there was confusion with setting up the payroll calendar and
salaries for the year which resulted in multiple emails to CTPF staff.
Staff recommends denying the waiver request and billing CTU for late payroll submissions. The employer
did display a good faith effort on and after 8/29/18, however CTU did not submit pension contributions
within the conditional grace period. There were no CTPF system impediments to CTU being able to submit timely payroll records and pension contributions. CTU has historically submitted untimely payroll
records and pension contributions during FY 2017 and FY 2019.
Recommendation Regarding Chicago Charter School Foundation (“CICS”) Waiver Request
CICS has submitted a formal waiver request for pay period end dates 5/23/18 through 9/23/18 in the
amount of $14,468.76. CICS is stating that the reason for untimely submission is due to a brief training
period related to the new ERS website. The employer states multiple errors occurred which prevented the
employer from submitting payroll records to CTPF. According to the employer, CTPF staff did not respond
to questions in a timely manner which resulted in late submission.

 FEBRUARY 21 542 2019

Staff recommends denying the waiver request and billing CICS. Neither Matthew Battaglia (previous
Pension Officer), Aleks Lazarevski (the current Pension Officer), nor anyone else from CICS reached out
to CTPF in regard to payroll submissions. There were no CTPF system impediments to CICS being able to
submit timely payroll records and pension contributions. The employer has historically submitted untimely
payroll during FY 2018.

REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE
Callan Associates
Ms. Jen Mende, of Callan Associates, Ms. Angela Miller-May, CTPF Chief Investments Officer, and
Mr. John Freihammer, CTPF Portfolio Manager, reviewed the Infrastructure performance report ending
September 30, 2018. Ms. Mende stated that the Fund has a target of 2% to be invested in infrastructure and
a range of 0% to 4%. Ms. Mende stated that Macquarie represents 40% of current infrastructure exposure
considering funded and unfunded commitments for CTPF, and that this concentration will decline as the
existing funds exit their investments. Ms. Mende also presented the rationale for Brookfield Infrastructure
Fund IV investment. She stated that both Macquarie investments were made in 2008, and based on manager guidance, it is likely CTPF will receive significant distributions in the next two to three years from
those funds. Ms. Miller-May reported that the 2019 pacing study recommendation is to invest up to $50M
to private infrastructure and to maintain exposure to the infrastructure investment market. Callan and staff’s
recommendation is to commit $25M to Brookfield Infrastructure Fund IV. They addressed questions raised
by the Board.

Manager Due Diligence Presentations
Representatives from Brookfield and Channing Capital Management presented to the Board. The managers
reviewed organization, strategy, performance, firm diversity and fees. The managers addressed questions
raised by the Trustees.

 FEBRUARY 21 544 2019

Motion to Accept Callan and Staff Recommendation, Approved
Ms. Padilla made a motion, seconded by Ms. Reilly, to approve Callan and staff recommendation to Re-Up
$25M to Brookfield, subject to contract negotiations. The motion passed by the following roll call vote:
Ayes: Mr. Blackwell, Mr. Bures, Mr. Cavallero, Ms. Padilla, Ms. Price Ward, Mr. Redfeairn, Ms. Reilly,
Ms. Rodriguez, Mr. Travlos, Ms. Ward – 10
Abstentions: Ms. Clay – 1

Watch List Status Report and Recommendation
Ms. Brianne Weymouth, of Callan Associates, reviewed the Fund’s Watch List. She reported that Channing
was put on the Watch List due to the succession plan and short term performance struggle. She stated that
the recommendation of Callan is to keep Channing on watch and continue to monitor their performance.
Ms. Weymouth addressed questions raised by the Board.

Lease Status Update & Architectural Services
Mr. Robert Griffin, CBRE, Mr. Charles Burbridge, Executive Director, and Ms. Gail Davis, Manager of
Administrative Services, reported on the architectural services contract. Mr. Burbridge stated that the Board
approved expenditures of up to $110,000 for architectural services by PBD for space needs in conjunction
with CTPF’s office relocation. This authorized spend was based on rentable square footage projected at
30,000 square feet at a cost of $3.67 per square foot and the understanding based on initial discussion with
PBD, that any PBD reimbursable expenses were incorporated into this $110,000. He noted that the first
phase of the architectural services, which included test fits of the space and projections of additional staffing
needs over the life of the lease, the anticipated final RSF will be 31,817 square feet. At an agreed-upon cost
of $3.67 per square foot, this increases the cost of the PBD contract, prior to reimbursable to $116.768.39.
This increase in RSF means that there will be an increase in tenant improvements allowance, which is
based on square feet, offered as part of space negotiations with the 425 W. Financial building owners. CTPF
is requesting approval of architectural services contract to include expenditures of up $125,000, based on a
total RSF of 31,817 square feet, and up to $7,500 of architectural reimbursable expenses.

contract. The motion passed by the following roll call vote:

Travlos, Ms. Ward – 8
Nays: Ms. Padilla, Ms. Rodriguez – 2
Abstentions: Ms. Clay – 1

RFP for General Contractor
Mr. Burbridge reported on the lease agreement at 425 Financial Place. He stated that as part of CBRE services as the Fund’s real estate broker, CBRE will conduct an RFP to assist Fund staff in identifying general
contractor candidates to be interviewed and selected by CTPF to build out the space in its new location.
The RFP will be conducted as part of the services provided under contract with CBRE, and there is no cost
to the Fund for the RFP services. The search will include criteria based on the qualitative needs outlined by
