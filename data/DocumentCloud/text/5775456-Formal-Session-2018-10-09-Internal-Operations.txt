RE: LATRINA WILLIAMS v. CITY OF DETROIT
WAYNE COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT
CASE NO. 17-017886-NO
FILE NO. L18-00006 (MA)

On October 2, 2018, a case evaluation panel evaluated the above-captioned lawsuit and awarded
Fifteen Thousand Dollars in favor of Plaintiff. The parties have until October 30,
2018, to either accept or reject the case evaluation. Failure to ?le a written acceptance or rejection

within that period constitutes a rejection.

Based upon our review of the facts and particulars of the lawsuit, which are set forth in a
con?dential memorandum that is being separately hand-delivered to each member of Your
Honorable Body, it is our considered opinion that acceptance of the case evaluation award is in

the best interest of the City of Detroit.

We, therefore, request Your Honorable Body to authorize acceptance of the case evaluation award;
and, in the event that Plaintiff accepts the award, tO deem such acceptance as a settlement and to
direct the Finance Director to issue a draft payable to Goodman Acker, RC, and Latrina
Williams in the amount of Fifteen Thousand Dollars in full payment for any and
all claims which Latrina Williams may have against the City of Detroit and any City Of Detroit
employees by reason of alleged injuries or property damage sustained by Latrina Williams on or
about May 23, 2017, as otherwise set forth in Case NO. 17-017886-NO ?led in the Wayne County
Circuit Court, and that said amount be paid upon receipt of properly executed Releases, Stipulation
and Order of Dismissal entered in Case NO. 17-017886-NO, and, where it is deemed necessary or
desirable by the Law Department, a properly executed Medicare Reporting and Indemni?cation

Af?davit, approved by the Law Department.

DATE: October 2, 2018

RE: Cash Bail Elimination Resolution

 

Cash bail has a deleterious impact on marginalized communities. When persons are being held in
pretrial incarceration solely because of their inability to afford cash money bail, they often lose
their jobs, are separated from their families, which threatens custody, and even stop pursuing

education.

As a result of this and other negative impacts, there is a movement nationwide to eliminate cash
bail and the State of California was recently successful in this regard. Since cash bail cannot be
eliminated in the City of Detroit, per an opinion of the law department, I am requesting that a
resolution be drafted to support the elimination of cash bail for pretrial incarceration.

I am also asking that the resolution have language to support The Bail Project, and the Detroit
Justice Center, which are organizations leading the effort to assist with cash bail here in the City

of Detroit and nationwide. Please see the attached language to include.

Whereas, Wayne County, the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities desire to coordinate,
contribute, and cooperate in enhancing public safety, and in particular our communities criminal
justice system

Whereas, holding indigent and impoverished clients in pretrial incarceration, solely because of
their inability to afford cash money bail does little to nothing to enhance public safety, and in fact
is regressive and detrimental to the community as a whole. Pretrial incarceration causes
employed community members facing allegations to lose their employment. Pretrial incarceration
cause students facing allegations to losing the ability to persist on with their education. Pretrial
incarceration cause parents to be separated from their children and threatens the loss of custody,
setting forth an avalanche of negative outcomes for children.

Whereas, The presumption of innocence is the principle that one is considered innocent unless
proven guilty, pretrial incarceration because of an inability to afford cash money bail threatens this
principle and undermines our justice system creating a caste system by which poor people bare the
brunt.

Now Therefore Be It Resolved, Wayne County, the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities
welcomes The Bail Project to Wayne County, the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities, so
that they may bring bail relief to hundreds indigent and impoverished residents of Wayne County,
the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities 

Be It Further Resolved, Wayne County, the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities in
collaboration with The Ball Projet seek to promote incarceration prevention by way of policy
solutions and direct interventions.

Be It Finally Resolved Wayne County, the City of Detroit, and its other municipalities support the
work of The Bail Project in conjunction with community to contribute to the solutions to reducing
incarceration

THE BAIL PRGJECT

Freedom Should Be Free

The Problem

There?s a profound injustice at the heart of the American legal system. If you can afford to pay
ball, you get to wait for your day in court while at liberty. But if you can?t, you?re faced with a
daunting choice: sit in jail until backlogged courts can hear your case which can take months,
even years or plead guilty and get out faster. This injustice exclusively impacts low-income
communities and disproportionately low-income women and people of color. It is also a key
driver of mass incarceration, accounting for 100% of all jail growth in the past 20 years.

Our Response

The Ball Project is an unprecedented national effort to combat wealth-based detention by
paying bail for those who can?t afford it. Building on 10 years of experience running a revolving
bail fund in the Bronx, The Ball Project is working with local partners to establish 40 sites across
the U.S. over the next five years to pay bail for as many peopleas possible. Based on current
seed funding and philanthropic commitments, we anticipate providing bail assistance for
160,000 people over this period.

The Model

The revolving bail fund model leverages the
fact that ball money is returned at the end of
a case as long as the person makes their

court appearances. A decade of data from mum? bullretumad to mm,
our pilot bail fund The Bronx Freedom bl!? set?t 
Fund indicates that a single dollar can be ?3
used two or three times a year, creating a 
massive force multiplier. The revolving bail bullmoneulsused

fund model is a critical tool to combat mass ?We? ?man? 

incarceration, prevent human suffering, keep
families together, and restore a measure of
justice to the legal process.

The Team

The Ball Project is comprised of a network of community-based teams known as Bail
Disruptors and a central support office. Bail Disruptors identify people at risk of pretrial
detention and provide bail assistance and support throughout the legal process. The central
support team identifies new sites, administers the revolving fund and collects data and stories to
advance advocacy and inform reform efforts.

THE BAIL PRGJECT

Basic facts about cash bail:

1. Jailed without conviction of a crime: On any given night, 450,000 people go to sleep in
jail cells across America without being convicted of anything. The majority are there because
they cannot afford bail.

2. A key driver of U.S. mass incarceration: Pretrial detention accounts for 100% of all jail
growth in the past 20 years.

3. Disproportionately harms people of color: People of color are more likely to be held on
cash bail and more likely to have bail set at a higher bail amount than white people arrested for
similar offenses.

4. A unique impact on women: 60% of women in jail are in pretrial detention and most of
them are mothers. Incarcerated women have lower incomes than incarcerated men, making it
even harder to afford cash bail. Case in point: The average annual income for incarcerated
Black women is lower than the median bail amount in the U.S. 
Incarcerated women are more likely to have their children placed in foster care.

5. Never meant to be punishment: Bail was originally intended to serve as an incentive for
people to return to court you come back, you get your money. It wasn?t intended to keep
people in jail who couldn?t afford to pay. However, in the Bronx, where we began, only 10% of
people who have bail set can afford to pay at their first court date.

6. Unnecessary: Data from The Bronx Freedom Fund shows that 95 percent of people return
to court when bailed out with philanthropic dollars the equivalent of being released on their
own recognizance without bail. This lays waste to the that money is a necessary incentive
to ensure someone returns to court.

7. Coercive: NY data indicates that over 90% of people incarcerated for the duration of their
case will plead guilty. On the other hand, almost 60% of The Bronx Freedom Fund?s clients
have had their cases dismissed entirely.

8. One night makes a difference: Even one night in jail can cause people to lose jobs, their
homes, and even custody of their children. For many, it can jeopardize immigration status.
About a third of sexual assault by jail staff happens in the first 24 hours in jail.

9. $14 billion paid by taxpayers: Taxpayers spend an estimated $14 billion annually

incarcerating people who haven't been convicted of anything, with collateral costs estimated to
be as high as $140 billion each year.
