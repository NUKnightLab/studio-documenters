STAFF REPORT 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6314
ADDRESS: 1778 SEYBURN
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WEST VILLAGE
APPLICANT: GEORGE DANAYAN / GERALD GRUBEY
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 7-3-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building at 1778 Seyburn Street is a 2 ½ -story, brick Prarie style, single-family home. It is located
midblock on Seyburn and has garage access to the rear off Shipherd Street. The home was built in 1913
and is characterized by a yellow brick facade and bay windows that feature leaded glass on the upper sash.
The home has suffered significant damage as a result of having a damaged roof for many years. A
Certificate of Appropriateness for a new roof was issued in 2015. HDC staff has worked with the
homeowner throughout the renovation process, issuing COA’s for several items on the front façade,
including: the removal of the non-historic aluminum awning; the restoration of the windows; rehabilitation
of fascia trim and gutters; the replacement of the deteriorated concrete front steps. The owner states that the
restoration process has been difficult, as he lives out of state and has worked with several different general
contractors throughout the process. This has led to some issues with the building department inspectors
issuing violations and work being done on the rear of the home without HDC approval. This work includes
the demolition and removal of the deteriorated upper deck, the demolition and removal of the deteriorated
non-insulated sun-porch as well as the cladding of the garage in vinyl siding. However, the homeowner has
worked with staff to make sure that the home is finished properly and hired an architect to assist in the
process.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s retroactive approval for the work
items performed without approval and to complete the following work associated with the overall
rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections Most residences have porch projections and/or entrance
recessions. Porches and entrances on classically inspired buildings are either centrally placed or, as in
the case of some duplexes, placed on both sides of the facade in a symmetrical arrangement. Victorian
and arts and crafts inspired buildings display more freedom in placement. Side and sun porches are rare
in the district due to the lack of side yards; a few exist on larger lots. Rowhouses or terraces generally
exhibit freedom in placement of porches and entrances within each complex; centrally located recessed
entrances in Shipherd Court create a rhythm amongst themselves. Commercial buildings on Kercheval
display a progression of recessed entrances, usually two (2) per building. No rhythm is established along
the Jefferson Avenue frontage.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings in West Village have either common or pressed
brick or clapboard sheathing as their principal exterior material. Stucco wall surfaces also exist as a
principal material; some later replacement siding exists in the district, but much of such siding changes
the visual relationship of the siding to the building. Masonry is used on the first story only on some
houses, and wood shingles exist on some second stories. Most buildings have wood trim; a few more
substantial houses and apartment buildings have stone trim. There are some tile roofs; some slate roofs
still exist; asphalt replacement roofs are common. Porches are built of brick or wood.

(8)

Relationship of textures The most common relationships of textures are the low-relief pattern of mortar
joints in brick contrasted to smooth wood trim and/or wood clapboard contrasted with smoother trim.
Random ashlar used at first story level is contrasted with a wood-sheathed or shingled upper story in a
few houses, as is a brick first story and a stuccoed second story. The smoother surface of glazed brick or
painted brick is sometimes contrasted with stone or wood trim. Carved wooden detail and half-timbering
provide textural interest. Slate and tile roofs provide textural interest whereas asphalt shingles usually do
not.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment of
individual properties is a flat or slightly graded front lawn area in grass turf, subdivided by a walk leading
to the front entrance from the curb and frequently a side walk beginning at the sidewalk leading to the
rear. Materials for such walks are primarily concrete, although a few brick walks exist. Some front yards
have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands, sometimes with a brick or stone
retaining wall at the change of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character, are present.
Hedges between properties and along front lot lines are not uncommon. Several types of fences exist in
the district, including cyclone fences, fences with wooden posts and rails with wire mesh, wrought iron
fences, and brick and concrete walls. Some large American elm trees remain on the tree lawns in the
district, although they are virtually extinct. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and
period, though only a disease resistant elm would be a practical choice. Very few straight side drives
from the street to the rear are present; alley-facing garages are the norm, although many parking bays are
present with alley entrances. The lack of front driveways leads to a unity of front yards. Street

 pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs exist with frequency although in some areas they have been
replaced with concrete curbs. Alleys are concrete except for the alley between Shipherd and Van Dyke
and the alley between East Jefferson and Van Dyke Place, which are brick. Steel lighting poles on Van
Dyke are fluted; elsewhere in the district on north/south streets O.P. poles are the predominant type. On
east-west streets and Shepherd there are telephone poles with cranes carrying lanterns. A boulevard with
a landscaped median forty-four (44) feet by three hundred seventy (370) feet exists on Parker Avenue
between the Jefferson and Lafayette and Lafayette Avenue [sic].
(22)

General environmental character. The West Village District is characterized by residential and minor
commercial development dating from 1880-1930. Long, straight streets, a significant array of housing
types, and a cohesiveness achieved through uniform setbacks and heights result in an urban, medium
density neighborhood. Newer commercial and institutional uses exist primarily on the northern and
southern fringes of the district. West Village is of an urban character rare in Detroit because of the
diversity of building types in the area. (Ord. No. 547-H, ' 1(28A-1-39), 2-18-83)

RECOMMENDATION

While it is unfortunate that some of this work comes before the Historic District Commission for
retroactive approval, it should be noted that the applicant has worked with staff to find a path forward to
compliance. It is HDC staff’s opinion that the rehabilitation of the following items is appropriate under
Secretary of the Interior Standards 6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall
match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence:
Installation of new gutter system, painting as proposed (with the exception of painting the concrete
window sills, staff recommends these remain unpainted), as well as all proposed site work.
It is also staff’s opinion that the much of the remaining work is appropriate under Secretary of the
Interior Standards 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and
shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment: While it may be of historic age, the Sanborn map
indicates that the deteriorated upper sun porch does not appear to be original to the home and therefore,
it’s replacement with an exposed wood deck appears to be appropriate. Additionally, the removal of the
existing deteriorated sun porch and replacement with a wooden deck also appears appropriate.
It should also be noted that vinyl siding is not typically a historically appropriate material for a home in
a historic district and there has been some recent discussion among the commission concerning the use
of vinyl siding in historic districts. Therefore, staff recommends that the garage be clad in wood siding
in favor of vinyl which would be appropriate under Secretary of the Interior Standards Number 6.
However, vinyl siding can be found on other garages on Shipherd Street with various results.
Finally, staff does not offer an opinion if the in-filling of the rear door opening with brick and the
creation of a new doorway onto the rear porch is appropriate under Standards 6 or 9.
