Request number 3 is a request to increase the contract with CyraCom LLC for System-wide telephonic
interpreter services; this vendor is based out of Arizona. The Committee was made aware that, in 2010, the
Cook County Board passed a Resolution suggesting that the County not contract with Arizona-based
contractors, unless it is critical to the services provided by the County. Interpreter services are critical to the
services that are provided by the System; therefore, it was concluded that execution of this contract increase is
in the best interests of the County.
Ms. Besenhofer indicated that review of this request by Contract Compliance has not yet been completed; she
respectfully requested that the Committee conditionally approve this request, pending the completion of the
review by Contract Compliance.
Director Hammock, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the conditional
approval of request number 3, pending completion of review by Contract Compliance.

D. Any items listed under Sections III and IV
IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare (Attachment #3)
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that, one of the things that is anecdotally said, although he has not seen data
to support it, is that the System loses its patients once they become eligible for Medicare; historically, a large
segment of that population has been uninsured, but they became Medicare-eligible when they reach a certain
age. He remarked that, if the administration is not already thinking about it, a strategy of retention should be
considered. Mr. Glass concurred; he indicated that this subject has been a topic of discussion.
With regard to the slides containing information on the CountyCare membership by age, Director Hammock
requested that information on the CountyCare population be layered onto them, in order to be able to see the
market share3. Mr. Glass responded that this can be done.
Regarding the information provided on race and ethnicity, it was stressed that this information was not required
to be provided by the applicants – it was purely voluntary; over half of the applicants chose not to provide that
information. With regard to the extremely low number of members who voluntarily reported their ethnicity as
Hispanic, Board Chairman Carvalho offered to put Mr. Glass in touch with an individual who developed an
algorithm that can assign Hispanic ethnicity based on the person’s name and other factors. He stated that it is
not 100% accurate, but it may help to provide a better estimate of Hispanic CountyCare members.
Board Chairman Carvalho noted that the whole concept especially of being an at-risk provider under the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) is not simply to process everybody, but to also manage their care in such a way
that the quality of care is improved and the cost per person is reduced. He asked Mr. Glass to provide
additional information on how the System will manage the population. Mr. Glass stated that the key to that is
in the Quality Assurance (QA) plan. As the System is required to develop and implement a QA plan, that is
where the population focus comes into play. Using the list of diagnoses - certainly the initial diagnosis and
pharmacy data - provides the roadmap to identify the populations that the administration will begin to address.
What is known is that good management of these diseases leads to lower cost. Dr. Shannon noted that there
will be standalone, and then multi-factorial risk modeling that will be needed to focus on certain populations.
In response to a question from Director Gugenheim regarding whether there is an ombudsman position within
the CountyCare structure, Mr. Glass responded in the negative, but added that he will look into that matter.

stated that an analysis of that information will be provided4.

Financial Reports through January 2014.

and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the two months with overall
revenue of $174,258 and overall expenses was $192,183.
Net Patient revenue for the twelve months was $141,221.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $1,113. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.
Patient Accounts Receivable
General
As compared to November 30, 2013, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
January-2014 increased by 1 to 106 days. Additionally, there was a 5 day increase in this
figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts declined by $21.058M (-6.6%) as compared to the November-2013
balance.
As compared to the previous month, this figure decreased by $2.832M (-0.9%). The
decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are completing the
collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
6
Page 42 of 73

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of January-2014 increased by
$4.103M (48.5%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance and increased by
$4.311M (52.2%), as compared to the previous month’s balance. This indicates that
fewer inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the previous
month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of January-2014 decreased by $1.121M (-0.7%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance. This figure fell by $1.696M (-1.1%)
compared to the previous month’s total.
The decrease in this number indicates more accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a greater number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts increased by $1.394M (12.9%) by the end of
January-2014, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013.
This balance was $2.350M (23.8%) larger than the previous month’s balance. This
change indicates that fewer outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as
compared to the previous month.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
7
Page 43 of 73

 The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of January-2014 decreased by
$19.937M
(-12.4%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013.
This figure fell by $1.136M
(-0.8%) compared to the previous month’s total.
The decline in this figure indicates that more Out-Patient accounts had their collection
and write-off related activities completed, as compared to the prior month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

The above data does not include bad-debt write-offs; it includes only the amounts
written-off directly to charity care.

Operating Expenses at the end of the two months was $192,.183M broken down as
follows:
Salaries and Wages - $79.830M
Benefits - $22.037M
Supplies - $22.401M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $58.033M
Insurance - 4.116M
Depreciation - $5.629M
Utilities - $0.137M
Nonoperating Revenue was $31.523M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
cigarette tax in the amount of $10.609 and property tax in the amount of $6.028M. Sales
tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS when earned; this occurs when the underlying
sales transactions occur. The amount recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax
represents the amounts earned by CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the
state. There is a 3 months lag from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the
receipt of funds.

 Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 12/18/13 - 01/15/2014.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing
payments include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental
workers hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget is spread over 12 months, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received. Meaningful Use includes
both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.
Revenue Enhancement includes the fee CCHHS pays the state for the additional state workers that process CountyCare and MANG applications.

- ER Elopes are patients who leave without being seen by a physician.
- "Medicaid-Pending" assumes 30% of the Self-Pay accounts accepted by the eligibility vendor will be successfully converted to Medicaid accounts.
- The "Payer Type" represents the financial class in which the patient presented to CCHHS; it is not necessarily the final financial class for the patient, especially for Self-Pay patients.
