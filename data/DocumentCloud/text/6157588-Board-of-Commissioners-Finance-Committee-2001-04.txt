REVIEW OF CURRENT PLANS AND CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES
REGARDING THE TRAFFIC COURT/DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT
FACILITY. Transmitting a Communication , dated March 20, 2001 from John H.
Stroger, Jr. , President, Cook County Board of Commissioners:
As you have no doubt heard or read, the Traffic Division of the Circuit Court
operations which were recently relocated to the Daley Center are running
efficiently and in fact far more smoothly than had been expected. After
discussing this matter with various parties including the Chief Judge of the
Circuit Court, I now believe that there is a need to revisit plans to construct a
new Traffic Court/Domestic Violence Court facility. I am hereby requesting that
the County Board review current plans and give consideration to alternatives to
satisfy the needs of the Circuit Court. I ask that this request be referred to an
appropriate committee of the County Board for discussion and public hearing.
*Referred to the Finance Committee March 20, 2001

*The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, April 17, 2001.
