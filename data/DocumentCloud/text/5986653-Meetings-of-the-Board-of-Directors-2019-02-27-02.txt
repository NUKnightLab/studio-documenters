Social Determinants of Health
• The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.
• Health care
• Affordable housing
• Healthy food
• Safe, walkable neighborhoods
• Healthy work environments
• Living wage
• Social determinants of health are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources throughout local
communities, nations, and the world.

Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH), Closing the gap in a generation: health equity through action on the social determinants of health. Final report of the
Commission on Social Determinants of Health. 2008, World Health Organization: Geneva.

 Health Equity
“Health equity is the assurance of the conditions for optimal
health for all people.
Achieving health equity requires valuing all individuals and
populations equally, recognizing and rectifying historical
injustices, and providing resources according to need.”

 Structural Racism

A fundamental cause of health inequity, associated with imbalances in
political power throughout society… Structural racism perpetuates
residential segregation, concentrated poverty, disinvestment in
neighborhoods, and targeting neighborhoods for toxic waste— all issues
related to serious health outcomes. (NACCHO 2016)

1934–1968: FHA Mortgage Insurance
Requirements Utilize Redlining:
“The FHA also explicitly practiced a policy of “redlining” when
determining which neighborhoods to approve mortgages in.
“… color-coded maps indicating the level of security for real
estate investments… appraisers divided neighborhoods by
categories including occupation, income and ethnicity of
inhabitants:
C (yellow) were neighborhoods that were “definitely declining.”
Generally sparsely populated fringe areas that were typically
bordering on all black neighborhoods.
D (red) (hence the term “red-lining”) were areas in which
“things taking place in 3 (“C”) had already happened.” Black and
low income neighborhoods were considered to be the worst for
lending”.

 In Summary
Long history of discrimination and racist practices affecting residents of the
near west and southern parts of Cook County
The evidence is clear that racism is deeply entrenched and continues to affect
the opportunities available to people of color
This has resulted in areas of concentrated poverty and low opportunity
As a result, populations residing in those areas suffer from
disproportionately poor health outcomes
Must improve health equity and correct Social Determinants of Health

 Patient Feedback
“My goals: get released from jail, stay clean, live a normal life, have a healthy pregnancy”
“I have received more medical care here in the past 6 months than I have in my whole life.”
“I wouldn’t have followed up for birth control on the outside, I’m glad I’m getting it done now.”
“I think it’s good for me to leave jail with birth control because I want to take time with my three
daughters and gain our bond back. I don’t need another baby until I am stable and with my life back
on track.”

86 of 137

16

 Patient Feedback
One woman planned to ask her judge for an extension of her stay in order to get her IUD placed
before release. Luckily, this was not needed.

“I'm an addict... and while I work on figuring that part of my life out the last thing I need is to get
pregnant. Getting a Nexplanon is the most responsible thing I've done in my life.”
"The staff and services were excellent. It really means a lot to me and will help my recovery now that
I don't have to worry about birth control."
"Getting birth control before I left CCDOC was very important to me. Now I can focus on my two
young children and getting back to school and my future. Thank you so much!”

Deliver High Quality Care
FY 2020-2022 Strategic Planning Recommendations
Primary Care Physician and Behavioral Health Integration
• Phase 1 and 2 are complete
• Phase 3 requires developing infrastructure to solidify operations: identify barriers, define provider roles
and responsibilities, develop tools to support workflow, algorithms and build consistency across all
ambulatory health centers, implement a culture of collaboration, identify best practices, institute
training programs, resolve State policies that hinder reimbursement, consider other value added
resources of Family/Marital Counseling to support areas that require more intensive therapies, form
multidisciplinary team approach to shared-care responsibility model
• Phase 4 requires testing and monitoring processes put in place and analyzing data, outcomes, identify
value added services and HEDIS (Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set) measures, fill gaps in
delivery of care, workflow obstacles-test and continue tracking and trending data
• Phase 5 -Full integration- Barriers resolution, gaps filled, measures support improved patient outcomes,
increase patient access to care, increased provider productivity, reduce reimbursement issues, improve
quality/value added services
