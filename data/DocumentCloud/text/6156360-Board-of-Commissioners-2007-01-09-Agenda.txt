GRANT APPLICATION
ITEM #5
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 12, 2006 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization to apply for a grant in the amount of $200,000.00 from the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs. This grant would expand funding for gender-responsive treatment
services to felony offenders that have significant mental illness and substance abuse disorders which are
referred to the court’s Mental Health Treatment Court.
In April 2004, the Circuit Court of Cook County launched the Mental Health Treatment Court pilot
program in the Criminal Division to enhance court supervision of mentally ill offenders by improving the
delivery of mental health care. The ultimate goal of the program is to reduce incarceration of mentally ill,
nonviolent felony offenders. In its first two years of operation, the program has received 124 referrals
and has 44 active participants, both male and female. Most participants have substance abuse disorders in
addition to chronic mental illness and other health concerns, such as positive tests for HIV. Early
program results are encouraging, with recidivism for participants substantially reduced. The grant funds
will be used to increase the participant capacity of the program by an additional 25 offenders, or 75 per
year.
Funding for this program would be effective for a two-year period beginning in early 2007. The grant
requires an in-kind match of $55,180.00 in the first year and $57,832.00 in the second year which is
provided in the form of contributions of time from existing staff.
The Budget Department has reviewed this item, and all requisite documents have been submitted.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $200,000.00. Funding period: March 1, 2007 through

FY2007; and
WHEREAS, one of the tasks of each department and elected official, as well as this government is to

more attainable; and

lots would represent a substantial revenue source for the County; and

involved in any fee-based parking system planning; and
