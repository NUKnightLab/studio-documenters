STAFF REPORT 7/24/2019
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6356
ADDRESS: 19563 CANTERBURY
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SHERWOOD FOREST
APPLICANT: BRYANT HARRIS

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
The dwelling located at 19563 Canterbury is two stories in height and was erected ca. 1935. The
resource features buff brick exterior cladding with stone detailing. A wrought iron balcony serves to
shelter the building’s primary entrance. Copper gutters and downspouts are located at the building’s
hipped roof. A two-story, 2 car garage/carriage house is connected to the rear of the house. The
windows on the front elevation are original to the home and include steel casement units with fixed transoms.
These windows are covered by metal exterior storm windows. Fiberglass casement and double-hung
windows (approved by the Commission in 2017) are located at the side and rear elevations of the home.

With the current application the homeowner is seeking the Commission’s approval to install three
new “scalloped” cloth awnings at the home. Specifically, the new awnings shall be located at the
front elevation, over the second story windows. Note that the dimensions, mounting details, and color
of the proposed new awnings are currently not known.

19563 Canterbury, location of proposed new awnings
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Please see the attached narrative and photos. In these documents, the applicant outlines the location
of perforations in the brick/wall and states that they indicate that awnings had previously existed at
the home. He has also provided photos of two homes in his neighborhood that have awnings at the
front elevation.

 As noted previously, the only remaining historic-age windows are located at the home’s front
elevation. In 2017. The Commission allowed the applicant to replace the then historic-age casement
windows at the side and rear elevations with the condition that those historic-age steel casement units
at the front elevation remain. It is staff’s opinion that the remaining original sash at the front
elevation, the proportion of their openings in the façade, and the stone trim are character defining
features of the home. The proposed new awnings would cover/obscure the upper portion of the trim,
window opening, and window sash. Though removable in nature, it is staff’s opinion that the
proposed awnings would visually alter features and spaces (the windows, window openings, and
trim) that characterize the property.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(2)
Proportion of buildings front facades. The typical front facades of residential buildings in
the Sherwood Forest Historic District are predominantly wider than tall to their eaves.
(3)
Proportion of openings within the facades. Proportion of openings varies greatly according
to the style of the building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but individual windows
are often grouped together to fill a single opening which is wider than tall. Windows are
usually subdivided; buildings designed in English Revival styles frequently display leaded
glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
double-hung sash windows are further subdivided by muntins. A variety of arched openings
and bay windows exist throughout the district Modernistic style residential buildings have
openings with a variety of proportional relationships, sometimes extending around the
corners. In general, openings amount to between twenty percent (20%) and thirty-five percent
(35%) of the front facades.
(4)
Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facades. In
examples of other styles, particularly those of English Revival sub-styles, voids are arranged
with more freedom, but usually result in balanced compositions. Windows are arranged by
floor in asymmetrical arrangements in modernistic style houses.
(7)
Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with pressed, wire cut or glazed
brick, often combined with wood, stone and/or stucco. Stone trim is common, and wood is
almost universally used for window frames, half-timbering and other functional trim.
Windows are commonly either of the metal casement or wooden sash variety. Glass block
exists as an original material in some window openings of modern buildings. Original metal
balconets, balustrades and light fixtures exist on some properties. Roofs on the majority of
the buildings in the Sherwood Forest historic district are either slate or slate-like asphalt
shingles.
(8)
Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often
juxtaposed with wood or smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone elements and trim.
Textured brick and brick laid in patterns creates considerable interest, as does half-timbering,
leaded and subdivided windows, and wood shingled or horizontal sided elements. Slate roofs
have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles generally have little textural
interest, even in those types which purport to imitate natural materials. Garages correspond
in materials to the main residential dwelling.
(9)
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors -- such as red, yellow, brown, or buff -predominate in wall surfaces. When brick is painted, it is in white or shades of cream. Natural
stone colors also predominate; where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural
state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural slate colors, and asphalt shingles
are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The
buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of classical styles, generally
have woodwork painted the white or cream range. English Revival style buildings generally
have painted wood trim and window frames of dark brown, gray, buff or shades of cream,

depending on the main body color. Half timbering is most frequently stained or painted dark
brown. Stained glass, where it exists as decoration visible on the front facade, contributes to
the artistic interest of the building. The original colors of any building, as determined by
professional analysis, are always acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar
houses. Colors used on garages should relate to the colors of the main dwelling.
Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure
generally relate to its style. Residential buildings derived from characteristic elements and
details displayed on vernacular English revival-influenced buildings include arched windows
and door openings, steeply pitched gables, towers, and sometimes half-timbering. Tall,
clustered chimney stacks and decorative chimney pots are features of the district. Classical
styles display modest detail, mostly in wood. Porches, shutters, window frames, cornices,
and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Modern style buildings
are generally characterized by smooth, unadorned wall surfaces, horizontal bands of
windows, and curved corners. A few cape cod style buildings and ranches are located in the
northeastern section of the Sherwood Forest Manor subdivision. In general, the district is
rich in early to mid-twentieth century architectural styles. Garages correspond in architecture
to the main residential dwelling.
Scale of facades and facade elements. The Sherwood Forest Historic District comprises a
residential neighborhood of moderate to large scaled dwellings. Elements and details within
are appropriately scaled, having been determined by the style, size and complexity of the
individual buildings. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins and casement windows
are leaded, affecting the apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
Degree of complexity within the facades. The degree of complexity has been determined by
what is typical and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher degree of
complexity in the English Revival style buildings, where their facades are frequently
complicated by gables, bays, irregularly placed openings and entrances, and irregular
massing, than those of other styles. The facades of classically inspired buildings and
modernistic buildings are straightforward in their arrangement of elements and details.

RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that proposed awnings would visually alter features and spaces
(the windows, window openings, and trim) that characterize the property. Staff therefore recommend
s that the Commission deny the proposal because the work does not meet the Secretary of the Interior
Standards, standard # 2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall
be avoided.

Dear Historic District

I am requesting permission to install Awnings on the upper part of my property to prevent ice
built up in the winter while preserving the historic: character of the neighborhood. have
included a picture of the front, side and rear of property showing that awnings where on the
property. before

The previous owners removed the awning and never replaced them. I have also included two
photo's of properties in Sherwood Forest with awnings. Attached is the brand of material
and a photo of the cloth along with a estimate that I received from a Awning company.

i am asking the board to please approve the re-instaliation of my awning so that I can
complete this project this summer. Also, I did see where you can remove cloth awnings on
existing frames without approval, but I don't have the frames up just the attachments.

Thanking you in advance for your consideration in this matter.

Brya Harris
