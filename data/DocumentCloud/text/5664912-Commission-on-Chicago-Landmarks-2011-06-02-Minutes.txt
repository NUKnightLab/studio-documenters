The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:

2.

1401 S. Michigan
(Engine Company 104, Truck 31 Firehouse – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed two-story rear addition and rooftop deck to masonry 2-story
former firehouse

Action:

Approved unanimously as submitted.

9801 Avenue G
(Calumet Park Fieldhouse – 10th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed exterior rehabilitation of the fieldhouse including roofing, façade
concrete repairs and application of an elastomeric concrete coating, and
new concrete paving at terrace

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the deteriorated architectural concrete shall be repaired
with new concrete to match the original in profile and texture.
Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve a mock- up of
repair work prior to construction;
2. As proposed, cleaning mock- ups shall be performed to determine the
final water pressure and cleaning procedure prior to the cleaning of the

 building facades and balustrade. Historic Preservation staff shall
review the cleaning mock-ups and approve the final cleaning process
prior to beginning work; and,
3. As proposed, the color of the elastomeric coating shall match the
original color of the historic concrete as much as possible. Historic
Preservation staff shall review and approve the final coating
specification and color prior to its application.

3.

2018 W. Walton
(Ukrainian Village District Extension – 9th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of 2½-story, masonry single-family residence and
detached garage with alley access

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed 26’-10” long wall dormer, set back 14’-9” from the front
façade, is approved as proposed, except that the slope of the shed roof
shall be reduced to 4- in-12 as agreed to at the meeting to further
reduce the potential visibility of the dormer;
2. The cladding on the side of the dormer shall be smooth- finish cement
fiber clapboard (rather than panels, as proposed) and match either the
color of the brick or the color of the roofing; and,
3. The applicant shall provide face brick, mortar and limestone samples
for Historic Preservation staff review and approval prior to permit
submittal. The brick and stone colors and textures shall match typical
colors and textures found within the district, and mortar shall match
the color of the face brick.
The Committee also voted to approve the proposed side yard reductions,
as depicted on the site plan, as necessary to match the predominant yard
depths and house widths contributing to the district’s character, pursuant
to Title 17, Sec. 13-1003-G of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance. The
Zoning Administrator will be notified of the Committee’s determination.
