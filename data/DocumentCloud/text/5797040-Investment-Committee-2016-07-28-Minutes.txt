REASONING FOR TRUSTEE DIAZ’S “NAY” VOTE
MY “NO” VOTE REGARDING GENERAL COUNSEL’S CONTRACT IS BASED UPON
THE SYSTEM’S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE
PROVIDING OUR PLAN PARTICIPANTS WITH THE BEST SERVICES AND TO BE
FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE IN PROVIDING SAID SERVICES.
WHERE THE SERVICES PROVIDED HAVE BEEN TRIED, TESTED AND PROVEN, I
BELIEVE ACTING ON THIS MATTER AT THIS TIME, WITHOUT COMPARABLES,
FALLS SHORT OF ENSURING THAT WE ARE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WHEN WE
DO NOT KNOW WHAT OTHER PUBLIC PLANS ARE PAYING THEIR GENERAL
COUNSEL.
REASONING FOR TRUSTEE PEGG’S “NAY” VOTE
NOW THAT ACTIVE POLICE AND FIRE MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
UNFUNDING OF THE NEW HYBRID PLAN, WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IN
ORDER TO AVOID THAT POSSIBLE LOSS TO THE MEMBERS, THIS BOARD
NEEDS TO BE MORE CONSERVATIVE REGARDING CONTRACTS MADE WITH ITS
BUSINESS ASSOCIATES.
TRUSTEE PEGG ALSO AGREED WITH TRUSTEE JAMES THAT THE BOARD NEEDS
TO REVIEW ITS CONTRACTS WITH ALL OF ITS VENDORS.
