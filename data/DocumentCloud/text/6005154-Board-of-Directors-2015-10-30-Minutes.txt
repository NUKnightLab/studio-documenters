B. Managed Care Committee Meeting, October 20, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #1)
ii. Focus Area Presentation - Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS)
Survey Results (included in Attachment #1)
iii. Meeting Minutes
Director Lerner presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the Metrics and presentation on the CAHPS
Survey results with Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care. The Board reviewed and discussed
the information.
With regard to the measure relating to 90-day maintenance prescriptions, Director Lerner asked for
suggestions of what can be done to really ramp up that issue and reach the goal of 85%. Mr. Glass stated
that the data reflects that the bulk of maintenance medications are being filled by specialists; the
administration is now looking at how to get that back to the primary care physician, make sure they are
more informed, and start to manage it from that perspective. Director Lerner recommended that this
measure and the other measure relating to HIV medications remain a part of next year’s metrics.
During the discussion of the CAHPS survey results, Director Velasquez inquired whether race data was
collected. Mr. Glass responded that he will check; he was unsure if it was collected in this survey.
Chairman Hammock inquired whether the results regarding respondents’ perceived health status and
mental/emotional health status were consistent with national scores. Mr. Glass responded that he will find
out.
Director Wiese inquired whether the data can be sorted by facility; this ties into the subject of assessing
how long it is taking for patients to see specialists. Mr. Glass stated that staff can look into that question.
It was noted that this is a survey of CountyCare members (ACA Adult population) who receive care within
the network – these results are not exclusively pertaining to CCHHS facilities or staff. He stated that, as
a health plan, CountyCare is required to demonstrate health plan adequacy across the network; in that
measurement, it has demonstrated adequacy in the network. This is measured by data relating to the third
next available appointment. (Further discussion on the subject of receiving data on third next appointment
for CCHHS as a provider took place later in the meeting, during the review of the Finance Committee
Meeting Minutes.)
Director Lerner, seconded by Vice Chairman Butler, moved the approval of the
Minutes of the Managed Care Committee Meeting of October 20, 2015. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Action was taken on this item following the adjournment of the closed meeting.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved that the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System Board of Directors approve the October 20, 2015 Minutes of
the Special Meeting of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee, with the exception
of the Medical Staff Appointments/Reappointments/Changes and the Stroger Hospital

THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

and Hospitals System Board of Directors adopt the recommendation of the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee to approve all medical staff appointments/reappointments/changes set forth in the list submitted by the Executive Medical Staff
Committee of the John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County that were approved at

Director Lerner, seconded by Director Marsh, moved that the Cook County Health
and Hospitals System Board of Directors adopt the recommendation of the Quality
and Patient Safety Committee to approve all medical staff appointments/reappointments/changes set forth in the list submitted by the Medical Executive
Committee of the Provident Hospital of Cook County that were approved by the
Provident Medical Executive Committee on October 6, 2015 with the exception of
Provider #1, who was the subject of discussion at today’s closed meeting. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Velasquez, moved that, based upon assurances
that CCHHS policies and practices routinely provide for review of the work of this
provider, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board of Directors adopt the
recommendation of the Quality and Patient Safety Committee to refer the application
for reappointment and grant of clinical privileges requested by Provider #1 back to the
Provident Hospital of Cook County’s Medical Executive Committee for further
investigation for the reasons discussed by this Board during the closed meeting, and
further moved that this Board direct the Provident Medical Executive Committee that
this application for reappointment be processed as a non-expedited application under
the Bylaws of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Director Junge abstained; she stated that she previously represented providers in her
former employment.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Richardson-Lowry, moved that the Cook
County Health and Hospitals System Board of Directors adopt the recommendation of
the Quality and Patient Safety Committee to adopt the Recommendations and Reports,
and the grounds set forth therein, of the Stroger Hospital Executive Medical Staff
Committee, the Stroger Hospital Credentials Committee, and the Stroger Hospital

D. Finance Committee Meeting, October 23, 2015
i. Metrics (3rd Quarter FY2015 Financials) (Attachment #2)
ii. Capital Asset Management
iii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items:
• Contracts and Procurement Items (detail was provided as an attachment to the Board Agenda)
• Transfers of Funds
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, reviewed the Metrics and
Financial Statements, and provided an overview of the contractual requests included in the Minutes. The
Board reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the contractual requests contained in the Minutes, a question was raised regarding
request number 5 (Saldemar Solutions). It was noted by Director Richardson-Lowry that, in her
experience, she has never seen the oversight of Request for Proposals (RFP) processes performed by an
outsider. Mr. Elwell stated that this function is being temporarily filled by an individual on a contractual
basis until the position is internally filled; he added that the RFP process is overseen by the head of Supply
Chain. Director Richardson-Lowry requested that the Board be informed when the administration is in the
process of onboarding the new person who will internally fill that position; additionally, she requested
information with regard to the rigor that is in place with respect to RFP oversight.
With regard to request number 6 (HMA), Director Junge inquired regarding whether the vendor produces
reports as part of their contract scope. Dr. Shannon responded affirmatively; he indicated that he will
provide copies of those reports to Director Junge.
During the discussion of request number 17 (Clayco), Director Gugenheim commented regarding the label
of “Campus Core Medical Building” that is associated with this project; using the word
“Core” in this label creates confusion, due to the existence of the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center.
Chairman Hammock agreed, and asked that staff re-examine the label to avoid confusion.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Contracts
and Procurement Items contained within the Minutes of the Finance Committee
Meeting of October 23, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the proposed
Transfers of Funds contained within the Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting
of October 23, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Board and Committee Reports
D. Finance Committee Meeting, October 23, 2015 (continued)
Mr. Elwell stated that, in response to earlier requests by Director Wiese for information on data tracked
internally relating to the availability of appointments with specialists, referred to as “third next
appointment,” he will be providing it electronically to the Directors after the meeting. Chairman Hammock
indicated that it should be expected that the Board will discuss the data at its next meeting. Dr. Shannon
noted that this is going to be one of those areas where the administration is unable to have a single metric.
They will be able to show the wait time for different specialties at different locations, and reflect patient
satisfaction and their perception of the wait time through methodologies such as the survey referred to in
Mr. Glass’ presentation. The Board will be able to get an implicit idea of the responsiveness of CCHHS’
services by the volume of referrals that are received from outside providers and its own primary care
providers, but there is not a single one-page magic answer to the question of – what is the wait to get into
clinic for a radiology test? It all depends. Director Marsh stated that, while a metric may not exist, it is
important to set a standard. Mr. Elwell stated that this report can perhaps be produced on a quarterly basis.
During the discussion of the financial reports, Mr. Elwell stated that the number of days of cash on hand
fell from 96 days to 57; he indicated that this is solely related to the slowdown in State payments. July,
August and September Affordable Care Act (ACA) capitation checks totaling approximately $160 million
were received on October 1st or 2nd; the administration has been informed that they should receive the
payment for October before the end of the month, which is today. Capitation checks for the Family Health
Plan (FHP) and Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPD) populations have not been received since
June; that amount due from the State now tops $100 million. Discussions with the State are ongoing, but
this is a concern, as CCHHS continues to make payments to providers.
Director Richardson-Lowry remarked that, with regard to the information on the State’s budgetary woes
and their impact on CCHHS, it will be important to start putting on the record the categories of impact, not
just the overall number, so CCHHS will have a fundamental record of tracking that, and the public can
understand the potential areas of adverse impact.
During the discussion of the subject of non-operating revenue, Director Lerner stated that it would be
helpful if the Board periodically receives information regarding the appropriation received from the County
to get an idea of what that is really supporting - how much is going to fund Cermak, Public Health, etc.
He stated that what is really happening, to a great extent, is that the managed care operation is helping to
subsidize the System; it would be good for the Board to understand the size of that subsidy, along with the
knowledge of how much is being received from the County and where that funding is going.
While discussing the subject of capital asset management, Mr. Elwell stated that the administration hopes
to have an inventory put together by June 30th that will include the age of the equipment and also the
replacement timeframe for it. Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether this will include details on the
condition of the equipment. Mr. Elwell responded that he will make sure that is included.
Director Wiese inquired regarding the subject of physical plant/equipment and the relationship between
that and patient safety. Dr. Shannon provided information on the history of reports and estimates that have
been provided over the years of needed capital improvements that have not been made. He noted that the
purchasing group has been able to complete the purchasing and spend of about $30 million in capital this
year. With regard to the question of when there is a capital equipment issue that leads to a safety item,
how does that bubble up, he stated that the administration has the ability to capture that in its electronic
reporting system. Dr. Shannon stated that he will ask his team to see whether that specific information can
be captured and summarized, to provide to the Board.

Board and Committee Reports
D. Finance Committee Meeting, October 23, 2015 (continued)
Director Collens, seconded by Director Lerner, moved the approval of the Minutes of
the Finance Committee Meeting of October 23, 2015, 2015. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

E. Human Resources Committee Meeting, October 23, 2015
i. Metrics (Attachment #3)
ii. Meeting Minutes, which include the following action items:
• Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement-related matters – approval of:
Negotiated wages and healthcare changes for:
o Illinois Fraternal Order of Police, representing Oak Forest Health Facilities Public Safety
Officers (HS1)
Collective Bargaining Agreements for:
o Cook County Pharmacy Association, Chicago Joint Board, Retail, Wholesale & Department
Store Union (RWDSU) Local 200, representing Cook County Health Facilities Administrative
Assistant III’s and IV’s, Talent Management Assistant, Talent Management Specialist, Human
Resource Specialist and Recruitment and Selection Analyst
o International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 700 representing Oak Forest Health Facilities
Public Safety Officers II and Investigators II
Prevailing Wage Rates for:
o Coalition of Unionized Public Employees (C.O.U.P.E.) Trades, for Sign Painter Shopman
positions
Director Wiese presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the Metrics with Gladys Lopez, Chief of
Human Resources. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Ms. Lopez noted that, over the past few months, it was identified that there seems to be a disconnect
between the number of vacancies being filled and the total vacancy number. The data for this is drawn
from two (2) separate systems – the Human Resources system, as well as the budget system. Following
review of the issue, it was identified that the vacancies number is actually lower than what has been
presented. The total of 804 CCHHS Vacant Positions reflected in the metrics is a much more accurate
representation of the vacancies. She added that the goal for this year was to get down to 750 vacancies;
she expects that goal will be reached. Following questions on the subject, Chairman Hammock requested
that he, Ms. Lopez and Mr. Elwell get together in the next week to clarify his understanding of vacancies
and budgeted positions.
The Board discussed the subject of employee satisfaction surveys. Ms. Lopez stated that she plans to meet
with Director Wiese soon to talk about plans for 2016; that subject is planned to be discussed. The last
survey was done in 2010; she noted that if an organization does not have the resources and funds to back
up what it is going to do after the survey is taken, that is where the organization loses momentum. Director
Lerner suggested that, prior to any new surveys being conducted, the Board should receive the template of
what the survey will look like; he stated that he is very interested to see if it will be cohort-based, and
whether it will address some of the cultural differences of the employee population. Dr. Shannon stated
that, to start, they will look at the results/observations/actions associated with the 2010 survey. Then the
administration will be able to come up with a strategy about whether or not re-surveying is the best first

step, or whether it is better to take the information that is already known as a challenge for the organization
and do some action first.
Additionally, on the subject of employee surveys, Director Wiese referenced previous discussions
regarding an internal survey of employees that would include the question of “would you bring your family
member here?” Chairman Hammock stated that Human Resources would seem to be the appropriate area
that would address that survey question; he suggested that Director Wiese, as Chairman of the Human
Resources Committee, pursue that subject.
Action was taken on this item following the adjournment of the closed meeting.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Marsh, moved the approval of the Minutes of
the Human Resources Committee Meeting of October 23, 2015. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

2016) (Attachment #4)

Chairman Hammock stated that a new fiscal year is nearing; he has encouraged each of the Committee Chairs
to look at their metrics, as now is the time to review whether any measures need to be dropped or added to each
Committees’ regular reporting of metrics. He noted that, in particular, he wants the Board to focus on and
emphasize ambulatory services – is CCHHS providing what patients need and want in a timely, pleasant,
effective, well-located fashion?
Chairman Hammock stated that Dr. Shannon asked that the Board consider the subject of frequency of meetings
of Committees for 2016 as meeting schedules are being discussed and developed. Chairman Hammock
requested that the Committee Chairs provide their input to him on that subject.
Chairman Hammock noted that the County Board’s Finance Committee recently conducted their review of
CCHHS’s proposed budget. Directors Lerner, Gugenheim, Junge and Velasquez attended the hearing; they
provided a brief overview of their impressions from that meeting.

NCQA posts Health Insurance Plan
Rankings on 5-point scale, using
0.5 increments (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.)
CAHPS survey calculates results on
a 3-point scale (1.0-3.0)
For comparison, converted
CountyCare’s 3-point scores to a 5point scale assuming equal
proportion
– E.g. Score 2.4/3 = 0.81*5 = 4.0; or
– 2.4 = 81% of 3; 4.0 = 81% of 5

 JOHN JAY SHANNON, MD
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM
REPORT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OCTOBER 30, 2015
Recognition
•

Armed with grant funds from the Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics through the
Health Resources and Services Administration, Dr. Denise Cunill, set out to ‘spread the piloted Illinois
Medical Home Model within a health care system to improve patient centered care.’ Over a 3.5 year
period, Dr. Cunill and others worked with CCHHS community health centers that had large and modest
pediatric practices to engage in quality improvement initiatives designed address four performance
measures: 1. Families partner in decision making; 2. Access to comprehensive health and related
services through the medical home; 3. Early and continuous screening, evaluation and diagnosis; and 4.
Transition to adult health care. Each of these measures included specific objectives throughout the
course of the project. The project is featured in the October issue of the Illinois Medical Home
Newsletter, a publication of the Illinois Chapter of The American Academy of Pediatrics.

•

More than 700 employees attended the Ambulatory and Community Health Network annual education
day on Tuesday, October 27th. The theme for the day was “I am the Patient Experience”. The focus in
all sessions was on improving the access, improving the experience of patients and families using our
centers with the end goal to be the provider of choice. The vision for CCHHS transformation was
shared by leadership and the keynote speakers emphasized the importance of patient satisfaction and
customer service. Special thanks to the planning committee: Drs. Sharon Irons, Jorelle Alexander,
Juliet Bradley, Charles Edoigiawerie and Ellen Costello, Constance Hill, LaJewell Thompson, Paula
Keitt, Denise Little, Eular Brown, Patricia Looker, Karen Williams, Felecia Odom-Bro and Marie Leahy.

•

The Cook County Health & Hospitals System’s (CCHHS) 16 ambulatory clinics recently achieved Stage 6
on the HIMSS Analytics Electronic Medical Records (EMR) Adoption Model for advanced use of
electronic medical records to improve patient care and clinical outcomes. The HIMSS EMR Adoption
Model includes eight stages (0-7). Congratulations to our clinical and IT ambulatory staff represented
today by: Drs. Davidovich, Irons and Barker as well as Irene Marks, Victor Medina, Alex Cross, Marty
Grant and Katina Daher. Less than 20% of the participating ambulatory organizations have reached
HIMSS Stage 6 or Stage 7.

 Patient Experience Recognition
Excerpt from an email received from Dr. Shweta Gupta, Oncology
Dr. Aneel Kumar took care of a patient of mine in the hospital last week and she came to see me today. For 10
minutes of the 20 I spent with her she kept telling me how good Dr. Kumar was, he was very compassionate,
patient, would listen to her complaints and then address them fully to her satisfaction, was very polite, always
smiling, excellent communication skills and that he was never in a hurry to get out of the room like other
physicians.
After the patient, her son and daughter-in-law spoke to me for 15 minutes outside and for 10 out of the 15
minutes they said phenomenal things about Dr. Kumar.
I thought I should let the leadership know so that he can be congratulated and encouraged to continue to do
the good work he is doing.
Activities and Announcements
•

CCHHS has kicked-off its 2015-16 Influenza season. Employee Health Services has been holding mass
vaccination events to provide employees with their shots. As of 10/27/15, more than 3,300 individuals
are already in compliance. The deadline for compliance is December 1, 2015.

•

As part of the expansion of behavioral health services discussed at the June Board Meeting, we are
pleased to report that we have been working closely with the Cook County Justice Advisory Council and
the Chicago Police Department to establish a pilot 24/7 Community Triage Center (CTC) to provide
prevention and diversion services for individuals who are at-risk of arrest due to behavioral health
conditions. CCHHS recently received a $348,000 grant from the Otho S. A. Sprague Memorial Institute
for initial planning of the Community Triage Center (CTC) and we have allocated an additional $3
million to operationalize the CTC. It is expected to open in early 2016 and has the potential to divert
hundreds of individuals from local emergency departments and Cook County jail every year. CCHHS is
currently identifying appropriate space for the pilot CTC.

•

As part of the marketing efforts around CCHHS’s Patient Centered Medical Home, new interior
signage has been installed at all sixteen community health centers (see attached). Signage is in multiple
languages throughout the system and has been well received by staff and patients. Additionally, a soft
launch of the “Count on Expert Care” marketing efforts has occurred. When complete, new interior
and exterior signage (see attached) will be installed at Stroger, Provident and the CORE Center. A
media guide featuring 35 CCHHS subject matter experts will be mailed to local, regional and national
news outlets as a resource for reporters and producers on various health-related topics. The guide will
also be provided on the CCHHS website and new ‘experts’ will be added regularly. CCHHS will be
promoting these experts in the coming months.

•

A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on October 16th to celebrate the new dental clinic opening at the
Dr. Jorge Prieto Health Center in Chicago’s Lawndale neighborhood. The dental clinic at Prieto Health
Center will provide a wide range of dental services, from cleanings and fillings, to root canals, dentures,
crowns and even minor oral surgery. The clinic will be able to offer approximately 2,000 visits each
2 Pa g e
Page 41 of 45

 year, significantly increasing the system’s dental capacity. Last year, CCHHS provided for more than
4,300 dental visits across the system.
•

The Cook County Health Foundation’s second annual Gala is Wednesday, November 4, 2015 at
Morgan Manufacturing. The benefactor of this year’s Foundation’s will be CCHHS’ Oncology services.
From prevention initiatives and patient education to screening and state-of-the-art treatment, CCHHS
cares for more than 10,000 cancer patients annually, including more than 1,700 newly-diagnosed
cancer patients each year. The most common cancers treated by CCHHS include breast, lung, colorectal
and prostate cancer. Stroger Hospital’s oncology program has been accredited by the American College
of Surgeons as an Academic Comprehensive Cancer Care Program for the past 15 years.

•

The fifth issue of Strategic Planning Update was sent to employees on October 15th. The issue is
attached.

Legislative Update
Local
• On October 7th, the Cook County Board approved President Toni Preckwinkle’s appointment of Mary
Richardson-Lowry to serve on the CCHHS Board of Directors filling the unexpired term created by the
resignation of Reverend Calvin Morris.
•

On October 14th, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle introduced her FY2016 Executive
Budget Recommendation. CCHHS’ FY2016 Budget, as approved the Board of Directors in August 2015,
was included as part of the President’s recommendation. On October 22nd, Dr. Shannon appeared
before the Cook County Finance Committee to present CCHHS’ budget and respond to questions from
Commissioners. Dr. Shannon was joined at the hearing by Directors Gugenheim, Junge, Lerner and
Velasquez as well as members of the senior leadership team. Over the course of the next few weeks
the Cook County Committee on Finance will conduct four public hearings. At the conclusion of budget
hearings Commissioners will have an opportunity to submit amendments to the budget for
consideration in mid-November. The budget is expected to be approved prior to November 30th which
is the end of the County’s fiscal year.

State
• The State of Illinois is now in its 18th week without a comprehensive state budget. The new state fiscal
year started July 1, 2015. Yet, over 90% of the state budget has been committed for spending in the
FY16 fiscal year through court rulings and administration actions. The remaining 10% of the state
budget includes funding for higher education, such as student financial assistance programs, as well as
local health protection grants, of which CCDPH receives approximately $2.2 million, and funding for
services to vulnerable populations such as the homeless, survivors of domestic violence and sexual
assault, and persons at risk of HIV. It is likely that many of our patients have been adversely impacted
by the lack of funding for these human services programs.

HB1, the Heroin Crisis Act was approved by the General Assembly and is in the process of being
implemented. Medicaid is impacted in the following ways:
• Requires all medication assisted treatment (injectable naltrexone, methadone, suboxone, etc.)
prescribed for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence to be covered under fee for
service and managed care medical assistance programs. It shall not be subject to any utilization
control (other than those established by the American Society of Addiction Medicine), prior
authorization or lifetime restriction limit mandate.
• Requires opioid antagonists prescribed by a physician for the treatment of an opioid overdose,
including the medication, administration device, and any pharmacy administration fees, to be
covered under the medical assistance program.

•

The House and Senate returned to Springfield on October 20th to conduct business. No significant
progress was made to move past the budget stalemate.

•

A number of changes in the state legislature have occurred or been announced in the past few weeks,
including the following:
• Laura Murphy (D-28) was appointed to serve the remainder of Senator Dan Kotowski’s term.
Senator Kotowski recently announced his retirement from the Illinois General Assembly. He
now serves as the President/CEO of Childserv, a nonprofit organization that provides direct
services to at-risk children in Cook and the Collar Counties. Senator Murphy is a former
Alderman from Des Plaines. Senate District 28 includes portions of NW Cook County, including
Park Ridge, Des Plaines, Elk Grove Village and Schaumburg.
• Chuck Weaver (R-37) was appointed to fill the seat vacated by former Senator Darin LaHood
who won a special election to succeed former Congressman Aaron Schock in the 18th Illinois
Congressional District. Senator Weaver is a former member of the Peoria City Council. Senate
District 37 includes Peoria and other areas in Central Illinois.
• Sonya Harper (D-6) was appointed October 20th to fill the seat previously occupied by
Representative Ester Golar, who passed away in September. Representative Harper is a
community activist from Englewood. House District 6 is in Chicago and includes areas of the
Loop, the South Loop, New City (Back of the Yards), and parts of Englewood.
• Representative Frank Mautino (D-76) who also serves as the House Deputy Majority Leader,
received approval from the House and Senate to become the next Illinois Auditor General,
succeeding William Holland who will retire at the end of this calendar year. Representative
Mautino’s district includes all or portions of Bureau, LaSalle, Livingston and Putnam Counties.

•

The House and Senate are scheduled to return to Springfield on November 10th.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for CCHHS at both the State and Federal level.
