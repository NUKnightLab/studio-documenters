Report from Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (continued)
During the discussion of the information on appeals, Ms. Lipinski provided additional information on Fair
Hearing appeals; this is when a member exhausts the plan level appeal and chooses to go to the State. A recent
Fair Hearing appeal involved a drug denial of Harvoni, which is a very expensive drug used to treat hepatitis C.
CountyCare denied this drug for the individual because the member did not meet the medical criteria. This
member filed an appeal and it was denied. Then, the member filed a Fair Hearing appeal with the State of
Illinois; CountyCare’s decision to deny Harvoni was upheld by the State. Now this member has engaged the
Legal Assistance Foundation; they filed an administrative review action in circuit court in May, along with a
Section 1983 claim. The defendant is the State of Illinois, through the actions of CountyCare. The case is being
overseen by CCHHS’ legal department, with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
Following discussion of the appeals process, Ms. Bodnar offered to provide a more detailed explanation of the
stairstep process used for appeals at the next meeting.
During the discussion of the information on the Grievances and Appeals Program Assessment, Chairman Junge
inquired regarding delays in provider responsiveness; she asked if there was a distinction between CCHHS
providers and network providers. Ms. Lipinski stated that this can be a challenge across the board – it can be very
difficult to find the right person to send the letter to, and to find the right staff person to make sure the provider
sees it and responds in a timely fashion. She noted that CCHHS has a coordinated effort internally now;
grievances sent to CCHHS providers are sent to one (1) single place.
With regard to Fraud, Waste and Abuse issues, Ms. Bodnar pointed out the decrease in new investigations opened
in the 4th quarter of the State’s FY2016; that decrease is related to the transition and issues with the build of the
special investigations unit, which is a required component. The Third Party Administrator (TPA) had contracted
with an entity for the special investigations unit and was moving forward with them; unfortunately, that entity
changed their business model from doing both pre-payment and post-payment review to only doing pre-payment
review. Post-payment review is needed in order to see trends and patterns, but that subcontractor was unable to
perform that service. Ms. Bodnar stated that this is not a missed opportunity - all of the claims data is intact and
will be run when the special investigations unit is up and running. The challenge right now is that the
administration will need to issue a Request for Proposals for the provision of services relating to the special
investigations unit. The unit will need data systems in place that can run all of these algorithms and identify the
anomalies, to be able to investigate, and to have nurses and coders on staff to look at the records. The
administration is in the process of transitioning that function from the TPA to CCHHS.
Board Chairman Hammock noted that the transition to the new TPA, Valence, occurred on April 1 st; he thought
the transition would be finished by now. The Committee discussed the suggestion of having representatives from
Valence come to a committee meeting in the near future to discuss the transition issues and operational
implementation concerns. Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, noted that, in November, it is
expected that Valence and their new leadership will be providing a post-acquisition report to the Managed Care
Committee. This request is a little different – this is expressing a concern about some of the operational
implementation; it was agreed that a report on this subject from Valence should be provided earlier than
November. Following discussion, a report on the subject was tentatively scheduled to take place at the September
Managed Care Committee Meeting.
Board Chairman Hammock requested that the Directors have a deeper review, conversation, and corrective action
plan regarding the subject of transportation. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, concurred; he stated
that issues with transportation are ubiquitous – all plans are having the same problem. He stated that he will talk
to his staff and follow up with a recommendation for the context of the discussion and preferred Committee for
the review and discussion of the subject.
