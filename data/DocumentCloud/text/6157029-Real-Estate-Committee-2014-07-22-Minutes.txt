Integrated Feasibility Report and Environmental Assessment for the Upper Des Plaines River and Tributaries of
Illinois and Wisconsin (the “Report”);
WHEREAS, the Report sought to create a comprehensive plan for addressing flooding and stormwater along the

with and have not ruled upon the proposal within the Documentation of Changes;

EASEMENT REQUEST
Department: Planning and Development
Request: Requesting authorization for the Forest Preserve District of Cook County (“the Preserves”) to grant a
temporary easement to the Illinois Department of Transportation (“IDOT”) at Harts Road and the North Branch of
the Chicago River for 0.02 acre or 741 square feet.
Reason: IDOT requests a temporary construction easement to access the North Branch of the Chicago River along
the north side of Harts Road for a slope stabilization project. The slope stabilization is necessary to ensure the
continued operation and safety of the Harts Road Bridge over the river. This remediation will stabilize the river
bank and prevent further loss of soil, trees, and vegetation. The slope stabilization will decrease the sediment load in
the river, thus reducing surface water degradation and stream siltation.
Slope stabilization utilizing a 12-inch tall stone slope mattress over 36-inch tall gabions is to be placed along the
banks of the North Branch Chicago River. A synthetic geo filter fabric will be placed on the ground below the slope
mattress and gabions. The area for the temporary easement is 0.02 acres. IDOT indicates that 4 (four) trees are
expected to be removed for this project.
Easement Fee: $1,500.00
Tree Mitigation Fee: $1,814.12

Request be approved. The motion carried by the following vote:
