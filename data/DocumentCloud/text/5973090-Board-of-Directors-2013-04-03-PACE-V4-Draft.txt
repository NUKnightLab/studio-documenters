 PACE Basics
•

•
•
•

•

PACE programs create local financing districts and a loan application approval process to
provide loans to homeowners and businesses to finance renewable energy and energy
efficiency improvements
Property owners voluntarily apply to PACE financing
Realigns benefits of energy improvements to length of use and removes initial capital
barrier
Repayment of loan is attached to the property
– Typically an assessment or special tax that is repaid along with property taxes
– Loan repayments can be as long as 20 years
– Senior lien position
• Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have indicated concerns of the lien
• July 2010 guidance from FHFA cited “significant safety and soundness concerns,”
resulting in a pause or suspension of most residential programs that were under
development
Since its origination 29 states have passed legislation concerning the program

 PACE Opportunities in Illinois
•

•

•

Illinois authorized the program in 2009
– However, original bill lacked proper lien language and has impeded implementation
– HB67 reintroduced as a priority in 2013 will attempt to subordinate the lien to the
existing mortgage and resolve Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac concerns
Non-conforming loans
– Loans that do not meet certain Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae requirements
– Typically resold on secondary markets without Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae
– Loans are nonconforming due to a range of reasons including:
• Jumbo loans
• Loan to value ratio is too high
• Credit score and history challenges
Commercial loans
– Loans secured for multifamily or commercial properties
– Depending on size of building, may be subject to floating rates
– Available through Freddie and Fannie, or through other lenders
