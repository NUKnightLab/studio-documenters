FY 2018-19 RESOLUTION NUMBER 3

RESOLUTION REQUESTING MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES TO UPDATE THE GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS FOR FUNDING TO

RECOMMENDATIONS

WHEREAS the Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority is responsible for
providing Medicaid specialty behavioral health supports and services (?Medicaid Services?) for
the citizens of Wayne County, Michigan, through its Pre-Paid Impatient Health Plan 
agreement with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and

WHEREAS is responsible for providing appropriate funding to DWMHA to enable
DWMHA to provide Medicaid Services to meet the needs of the citizens of Wayne County,
Michigan; and

WHEREAS the funding of these Services has historically been systematically underfunded by
and its predecessor the Michigan Department of Community Health; and

WHEREAS in the summer of 2018 through its contractor for actuarial services,
Milliman, reviewed the funding to the state?s ten (10) PIHPs, taking into consideration speci?c
geographic factors; and

WHEREAS in September of 201 8 intended to update the geographic factor for Medicaid
Services to the PIHPs in January of 2019 which would have resulted in a more equitable
distribution of the state?s Medicaid dollars among the ten (10) and

WHEREAS in December of 2018, reversed its decision to update the geographic factor
it previously committed to in September of 20 1 8; and

WHEREAS reversal to not update the geographic factors will have an adverse impact
on all populations, including but not limited to; substance use disorder services, crisis services and
possible limitations on summer youth employment programs, school?s mental health programs and
programs for the Wayne County jail and courts.
