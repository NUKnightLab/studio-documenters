PROPOSED ORDINANCE

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 28, 2005 from
ROBERT MALDONADO, County Commissioner
In January of 2005, I directed my staff to prepare an ordinance entitled the "Cook County Motor Vehicle
Weight Tax" in order to help bridge an unprecedented budget gap. The purpose of the tax was twofold:
to raise funds while discouraging consumers in Cook County from purchasing larger motor vehicles. The
legislation also aimed to protect public health and safety as well as our public investment in the Cook
County highway system. However, keeping in the spirit of budget negotiations, I shelved the proposal
until such time the Board might be receptive to its adoption. In the wake of Comm issioner Quigley's
announcement that he favors such a tax I am now introducing this item.

1415

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Below is a copy of the Proposed Ordinance that I am submitting for the May 3, 2005 Board Agenda. I
will request that the item be referred to the Committee on Finance. I am also submitting a letter from
Barbara Bruno, Director of Revenue, estimating the potential revenue from this tax at nearly six million.
(The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
ROBERT MALDONADO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE

COOK COUNTY MOTOR VEHICLE WEIGHT TAX
WHEREAS, according to the World Health Organization, larger passenger motor vehicles, particularly
Sport Utility Vehicles, known as SUVs, pose a serious health and environmental impact that will become
the world's third most common cause of death and disability by the year 2020; and
WHEREAS, despite dire warnings, SUV sales have exploded on the U.S. market, representing 25% of
new passenger vehicles sold in the U.S., and their sales continue to soar; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the obvious health and environmental concerns, the Board of Commissioners
further finds that larger passenger motor vehicles, because of their size, contribute to greater wear upon
the highway system within Cook County than smaller passenger motor vehicles, resulting in increased
street maintenance and repair costs; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department spends approximately $17 million annually to provide an
adequate level of preventive and corrective maintenance of the highway facilities; and
WHEREAS, in the same way the Cook County cigarette tax discourages consumers from smoking,
consumers in Cook County should be discouraged from purchasing SUVs for the protection of the public
health and safety and for the protection of the public investment in the Cook County highway system; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII, Section
6(a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution; and
WHEREAS, Illinois law (55 ILCS §5/5-1009) permits home rule units to impose " taxes not based on the
selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale or purchase of tangible personal property";
and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that a County tax not based upon
the selling or purchase price or gross receipts from the use, sale or purchase thereof should be imposed
upon the larger passenger vehicles within Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION 1.

TITLE.

This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Cook County Motor Vehicle Weight Tax". The

may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.

drng diversion and education program fo r non-violent adult drug offenders with limited criminal
backgrounds.
Reason:

TASC has been involved in the State's Attorney's Drug Abuse Program since 1995. As the
designated state agency for court treatment programs as condition of probation, T ASC is
uniquely qualified to act as an intennediary between the court system and the treatment
community. By contracting with T ASC to administer this program, there is a consistency
between the State's Attorney Office's intervention program and the various court mandated
programs available throughout the system. Given TASC's long history with this program,
renewal of this contract will ensure continuity of service to participants. T ASC has
consistently met or exceeded all perfonnance goals under previous contracts for this program.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $702,000.00. Contract period: December I, 2004 through November 30, 2005 .
(250-260 Account). Requisition No. 52500009.

Chief, Highway Department

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Roads and Bridges of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Tuesday, April 26, 2005 at the hour of I0:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the recommendation
is as follows:
270729

COUNTY HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT, by Wally S. Kos, P.E., Superintendent of
Highways, transmitting a Communication, dated March 23, 2005:
respectfully requesting permission to discuss the following matter with the Board of
Commissioners or the appropriate committee thereof, pursuant to County Ordinance 95-0-07
regarding acquisition of real estate.
I.

88th/86th A venue,
11 lth Street to I 03rd Street

Section: 0I-W3016-02-FP
Plat: 964
Tract: 16-04

Note:

This item was also referred to the Real Estate Subcommittee. (See Comm. No.
270728).

Commissioner Maldonado noted the huge differences in the value of compensation amounts which the
two appraisers quoted.
Kiran Patel , Engineer for the Highway Department, noted that the first appraisal used residential value of
compensation. The second appraisal used vacant land comparables from surrounding communities.
Wally S. Kos, Superintendent of the Highway Department stated that the first license appraiser used
vacant properties to determine comparables and the parcel includes a large church; the second license
appraiser used comparables of developed properties within the area.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the parcel is improved or unimproved.
Superintendent Kos replied that the parcel is improved.
Commissioner Goonan reiterated that the two different appraisers are large in variation. The County had
to distinguish between developed property appraisals versus undeveloped property appraisals. That
would explain the large discrepancy between the eight dollars per square footage and the one dollar and
fifty cents per square footage.

1459

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Superintendent Kos replied that whenever there are two appraisals, the Highway Department accepts the
highest appraisal. However, if there is a large difference as in this appraisal, the Highway Department
utilizes a review appraiser who is not associated with the two certified appraisers who conduct the review
for the Highway Department. Superintendent Kos further stated that the Highway Department does not
have a certified appraiser on staff.
Chainnan Hansen asked for the names of the three appraisers.
Superintendent Kos replied that the three appraisers are Ronald S. Lipman, Jennifer L. Dounias and the
Review Appraiser, Charles A. Southcomb.
Commissioner Collins inquired about the acreage of land the Highway Department is purchasing.
Superintendent Kos replied that the roadway has one lane in each direction. The proposed scope is to
remove and replace the roadway with three lanes, one lane in each direction and a center turning lane that
will widen the roadway. Additionally, the Highway Department is installing curbs and gutters. The
parcel of land in Palos Hills has dips, valleys, ravines and thirty-three feet of right-of-way by township
dedication from one hundred years ago. The Highway Department is acquiring twenty feet of land in this
particular area.
Commissioner Collins voiced concern about the cost of the parcel.
Superintendent Kos reiterated that the value of the twenty feet of land was detennined by the appraisers.
The Review Appraiser concurred with the appraisal amount of $72,000. The compensation was evaluated
and the parcel is slightly less than three acres. The Highway Depa1tment is purchasing .15 of an acre
which is approximately one sixth of an acre. Along the frontage are trees, scrubs, fancy gate works,
bricks, and light fixtures to highlight and illuminate the driveways. The cost of the property includes
damages that will be incun-ed for removal of trees, scrubs, fancy gate works, bricks and driveways in a
residential area.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Murphy, moved the approval of Communication
No. 270729. The motion carried.
Commissioner Butler moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Daley.

services for the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Water Main Survey and Valve
Replacement Project at the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Campus. It is respectfully
requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

of repairs. The scope of this project will be to repair and/or replace equipment as
needed, to better service the needs of this campus and comply with current codes.

Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on 04/19/05.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the eleven miles of water main are included in the $3.3 million
project cost.

identify main-line piping to be replaced or repaired for the system. Mr. LaMont further stated that the
consultant was present to answer any questions for the Commissioners.
R. Murty Yedavalli, P.E., F-ASCE President, DuSable, Inc., replied that the contract includes eleven
miles of tracing and locating of the piping. Further, Mr. Y edavalli stated that he has experienced

Yedavalli stated that he does not expect any of the main-line piping to have problems. In conclusion, Mr.
Yedavalli stated that entire piping within the campus will be replaced.
Commissioner Hansen asked whether the committee was seeking approval of the $3 .3 million
construction cost or the $547,091.00 desig n fee.
Mr. LaMont replied that the $547,09 1.00 is the desig n fee and the $3.3 million is the estimated cost of
construction calculated by the Office of Capital Planning and Policy based on previous studies that were
done for the replacement of valve vaults and the main-line piping.

Commissioner Hansen asked for a report once the investigation is completed.
Mr. LaMont replied that once the initial investigation is completed a report will be issued to the

contingency fees, percentage-wise, are so varied, and she also inquired as to the discrepancies within the

at the discretion of President Stroger. President Stroger selects finns that are qualified to provide these
specialized services. There are ranges of fees from 5% to 18% that the Office of Capital Planning and
Policy considers. The fees are negotiated with the firm once selected. Some of the contracts will contain
three consulting contracts for exterior repair design work, and the percentage of the fee varies among the
contracts and is based on the complexity of the project.

master plan. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moreno asked Mr. LaMont to address the Committee regarding the item being deferred.
Mr. LaMont replied that the building in question is the seventeen-story-administration building located on
the Stroger Hospital campus. The consulting contract includes both an investigation of the fac;;ade and the
design of pennanent repairs to the fac;;ade in accordance with City of Chicago codes. Further, Mr.
LaMont stated that the master plan currently underway for Stroger Hospital of Cook County is to evaluate
all the buildings. This includes evaluating what will be needed in terms of square footage for office
space; options will be developed regarding how to satisfy the needs for the office space. Mr. LaMont
stated that at this time the Office of Capital Planning and Policy does not know what the recommendation
will be and what the Board is going to adopt. Mr. LaMont stated that it is possible that there might be a
recommendation to demolish the building; the preliminary findings on the master plan will be available

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated March 30, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is Amendment No. 1 to the contract with ERS
Enterprises/Oppidan, Joint Venture in the amount of $145,000.00 for the Countywide
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Study and Renovations, Phase II. It is respectfully
requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This amendment provides for design and construction administration services for
proposed floor drain installation in public restrooms at Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County, Provident Hospital of Cook County, and the Sengstacke Clinic.
The floor drains are required because during the normal course of the Illinois
Department of Public Health (IDPH) review, the lack of drains in these bathroom
areas was identified as an existing building element that is not in conformance
with the current State of Illinois Plumbing Code. The most cost effective way to
implement the change is to allow ERS Enterprises/Oppidan to prepare the plans
based on their familiarity with the buildings. Additionally, this amendment
provides for conceptual design work for areas of rescue assistance, for alterations
to nursing stations at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and Provident
Hospital of Cook County, and for additional construction administration services
for Groups I, II and Ill.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations of the Board of Commissioners of Cook

Room 569, County Building, 118 North C lark Street, Chicago, Illinois.

1520

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
Illinois State Representative Julie Hamos, Chainnan of the Special Transportation Committee on
Regional Transportation, Illinois House of Representatives, testified that transportation is both a regional
and state-wide issue. She further stated that the Committee on Regional Transportation received
assistance from the University of Illinoi s at Chicago's Urban Transportation Center in analyzing data
from the current funding fonnula a summary of which is submitted with th is report.
Representative Harnos noted that the 1983 funding formula has no relationship to transit perfonnance.
This funding formula was required to address a crisis that occurred in this region. In 1983 the legislature
designed a solution as to how to divide a large sum of money for transit. A portion of the sales tax would
fund the government subsidy that is associated with each trip. The legislature decided that Cook County
would have a one percent sales tax that would be allocated to the RT A for distribution among three transit
agencies. In the collar counties one-fourth-of-one percent sales tax would be allocated to the RTA for
Metra and Pace. The CTA receives all sales taxes from Chicago. Cook County suburbs divide the sum
among the CTA, METRA and PACE. The suburban Cook County dollars generated are allocated as
follows: Metra receives fifty-five percent, CTA receives thirty percent, and Pace receives fifteen percent.
Fifty-four percent of the total of all sales tax revenues come from Suburban Cook County.
There are a few imbalances concerning where passengers are, which sub-regions are being served and
where the money is being allocated.
Suburban Cook County subsidizes the services for both Chicago and the collar counties. There is $100
million of Suburban Cook sales taxes that go to collar county services.
The goal is to understand why the CTA believes it is not receiving adequate dollars out of the existing
funding formula. The funding formula, developed in 1983, does not support the full range of CTA
services. The CTA suggested that the funding formula should be connected more to transit service. The
current sales tax base for regional mass transit is expended. Without additional revenues, no one can
move forward.
When the Federal Reauthorization Bill is decided, the RTA will know which expansion projects are being
funded. Also to be determined is how many operating dollars will be needed to subsidize the expansions,
and when and how this subsidy will occur. The legislature will have to devise a new funding fonnu la.
The Committee on Regional Transportation plans to travel and create a consensus in the region and the
Cook County Board should be a part of the process.
One of the short tenn goals is to provide more state and federal dollars in para-transit services for the
disabled. This is a very important public policy goal. The State should more fully support this endeavor.
Some of the transit service, for example, transportation to doctors' offices, should be claimed under the
Medicaid program so that the federal government can supply fifty-percent of the transportation cost. The
restructuring of the para-transit system will relieve the burden placed on CTA and PACE budgets. If
para-transit were transferred to a state responsibility, the short term crisis at the CTA would be solved.
Commissioner Murphy inquired whether Representative Harnos has observed the need for public
transportation in the south end of Cook County.
Representative Harnos stated that Metra has an ambitious plan for new stations in the south suburbs. In
Will County three new stations will be built for the south-east extension; two new stations will be built
for the south-west extension.

1521

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Commissioner Murphy asked whether the Committee will require more contributions from the Collar
Counties.
Representative Harnos replied that this is part of the regional consensus-building effort in terms of
funding. She further stated that it is important to build support among all public officials so that
conversations among the various regions can take place.
Commissioner Daley asked whether Representative Harnos had heard of any new changes regarding the
Federal Reauthorization Bill.
Representative Harnos stated the Federal Reauthorization Bill will provide capital for new projects that
will launch expansion plans. This will indicate what the federal government wi ll support. Funds will be
needed to build and operate stations.
Commissioner Gorman asked where the Starline, one of the expansion projects, runs.
James Dodge, Member, Metra Board of Directors, who was present in the audience, was asked to answer
the question. He replied that the Starline runs from .Joliet to Hoffman Estates and then makes an "L" and
continues through parts of Will County. The Starline travels on to the Indiana border. He further stated
that projects such as Starline are expensive.
Commissioner Gonnan asked whether there are plans for future expansion.
Mr. Dodge stated that there would be other expansions as soon as insight is gained into capital funding
and operational expenses.
Commissioner Gorman asked what new funding formula is in place.
Representative Harnos replied that everyone concerned with this issue is currently brainstonning and
further stated that the Committee will ensure that regional consensus building is achieved.
Commissioner Gorman asked whether the CTA's "doomsday" budget is accurate.
Representative Harnos stated that the Committee cannot currently extricate budget dollars to address
service cuts. State dollars are necessary in this matter. She further stated that an examination by the state
of para-transit for the disabled would be appropriate.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the operational budget is $1 billion without the capital component.
Representative Harnos replied in the affinnative. She further stated that the capital project cost could be
an additional $ 1 billion.
Commissioner Peraica stated that the transportation system needs to avail itself of external expert
analysis. Such analysis could render infornrntion about how the transportation system could best operate.
A second objective is to revise how the RTA Board membership is detennined. Commissioner Peraica
asked whether or not there ha ve been discussions on how the RTA Board is selected.
Representative Hamos stated that there has been no discussion of governance issues. She suggested that a
long-term goal would be to examine the governing powers and authority of the RTA.

1522

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Vice Chainnan Silvestri asked whether Representative Harnos was receiving cooperation from various
agencies; such as the Republican and Democratic leadership and the Office of the Governor.
Representative Harnos stated the Committee is dedicated to having a strong transportation system.
Further, she noted that one problem is that the RTA has not had a Chainnan. Representative Harnos
restated three points: first Cook County suburbs account for 54% of the sales tax revenue, secondly Cook
County suburbs subsidize the collar counties by $I 00 million, and finally that the original RTA fonnula
gave the CTA additional funds because the original formula was not balanced.
Chairnrnn Suffredin stated that the additional discretionary fund was never intended to be discretionary so
funding cannot be redirected.
Representative Harnos stated that the discretionary funds comprise twenty percent of the CTA' s current
budget and were needed by the CTA from the beginning.
Commissioner Murphy stated that PACE has a dispatching program in DuPage County. She asked
whether Representative Harnos has knowledge of the program as it might relate to para-transit.
Representative Harnos replied that DuPage County possesses a model of how to operate a coordinated
system; this model could be used for para-transit ifthe state takes over the operation.

Steve Morrill, Cook County Lobbyist, stated that Illinois Senate Bill 458 was introduced last year; the
Board was opposed to it on fiscal grounds. The bill narrowly passed the Senate. House action is
questionable. The Judicial Advisory Council estimated an operational cost of $20 million. The capital
cost, according to the Judicial Advisory Council, would amount to $100 million if we were required to
build a new Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Gene Barnes, Cook County Lobbyist, stated that both Frank Bass, Legislative Liaison, Office of the
President, and Tim Casey, Coordinator of Intergovernmental Affairs, Office of the President, spoke to
various members of the Illinois House of Representatives. Mr. Barnes predicts that the bill will be further
studied by the House Sub-Committee. At present there is no overwhelming consensus to support the bill
by the House.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the bill is very significant because it deals with a one year period where
many people get their first felony conviction and this leads to lost employment opportunities. There
should be a report regarding what the House does on this bill. Off-setting funds may exist that could
address this financial issue if it were to become law.
Chairman Suffredin asked Mr. Casey whether either the Cook County State's Attorney or the Presiding
Judge of Juvenile Court are opposed to the bill.
Mr. Casey responded in the negative.
Chairman Suffredin stated that the State's Attorney and the Presiding Judge of Juvenile Court should
testify.
Vice Chainnan Silvestri noted that the resolution that is being considered does not include Illinois Senate
Bill 458 and action will be taken to defer Senate Bill 458.
Commissioner Daley stated that the Chief Judge's Office and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
should be here to testify.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he supports a program to treat seventeen year olds as juveniles. He
further stated that it does not increase cost.
Commissioner Murphy asked whether a boot camp exists for women and she noted the positive results of
the Cook County Boot Camp for male detainees. The female population of detainees is increasing. She
supports Senate Bill 458 and the State of Illinois should allocate more resources into funding education.
Mr. Casey stated that other counties also believe that Senate Bill 458 could be costly.
Vice Chairman Silvestri stated this issue falls under the purview of policy makers. Further discussion on
SB 458 was deferred to a later date when other witnesses will be called.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to discuss the proposed
substitute Resolution. The motion carried.

(See

Chainnan Steele asked Wally Kos, Superintendent of the Highway Department to address the Committee.
Commissioner Maldonado noted the huge differences in the value of compensation amounts the two
appraisers quoted.
Kiran Patel, Engineer for the Highway Department, noted that the first appraisal used residential value of
compensation. The second appraisal used vacant land comparables from surrounding communities.

1528

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 3, 2005

Superintendent Kos stated that the first license appraiser used vacant properties to determine comparables
and the parcel includes a large church; while the second license appraiser used comparables of developed
properties within the area.
Commissioner Maldonado asked whether the parcel is improved or unimproved.
Superintendent Kos replied that the parcel is improved.
Commissioner Gorman reiterated that the two different appraisers are large in variation. The County had
to distinguish between developed property appraisals versus undeveloped property appraisals. That
would explain the large discrepancy between the eight dollars per square footage and the one dollar and
fifty cents per square footage.
Superintendent Kos replied that whenever there are two appraisals, the Highway Department accepts the
highest appraisal. However, if there is a large difference as in this appraisal, the Highway Department
utilizes a review appraiser who is not associated with the two certified appraisers who conduct the review
for the Highway Department. Superintendent Kos further stated that the Highway Department does not
have a certified appraiser on staff.
Chairman Hansen asked for the names of the three appraisers.
Superintendent Kos replied that the three appraisers are Ronald S. Lipman, Jennifer L. Dounias and the
Review Appraiser, Charles A. Southcomb.
Commissioner Collins inquired about the acreage of land the Highway Department is purchasing.
Superintendent Kos replied that the roadway has one lane in each direction. The proposed scope is to
remove and replace the roadway with three lanes, one lane in each direction and a center turning lane that
will widen the roadway. Additionally, the Highway Department is installing curbs and gutters. The
parcel of land in Palos Hills has dips, valleys, ravines and thirty-three feet of right-of-way by township
dedication from one hundred years ago. The Highway Department is acquiring twenty feet of land in this
particular area.
Commissioner Collins voiced concern about the cost of the parcel.
Superintendent Kos reiterated that the value of the twenty feet of land was detennined by the appraisers.
The Review Appraiser concurred with the appraisal amount of $72,000. The compensation was evaluated
and the parcel is slightly less than three acres. The Highway Department is purchasing .15 of an acre
which is approximately one sixth of an acre. Along the frontage are trees, scrubs, fancy gate works,
bricks, and light fixtures to highlight and illuminate the driveways. The cost of the property includes
damages that will be incurred for removal of trees, scrubs, fancy gate works, bricks and driveways in a
residential area.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved the approval of
Communication No. 270728. The motion carried.
Commissioner Maldonado moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Butler. The
motion carried and the meeting was adjourned.

WHEREAS, unless adequate funding is provided for the CTA and all regional transit, the transit agencies
will not be able to provide world-class transit for a world-class County; and
WHEREAS, as demonstrated by the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) Board at its September
I 0, 2004 adoption of alternative statutory funding Ordinances commencing the 2005 Budget process for
the RTA and its service boards, Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Pace and Metra, existing funding
services and mechanisms do not provide adequate resources to maintain current transportation services;
and
WHEREAS, appropriate legislative action is required to give effect to the RT A Resolution and service
board alternative Budget Resolutions; and
WHEREAS, the existing funding formula found in the Regional Transportation Authority Act, which has
not been changed in over 20 years, should address and consider transit service funding challenges and
needs from a regional perspective.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners be on
record as supporting Ordinances, adopted by the RT A Board September I 0, 2004 and Budget Resolutions
implementing this Resolution adopted by CTA, Pace and Metra; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board joins with the CTA, business leaders,
community leaders and municipalities in supporting the following five core principles for regional transit
solutions:
1. Public transit is an essential regional resource and the entire Northeastern Illinois region
needs more operating and capital funding now.

2. No transit service board in the region should gain at the expense of the others.
3. A healthy transit system curbs traffic congestion and pollution while improving mobility,
economic competitiveness and the quality of life for all the people in the region.
4. Funding should keep pace with steadily increasing demands on transit, including population
and job growth, the end of federal operating support and rising paratransit and security costs.
5.

Future funding solutions should reflect the spirit of bipartisanship and regional consensus;
and
