from the border of Cook County; and

WHEREAS, Cook County shares the Des Plaines Watershed Region, and our water and air resources are all
interconnected; and

WHEREAS, the State of Wisconsin has passed legislation that waives environmental regulations for the Foxconn plant;

WHEREAS, the legislation allows Foxconn to fill 26 acres of wetlands with dredged materials without an
Environmental Impact Study or input from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and

WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency exempted
from air quality requirements for ozone, allowing Foxconn to avoid having
control equipment; and

adverse effects to the environment and population of Cook County

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County call on the State of
Wisconsin and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to require the Foxconn Development to comply with
all applicable environmental regulations in the construction and operation of its proposed plant at Mount Pleasant,
Wisconsin; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County urges the State of Wisconsin and
the United States Environmental Protection Agency to uniformly apply and enforce all applicable regulations and laws as
written without any exemptions, waivers or variances to ensure negative impacts are not imposed on the residents of
downstream Cook County;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County supports the Illinois Attorney
General, Illinois General Assembly and Illinois agencies in taking whatever actions possible to protect Cook County and
the State of Illinois against the loss of water resources, potential flooding, and other ecological impacts from this
development; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution shall be provided to the Governor of Wisconsin, the
Director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Governor of Illinois, the Illinois Attorney General, the
