RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
This month we have been working hard to build our relationships across the community and with
our political supporters throughout the state. We have met with possible business partners in
northern Summit County to talk about mobility options outside of the denser cities. They are open
to listening to our proposals and it gives us a sense of pride and excitement to know people want
to talk about transit and METRO’s role in the community. We have also met with a few of our
representatives including Representatives Galonski, Weinstein, and DeVitis, as well as Senator
Sykes. Representative Roemer came to visit and tour our Kenmore facility and Minority Leader
Sykes will visit us next week. These folks have been very supportive of the need for Ohio to
invest in public transportation throughout the state. As I write this, the House has passed along a
budget that includes $100M of dedicated capital funding flexed from federal highway money. This
is now being debated by the Senate and we are hopeful these dollars will remain dedicated to
public transit infrastructure. I also thank those of you who have taken time to complete our retreat
surveys. This information collected will assist us in developing material for our next retreat.
Thank you for your support and commitment to METRO RTA and our mission of providing the
best transportation services in the nation.
Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler
Executive Director

 FEBRUARY 2019 OPERATIONS REPORT
The training hours for the month of February totaled 682. The training consisted of New Hire Training, Refresher Training,
Line-Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable Accident Policy.
th

The Director of Operations had the privilege of attending the State of the City Address on February 20 , along with
several members of the Leadership Team. We rode METRO buses to and from the John S. Knight Center. The experience
provided us a great opportunity to interact with passengers while we were at the Robert K. Pfaff Transit Center and on
the bus ride.
On Friday, February 22, 2019, the Operations Department hosted our colleagues from Greater Cleveland RTA. The
purpose of the visit was to discuss best practices within our agencies. Jarrod Hampshire, Director of Maintenance,
provided a tour of our facilities, both at 416 Kenmore Blvd., and at 631 S. Broadway St. Our guests were very
impressed with our Operations Department and the efficiency with which we operate.
Various members of METRO’s Board of Trustees and all of METRO’s Department Directors had the opportunity to
participate in a one day retreat. We met at the RKPTC and rode the DASH to Greystone Hall where the retreat was
held. After having a light continental breakfast, our session began with facilitated media crisis training. This was a great
training opportunity that provided us with the best tools for speaking with the media in the unlikely event there is some
type of crisis with METRO services or personnel. The strategy portion of our day began following lunch. A session of team
building and strategizing for the future closed out the retreat.
FEBRUARY 2019 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PARATRANSIT REPORT
CARE CENTER CALL NUMBERS: Our group answered 29,827 calls during the month of February. Of that total, 10,122
calls were for line-service information and the balance, 15,184 calls, was divided amongst paratransit reservations and
paratransit returns and/or cancellations. Calls were down this month compared to a total of 31,919 calls in January. We
are seeing a decline in information calls as other options are available for passengers to check on buses, such as Avail.

APPLICATIONS FOR PARATRANSIT SERVICE: Fewer applications for paratransit service are coming in as we inch closer to
spring. In February, 110 applications were processed. Eight new reduced fare riders are now riding line-service buses,
with four new ADA approvals and one ADA Visitor pass issued.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILTY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT:
Mobility reached out to approximately 80 people as part of our Agency Initiative to increase awareness of METRO services
and to promote travel training; completed 25 courtesy calls to new passengers and 14 wheelchair weight, inspection and
advocacy meetings. As a group, Customer Service team members attended meetings, gave presentations or worked on
several events in the community in February, including: Community Support Services, Child Guidance & Family Services,
Asia Inc., Project Learn, Summit County Development Disabilities, East Akron Neighborhood Development Emergency
Taskforce, Akron State of the City, Project Search, Ohio Means Jobs, Green High School Provider Expo, Ellet Apartments,
Herzing University, Goodwill, Flash Interviews to hire SSO’s, Mayor’s Senior Commission Meeting, and AMHA

 for approval, seconded by Ms. Heslop Licata. Resolution 2019-02 was unanimously
approved by the Board.
Resolution 2019-03 authorizing the renewal of METRO’s agreement with Downtown
Akron Partnership was presented for consideration. Mr. Fernandez made a motion for
approval, seconded by Mr. Christian. Resolution 2019-03 was unanimously approved by the
Board.
MARKETING AND SERVICE PLANNING COMMITTEE
The Marketing and Service Planning Committee did meet. Mr. Christian reported that there
had been a small down tick in ridership due to the recent arctic weather, but there was hope
that we were past the worst of the winter weather for the season. Mr. Christian requested that
the remainder of his time be deferred to Mr. Curtis Baker, Director of AMATS (Akron
Metropolitan Area Transportation Study).
Mr. Baker explained that AMATS looks forward many years to plan a better future for the
citizens of Akron. The focus used to be on roads, expansion, and widening, and the result
was planning for cars rather than for people. Now, Mr. Baker has joined Ms. Distler in
meeting with state representatives to emphasize the importance of transit in Ohio, and the
funding of that transit system. Ohio has suffered a state-wide disinvestment in transit.
AMATS is working to bring the state’s attention back to the funding of transit. Transit is a
service that may not always be needed by each individual, but it is a public utility that will be
there when it is needed. The gas tax increase could potentially generate $1.2 billion, and the
state has only indicated that $7 million will go towards transit, which is insufficient. Ohio
ranks 47th in the country for per capita spending on transit. AMATS is trying to make sure
that at the federal and state level, we are all on the same page about moving people, and not
just focusing on cars.
RAIL OPERATIONS COMMITTEE
The Rail Operations Committee did meet. No actions were requested.
HUMAN RESOURCES
Mr. DeJournett reported that the Human Resources Committee did meet. There were nine
new employees hired in January, eight of those were in Operations.
SAFETY COMMITTEE
The Safety Committee did meet. No actions were requested.
OFFICERS’ REPORT
President:
Mr. DeJournett read a letter of appreciation from Chief Tucker of the Akron Fire Department.
On January 30, 2019, METRO provided the use of a nearby bus to allow firefighters battling a
house fire to have a place to be warm and out of the elements. The Chief expressed gratitude
for the courtesy that was extended to his staff on that day with frigid temperatures and
hazardous conditions.

9

 Mr. DeJournett expressed appreciation for those who attended the Board retreat the previous
day (Feb. 25th). Much was accomplished, and the majority of the recommendations from the
consultants were discussed. There was also a crisis training segment that was beneficial. An
evaluation will be distributed to Board members. The retreat facilitator will be sending out a
summary of tasks to be put into action. Once received, it was suggested that an action
register be created with a timeline for when each item will be accomplished.
At the retreat and in committee meetings, a new committee structure was agreed upon. The
new structure is as follows:
Maintenance / Operations / Customer Services Committee
Chair: Mark Derrig
Finance / Audit / Procurement Committee
Chair: Nicholas Fernandez
Human Resources / Safety & Security Committee
Chair: Louise Gissendaner
Planning / Marketing / Rail Committee
Chair: Donald Christian
Governance Committee
Chair: Gary Spring
Members for each committee are still being decided. Trustees were asked to indicate on
which committees they wished to serve. The Governance Committee will be reviewing the
Board bylaws, and bringing a recommendation for how they should be updated. The
suggestion was made for each Board member to ride the bus at least one time per year, and to
report back on their experience. A sign-up sheet was provided.
Executive Director:
Ms. Distler also expressed appreciation for those who attended the Board Retreat the prior
day, and noted that Leadership reported it as a successful day. She reported that she, Mr.
Baker, and Ms. Shea had attended events in Columbus in recognition of Ohio Loves Transit
Day. She reiterated the importance of letting our state and federal representatives know the
importance of transit, and therefore, the importance of funding transit. Ms. Shea clarified
that, in regards to state funding of transit, a recent ODOT study had shown that they should
be funding up to 10% of transit needs. The estimation for 2025 was an amount of $185
million, not the $7 million that is dedicated in the current proposed budget. This provided
context for why the request has been made for an increase in the budget for transit funding.
OTHER BUSINESS
None
EXECUTIVE SESSION:
Mr. DeJournett requested a motion to go into Executive Session to discuss a Board personnel
matter. Mr. Christian made a motion, seconded by Mr. Rector.
