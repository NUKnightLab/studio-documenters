Section 1. Findings. it is found, declared and determined as follows.

Pursuant to section 34-43 of the Code, the Board has previously established standards
by which its budgets shall be balanced in each fiscal year, consistent with the requirements of the Code.
These standards provide that each budget of the Board shall cover a fiscal year of the Board and shall be
developed and adopted in accordance with the requirements of the Code, including, but not limited to,
Sections 34-42 through 34-51 thereof. These standards also provide that each budget shall be prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and shall be balanced such that, for each
fund, the estimated sum of all revenues for the fiscal year from all sources and the amount of Fund
Balance Available for appropriation in the fiscal year is greater than or equal to the estimated sum of all
appropriations required to defray the amount of all expenditures and charges to be made or incurred
during the fiscal year and the amount of all unpaid liabilities at the beginning of the fiscal year. The
standards further provide that in determining the amount of the Fund Balance Available for appropriation
in the Educational Fund, there shall be deducted the amount, if any, which the Board directs to be
accumulated to achieve a balanced budget in a future year within the four-year period of the financial plan
to begin in the budget year or for capital improvements, and (ii) any reserve to insure uninterrupted
services in the event of unfavorable budget variances. The Board?s goal is to have a balanced budget
over the period of the four-year financial plan that is to be developed.

Office of Management and Budget and approved by the Board by a vote of two?thirds of the members,
provided that such transfers shall not exceed 10% of the fund during the first half of the fiscal year, and
no appropriation shall be reduced below an amount sufficient to cover all obligations that will be incurred
against the appropriation. The Chief Executive Officer shall define object groups and purposes that are
subject to these requirements.

The Senior Vice President of Finance is hereby authorized to transfer and use Debt Service funds not
otherwise restricted under bond documents for the purpose of operating and capital expenditures to
support cash flow during the fiscal year. Transfers from the Debt Service funds for this purpose will be
repaid from the next receipts of property tax revenues.

Section 4. Capital Budgeting Process. The Chief Executive Officer proposed a one-year Capital
improvement Plan (the consistent with the annual budget and the requirements of Section 34-215
of the Code on August 8, 2016, for the Board?s approval. Three public hearings were held to receive
public comment on the proposed CIP. Such meetings were held on August 17, 2016, at three different
locations.

Section 7. Personnel Policies. The appropriations herein made for personnel services shall be
regarded as maximum amounts to be expended from such appropriations. Such expenditures shall be
limited to personnel only as needed, or as may be required by law, not to exceed the maximum that may
be employed for any position by title. Notwithstanding any item in the budget, one person may be
employed or more than one person may be employed, upon recommendation of the Budget Officer and
the Chief Executive Officer, whether such title is printed in the singular or plural. The salary or wage rate
fixed shall be regarded as the maximum salary or wage rate for the respective positions, provided that
salaries or wage rates are subject to change by the Board during the fiscal year in accordance with
collective bargaining agreements approved by the Board.

Initial appointments to any position, transfers among positions and resignations of Board personnel shall
be made in accordance with, and subject to, current Board Policies and Rules, as may be amended, from
time to time.

Section 8. Settlement Agreements and Judgments. No expenditure may be made from any fund or
line item account herein for the purpose of executing settlement agreements, entering into consent orders
or paying judgments except upon the approval of the Board; provided, however, that this section shall not
apply to judgments, settlement agreements or consent orders involving an amount up to $50,000 or to
labor arbitrations. In those cases, the General Counsel is authorized to approve such documents and
expend such funds without approval of the Board.

Section 9. Fiscal Stability. Pursuant to the Fund Balance and Budget Management Policy (Board
Report as may be amended), in the event that the stabilization fund decreases below 5%
of the operating and debt service budget, the Senior Vice President of Finance will prepare and present to
the Board a plan to replenish the reserve. The Board must approve and adopt a plan to restore these
balances to the target levels within a 12-month period. If the restoration of the reserve cannot occur
within a 12-month period, the Senior Vice President of Finance or Budget Officer can request that the
Board approve an extension of this deadline.

It is anticipated and planned in the FY 2017 budget that the stabilization fund will be below 5% of the
operating and debt service budget. Moreover, the FY 2018 budget is anticipated to present similar
financial challenges and the Senior Vice President of Finance does not reasonably foresee the fund
balance being restored during FY 2018. Therefore, the Board extends the restoration deadline to the end
of FY 2019. The Senior Vice President of Finance will submit as part of the FY 2018 budget a plan to
restore the fund balance by the end of FY 2019.

Section 10. Severability. To the extent that any prior resolution or policy of the Board (excluding Board
Rules) is in conflict with the provisions of this Resolution, the provisions of this Resolution shall be
controlling. If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Resolution shall be held invalid, the
invalidity of such section, paragraph, clause, or provision shall not affect any of the other provisions of this
Resolution.

Section 11. Effectiveness. This Resolution is effective immediately upon its adoption.
