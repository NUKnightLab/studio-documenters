WHEREAS, the Cook County Forest Preserve District Act (70 ILCS 810/40) clearly states that
admission proceeds to Brookfield Zoo must be devoted exclusively to the operation and maintenance of
the zoo; and
WHEREAS, attempts have been made by the Village of Brookfield to place an amusement tax on the
zoo’s admission which, if enacted would divert much-needed incremental revenue away from the zoo and
into the Village of Brookfield’s operating fund representing a potential violation of Illinois state law; and
WHEREAS, Brookfield Zoo already faces a $1.3 million shortfall in its 2010 budget and must make $65
million in critical capital repairs over the next four years to its aging infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, the Zoo already contributes more than its fair share to the Village of Brookfield, including
$200,000 a year in sales tax and water maintenance fees; 145 jobs for Brookfield residents representing

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
$3.5 million in wages and benefits; $3.7 million in annual economic activity for the Village; and so much
more; and
WHEREAS, Brookfield Zoo is a potent economic engine that generates $150 million in economic
activity for the region; a top tourism attraction that attracts more than 2.2 million people a year; and an
award-winning educational institution; and
WHEREAS, the aforementioned provision of the Cook County Forest Preserve District Act was
established to ensure that admission proceeds to Brookfield Zoo would always be devoted to the
maintenance and operations of Brookfield Zoo; indeed admission proceeds to the zoo have been expended
in a manner consistent with the Act since the zoo opened in 1934; and
WHEREAS, if the Village of Brookfield were to place an amusement tax on the Zoo, it would take away
much-needed revenue from the Zoo which would result in layoffs and exhibit closures at the Zoo.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby oppose any effort by
the Village of Brookfield to place an amusement tax on Brookfield Zoo and respectfully request
immediate legislative action by the Illinois General Assembly that will prevent layoffs and exhibit
closures at Brookfield Zoo by prohibiting the Village of Brookfield from placing an amusement tax on
Brookfield Zoo.
Approved and adopted this 16th day of November 2010.

guardianship, explanation of court procedures and assistance with completing
court forms and documents. The desk has provided assistance to thousands of

with court personnel and off site legal assistance is provided by attorneys
from CBF’s program partner, the Chicago Volunteer Legal Services
Foundation (CVLS). CBF would grant 100 percent of the contract proceeds
to CVLS, which pledges to match the value of the county’s contribution.
CBF proposed the lowest cost in conjunction with a Request for Proposal
process.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $179,287.00 (FY 2011 - $33,833.31; FY 2012 - $59,014.96; FY 2013 $60,794.09; and FY 2014 - $25,644.64). Contract period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2014. (310260 Account). Requisition No. 13100001.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
The Purchasing Agent met with the Transition Team today at 11 S. LaSalle, Suite 2400.
The meeting was conducted by Phil Maxwell, of Accenture and Matt Bailey of Accenture
joined us via conference call. The meeting focused on potential revenue opportunities to
be gained through procurement and the opportunity to consolidate purchases.
They discussed the agenda sent to me from the Office of President which included the
following: Lists of contract managed by Purchasing Agent/Contracts Managed by other
parts of the organization/Contract Management Section/Centralized & Decentralized
purchasing/Procurement Policies/Regulations on spending limits/categories/Overview of
approval procedures/Policies/Overview of technologies used for Procurement
Activities/Organizational Chart for Central Purchasing and Contact information for other
departments/Vendor Registration Process and Application.
Mr. Maxwell, requested a spend analysis by $dollars, commodities and departments.
They were advised that this analysis was completed in 2006 and 2007; however no
additional information is available. This project was a manual process and in 2008
several staffers were lost due to the hospital procurement section moving and therefore
completing this task was not the best utilization of the remaining staffer’s time. Scanned
charts will be forwarded to him on Monday.
Additionally, a staff person was also asked to meet with three individuals from the
transition team representing President-elect Preckwinkle today at 3 p.m. There were two
men present and one on a conference line. Two of the gentlemen stated that they
represented Accenture and were interested in discussing the requisition process in our
Purchasing department. They asked a variety of questions concerning processing of the
requisitions. They also asked about Countywide contracts, advertising for bids, legal
notices, and if it were possible to streamline any of these procedures. The Widgit model
was briefly discussed but they were told how the Purchasing Department has already
implemented a more efficient protocol.
A team met with the transition team on Tuesday, November 9, 2010. During the
meeting, the following were discussed:
- Overview of the department and structure
- Overview Revenue Collection and Home Rule Taxes Ordinances
- Collection, Compliance process and assessments
- Various business processes/functions that are performed
- Initiatives/major projects underway
- Automation, challenges and potential intergovernmental relationships with the
State and City
In addition to the Director, they also met with the Deputy, Manager of Compliance and
the Manager of Collections.
Comptroller:
The Comptroller has provided additional copies of audit reports which were received and
filed with the Audit Committee. The meeting set up for last Wednesday, November 10,
2010 was later canceled due their scheduling conflict. A meeting is anticipated with the
transition team this week.

Where a respondent who has requested an administrative hearing either fails to pay the indicated
fine prior to the hearing or appear at a hearing, a determination of parking or compliance violation
liability, as the case may be, shall be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the notice of violation.
Failure to pay the fine within 21 days of issuance of a determination of liability will result in the
imposition of a late payment penalty pursuant to subsection (e) herein. Upon the occurrence of a final
determination of liability, any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the county. The
county traffic compliance administrator will cause a notice of hearing providing this information to be
sent to the respondent in accordance with subsection (f) herein.
(d)
If no response is made in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, the county traffic
compliance administrator shall cause a second notice of violation to be sent to the respondent in
accordance with subsection (f) herein. The notice shall specify the date and location of the violation, the
make and state registration number of the cited vehicle, the code provision violated, the applicable fine,
and the time and manner in which the respondent may obtain an adjudication by mail or request a hearing
to contest the violation. If the respondent requests an administrative hearing to contest the cited violation,
the county traffic compliance administrator will cause a notice of hearing to be sent to the respondent as
provided in subsection (c) herein.
If the respondent fails to pay the indicated fine, submit documentary evidence to obtain an
adjudication by mail, or request a hearing to contest the charged violation within 14 days from the date of
such notice, or prove compliance as provided in subsection (7) of Section 82-178, a determination of
liability shall be entered in the amount of the fine indicated on the notice of violation. Failure to pay the
fine within 21 days of issuance of the determination of liability will result in the imposition of a late
payment penalty pursuant to subsection (e) herein. Upon the occurrence of a final determination of
liability, any unpaid fine or penalty will constitute a debt due and owing the county. The second notice of
violation shall provide the above information.
(e)
Failure by any respondent to pay the fine for a parking or compliance violation within 21
days of the issuance of the determination of liability will automatically subject the respondent to a penalty
for late payment. The penalty for late payment shall be an amount equal to the amount of the fine for the
relevant parking or compliance violation.
(f)
The county traffic compliance administrator shall serve the notice of hearing, the second
notice of violation, the administrative law officer's determination, the notice of final determination of
liability, and the notice of impending driver's license suspension, where applicable, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the county vehicle as recorded with the
Secretary of State of Illinois. If the vehicle is registered in a state other than Illinois, the county traffic
compliance administrator shall send the appropriate notice to the address of the registered owner as
recorded in such other state's registry of motor vehicles. In the event a mailing sent pursuant to this

section is returned as undeliverable, subsequent mailings may be sent to the address of the registered
owner of the vehicle as recorded with the United States Postal Service.

Office Expense - Secretary to the Board of Commissioners

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and
what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On November 8, 2010, it was determined that there were FY 2010 funds available to make
advance purchases of supplies and materials for FY 2011. Thirty days prior, the balance in
Account 018-397 was $90.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 018-224 was identified after the proposal from the proposed vendor for media archiving
came in lower than expected. Account 018-268 was identified after ensuring that the current
purchase order for our vendor would cover all costs for the FY 2011 budget process.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
For account 018-224, after factoring in all costs relative to media archiving and cable casting, and
ensuring that all obligations would be met, a surplus became available. For account 018-268, the
number of public hearings and special meetings requiring a court reporter was less than
anticipated, creating the available surplus.
_________________________

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved that the transfer of funds be
approved. The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
PROPOSED CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 9, 2010 from
JAMES M. HOULIHAN, Cook County Assessor

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
by
JOHN M. FALLON, Chief Deputy Assessor
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc. Chicago, Illinois, for publication of the state mandated publications as follows; proposed
assessed values for the 2011 real estate triennial assessment of the South Townships outside the city of
Chicago; revisions made to the 2011 triennial assessment in South Townships outside the city of Chicago,
after publication of the initial triennial assessment publication; 2011 triennial assessment list in additional
newspapers for additional public notification as directed by the Assessor's Office; revisions made to the
2011 real estate non-triennial assessment of North Townships outside the city of Chicago; and revisions
made as a consequence of the change in assessment practices to the 2010 real estate assessment of North
townships outside the city of Chicago.
Reason:

Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. has been the sole-source vendor for the publication of
Cook County's suburban townships assessment list since 2002. Prior to 2002, this same
entity published the assessment list for many years. During this time, prior to 2002, Cook
County Suburban Publishers, Inc. was the only vendor to submit a response when the annual
contract was sent out to bid. State statutes (35ILCS 200/12-20 and 715 ILCS 10/1 et seq.)
impose strict guidelines as to who may publish the assessment list for Cook County's
suburban townships. Therefore, due to the timely nature of publishing the assessment list, the
Assessor's Office requests that this contract be sole-sourced to Cook County Suburban
Publishers, Inc.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $597,441.28. Contract period: May 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012. (040-240
Account). Requisition No. 10400003.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2011 funds.
_________________________
In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved to suspend Section 2-108(h)(1) Prior
notice to public; agendas. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to defer consideration of the
proposed contract to the December 14, 2010 Board meeting. The motion to defer carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY
PURCHASE ORDER ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2010 from

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $8,140.00, Purchase Order No. 170901000-OP with Booth Hansen, Ltd., Chicago, Illinois, for the Countywide Exterior Wall Repair Project
at Cook County's Domestic Violence Courthouse for remedial repair work on the stone base.
Original Purchase Order amount approved 01-20-10:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$ 9,750.00
_8,140.00
$17,890.00

A change in scope is required to consolidate the exterior cleaning project with an interior
cleaning project, originally to be performed by the Department of Facilities Management. By
combining these projects, we were able to secure better pricing and greater efficiency. The
original interior granite wall was never sealed and a variety of staining is prevalent and must
be cleaned prior to sealing. The interior wall area closest to the roof line is stained due to a
water leak, which was unknown at the time the scope of work was being developed. This
work represents architectural and construction administration services. The water leak
solution will be addressed prior to all walls being cleaned. There is no expiration date on this
purchase order.

Estimated Fiscal Impact $8,140.00.
20000 County Physical Plant.
This item was included in the FY 2009 Capital Improvement Program approved by the Board of
Commissioners on April 2, 2009.
_________________________

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the County Purchasing Agent be
authorized to increase the requested purchase order. The motion carried unanimously.

CHANGE ORDERS
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 4, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of $36,582.00 to the contract
with NW Construction, LLC for the Exterior Wall Repair Project at the Cook County Domestic Violence
Courthouse. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order is a request for a twenty-one (21) day time extension and is
required for the following reasons: 1) Chemical cleaning must be added to remove
areas of heavy efflorescence. 2) The cleaning process will result in the removal of
the masonry stain and the re-application of a new stain. 3) A roof leak has caused
staining on the granite walls. The roof leak will be repaired and the granite will be
cleaned and sealed to prevent future staining.

Institute, Hektoen Building, Durand Building & Skybridge, Cook County Building and Provident
Hospital of Cook County Project. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this

Roof #1 to the elevator penthouse to Roof #3 at Provident Hospital of Cook County. Also,
included is the installation of a crossover walkway at the east end of Roof #5 to protect the
insulated pipes and allow for more efficient roof maintenance and safe passage.

Hospital of Cook County was completed under the Exterior Wall Repair Project before the
roofing project commenced.

CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 21, 2010 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $125,796.00 and extend for twelve (12)
months, Contract No. 09-84-08 with DDW & Associates/REB Storage System International, Chicago,
Illinois, for rental of shelving located at 1120 East 89th Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Board approved amount 02-04-09:
Previous increase approved 03-16-10:
This increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$125,796.00
94,347.00
125,796.00
$345,939.00

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process, and contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed, and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents, until space was made available at the Hawthorne Warehouse. If the contract
were to be rebid, the County would most likely incur additional cost increases for the
reconstruction of shelving and reloading of pallets. Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit
Court would experience delays in the retrieval and delivery of court documents during the
reconstruction of the shelving, and incur possible increases in labor costs needed for staff to
search for the location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction. Therefore, we believe

accounts 530-530 and 530-549 were was not funded in the FY 2010 budget; therefore the balances
were was zero throughout FY 2010.
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Funds allocated in account 530-441 will not be totally expended because the computer system is
presently being serviced internally and no longer by the vendor who initially had the proprietary
interest in the system.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
At the time the FY 2010 budget was developed, this computer equipment was in place and
budgeted for maintenance consistent with prior years. Thereafter, the agency learned that the
vendor could no longer support the system. Subsequent to the passage of the FY 2010 budget, the
Board of Commissioners authorized the purchase of a new system for which a new line item and
funding was identified.

PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 29, 2010 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for the purchase of six (6) 2011
Chevrolet Impalas.
These autos will be replacing vehicles that are over 8 years old and/or will be close to or exceeding
100,000 miles. The vehicles available on the countywide contract do not meet specifications suitable for
use in our office because the contract is tailored for the Sheriff's Office and includes police equipment.
One time purchase. (717/260-549 Account). Requisition No. 02600041.
This item was included in the FY2010 Capital Equipment Project approved by the Board of
Commissioners on November 19, 2009.
The Vehicle Steering Committee concurs with this recommendation.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 22, 2010 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $149,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below, to meet expenses required to complete our mission of protecting the
fundamental rights of our clients.
Reason:

An analysis of the Court Reporting, Expert Witness and Computer Operations accounts
indicates they are likely to exceed appropriated amounts. This is primarily due to the fact that
our caseload has been more complex requiring additional expertise in the mental health area
and lengthier transcripts.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On October 4, 2010 a review was conducted of each of the non-personnel line items.
Expert Witnesses: the balance was $127,222.00. The balance 30 days prior was $223,073.00.
Expert witness fees are a difficult thing to predict but this year our cases have been more complex
requiring additional experts in the area of mental health. In addition, historically, the number of
invoices increased as we get close to year end. For the month of October, our year-to-date spending
was over the year-to-date budget by $40,000.00. Based on spending year-to-date FY 2010 we
estimate the need for $100,000.00 to meet year end obligations.
Court Reporting: The balance was $107,864.00. The balance 30 days prior was $169,155.00.
Court reporting fees have increased in the last two years and the complexity of some of our cases
have necessitated lengthier transcripts. Based on year-to-date spending levels, we estimate the need
for $40,000.00 to meet year end obligations.
Computer Operation Supplies: The balance was $13,325.00. The balance 30 days prior was
$14,710.00 Based on current orders for computer cartridges we estimate the need for an additional
$4,000.00 to meet year-end obligations.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts were identified during the October 4, 2010 review of each of the non-personnel line
items. No other accounts were considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Training- the training budget was developed based on input from senior management as well as
expenditures in previous years. This year, the office was able to save approximately $20,000.00 in
hotel expense by holding two separate training programs on the same dates. In addition, the expense
for other training programs was lower than originally expected.
Postage- due to the increased use of email, our postage needs have been reduced.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
Professional Services- there is a slight surplus in this line item of $5,000.00.
Books, periodicals, etc.- in lieu of maintaining libraries in each of the locations, the office is
utilizing other paperless, computerized sources which are less expensive than ordering books.
Moving expenses & remodeling- this line item was increased from FY 2009 levels to accommodate
the needs of several new positions the office was allowed to fill in FY 2010. We were able to
accommodate the new positions without as much remodeling as anticipated.
Rental office equipment- we have a surplus in this line item because we are no longer renting water
coolers at our various locations. In addition, we were anticipating an increase to our postage meter
expense from Pitney Bowes but this did not materialize.
_________________________
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.

Commissioners of the Board of Review
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $5,000.00 from and to the
accounts listed below for office supplies.
Reason:

The Board of Review has used all of its allotted office supply funds for xerox paper, toner
cartridges, storage file boxes, file carts, Property Tax Appeal Board (PTAB) file folders and
other miscellaneous office supplies due to the large filing volume of appeals.

From Account:
050-190

050-353
050-440

Transportation and Other Travel Expenses for Employees
Transportation for Specific Activities and Purposes

Total

$1,000.00
500.00
1,800.00
1,700.00
$5,000.00

To Account:
050-350
1.

Office Supplies

$5,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On October 15, 2010 the account balance was $838.00. Thirty days prior the account balance was
$10,031.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The accounts chosen to transfer from were the only accounts in the budget which have funds
available that are not as critical to our operations.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR NOVEMBER 16, 2010
None.
4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
In accounts 050-190 and 050-217 the anticipated amount funded was not spent because our field
employees went on fewer site inspections and the majority of the PTAB hearings were done
locally. Also, as the year progressed with the reevaluation of operations and the use of technology;
less funds were needed for (050-353) Data Services, and in the middle of the year we had our
maintenance contract updated to include all of our time stamp machines; which reduced our
maintenance and repair charges.
_________________________

Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.
