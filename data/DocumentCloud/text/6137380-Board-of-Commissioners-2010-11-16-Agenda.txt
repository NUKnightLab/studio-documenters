AMENDED
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 9, 2010 from
PETER N. SILVESTRI, County Commissioner
Pursuant to Cook County Code Section 2-105(j) Discharge of committee by the Board, I hereby request
that an item submitted to the Board by the Office of the Chief Judge, which was referred to the Litigation
Subcommittee on November 3, 2010 be discharged from committee, and further request that the Board
take action on this item.
309525

Transmitting a Communication, dated September 14, 2010 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the
Chicago Bar Foundation (CBF), Chicago, Illinois, to manage the court’s Guardianship
Assistance Desk for Minors.
Reason:

The Guardianship Assistance Desk for Minors, located on the tenth floor of
the George W. Dunne Administration Building, provides critical assistance to
individuals who represent themselves in court in seeking to obtain the
guardianship of minors in the Probate Division of the Circuit Court of Cook
County.
Services include assessment of client’s eligibility to seek
guardianship, explanation of court procedures and assistance with completing
court forms and documents. The desk has provided assistance to thousands of
pro-se guardianship litigants over the past many years. The desk is staffed
with court personnel and off site legal assistance is provided by attorneys
from CBF’s program partner, the Chicago Volunteer Legal Services
Foundation (CVLS). CBF would grant 100 percent of the contract proceeds
to CVLS, which pledges to match the value of the county’s contribution.
CBF proposed the lowest cost in conjunction with a Request for Proposal
process.

1.

Office Expense - Secretary to the Board of Commissioners

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and
what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On November 8, 2010, it was determined that there were FY 2010 funds available to make
advance purchases of supplies and materials for FY 2011. Thirty days prior, the balance in
Account 018-397 was $90.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 018-224 was identified after the proposal from the proposed vendor for media archiving
came in lower than expected. Account 018-268 was identified after ensuring that the current
purchase order for our vendor would cover all costs for the FY 2011 budget process.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred.
None.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
For account 018-224, after factoring in all costs relative to media archiving and cable casting, and
ensuring that all obligations would be met, a surplus became available. For account 018-268, the
number of public hearings and special meetings requiring a court reporter was less than
anticipated, creating the available surplus.

Expert witness fees are a difficult thing to predict but this year our cases have been more complex
requiring additional experts in the area of mental health. In addition, historically, the number of
invoices increased as we get close to year end. For the month of October, our year-to-date spending
was over the year-to-date budget by $40,000.00. Based on spending year-to-date FY 2010 we

Training- the training budget was developed based on input from senior management as well as
expenditures in previous years. This year, the office was able to save approximately $20,000.00 in
hotel expense by holding two separate training programs on the same dates. In addition, the expense
for other training programs was lower than originally expected.
Postage- due to the increased use of email, our postage needs have been reduced.
Professional Services- there is a slight surplus in this line item of $5,000.00.
Books, periodicals, etc.- in lieu of maintaining libraries in each of the locations, the office is
utilizing other paperless, computerized sources which are less expensive than ordering books.
Moving expenses & remodeling- this line item was increased from FY 2009 levels to accommodate
the needs of several new positions the office was allowed to fill in FY 2010. We were able to
accommodate the new positions without as much remodeling as anticipated.
Rental office equipment- we have a surplus in this line item because we are no longer renting water
coolers at our various locations. In addition, we were anticipating an increase to our postage meter
expense from Pitney Bowes but this did not materialize.

Reason:

$ 9,750.00
_8,140.00
$17,890.00

A change in scope is required to consolidate the exterior cleaning project with an interior
cleaning project, originally to be performed by the Department of Facilities Management. By
combining these projects, we were able to secure better pricing and greater efficiency. The
original interior granite wall was never sealed and a variety of staining is prevalent and must
be cleaned prior to sealing. The interior wall area closest to the roof line is stained due to a
water leak, which was unknown at the time the scope of work was being developed. This
work represents architectural and construction administration services. The water leak
solution will be addressed prior to all walls being cleaned. There is no expiration date on this
purchase order.

Estimated Fiscal Impact $8,140.00.

Commissioners of the Board of Review
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $5,000.00 from and to the

Reason:

other miscellaneous office supplies due to the large filing volume of appeals.

From Account:

$5,000.00

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On October 15, 2010 the account balance was $838.00. Thirty days prior the account balance was

available that are not as critical to our operations.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
In accounts 050-190 and 050-217 the anticipated amount funded was not spent because our field
employees went on fewer site inspections and the majority of the PTAB hearings were done
locally. Also, as the year progressed with the reevaluation of operations and the use of technology;
less funds were needed for (050-353) Data Services, and in the middle of the year we had our
maintenance contract updated to include all of our time stamp machines; which reduced our
maintenance and repair charges.

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT continued
CONTRACT ADDENDUM continued
ITEM #58 cont’d
Reason:

DDW & Associates/REB Storage Systems International was selected from two (2) vendor
bids received through the open market bid process, and contract for the rental of shelving was
approved by the County Board on February 4, 2009. The vendor designed, installed, and
anchored the shelving to the 89th Street warehouse floor. The temporary storage shelving
system was needed by the Clerk of the Circuit Court to maintain a total of 3,072 pallets of
court documents, until space was made available at the Hawthorne Warehouse. If the contract
were to be rebid, the County would most likely incur additional cost increases for the
reconstruction of shelving and reloading of pallets. Additionally, the Clerk of the Circuit
Court would experience delays in the retrieval and delivery of court documents during the
reconstruction of the shelving, and incur possible increases in labor costs needed for staff to
search for the location of pallets/documents during the reconstruction. Therefore, we believe
that it is more cost effective, and efficient to retain the expertise and services of the current
vendor until the Hawthorne Warehouse space is ready for permanent occupancy. The
expiration date of the current contract is December 15, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $125,796.00. Contract extension: December 16, 2010 through December 15,
2011. (529-660 Account).
Sufficient funds are available in the Clerk of the Circuit Court Document Storage Fund.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
