STAFF REPORT 10-09-2019 REGULAR MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER: 19-6477
ADDRESS: 19512 CANTERBURY ROAD
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SHERWOOD FOREST
APPLICANT: ADAM BLANCK, WALLSIDE WINDOWS
DATE OF COMPLETE APPLICATION: 09-17-2019
STAFF SITE VISIT: 10-02-2019

PREPARED BY: A. PHILLIPS

SCOPE: REPLACE EXISTING WOOD WINDOWS WITH VINYL WINDOWS
EXISTING CONDITIONS
The building located at 19512 Canterbury Road is a 2½-story single-family residence constructed in 1924. The house
is clad in variegated brown brick and stucco and features wood shutters and cast stone detailing. The asymmetrical
front façade includes a large chimney and a substantial covered entry porch constructed of brick with a gable roof
located toward the right side of the elevation. The original wood with leaded pane windows, of varying operation
(casement, double-hung, fixed) appear to be intact and the majority are protected by aluminum storm windows. The
multi-gable roof is covered in brown asphalt shingles. The garage is located at the rear of the house and is accessed
via the driveway located directly south of the house.

PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to replace all (22) existing wood
windows with vinyl windows per the attached drawings and application.
STAFF OBSERVATIONS & RESEARCH
• The windows appear to be in good condition

 ISSUES
• The contract included in the application lists existing leaded-panel casement windows as “sliders” and is
proposing to replace with vinyl sliders.
• Applicant is not proposing replacement due to deterioration and therefore did not provide documentation
regarding the level of deterioration of the existing windows.
• Applicant did provide one estimate for repair but was unable to obtain a second estimate. According to the
applicant, the company that provided the estimate for repair stated that it appeared as though the windows
simply needed to be repainted rather than replaced.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the work, as proposed, destroys historic materials that characterize the historic building, its
site, and setting. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission deny a Certificate of Appropriateness as the
proposed work does not meet the following Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation:
2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
5) Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
property shall be preserved.
6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual
qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence.
9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

REPORT

WE CAN DO THAT. WE ARE THE THE LEADER IN REPLACEMENT WINDOWS

 

September 17, 2019
To Whom it may concern;

Darryl Clark of 19512 Canterbury Rd Detroit, MI 48221 would like to replace
his older existing wood windows that have very little energr efficiency qualities
to a top grade vinyl Wallside Windows with premium grade glass which will
make the home much more energy efficient.

Current windows are wood are being replaced with vinyl. They wish to keep all
windows same style for style including the grid count for each window.

Wallside Window will be installing
- (18) double hung (oriel) vinyl replacement windows
a (4) double hung vinyl replacement windows

Mr. Clark would like to replace his wood windows due to the windows are
starting to break down and let in a lot of air which becomes difficult to heat
and cool properly, he currently keeps windows covered with plastic to assist in
the situation. He feels that refurbishing the existing wood windows still won?t
be as energy efficient as replacing with new vinyl windows due to the fact that
refurbishing doesn?t replace the glass but just repairs the wood frame.

Mr. Clark is submitting for historical approval for all the windows listed on the
contract but is willing to refurbish the windows that are not approved.

If you have any further questions please feel free to call Wallside Windows at:
313-292-4400

Sec. 21-2-178. - Sherwood Forest Historic District.
(a)

An historic district to be known as the Sherwood Forest Historic District is hereby established
in accordance with the provisions of this article.

(b)

This historic district designation is hereby certified as being consistent with the Detroit
Master Plan of Policies.

(c)

The boundaries of the Sherwood Forest Historic District, as shown on the map on file in the
Office of the City Clerk, are as follows:

On the north, a line described as follows: Beginning at the intersection of the center line of
Pembroke Road and the north-south alley running east of and parallel to Livernois Avenue, and
proceeding easterly along said center line of Pembroke Road to its intersection with that easterly
boundary of Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision (Liber 39, Page 11) which forms the rear lines of Lots
38—47 of said subdivision; thence south along said easterly boundary to its intersection with that
northerly boundary of Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision which forms the rear lines of Lots 49—53 of
said subdivision; thence easterly along said northerly boundary to its intersection with the western
boundary of the Palmer Woods Subdivision (Liber 32, Page 16); on the east, the western boundary of
the Palmer Woods Subdivision; on the south, the center line of Seven Mile Road; and on the west, a line
described as: Beginning at the intersection of the center line of the north south alley running east of
and parallel to Livernois Avenue and west of Warrington Drive and the center line of Pembroke Road,
thence southerly along the center line of said alley to its intersection with the south line, extended east
and west, of Lot 244, Sherwood Forest Subdivision (Liber 59, Page 17), thence east along said line as
extended to its intersection with the center line of Warrington Drive, thence south along the center line
of Warrington Drive to its intersection with the center line of Seven Mile Road. (Legal Description: Lots 1
—179 and Lots 244—485 of the Sherwood Forest Subdivision of the southwest quarter of Section 3,
T.1S., R.11E (Liber 39, Page 11, W.C.R.) and Lots 1—63 of the Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision of part
of the east half of the southwest quarter of Section 3, T.1S., R.11E (Liber 59, page 17, W.C.R.).)
(d)

The elements of design, as defined in Section 21-2-2 of this Code, shall be as follows:
(1)

Height. The height of the majority of residential structures are full stories to 2½ stories
tall, and have at least 18 feet of studding. These standards shall be met by new singlefamily residences, and by two-family residences, which are permitted only on Seven
Mile Road. A few houses of one and 1½ stories exist. Additions to existing buildings shall
be related to the existing structure. Garages range from one to two stories.

(2)

Proportion of buildings' front façades. The typical front façades of residential buildings
in the Sherwood Forest Historic District are predominantly wider than tall to their eaves.

(3)

Proportion of openings within the façades. Proportion of openings varies greatly
according to the style of the building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but
individual windows are often grouped together to fill a single opening which is wider
than tall. Windows are usually subdivided; buildings designed in English Revival styles

 frequently display leaded glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings
derived from Classical precedents, double-hung sash windows are further subdivided
by muntins. A variety of arched openings and bay windows exist throughout the district.
Modernistic style residential buildings have openings with a variety of proportional
relationships, sometimes extending around the corners. In general, openings amount to
between 20 percent and 35 percent of the front façades.
(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front façades. In buildings derived from Classical
precedents, voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner
within the façades. In examples of other styles, particularly those of English Revival substyles, voids are arranged with more freedom, but usually result in balanced
compositions. Windows are arranged by floor in asymmetrical arrangements in
Modernistic style houses.

(5)

Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally
determined by the lot sizes and setbacks from side lot lines. There is a general
regularity in the widths of subdivision lots from one block to another, with the
exception of those in the Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision where some lot sizes are
larger and single houses sometimes occupy more than one lot. Generally, all residences
or part thereof, including cornices, balconies, pergolas or porches, are not permitted
nearer than five feet to the side lot line.

(6)

Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance and porch types relate to the
style of the building. Entrances and porches on the English Revival buildings exhibit
freedom of placement and orientation, while on buildings of Classical inspiration, they
are centered on the front façade. Some houses have entrances that recede while others
have porches, steps and/or entrances that project. A common entry arrangement on
vernacular English Revival houses is that of a slightly projecting, steeply-gabled vestibule
or gabled wall punctured with an arched opening. Side and rear secondary entrances
and porches, and enclosed sunrooms, are common. A rhythm of entrances and porches
is not discerned due to the variety of house designs and the winding street plan.

(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with pressed, wire cut or
glazed brick, often combined with wood, stone and/or stucco. Stone trim is common,
and wood is almost universally used for window frames, half-timbering, and other
functional trim. Windows are commonly either of the metal casement or wooden sash
variety. Glass block exists as an original material in some window openings of modern
buildings. Original metal balconets, balustrades, and light fixtures exist on some
properties. Roofs on the majority of the buildings in the Sherwood Forest Historic
District are either slate or slate-like asphalt shingles.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar,
often juxtaposed with wood, or with smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone

 elements and trim. Textured brick and brick laid in patterns creates considerable
interest, as does half-timbering, leaded and subdivided windows, and wood-shingled or
horizontal-sided elements. Slate roofs have particular textural values where they exist.
Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even in those types which purport
to imitate natural materials. Garages correspond in materials to the main residential
dwelling.
(9)

Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors, such as red, yellow, brown, or buff,
predominate in wall surfaces. When brick is painted, it is in white or shades of cream.
Natural stone colors also predominate; where stucco or concrete exists, it usually
remains in its natural state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural slate
colors, and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint
colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly
those of Classical styles, generally have woodwork painted in the white or cream range.
English Revival style buildings generally have painted wood trim and window frames of
dark brown, gray, buff or shades of cream, depending on the main body color. Half
timbering is most frequently stained or painted dark brown. Stained glass, where it
exists as decoration visible on the front façade, contributes to the artistic interest of the
building. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are
always acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar houses. Colors
used on garages should relate to the colors of the main dwelling.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each
structure generally relate to its style. Residential buildings derived from characteristic
elements and details displayed on vernacular English Revival-influenced buildings
include arched windows and door openings, steeply pitched gables, towers, and
sometimes half-timbering. Tall, clustered chimney stacks and decorative chimney pots
are features of the district. Classical styles display modest detail, mostly in wood.
Porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly,
although not always, treated. Modern style buildings are generally characterized by
smooth, unadorned wall surfaces, horizontal bands of windows, and curved corners. A
few Cape Cod style buildings and ranches are located in the northeastern section of the
Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision. In general, the district is rich in early to mid 20th
Century architectural styles. Garages correspond in architecture to the main residential
dwelling.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exists, relating to the style of the
buildings. Common on English Revival buildings are steeply sloped pitched or hipped
roofs with complex arrangements of secondary roof shapes, including steeply sloped
gables, clipped gables, and shed roofs. These roofs are commonly interrupted by
gabled, shed and multi-sided dormers and substantial chimneys which are sometimes

 clustered. Classically-inspired buildings display pitched or hipped roofs with less slope,
with or without dormers. Roofs of houses built later in the period of development of the
district, such as those of Modern inspiration, tend to have significantly lower slopes,
with the exception of Cape Cod style houses in the northeastern section of the district
which display steeply-pitched roofs with dormers. Flat roofs are not typical except on
porches, sunrooms, and other small extensions of a primary building with a pitched
roof; flat roofs as the main roof of a primary building shall not be permitted.
(12)

Walls of continuity. Where common setbacks of houses on relatively straight stretches
of residential streets exist, strong walls of continuity are created. This is augmented by
tall, fluted light standards and mature trees on the tree lawns. Where streets curve and
the procession of houses is less visible, landscape features in the public right-of-way
create a sense of continuity.

(13)

Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical
treatment of individual properties is that of a dwelling erected on a grade of
approximately 15 to 20 inches above the inner grade line of the public sidewalk. The
front lawn area is generally covered with grass turf, subdivided by a straight or curving
concrete, stone, or brick walk leading to the front entrance and a single width side
driveway leading to a garage, which is most often located at the rear of the lot but
sometimes attached to the rear, side, or, less frequently, the front of the main dwelling.
On corner lots, garages are located on the side streets and the width of the driveway
corresponds to the width of the garage. A single storage building, including garden and
tool sheds, shall be permitted, provided, that it is placed at the rear of the property, is
harmonious in color and design to the contiguous property, does not exceed six feet by
ten feet in length and width, and six feet in height. Foundation plantings, often of a
deciduous nature and characteristic of the period between 1920 and 1960, are present
virtually without exception. Large trees of many varieties shield some houses from view.
There is variety in the landscape treatment of individual properties. Generally,
boundary lines between lots forward of the building line are not marked with fences of
any kind, but may have hedges no greater than two feet in height. Hedges and fences of
up to four feet in height generally extend along boundary lines beyond the building line.
On lots abutting the alley behind Warrington Drive and Livernois Avenue, a tight board
fence or masonry wall of a uniform height of five feet must be constructed on rear lot
lines. The placement of trees on the tree lawn between the concrete public sidewalk
and masonry curb varies from block to block or street to street. Replacement trees
should be characteristic of the area and period. If an American elm is planted, it should
be disease resistant. Original street lighting throughout the district is of the tall fluted
standard with crane neck pendant variety.

(14)

Relationship of open space to structures. The Sherwood Forest Historic District has, as

 its main open space, the triangularly shaped Sherwood Forest Park, bounded by
Warrington Drive, Saint Martins Road, and Canterbury Roads. That park, as well as other
triangular lots created between the intersection of winding streets, are planted with
grass and trees. All houses have ample rear yards as well as front yards. Where vacant
lots exist between residences, their landscaping tends to be continuous with the
adjacent lots or forested with mature trees.
(15)

Scale of façades and façade elements. The Sherwood Forest Historic District comprises
a residential neighborhood of moderate- to large-scaled dwellings. Elements and details
within are appropriately scaled, having been determined by the style, size and
complexity of the individual buildings; window sashes are usually subdivided by
muntins and casement windows are leaded, affecting the apparent scale of the
windows within the façades.

(16)

Directional expression of front elevations. The houses in the Sherwood Forest Historic
District are horizontal in directional expression. Large architectural elements within
façades are frequently vertical in directional expression, such as multi-storied projecting
gabled sections.

(17)

Rhythm of building setbacks. Front yard setbacks are generally consistent on each
residential street in the Sherwood Forest Historic District, although porch, entrance and
window projections and irregular massing result in the appearance of variety. Where
lots are combined or irregularly shaped at corners, the rhythm is sometimes irregular.

(18)

Relationship of lot coverages. The lot coverage for the single- and two-family residences
ranges generally from 25 percent to 35 percent, including either the freestanding or
attached garage. Where lots are combined, the percentage of lot coverage may be less.

(19)

Degree of complexity within the façades. The degree of complexity has been
determined by what is typical and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher
degree of complexity in the English Revival style buildings, where their façades are
frequently complicated by gables, bays, irregularly placed openings and entrances, and
irregular massing, than those of other styles. The façades of Classically-inspired
buildings and Modernistic buildings are straightforward in their arrangement of
elements and details.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. The orientation of buildings is largely determined by the
winding streets created by the subdivision plans. All, but a few, buildings in the district
are oriented towards the street; buildings situated on corner lots sometimes face the
side street or, when the corner lot is curved, the intersection of the streets. The primary
vistas are created by the winding streets. Sherwood Forest Manor Subdivision has a
different character because of its later development and the elliptical shape of its plan.

 While the streets through Sherwood Forest Historic District extend into the Green Acres
Subdivision on the north, they do not extend into the Palmer Woods Subdivision on the
east.
(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front façades of buildings range from
completely symmetrical to asymmetrical, but balanced, compositions. English Revival
style buildings are irregular in layout and asymmetrical in appearance. The Classicallyinspired buildings are generally symmetrical; the Modernistic buildings are not
symmetrical but result in highly ordered compositions.

(22)

General environmental character. The Sherwood Forest Historic District is a fullydeveloped residential area of well-maintained, substantial single-family residences of
the second quarter of the 20th Century complemented with fine examples of
compatible houses from the 1950s and 1960s. On Seven Mile Road, its southern
boundary, are several duplexes; the east side of Livernois Avenue, outside the district's
boundaries to the west, is an intact commercial thoroughfare of 1940s vintage. With the
residential subdivisions of Palmer Woods to the east and Green Acres to north,
Sherwood Forest is a part of a solid, well-maintained, and handsome urban residential
community.
