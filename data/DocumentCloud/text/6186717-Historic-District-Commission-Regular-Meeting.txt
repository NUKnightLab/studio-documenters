STAFF REPORT 7-10-2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6212
ADDRESS: 1441 WOODWARD AVENUE
HISTORIC DISTRICT: LOWER WOODWARD AVENUE
APPLICANT: M1/DTW LLC
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 07-05-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
1441 Woodward Avenue is a storefront that operates on the ground floor of a six-story commercial
building in the Lower Woodward Avenue Historic District. It is the center of the three ground floor bays
inside the 1437 Woodward building, built in 1886 by William G. Malcomson as a furniture warehouse.
Many of the original cast iron façade elements on the first three floors were replaced around 1958 with
corrugated aluminum siding. The ground floor pilasters are made of stone inlay panels. In 2004, the
building was completely rehabbed as part of the Lofts at Merchant Row project, and the storefront
systems were updated. The building has maintained it’s original façade elements on floors 4-6.
With the current proposal, the applicant seeks to remove the non-historic storefront windows and lower
stone knee wall panel, leaving the top and side framing in place. The applicant wishes to replace these
elements with a new storefront system that will allow the window sill to be lowered to the street level
for a full view inside the business. The new tenant, 6 Salon, seeks to “maintain a clear relationship to the
street,” “increase visibility and activity to enliven the street,” and gain “as much natural light as possible
during the day; lantern effect at night.”
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following
work associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building as per the following project description:
Non-Historic Storefront Window Replacement
• Remove existing storefront windows, leaving top and side framing in place
• Remove lower stone knee wall inlay panel (under existing storefront windows)

• Manufacturer: Old Castle Building Envelope,
o Standard -NS-212 Door and Frame
o Black 760 Finish
o Insulated Glass

 ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(2)
Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on the size
of the building, its period of construction, and its style. All of the individual buildings that
contribute to the district are taller than wide but, when taken as a whole, result in an unbroken,
continuous commercial streetscape. Where individual buildings are connected to adjacent
buildings at the lower levels, the proportional relationship of the facades is altered, resulting in
the impression that the combined buildings appear wider than tall at the lower levels. Where
buildings occur on corner lots, their visible side elevations may appear wider than tall.
(3)

Proportion of openings within the facades. Large, square storefront windows and entrance bays
line the ground floor of most buildings although many are covered with temporary boards,
metal guards or gates, masking their visibility. Individual window units above the ground floor
are usually taller than wide but are frequently grouped in openings that are as tall as wide or
wider than tall. Typical groupings include the “Chicago-style” window composed of a large
central light between two narrower lights, rows of two or three similarly sized windows, and
pairs of windows. Openings containing more than three window units also exist. Transom
windows above both single and grouped windows, as well as storefront windows, are common.
Groupings in arched configurations exist at the upper floors or mezzanine level of some of the
older buildings in the district. Double-hung sash are prevalent, with pivot windows and other
single-paned types present. Windows are frequently subdivided by muntins. Non-original
materials on the facades, where they exist, often obscure the original proportions of openings
within the facades. Consequently, areas of voids are approximate, and originally ranged from
approximately one-third to two-thirds of the front facade areas of contributing buildings.

(4)

Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. Openings within the facades are generally regularly
arranged, horizontally by floor and vertically by bay, due to the classical stylistic derivation of
most of the buildings and their steel frame and curtain wall construction.

(7)

Relationship of materials. Building materials common to exterior surfaces in the district are
limestone, brownstone, brick, cast iron and terra-cotta. Wood, cast iron, and steel surround
windows, and metal spandrels are common. Modernizations tended to be in stainless steel,
enameled or porcelain steel, granite, glass and steel. Metal fire escapes and decorative window
grates are visible on some side elevations.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The low relief pattern of mortar joints in brick juxtaposed with
smooth masonry trim, where it exists, provides textural interest. Glazed brick, glazed terra
cotta, and large glass surfaces are smooth in texture. Carved and/or molded repetitive
ornamental detail in terra cotta or masonry contrasts with the surface material, providing a high
degree of textural interest. Subdivided windows, patterned spandrels, and cornices with
repetitive detail, where they still exist, are often areas of textural interest. In general, the
district is rich in textural relationships.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to architectural
styles. Late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings exhibit roman arches, cartouches,
fluted pilasters, rosettes and other classically derived details. Cornices, where they still exist,
are richly ornamented with brackets and trim; where cornices have been removed, plain
surfaces have replaced them. Other areas of the facade frequently ornamented are spandrels
beneath windows and between arches, tops of pilasters, and string courses. Storefronts
typically have apron walls and transoms.

 (15)

Scale of facades and facade elements. Individual building facades range from small in scale to
large, with the majority being in the moderate range. Details within individual facades range
from small to moderate in scale; the repetition of small scale detail is common. Signage is
often placed above the ground floor storefront windows, often in a panel designed for such
purpose, and is large in scale.

(21)

Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Most buildings were originally symmetrical in
appearance above the first floor. Many were symmetrical on the first floor as well, depending
on the position and number of storefront entrances. Multiple changes to the storefronts have
resulted in the creation of increased asymmetry on the lower levels.

(22)

General environmental character. The Lower Woodward Historic District is an architecturally
significant, urban-scaled, late-nineteenth and early twentieth century commercial streetscape
that, despite modernizations over time, remains intact. It represents a continuum of Detroit
retailing history that maintains a unique sense of place as Detroit’s main street. It also serves
as a link between the Theater District and the Financial District.

RECOMMENDATION
The proposed replacement of the storefront façade appears to be appropriate because the work does not
destroy any historic materials that characterize the property. The proposed design of the storefront façade and
door way is consistent in style with other commercial storefronts within the same block, sans knee wall and
glazing that extends to the street.
It is staff’s recommendation that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work
based on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 9) New additions, exterior
alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

THE SPARKLE OF
STARPHIRE
ULTRA-CLEAR
GLASS

STARPHIRE
ULTRA-CLEAR GLASS
Building designs that incorporate PPG Starphire glass from Vitrum have an unmistakably clear goal: To
provide a signature element that seamlessly blends the structural and environmental surroundings together.
Because Starphire is available in thicknesses up to one inch and provides the highest level of transparency in
the industry, it has been the glass of choice for iconic structures across the country. Starphire low iron glass
can have as little as 10% of the iron content of regular glass, allowing it to transmit 91% of light, compared to
83% for regular glass. Building designers and occupants are rewarded with a clearer viewer and exceptional
visible light.
Starphire is designed for a wide variety of interior and exterior applications, including storefronts, entrances,
skylights, interior partitions and back painted glass products. The ultra-transparency of Starphire glass
provides truer colours when applying paint or using coloured laminate interlayer’s.
When beauty, clarity and functionality are the cornerstone of your design vision, accept no substitutes and
choose Starphire ultra clear glass.

M1/DTW
M1/DTW LLC

Starphire Ultra-Clear Glass is the industry’s most transparent glass, thanks to a proprietary glass formulation and
manufacturing process that gives this extraordinary product a jewel-like blue-edge not available from any other
commercial glass product.
Starphire glass brings more light into interior spaces and provides the industry’s most neutral glass product to
laminate or paint. Providing designers and building occupants unmatched levels of brightness, colour fidelity, clarity
and visual excitement. It’s glass in high-definition.
Through Vitrum’s partnership with PPG Glass we are able to exclusively offer 25 mm (1 inch) Starphire Glass to the
Canadian market. No other glass fabricator in Canada has this product or the ability to fabricate it. Vitrums 25 mm
Starphire glass is an ideal choice for railings, canopies, point-supported glazing systems, counter-tops and furniture.
To learn more about Starphire Ultra-Clear glass and it’s unique “blue-edge” clarity, contact Vitrum at 1.888.391.1166
or visit www.vitrum.ca.

The clarity of Starphire Ultra-Clear glass from Vitrum actually becomes
more apparent as the glass gets thicker and longer, maintaining a
pleasing aesthetic. The chart below illustrates how the thickness of
the glass can affect the greenish hue of traditional clear float glass in
comparison to Starphire glass.

Recommended Inspection Procedures
6 Salon Detroit

KC

Building managers and owners should have an
engineer or other qualified person inspect the
cleaning and maintenance of anodized or
painted finishes.
• It is important to check metal seams, sills,
crevices and other areas that can trap dirt,
cleaner or water, to be sure they are clean
and dry.

PROJECT

DATE

1901

04/26/2019

• It is recommended that a final inspection be
made to verify that no stains or discoloration
remain on surfaces.

Cleaning, Care and Maintenance of
Anodized Finishes
Architectural aluminum finishes, whether painted
or anodized, require care before and during
installation and periodic maintenance after
installation. Although resistant to corrosion,
discoloration and general wear, both types of
finishes can be damaged by neglect, abuse and
harsh chemicals. Also, exterior surfaces collect
various amounts of dirt and soil—of course, the
amount depends on the environmental conditions,
the building elevation and the type of finish.
