planning process to ensure there is a framework for
allowing input during the public involvement process.

 About the Public Involvement Framework
• Meetings are not the only form of public
involvement – it’s just a piece of it;
• The community needs a body of
communication that’s emotionally
charged;
• Frame information so people want to
collaborate;
• Educate the public behind the need not
the want;
• Overall we want the community to be
advocates for the project.

 • Credible means to achieve community buy-in;
• Transparency and high visibility of process;
• Be humble in our approaches;
• Let the community take credit for decision-making.
