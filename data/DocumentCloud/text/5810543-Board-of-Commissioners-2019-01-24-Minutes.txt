PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TREATMENT OF
TRANSGENDER, GENDER NON-CONFORMING, AND INTERSEX INDIVIDUALS
WHEREAS, the Trump administration and the Department of Health and Human Services is considering
narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth; and
WHEREAS, the Trump administration has banned transgender and gender non-conforming individuals
from serving in the United States military; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has been informed of this by Commissioner Kevin
B. Morrison and LGBTQ advocates; and
WHEREAS, Commissioner Kevin B. Morrison and LGBTQ advocates see this effort as a hateful attempt
to roll back recognition and protections of transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex people; and
WHEREAS, this proposed definition by the Department of Health and Human Services would essentially
eradicate federal recognition of the estimated 1.4 million Americans who identify as a gender other than
the one they were assigned at birth; and
WHEREAS, this proposed definition would erase children who are born with intersex conditions, which
is about 1.7 percent of the population, having been born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't
fit the typical definitions of female or male; and
WHEREAS, this position makes irrelevant and discounts what transgender, gender non-conforming and
intersex people understand about themselves and discounts what medical providers know and understand
about their transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex patients; and
WHEREAS, this redefining would force genetic testing to resolve any dispute, denying transgender and
gender non-conforming individuals their autonomy and humanity; and
WHEREAS, children born with intersex conditions often have male and female genitalia that do not fit the
Trump administration’s proposed definitions; and
WHEREAS, the Trump administration has already attempted to bar transgender people from serving in
the military; and

13

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

January 24, 2019

WHEREAS, the Trump administration’s ban on military service by transgender and gender nonconforming
individuals does not recognize the incredible sacrifice and service of as many as 15,000 transgender and
gender non-conforming troops that are already serving and would be forced to either conceal their gender
identity or face discharge; and
WHEREAS, the Trump administration’s ban on military service by transgender and gender nonconforming
individuals keeps talented and willing individuals out of the military based on a discriminatory policy; and
WHEREAS, Cook County is affirming and welcoming of all individuals to self-identify; and
WHEREAS, Cook County stands with the transgender, gender non-conforming, and intersex community
and affirms that intersex, gender non-conforming, and transgender people #WontBeErased; and
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that we, the Cook County Board President and Cook County Board
of Commissioners do hereby honor the identities of transgender, gender non-conforming and intersex
people, celebrate them, affirm their lives and call on President Trump and the Department of Health and
Human Services to stop any attempt to narrowly define gender as biological; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this resolution are presented to President Donald
J. Trump, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II, and Acting Secretary of Defense
Patrick M. Shanahan.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE TONI PRECKWINKLE,
PRESIDENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
CELEBRATING THE 188TH ANNIVERSARY OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS AND
APPOINTING A LOCAL HISTORIAN FOR COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County was founded by an act of the Illinois legislature on January 15, 1831; and
WHEREAS, originally part of the commonwealth of Virginia, the area which comprises modern day Cook
County was also part of the Northwest Territory and then a part of 10 separate counties as the territory was
formed into states, including Illinois. The 10 counties are Knox (1790), St. Clair (1801), Madison (1812),
Edwards (1814), Crawford (1816), Clark (1819), Pike (1819), Fulton (1823), Peoria (1825), Putnam (1826);
and
WHEREAS, when formed in 1831, Cook County’s original boundaries included all of McHenry, Lake,
DuPage and parts of Kane and Will. The other counties were separately created between 1836 and 1839,
leading to Cook County’s current boundaries; and

19

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

January 24, 2019

WHEREAS, Cook County was named for Daniel Pope Cook (1794 - October 16, 1827). Originally from
Kentucky, Cook moved to Illinois and became a lawyer, newspaper publisher, politician and one of the
early advocates of statehood for Illinois. An anti-slavery advocate, he was the state's first Attorney General,
and then congressman. Cook County, Illinois is named after him. It is believed Cook never visited the area
which would be named in his honor; and
WHEREAS, the first Cook County Board of Commissioners was elected on March 7, 1831, taking office
and holding their first meeting the following day. Three (3) Commissioners-Gholson Kercheval, Samuel
Miller and James Walker convened a meeting at Fort Dearborn on the Chicago Settlement lakeshore, in the
magazine (powder room). The first County Board meeting would last for two (2) days; and
WHEREAS, also elected on March 7th were James Kinsey, Sheriff and John K. Clark, Coroner; William
See, County Clerk, Archibald Clybourn, County Treasurer were appointed March 8th and Jededah Wooley
was recommended as County Surveyor to the Governor and Legislature; and
WHEREAS, one of the first acts of the new board was approval of a resolution asking Illinois for 10 acres
of land including the corner of Clark and Randolph for the location of a new County Courthouse. This
building would be completed in 1835 and included a small stockade which served as the first County Jail
and later added an Almshouse which was the forerunner of the County Hospital; and
WHEREAS, the official population of Cook County at the time of its founding was 100 (a count of settlers,
not including Native Americans forcibly removed from the local area). The Chicago settlement (Chicago
was not incorporated as a town until 1833) had 50 to 60 residents; and
WHEREAS, Cook County would become a leader in growing the region, the state and the nation; blazing
trails in the fields of transportation, food processing, public health, education, juvenile justice, art and
music. The dynamic and diverse county population would swell the county population to 350,000 in 1870,
over 1.1 million 20 years later and 1.8 million at the turn of the 20th Century. By 1910, Cook County had
2.4 million residents, surpassing three million residents by 1920. By 1940, Cook County grew to four
million residents. In 1960, Cook County population totaled 5.1 million; and
WHEREAS, the history of Cook County Government contributed directly to the development of the region
and the State of Illinois, with many projects and initiatives of several County departments directly impacting
the economic and political direction of the region for years to come; and
WHEREAS, as Cook County approaches its 200th anniversary-and having developed a unique and
extensive collection of public documents and records that contain historical significance-establishing an
initiative to archive historically significant documents and records is imperative to County Government
history; and
WHEREAS, fundamental to capturing the history of Cook County is a thorough and complete
documentation of the history of Cook County Government; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Government must effectively and efficiently coordinate efforts across all
departments and with all officials to determine the historical value of various county documents and records
and make recommendations to the Board of Commissioners regarding access and promotion of the
County’s history; and
20

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

January 24, 2019

WHEREAS, Cook County Government must collaborate with individuals and organizations that possess
experience and expertise in the implementation of large-scale archive efforts; as well as seek guidance and
recommendations from current and past County officials with vast historical knowledge of Cook County
Government; and
WHEREAS, 50 ILCS 130, the Illinois Local Historian Act allows for local governments to appoint,
without pay, a local historian for the purpose of preparing and publishing local histories, preserving and
protecting local historic records, artifacts and edifices and documenting local current events; and
WHEREAS, the President and the Board of Commissioner of Cook County believe it is important to the
County’s preservation effort and to the successful commemoration of the County’s 200th anniversary that
the Board does appoint an individual to serve in the role of County Historian; and
WHEREAS, Secretary to the Board Matthew B. DeLeon currently serves in the role of Chair of the Cook
County Archives Advisory Committee, a committee formed to address archives related issues; and
WHEREAS, Secretary DeLeon has served the last five Presidents of the County Board and is in his 29th
year of local government service, 26 of those with Cook County Government and in his 13th year as
Secretary to the Board; and
WHEREAS, Secretary DeLeon will be a unique position to draw on his experience and the experience of
others with whom he has worked to properly document the history of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the members of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County does hereby celebrate the 188th anniversary of the founding of Cook
County, Illinois; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the members of the Board of Commissioners does
hereby appoint Matthew B. DeLeon, Secretary to the Board as the Historian of Cook County to lead the
effort to preserve the County’s legacy and promote the historic role County Government has played in the
history of Illinois and the United States; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and the members of the Board of Commissioners of
Cook County encourages all County agencies under all elected and appointed officials to work closely with
the County Historian to document the history of their offices, preserving documents, photographs, films,
other media and artifacts towards that purpose.

2019, and the several sums necessary to be levied to meet the needs and requirements of the County of
Cook for said fiscal year, and have recommended that this Ordinance for the Levy of Taxes be adopted;
and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, Illinois, approved, passed, and adopted the
Annual Appropriation Bill of the County of Cook, for its Fiscal Year 2019, which said Appropriation Bill

policy of Cook County to recapture any property taxes at the termination of a TIF; and
WHEREAS, within the County of Cook, certain real-estate parcels, or a portion of the assessed valuation
of certain real-estate parcels, are from time to time identified on the County real-estate tax rolls as deriving
from new property, insofar as they were developed or substantially improved or are the subject of tax

heretofore been recaptured; and
22

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

from the Annual Tax Levy for the Fiscal Year A.D. 2019 of the County of Cook for the Public Safety Fund
purposes of said County, and for the Health Enterprise Fund purposes of said County, and for the payment

taxes levied for said Funds; for the amounts of taxes for which the nonpayment will result in forfeiture of
real estate; and for abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collectors’ books. To
ensure the County meets its obligations for indebtedness as represented by the Bond and Interest Fund, and
that the actual collections of property taxes received by the Annuity and Benefit Fund are commensurate

LARRY SUFFREDIN AND JEFFREY R. TOBOLSKI, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
TO REDUCE COUNTY FACILITY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
WHEREAS, Cook County Government and the Forest Preserves of Cook County strive to be leaders in
addressing climate change; and
WHEREAS, both entities are working to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by the
year 2050, a goal that is consistent with attempting to keep global temperatures from increasing more than
2°C (3.6°F) over preindustrial temperatures, per the 2012 Doha Amendment to the United Nations Kyoto
Protocol; and
WHEREAS, Cook County Government is ahead of its target for reducing building energy emissions as a
result of its Green Buildings Program that implemented successful energy efficiency, renewable energy,
space reduction and other initiatives that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its building energy
use by 32 percent since 2010; and
WHEREAS, with nearly 70,000 acres of land, Forest Preserves of Cook County ecosystems play an
essential climate change mitigation role by absorbing over 1,544,000 tons of CO2 annually, and further
restoration projects will help sequester even more CO2; and
WHEREAS, in October 2018, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a new study of
the impacts of global warming; and
WHEREAS, the report’s findings predict ocean rise of an additional 10 cm with 2°C warming compared
to 1.5°C, an arctic free of sea ice in Summer once per decade compared to once per century, complete
eradication of coral reefs compared to a 90 percent decline, and the loss of many more ecosystems; and
WHEREAS, in November 2018, the U.S. Global Change Research Program released the U.S. National
Climate Assessment, which predicted that climate change could reduce the size of the U. S. economy by
10 percent by the end of the century; and
WHEREAS, an estimated minimum 200 million people around the globe would be subject to inundation
from rising seas, and several hundred million more to climate related risks and poverty; and
WHEREAS, the current effects of climate change on Cook County from the warming of over 1°C that has
already occurred include increased flooding, heavier rain and snow storms, and more extreme summer heat,
all affecting the region’s people and economy; and
31

 Board of Commissioners

Journal of Proceedings

January 24, 2019

WHEREAS, the expected future impacts of global warming in Cook County include threats to food supply
from impacts on agricultural crops and livestock; increase of invasive species; wildlife habitat destruction;
extinction of native plant and insect species; increased incidence of pests and diseases; vulnerability of
water supply and decreased quality of water; threats to infrastructure such as roads, rail, water supply and
wastewater management; decreased air quality; threats of global unrest causing homelessness and
immigration and disruption of business supply chains and markets; and, threats to many natural habitats
and species, among others; and
WHEREAS, climate change impacts the low-income and vulnerable more heavily, through poorer air
quality which impacts children, the elderly, and people with asthma and other respiratory and circulatory
illnesses; flooding and heat-related damage to infrastructure which more heavily impacts municipalities
with smaller tax bases to pay for infrastructure repair; and through heat-wave related mortality, which more
heavily impacts the elderly, minorities and lower income populations, and in other ways; and
WHEREAS, the IPCC concludes that limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible, but would require global net
human-caused emissions of CO2 to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero
around 2050; and
WHEREAS, limiting CO2 emissions to these levels would require change on an unprecedented scale,
including rapid and far-reaching changes in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities; and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required are already underway but would need to accelerate, and action
across all fronts will need to proceed as fast as possible, and
WHEREAS, many of the actions required could either save money and resources, or improve other aspects
of quality of life and our ability to adapt successfully to the climate change that is already underway.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby adopt the following goal: to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and to reach
net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a plan shall be developed to achieve this goal, and that progress
towards this goal shall be reported publicly by the Cook County Department of Environment and
Sustainability in its annual Sustainability Report; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that other local government agencies and businesses within Cook County
are urged to join with us in adopting this greenhouse gas reduction goal to counter the most harmful effects
of climate.
Approved and adopted this 24th of January 2019.

Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered to wear a
GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the complaining witness,
the complaining witness’s home/workplace, or any other protected address specified. There are currently

are well versed in responding to defined needs of clients, family members, and court partners, as well as
adapting to specific program requirements. Specific to the NSDCSEP, Presence has been involved in all
phases of program planning, launch and implementation and thus will only require minimal additional
education on the new grant and/or infrastructure-building components to ensure service delivery and
processes are upheld to the highest standards.
This is a sole source procurement pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code, and
the Grant.

of April) and can be reappointed for consecutive decennial census terms.
(c) The Commission shall review and make recommendations to increase community participation
in hard to count communities. This will be done with the Bureau of Economic Development’s request for
proposal to facilitate a complete event.
