EXPLANATION

293M Boxelder Court is a vintage courtyard 18-unit building, built in approximately 1914,

from the Community Investment Corporation. Brinshore has nearly 20 years of experience and has
completed more than 30 tax credit projects comprised of over 2,800 apartments and homes valued at more
than $450 million. The tenant selection plan for the proposed 6 PRA units provides a preference for
families with severe and persistent mental illness. Thresholds will provide the supportive services to the
individuals and families in the proposed PRA units. The tenant selection plan for the proposed 6 PRA

the supportive services to the individuals and families in the proposed PRA units. A tiered referral process
to lease the units will consist of: ?rst, families from public housing developments; second,
families whose right of return has not been satis?ed under Relocation Rights Contract 
third families from the waitlists. The remaining 12 unassisted units will be rented to working families.
Unit amenities include private balconies, air conditioning, new appliances, and large floor plans.
Construction is expected to be complete in 2012. The 6 PRA units are two-bedroom/l bath units that
range from 942-962 square feet. The proposed rents are $650-$700/ per month and are comparable with
market rents for the neighborhood. Since the units will be substantially rehabilitated, the certi?cate of

over 42 years of developing and managing affordable housing. The Bickerdike portfolio consists of more
than 1,000 affordable units of housing. On October 13, 2010, CHA approved 8 units located in these two
buildings selected through the Regional Housing Initiative (RHI) evaluation process. The RHI is an
intergovernmental agreement (IGA) between the CHA, the Housing Authorities of Cook County, Lake,
McHenry, Joliet, Waukegan, Oak Park, the Illinois Housing Development Authority, and the
Metropolitan Planning Council to pool in order to create regional housing opportunities for
program participants. The Board Resolution approving the IGA was passed on February 19, 2002. On
August 16, 2011 the CI-LA Board of Commissioners approved a recommendation to amend the 8-unit
HAP contract to add 3 vacant two-bedroom apartments. These additional units are now occupied by
referrals from waiting lists. The proposed 1,014 square foot three-bedroom unit substantially
complies with Housing Quality Standards (HQS) requirements. Applicants from waiting lists will
