PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS CALLING ON THE
HONORABLE BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TO CONVENE A

 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN CHICAGO ON THE ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE
WHEREAS, on October 5, 2015, Reverend Jesse Jackson and community leaders joined together to call on the
President of the United States to convene a White House Conference on Gun Violence in the City of Chicago at
the earliest possible opportunity; and,
WHEREAS, Chicago has seen more than 2,400 shootings to date in the year 2015 and more than 400 murders to
date in the year 2015; and,
WHEREAS, compared to this time last year, shootings and homicides in Chicago have increased by 21 percent;
and,
WHEREAS, the County resources required in order to serve the populations impacted by the increase in
shootings in Chicago make the problem of gun violence germane and critically important to the governance of
Cook County and the work of the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and,
WHEREAS, the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States, has spoken eloquently in the
aftermath of mass shootings throughout our country, on the need for government action to reduce gun violence;
and,
WHEREAS, our nation has been shocked and dismayed in recent years by the proliferation of mass shootings in
American communities such as Sandy Hook, Connecticut; Charleston, South Carolina; Aurora, Colorado; and,
Roseburg, Oregon, among others; and,
WHEREAS, in the City of Chicago, the number and frequency of shootings are such that Chicago suffers the
equivalent of a mass shooting every week without respite; and,
WHEREAS, the level of violence in the City of Chicago merits the attention of the federal government, in
addition to municipal, county and state government; and,
WHEREAS, the time has long since passed for public officials at all levels of government to acknowledge that a
state of emergency exists in Chicago and Cook County and for those officials to treat the issue of gun violence
with the level of urgency the issue most certainly requires;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners do
call upon the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States, to convene a White House Conference to
be held in Chicago on the issue of gun violence; and,
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a signed copy of this resolution be sent to the attention of the Honorable
Barack Obama, President of the United States, at the earliest possible opportunity.
