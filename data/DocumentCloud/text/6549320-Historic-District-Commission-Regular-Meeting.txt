United Artist Theater Structural Condition Inspection

Dear Mr. Moten:
Preamble
Per the request of the National Park Services, Bagley Development Group has commissioned Robert Darvas
Associates P.C. Consulting Structural Engineers to prepare a Structural Condition Report for the theater wing of
the building located at 150 Bagley Street, Detroit Michigan. The existing building was designed and built in
1927. It consists of an 18-story high rise tower with approximately 200,000 square feet of enclosed area plus a
low-rise theater wing having approximately 20,000 square feet of enclosed area. The theater wing is on the
north side of the tower with its own roof and its own walls on the east, north, and west sides and a wall
common with the tower on the south side where it is structurally connected to and abuts the tower. The
theater was designed as a first run movie theater however in 1927, the future of the movie industry was
uncertain, so it was designed with a full stage, fly loft, stage rigging, and orchestra pit in case the movie
industry failed. We understand that Bagley Development Group has worked for many years to find a use for the
building and they have been successful in finding a use for the 18-story tower portion but not for the theater
wing due to its specialized design and very deteriorated condition. Very little of the ornate original interior
architecture of the theater remains, and at 2000 seats, it is too large for a modern movie theater and too small
for a concert venue.
We further understand that Bagley Development Group has reached out to numerous lenders and all of them
indicated that they will not approve financing for renovation of the tower as long as the abandoned theater
shell remains. We understand that Bagley Development Group is eager to renovate and restore the tower
portion of the original building that represents 90% of the original square footage. Bagley Development Group
has no plans to restore or renovate the theater wing and will need to have it demolished in order to proceed
with renovating the tower portion of the original building.
Stephen Rudner, P.E. of Robert Darvas Associates, P. C. (RDA) and Nadir Makhlouf of Robert Darvas Associates P.C.
(RDA) visited the United Artists Theater Building located at 150 Bagley Street in Detroit Michigan on October 18,
2018. Brian Bagnick of Hobbs + Black Architects was also present during the inspection. The purpose of our
inspection effort was to observe and document the present structural condition of the theater wing of the
building and to determine if the structure of the theater wing is still safe to be used for occupancy. The theater
building is currently unoccupied. Historic data indicates the theater has been essentially unoccupied, without
heat, and minimal maintenance since 1971. It also appears to have had a leaking roof for some time. The Theater
Building is an appendage on the north side of the tower and having its own roof and its own walls on three sides
but with a common wall with the tower along the south side of the theater. Our inspection effort consisted of
reviewing the original structural drawings and shop drawings from 1927, reviewing four previous reports on the
theater building prepared by others, walking through the accessible areas of the interior, walking around the
exterior, and walking on the roof, making observations that could be made without demolition of existing finishes.
No manlift was provided so we were not able to view the underside of the main roof structure although we were

able to observe the roof structure of the fly-loft above the stage. One of the previous reports included photos of
the underside of the roof deck above the seating area of the auditorium as space well as a description of the
condition of the roof deck of that space when viewed from the underside. These photos from the previous report
are included in the appendix at the end of this report for reference. The four previous reports are as follows:

June 25, 2015 by Lopez Engineering of Clarkston MI

These four previous reports are included in the appendix of this report.
No material testing was undertaken as a part of the current inspection effort.
Numerous captioned photos accompany the text portion of this report and these photos should be considered
an equal part of the report. Following are our observations and conclusions.
Observations
Review of Original Structural Drawings and Shop Drawings
Copies of the original building drawings from 1927 that were prepared by C. Howard Crane Architect from
Detroit Michigan in 1927 were reviewed for this report. Also reviewed were shop drawings prepared by Gabriel
Steel Company of Detroit MI in 1927. The original drawings were hand drafted. These drawings that we were
given to review are copies of the original drawings and are very hard to read in some areas being either blurred
and/or faded. The drawings show a structural steel frame with reinforced concrete floors that are flat slabs in
some areas and ribbed slabs in other areas. The design live load capacity for some areas Is printed on the
drawings. The columns and main beams are steel frame with riveted connections.
Review of Previous Inspection Reports
The four previous reports dated 2007, 2012, 2013, & 2015 can be found in the appendix of this report. Of
particular interest is the description of the underside of the gypsum roof deck above the seating area of the
auditorium space that is in the 2007 report. In that report it is noted that the majority of the gypsum roof deck is
water damaged, bowing, and must be replaced. See page #2 and #5 of the 2007 report.
Interior Inspection
The interior inspection consisted of walking through the accessible portions of the basements, main floor and
upper level to view any portions of the structural system that could be observed without demolition of finish
materials. Much of the actual structural system is obscured by wall and ceiling finishes however due to extensive
water leakage through a poorly maintained roof, some areas of ceiling have collapsed and been removed
permitting some observations to be made. The captioned photos should be reviewed to better understand what
was observed.
The construction observed appears to agree with the original drawings that were reviewed in that there is a steel
framework of columns and beams infilled with reinforced concrete floor slabs and masonry walls. The condition
of much of the reinforced concrete is not good as water leaking through a minimally maintained roof has caused
rusting and corresponding expansion of the reinforcing resulting in loss of bond between the reinforcing and
the concrete and accompanying cracking and spalling of the concrete in numerous areas. Some critical areas
could not be observed such as the underside of the main roof structure above the former seating area of the
theater because there was no man-lift or extremely tall ladder supplied to be able to ascend to the level of the
ceiling and observe the roof structure directly. In those inaccessible areas, we have referred to previous

inspection reports by others that have written and photographic documentation of the condition of the
structure. The Owner has indicated that they have had difficulty keeping the “egg shaped” roof system above
the theater seating area water tight and this appears to be a major cause of the water intrusion. Unfortunately,
this “egg Shaped” roof covers about 75% of the floor area of the theater. (see images # 12, #13, #21, #22, #23,
#36, #37, & #38 ) Photos #36, #37, & #38 were sent by Fred Beal and were taken in 2013. They show the very poor
condition of the main roof deck when viewed from below. Adjacent roof areas such as the fly-loft had lesser
height from a walkable surface and the underside of the concrete roof structure was therefore observable. In
most areas that were able to be observed – there was some percentage of the concrete floor or roof structure
that was damaged by water intrusion. These areas tended to be the areas where the ceiling had collapsed due
to water intrusion permitting direct observation of the floor and/or roof structure above. In areas with intact
plaster ceilings, no direct observations of the structure were able to be made. In the raised stage area there is a
wood framed portion infilling the opening where there was once a large vertical lift section in the stage. This
wood framed section of the stage floor has partially collapsed due to wood rot in the joists and will need to be
completely replaced. (See image #11) The remainder of the stage floor is a ribbed concrete floor structure which
has some water damage in the form of spalled concrete and exposed rusted reinforcing, with systematic
cracking along the bottom edge of the ribs indicating rusting reinforcing and delaminated concrete with loss of
bond to the reinforcing. We estimate that perhaps 40% of the ribbed slab floor of the stage will need to be
replaced and much of the remainder will require extensive repairs. (See image #1 ). The structure of the main
balcony consists of heavy plate girders supporting stepped reinforced concrete risers. The riser areas of the
balcony are interrupted by vomitory ramps that provide access to the lower front portion of the balcony. Along
the sides of the vomitories, the edges of the ramp slabs are supported on continuous steel angles that are
severely rusted. These rusted angles need to be completely replaced. (See images # 2 & #3) Lines of temporary
shoring have been introduced along the edges of the vomitory slabs extending down to the main level floor
structure to provide safety at these heavily corroded locations.
Exterior Observation
The exterior walls are masonry with either solid brick and/or brick facing over hollow clay tile back-up. The
lower portion of the Clifford Street façade is in fairly good condition with minimal distress visible, although
there are a few damaged bricks that will need to be replaced. (See image #25) The upper portion of this wall is
showing signs of the outer wythe of brick veneer pulling away from the back-up wythe. This movement and
separation is likely due to water entering the parapet at the coping working its way down between the veneer
and the back-up and deteriorating the metal brick ties we assume must be present as there is no header course
bonding evident on the exterior face of the brick. We estimate that the top 20% of the brick veneer will need to
be reattached to the substrate using a commercially available retrofit type anchor. The brick veneer along the
Clifford Street side is a very hard fired buff colored brick with running bond pattern interrupted by decorative
brick designs in relief as well as herringbone designs. The brick on the sides facing the parking lot along West
Adams Street and Grand Circus Park is a more utilitarian brick and has extensive deterioration in the form of
spalled and missing brick. There are stains in the brickwork indicating extensive areas where water was allowed
to get into the masonry at the parapet level and descend down the wall between the wythes. On the Adams
street side, It also appears that some spot replacement of exterior bricks had begun but was abandoned after
removal of deteriorated bricks but before replacement of the removed bricks could take place. Based upon the
quantity of the damaged brick along this elevation (See image #27), we estimate that more than 50% of this
brick will need to be removed and replaced. In one area of the wall facing the parking lot toward Grand Circus
Park, the exterior of the wall was once an interior wall made of brick and tile in a rubble type of construction
and it appears a wythe or more of this wall has been removed to expose the rubble masonry. This rubble
masonry section is not a proper solution for an exposed exterior masonry in our climate which is classified as a
severe weathering environment. This section of the wall will need to be completely re-worked either by parging
over the rubble masonry and covering with another material, or by re-constructing it as an exterior brick veneer
over a CMU back-up wythe. (See images #28, & #29) It also appears that some spot replacement of exterior
brick had begun and been abandoned after brick removal but before the replacement of the removed bricks.
The areas of removed brick will simply accelerate the deterioration of this exterior masonry if not infilled with
replacement brick.

Rooftop Observation
We walked on the various roof levels of the theater building. There are several low roof areas adjacent to the
high roof above auditorium space, and an even higher roof level above the fly-loft. The roof membranes appear
to be the bituminous type and there are numerous areas where the roof membrane is in poor condition, with
breaks in the roofing that are admitting water into the building interior and into the masonry exterior walls. The
shape of the main roof is such that along three sides, there are deep valleys between the sloped roof and the
back of the parapet and/or the exterior wall of the tower that can trap water if the drains clog. Trapped water
that freezes expands and can tear the flashings and the roofing at these areas. This type of damage appears to
have occurred at several locations as evidenced by the stains on the exterior brick visible from the parking lot
along W. Adams. We recommend the parapet coping be removed, flashing be installed, and then the coping reinstalled. Roof runoff cannot be allowed to accumulate behind the parapets and additional drains and/or
scuppers should be added to ensure that water accumulation on the back side of the parapets cannot occur.
Conclusion
Because it has been unoccupied, unheated, and minimally maintained for approximately 47 years; the theater
wing has been deteriorating for some time. The water that is finding its way into the interior of the building and
into the masonry walls has been freezing and expanding during the winter months and causing a lot of
cracking. We estimate that over 50% of the exterior masonry of the theater wing will need to be replaced and
much of the remainder will require extensive repairs.
The embedded steel reinforcing inside the concrete portions of the structure has been corroding and
expanding causing loss of bond and delamination of the concrete. We estimate that 40% of the reinforced
concrete structure including the fly loft roof, the balcony floor, the stage floor, and main floor will require
extensive repairs including removal and replacement of the concrete and reinforcing and the remainder will
require crack remediation such as epoxy injection. The building code and the codes for design of reinforced
concrete structure have changed significantly since 1927 and depending upon the proposed use of the various
parts of the floor and roof structure, reinforcement may be required to account for snow drift loads on the low
roof of the theater where it is adjacent to the tower, and/or the fly loft structure ( a change to the building code
since 1927 ) etc.
The structural steel frame was observed to have some advanced deterioration along the edges of the vomitory
slabs. The severely corroded steel will require removal and replacement as previously noted. The larger sections
of the steel frame that were visible during our inspection were not observed to have advanced deterioration
however many of the smaller sections such as web members of joists did exhibit severe deterioration (See
image #32). Additionally, the majority of the steel frame was hidden within walls and/or ceiling cavities and
could not be observed so the extent of deterioration of the steel frame is largely unknown.
The Owner has indicated he cannot find a use for the theater space. Most of the interior finishes within the
theater space are deteriorated beyond repair; and if the exterior shell is to be saved, extensive structural repair
and upgrade work would be required including but not limited to the following:
1.
2.
3.

4.

5.

Remove concrete encasement to expose and test all steel connections; especially those below grade
and those that have been exposed to leaks.
Replace the steel framing for the lower balcony; as its failure could negatively impact the exterior shell
structure.
There are pieces of plywood covering holes in the roof above the performance space. The condition of
the structural roof deck and the steel structure above the performance space could not be observed
during our inspection.
As a minimum, the entire area above the performance space will require a new roof membrane.
Previous observations by others indicate the gypsum concrete roof deck above the seating area is
heavily damaged and must be completely replaced. Damaged and/or deteriorated structural steel
framing, that will need to be remediated prior to replacing the roof deck and re-roofing.
Water appears to be getting in under the stone coping. These stone copings should be removed,
flashing installed, and then the copings should be reinstalled.

Over 50% of the exterior brick on the west face of the building should be replaced.
Portions of the north façade were not intended to be exposed to the elements and those areas that
have become exposed exterior masonry should be replaced with exterior brick or some sort of
cladding material to keep water out.
All masonry will need to be tuck pointed.
There is evidence that the brick ties on the south façade are failing. New retrofit ties should be
installed, especially near the top of the wall where the brick veneer is already pulling away from the
structure. The sidewalk adjacent to this façade should be protected with a scaffold type protective
cover to protect passes-by until repairs can be made that will prevent masonry from falling to the
sidewalk.
There is evidence of significant ground water infiltration in the orchestra pit. Additional investigation is
required to determine any damage to the foundations and a sump system may need to be installed.
Stairs, railings, catwalks, and other areas of miscellaneous steel are dangerously deteriorated and
should be removed/secured to prevent injury.
Visual observation indicated areas where concrete reinforcement of floor and roof structure was
exposed in a corroded condition with spalling, delaminating, and cracking of the structural concrete.
Additional intrusive investigation would be necessary to determine the extent of repair/replacement
needed.
It is important to take care when performing remedial work on a historic structure to properly deal with
hazardous materials that may be encountered such as materials containing asbestos, lead, mold, and
etc.

Image #6 – Typical of many locations with concrete floors – some areas are water
stained and rebars have rusted such that they expanded and spalled off the
concrete cover. Other areas had no original concrete cover and the reinforcing
was constructed in contact with the formwork. Repair of this type of
deterioration and improper original construction must begin with careful
removal of all delaminated concrete back to sound concrete and sandblast
cleaning of the reinforcing. Then the reinforcing can be assessed to see if any
has lost more than 25% of its original cross-sectional area and if it has, new
reinforcing must be spliced in. Then a bonding agent and a patching mortar is
applied. The selection of a repair mortar depends upon the use as some are
formulated for overhead use etc. The repair mortar must completely surround
the reinforcing which requires careful removal of concrete on all sides of the
rebar in the patch area. The edges of the patch area cannot be feather edged
but must be square cut with a minimum thickness appropriate for the particular
repair mortar being used. See the attached pages at the end of this report for a
further description of the required removal geometry.

Image #8 – Some areas of concrete floor structure are in good condition. The
slab and secondary beams here appear to be in good condition, however the
main girder has a rusted rebar spalling the concrete. No evidence of beam
stirrups here. Many early reinforced concrete building structures do not have
stirrups and even today they are not typically required in the building code at
ribs of ribbed slabs however they are typically required by the code in beams
where they are called stirrups and columns where they are called column ties.
These stirrups and/or ties increase the shear capacity of the members and
prevent rapid shear failure providing for a gradual cracking that would be a
warning of an overload. It may be necessary to investigate if supplemental shear
reinforcing should be added to any of the members here. Many beams and
columns in this building are in fact steel beams and columns encased in
concrete for fire protection and would not therefore require stirrups or ties. The
beam in this photo appears to be a reinforced concrete beam.

the fly loft. Gutter formed by roofing flashed to very short parapet along exterior
wall has leaked water into exterior brick bearing wall below. With no railing and
such a short parapet, the access to clean the drains and maintain the flashings
is dangerous. The failed gutter and parapet coping and flashing has resulted in
significant damage to the exterior brick wall below. We estimate 50% of the
brick on the west façade will require repair and/or replacement as a result of this
condition.

Image #27 – Exterior view from parking lot off North Adams. The exterior brick
shows stains where water has leaked into the wall from failed roof flashings at
parapet. There are many bricks missing throughout the full height of the wall, (
especially at the corner ), There is significant staining throughout indicating
water intrusion, and severe damage at the top six feet of the wall below the
parapet and coping. We estimate 50% of the brickwork here should be removed
and replaced to properly correct the damage to the exterior walls shown here.
The fire escape is also unsafe and should be removed or repaired. The parking
lot along this wall should be fenced-off so cars cannot park along the wall here
and potentially damaged by falling masonry.

Image #33 – Underside of stage level floor has cracked and spalled concrete due
to rusting of embedded reinforcing. Note that there are no stirrups in the
concrete beams of this ribbed slab. . Repair of this type of deterioration and
improper original construction must begin with careful removal of all
delaminated concrete back to sound concrete and sandblast cleaning of the
reinforcing. Then the reinforcing can be assessed to see if any has lost more than
25% of its original cross-sectional area and if it has, new reinforcing must be
spliced in. Then a bonding agent and a patching mortar is applied. The selection
of a repair mortar depends upon the use as some are formulated for overhead
use etc. The repair mortar must completely surround the reinforcing which
requires careful removal of concrete on all sides of the rebar in the patch area.
The edges of the patch area cannot be feather edged but must be square cut
with a minimum thickness appropriate for the particular repair mortar being
used. See the attached pages at the end of this report for a further description
of the required removal geometry.

Re: United Artists Theatre - Structural Condition Assessment

Dear Fred,

Walker has Finished our review oi the structural Framing to get a better understanding oi the extent
oF structural Framing and exterior masonry repairs required as part oF your overall assessment oi
the Feasibility oF restoring the structure.

Our review involved a visual survey at exterior wall, at exposed structural members and at a Few
hidden areas where encasement concrete or brick was removed to get a look at some oF the
hidden conditions at the steel beams, columns and connections. Our review does not involve a
structural analysis since at this stage oF the project you are simply trying to get a general
understanding oi the severity and extent oF repairs. IF the owner chooses to restore the building,
then at that time a detailed analysis will need to be perFormed to Further evaluate the type oF
repairs required and develop repair details and speci?cations

ReFer to the Opinion oF Probable Repair Cost Table in this report For an 'order at magnitude? cost
For expected structural repairs.

See the attached original design drawing showing a section through the balconies along with our
reFerence notes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Theatre Roof:

Most oF the main structural steel components oF the theatre rooF are in good condition. A test
excavation was made at a typical truss-column connection. Although we did not Find any severe
corrosion at this connection, we have included a repair contingency For budgeting purposes. It's
likely that hidden deterioration conditions requiring repair will be Found at some oF these
connection locations when more oF the structural components are uncovered during construction.
Also, we Found some rooF purlins and catwalk hanger connections that need to be
repaired/replaced.

A maiority oF the gypsum rooF slab is water damaged and bowed and needs to be replaced with
a new system. It wouldn?t be practical to try to Find and save random locations scattered
throughout.

Other Structural Framing:

A leaking root and high humidity have led to corrosion oF most oF the structural steel beams and
connections supporting the balconies at the back oF the theatre. Most oi the corrosion is minor
and will not require repair, but repairs will be needed where the corrosion has led to signiFicant
thinning (section loss) oi the steel members. Based on our measurements and visual observations,
we have included an opinion oF probable cost For expected structural steel repairs.

The most signiFicant corrosion damage occurs at the end oF the large truss at the back oF the
theatre that spans the Full width oF the theatre and supports a heavy load From the Fan room, rooF,
projection room, etc.. As with all the structural members that are experiencing corrosion damage,
a structural analysis will be needed to deFine the extent oF repair work required.

Also, the precast Floor planks within the room that was added in the center oi the mezzanine
balcony seating area needs to be removed so that all oF the heavily corroded steel supports can
be replaced.

The concrete Floors slabs are generally in good condition and will only require ?spot" repairs
where corrosion?related damage occurs. Once the debris is removed From the Floor slabs a
sounding survey can be perFormed to con?rm our assessment.

Facade:

The walls are in Fair condition with deterioration conditions typical For a building oF this age.
These walls are generally nonload bearing and only need a moderate amount oF typical masonry
repair and waterproo?ng type repairs.

The items above are discussed in more detail in Section ?Summary oF
Findings/Recommendations? along with other building elements that we observed during our
review oF the structural Framing.

SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS

T. Truss at back of Theatre: 

CI.

This large truss spans across the width at the theatre and in general, supports portions of
the upper proiection room, Upper root, Grand toyer root and tan room above the grand
foyer. At the east end next to the oFFice building, there is a large hole in the upper root
allowing water to Flow over this end oi the truss over the years, which has resulted in some
significant corrosion damage to the steel members comprising the truss. Repairs are need
at this end to restore the members to their original capacity. This will likely involve some
rivet replacement and strengthening with supplemental steel members. Because the truss
supports some large loads that cannot be removed, the repairs will need to be performed
in a phased approach and may need some temporary shoring to support the loads during
repair.

There is some corrosion at the west end of this large truss where water has been leaking
through the root. We were not able to get up?close to this end, but from what we can see
we expect the repairs to be signi?cantly less than that required at the other end.

Mr. Beal
WALKER July 12, 2007

2. Mezzanine Balcony:

a. Portions oF the beams supporting the mezzanine balcony are encased with concrete. The
concrete encasement was removed at three leaking areas as part oF our survey. At two oF
the areas the steel beam and connections were in good condition and at the other area
there was about a oF rust build-up which is not a significant concern.

We Found an exposed beam and a beam-to-column connection with a substantial amount
oF section loss From corrosion that we expect will need repair to restore original capacity.
We also expect that there will be a Few more hidden conditions that will require some
strengthening repair.

b. Structural modi?cations were made to the balcony seating at some time since original
construction. A room was added in the center portion oF the seating area. The original
concrete seating was removed and a Flat Floor comprising precast planking was placed on
steel angle supports that were attached to the original steel Framing. The steel angles and
associated welded supports are heavily corroded and need to be replaced. This repair
will require replacement oF the precast Floor planks (approximately 700 sq. Also, we
could not view the original cantilevered steel girders in this area due to the modi?cations
that cover these girders. We recommend you include a contingency For potential girder
repairs.

c. The original concrete Floor appears to be in good condition based on view From the
underside with only a small amount oF Floor repair anticipated.

3. Balcony Promenade and Vomitory:

0. There are a Few beams that have some heavy rust build?up and will require repair, and we
expect that there will are some hidden conditions that will require repair. There also are 6
hanger supports From the level above that support some oF the beams at the balcony
promenade and vomitory. The Four that we could see From the level below have a
signi?cant amount oF corrosion and likely will need to be strengthened.

b. The original concrete Floor appears to be in good condition based on view From the
underside with only a small amount oF Floor repair anticipated.

4. Upper and Lower Balcony:

a. The beams and Floor slabs are similar to the condition Found at the Balcony
promenade/vomitory as described in item 3 above.

b. The main support girders running parallel to the aisles are in good condition. These Frame
into a larger girder that spans the width oF the theater. We were not able to do an up?
close survey oF this girder except at an end connection, From our view From the mezzanine

Mr. Beal
WALKER July 12, 2007

RESTORATION comsumms
Page 5 oi 7

level there were only evidence 0F 0 minor amount oF corrosion. We do not expect any
strengthening repairs.

5. Rook

0. Structural Steel Members The main support trusses in the theatre area are generally in
good condition with only a minor amount oF corrosion Found at a Few areas. The purlins
also appear in good condition except there are several along the wall that are corroded
and several oF these may need to be replaced.

b. The brick surrounding a truss-to?column connection was removed at a leaking area so we
could see the extent oF corrosion to get a better idea what to expect at other areas that are
covered with brick. We Found that there was about a oF rust buildup, but no
signi?cant section loss. However, we expect that there will be a Few areas that will need
some strengthening where the corrosion damage may be more severe.

c. The existing gypsum rooF slab above the theatre main seating area has several holes
which have allowed water to leak onto the structural members which has led to the
corrosion problems. A majority oF the panels are water damaged and are bowed. We
recommend replacement ol the roo?ng system. At that time the hangers For the catwalk
can be inspected where they are embedded in the gypsum and hook over the steel
purlins.

d. Catwalk: The majority oF the catwalk is in Fair condition, but there are a couple areas
where the hangers and associated connections are corroded or loose and need to be
repaired to restore capacity.

e. The grand Foyer roo?ng system needs to be repaired. There are several holes along the
sloped portion adjacent to the oFFice building. The root slab appears to be cast-in?place
concrete. The steel beams and girders are generally in good condition. There is some
corrosion where a beam and girder Frame into the large truss discussed in Item 1 above.
We weren't able to see the condition ot the rivets on the grand Foyer side but have
included some contingency as part oF the truss repair.

F. Terra cotta capstones extend around the perimeter ol the rooFs. Installing a Coping would
be an eFFective way to stop water From entering through the bed joints and cap joints.

6. Facade

a. The walls along the alley and parking lot are constructed with common brick. Water is
leaking through the wall and probably the parapet above as evidenced by leach stains
and Freeze thaw damage. There is approximately 500 sq Ft oF brick replacement required
to replace the spalled and delaminated brick.

There is also a an area along the north side that has unFinished mortar joints where the
wall was constructed next to an existing building that was torn down some time since

original construction of the theatre. We expect that this wall is not water tight as the
edges of the protruding mortar Funnel the water into the building. The most practical
repair seems to be plastering this section of the wall rather than try to tuckpoint the mortar
ioint.

To help limit the water absorption and subsequent brick deterioration, we recommend the
installation of a penetrating masonry sealer along these elevations with common brick.

b. Along the Clifford street elevation, face brick matching the office building was used. There
are a few small areas that need brick replacement near the top of the wall. This will likely
requiring a minor amount of shelf angle repair. There also are some spot areas of eroded
ioints that we could see along the lower portion that need tuckpointing as well as the
numerous head joints that are open.

7. Other:

a. The concrete slab and Framing in the main level seating area and grand foyer appears to
be in good condition based on our review of the limited amount of floor surface that was
exposed and the limited ceiling area that we could see from the basement level. Most of
the slab extends over a plenum space that we could view into from a wall opening along
one of the basement hallways.

b. The fan room above the grand foyer has several concrete wall panels that have fallen onto
the grand foyer roof. The remaining panels will likely need to be removed and the steel
angles that serve as column supports for the roof may need to be reinforced.

c. Fire escape stairs at exterior: We looked at a few sections of the fire escapes on the west
side [others occur along the east side and from the auditorium roof down to the lower
roof). 

The main support triangular support brackets attached to the walls are in fair condition.
We could not see the condition of the anchors or members in the wall that support these
brackets. The floor members and stairs are experiencing a significant amount of
deterioration at several locations that as a minimum will require replacement of severely
rusted members, as well as new bolts at all stair step support angles. The awning roof
above the fire escapes also needs to be replaced.

For budgeting purposes we suggest that you budget for all new flooring and stairs plus a
contingency for possible reanchoring of some of the triangular brackets (test excavations
can be made to determine the condition and type of existing anchors.)

8. Steel Stairs: All of the interior steel stair section leading from the basement to the balconies
are severely corroded and need replacement including some of the hanger rod connections
that attach to the stair stringers.

Subject: United Artist Theatre
Based on our walk-through of theatre building with you on September 4th, we offer the following
safety recommendation related to the structural supports for the projection room located on the
mezzanine level. The original mezzanine seating was removed in this area and replaced with
precast floor planks and a concrete topping at some time in the past. The steel angles and
brackets that were added to support this floor system are severely corroded and structurally
unreliable (Note: In recent years, these support angles were exposed following removal of the
plaster and lathe ceiling.) As a minimum, we recommend that one of the two options listed below
be implemented right away to address this structural safety concern:
1. Remove the precast floor system and perimeter walls bearing on the floor system.
2. Install temporary shoring along bearing edges of each floor section to support the dead load,
and extend the shoring down two levels to the grade slab in the plenum space.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Re:

United Artists Theatre - Structural Condition Assessment Update

Dear Fred,
Walker has completed our review of the structural framing and exterior masonry as an update to
our original review in 2007. The purpose of the update review is to determine if there are any
significant changes in the conditions and to address any conditions requiring immediate repair.
Our review involved a visual survey of the exterior wall, exposed structural members including the
areas were encasement concrete over steel members was removed during our 2007 review. Our
review does not involve a structural analysis since your main objective at this stage is to get a
general understanding of the severity and extent of repairs. If the owner chooses to restore the
building, then at that time a detailed analysis will need to be performed to further evaluate the
type of repairs required and develop repair details and specifications.
Refer to the Table 1 in this report for an ‘order of magnitude’ cost for expected structural repairs.
The attached original design drawing shows a section through the balconies with room and level
designations to aid in locating the areas referenced in this report.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
There are no significant changes in the deterioration conditions discussed in the 2007 report
other than one area of bowing brick at the west side of the stage over an upper roof that was not
observed in our 2007 survey. Overall, there has been a big improvement in the reduction of roof
leaks. In 2007 there were many holes in the roof allowing water to pour over the structural
members that led to corrosion damage. At this time there are a few smaller roof leaks in the
vicinity of the fan room over the grand foyer and along the perimeter of the roof along the
masonry walls. Beal Construction was in the process of patching these areas during our survey.
Considering the poor condition of this roof, ongoing patching on an annual basis will likely be
needed. Over the fan room at the back of the balcony, we recommend a new roofing membrane
to stop leaking and corrosion damage to the structural members below.

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 2 of 11

Theatre Roof:
Most of the main structural steel components of the theatre roof are generally in good condition
with most members showing no significant corrosion damage. We have included an allowance
amount for in our cost opinion for deterioration conditions requiring repair may be uncovered at
the encased connection locations when more of the structural components are uncovered during
construction. There also are 2-3 small sections of the roof catwalk that will need to be repaired
when the building is restored. Beal Construction plans on repairing one of these at this time since
it serves as the main entrance to the catwalk system.
The entire gypsum roof slab and roofing membrane need to be replaced. Approximately 70% of
the gypsum roof slab is water damaged and bowed. There are a couple sections that have fallen
and are still hanging. These need to be removed to eliminate a falling hazard.
Other Structural Framing:
Prior leaks and a few active leaks have led to corrosion of most of the structural steel beams and
connections supporting the balconies at the back of the theatre. Most of the corrosion is minor
and will only require cleaning and painting, but a few structural repairs will be needed where the
corrosion has led to significant thinning (section loss) of the steel members. Based on our
measurements and visual observations, we have included an opinion of probable cost for
expected structural steel repairs.
In 2007, we found significant corrosion damage and active leaking occurring at the ends of the
large truss at the back of the theatre that spans the full width of the theatre and supports a heavy
load from the fan room, roof, projection room, etc.. Only a minor leak was observed near the
truss during our recent survey during a rain event, and there was no noticeable change in the
corrosion damage. As with all the structural members that are experiencing corrosion damage, a
structural analysis will be needed to define the extent of repair work required.
In 2007 we also reported extensive corrosion damage
precast floor planks within the room that was added in
seating area. Temporary shoring was added recently.
solution involves removal of the precast floor system so that

the steel supports can be replaced.

The concrete floors slabs are generally in good condition as previously reported and will only
require “spot” repairs where localized deterioration occurs.
Façade:
There is no significant change in the exterior wall condition since our last review. The walls are
generally in fair condition with deterioration conditions typical for a building of this age. These
walls are generally nonload bearing need typical masonry repair and waterproofing type repairs.
There is a bowed section of brick that we observed from a roof area over the stage that we did
not review up close during the 2007 survey. This area will need to be removed and replaced
and is at the point where it may fall out within the next few years, however this occurs over a roof

 Mr. Beal

area and is not a hazard to the public on the roadway below. The condition of the brick façade
along Clifford and the alley are similar to what we saw in 2007. There is a small section along
Clifford near the roof line that shows signs of slight bowing and movement that needs to be
monitored in the event that it moves further and requires repair. Accordingly, we recommend that
the sidewalk remain closed in this area to be monitored brick on the parking lot. The brick wall
along the parking lot side is a more porous type brick that is experiencing typical freeze-thaw
damage that will require spot brick replacement and waterproofing repairs.

The items above are discussed in more detail in Section “Summary of Findings/
Recommendations” along with other building elements that we observed during our review of the
structural framing. Our overall cost opinion below is similar to the 2007 estimate with an overall
increase of 10% for price escalation and minor adjustments.

SUMMARY FINDINGS/RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Truss at back of Theatre:
a. This large truss spans across the width of the
theatre and in general, supports portions of
the upper projection room, upper roof,
grand foyer roof and fan room above the
grand foyer. The leaking upper roof in this
area was repaired in 2007 and appears to
be watertight at this area as we did not see
any major leaking on truss during a recent
rain storm except for a minor leak at the
west end near the parking lot side.
However, past leaks have resulted in some
significant corrosion damage to the steel members comprising the truss at the end east end
(alley side). If the structure is returned to service, then repairs are needed to restore the
members to their original capacity. This will likely involve some rivet replacement and
strengthening with supplemental steel members. Because the truss supports some large
loads that cannot be removed, the repairs will need to be performed in a phased
approach and may need some temporary shoring to support the loads during repair.
b. There is some corrosion at the west end
(parking lot side) of this large truss where
water has been leaking through the roof in the
past and some current minor leaks. We were
not able to get up-close to this end, but from
what we can see we expect the repairs to be
significantly less than that required at the other
end.

2. Mezzanine Balcony:
a. There was no noticeable change in the beam
conditions from our 2007 survey. Portions of
the steel beams supporting the mezzanine
balcony are encased with concrete. In 2007,
we removed concrete encasement at three
leaking areas as part of our survey. At two of
the areas the steel beam and connections
were in good condition and at the other area
there was about a 1/8” of rust build-up which
is not a significant concern. At that time we
also observed an exposed beam and a beamto-column connection with a substantial

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 5 of 11

amount of section loss from corrosion that we expect will need to be repaired if the
structure is returned to service in order to restore original capacity. We also expect that
there will be a few more hidden conditions that will require some strengthening repair.

b. Structural modifications were made to the
balcony seating at some time since original
construction. A room was added in the center
portion of the seating area. The original
concrete seating was removed and a flat floor
comprising precast planking was placed on
steel angle supports that were attached to the
original steel framing.
The steel angles,
triangular connection plates and associated
welds are heavily corroded and need to be
replaced before the structure is returned to
service.
Temporary shoring was installed
recently as a precaution. The permanent repair will require replacement of the precast
floor planks (approximately 700 sq. ft.). Also, we could not view the original cantilevered
steel girders in this area due to the floor system that cover these girders. We have
included an allowance in Table 1 for potential girder repairs.
c. The original concrete floor appears to be in good condition based on view from the
underside with only a small amount of floor repair anticipated.

3. Balcony Promenade and Vomitory:
a. There are a few beams that have some heavy rust build-up and will require repair, and we
expect that there will are some hidden conditions that will require repair. There also are 6
hanger supports from the level above that support some of the beams at the balcony
promenade and vomitory. The four that we could see from the level below have a
significant amount of corrosion and likely will need to be strengthened.
b. The original concrete floor appears to be in good condition based on view from the
underside with only a small amount of floor repair anticipated.
4. Upper and Lower Balcony:
a. The beams and floor slabs are similar to the
condition
found
at
the
balcony
promenade/vomitory as described in item 3 above.

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 6 of 11

b. The main support girders running parallel to the
aisles are in good condition. These frame into a
larger girder that spans the width of the theater.
We were not able to do an up-close survey of this
larger girder except at an end connection from the
mezzanine level where there was only evidence of
a minor amount of corrosion. We do not expect
any strengthening repairs.
5. Roof:
a. Structural Steel Members - The main support trusses in the theatre area are generally in
good condition with only a minor amount of corrosion found at a few areas. The purlins
also appear in good condition except there are several along the wall that are corroded
and several of these may need to be replaced or repaired as part of the roof replacement
work.
b. In 2007, the brick surrounding a truss-to-column
connection was removed at a leaking area so we
could see the extent of corrosion to get a better
idea what to expect at other areas that are covered
with brick. We found that there was about a 1/8”
of rust buildup, but no significant section loss.
However, we expect that there will be a few areas
that will need some strengthening where the
corrosion damage may be more severe.
c. In 2007, several holes in the gypsum roof slab
above the theatre main seating area were patched
to help stop water entry and resulting corrosion
damage. Ongoing leaking observed along the
perimeter were being patched during this update
survey.
Approximately 70% of the gypsum
panels are water damaged and are bowed, and a
couple panels have partially fallen and are
hanging from the purlins. These occur near the
back of the main seating near the catwalk access
ladder along the east wall (alley wall) and need to
be removed to eliminate a potential fall hazard.
We recommend replacement of the roofing system. At that time the hangers for the cat
walk can be inspected where they are embedded in the gypsum and hook over the steel
purlins.
d. Catwalk: The majority of the catwalk is in fair to good condition, but there are a few
areas where the hangers/framing and associated connections and railing are corroded or

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 7 of 11

loose and need to be repaired to restore capacity. Beal Construction plans on repairing
one of these areas at this time since it occurs at the main entry to the catwalk system.

e. The grand foyer roofing system was repaired in
2007 to address the several holes along the
sloped portion adjacent to the office building.
Additional waterproofing at the windows along
this area have been boarded and flashing
installed to stop ongoing water leaking. This
area along the perimeter was watertight during
our survey during a rainstorm, but water is still
entering through leaks in the fan room roof
above. The fan room needs a new roofing
system as spot repairs have not been able to
stop the leaking. The roof slab of the grand
foyer appears to be cast-in-place concrete. The
steel beams and girders are generally in good
condition. There is some corrosion where a
beam and girder frame into the large truss
discussed in Item 1 above. We weren’t able to
see the condition of the rivets on the grand foyer
side but have included some contingency within the truss repair item in Table 1.
f.

Terra cotta capstones extend around the perimeter of the roofs. A few caps are missing
but have been waterproofed. Installing a metal coping over the parapet would be an
effective longterm solution to stop water from entering through the bed joints and cap
joints.

6. Façade
a. The walls along the alley and parking lot
are constructed with common brick which is
typically more porous making it susceptible
to freeze-thaw related damage. Water is
penetrating into the brick and is also
probably leaking into the wall from the
parapet cap/bed joints.
There is
approximately 500 sq ft of brick
replacement required to replace the spalled
and delaminated brick at the outer wythe.
There is also a an area along the north side that has unfinished mortar joints where the
wall was constructed next to an existing building that was torn down some time since
original construction of the theatre. We expect that this wall is not water tight as the

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 8 of 11

edges of the protruding mortar funnel the water into the building. The most practical
repair seems to be plastering this section of the wall (approximately 20 foot x 40 foot)
rather than try to tuckpoint the mortar joints.
To help limit the water absorption and subsequent brick deterioration, we recommend the
installation of a penetrating masonry sealer along these elevations with common brick.
b. Along the Clifford street elevation, face
brick matching the office building was
used. There are a few small areas that
need brick replacement near the top of the
wall. This will likely require a minor
amount of shelf angle repair. We also
noted slight bowing of the wall in a
couple areas but no significant change
from 2007. We recommend that this
area be monitored to determine if there is
any further movement that would warrant
performing repairs at that time. As a
minimum, the sidewalk needs to remain
closed.

Slight bowing

Excessive
bowing

Slight bowing

We found excessive bowing in the masonry façade along the east end of the stage roof
where the stage roof slab frames into the wall. This bowing is likely due to a corroded
shelf angle or corroding concrete beam, or could be related to a design or construction
flaw. We recommend rebuilding this portion of the wall before it falls and damages the
roof and wood framed structure below. This occurs over a roof area and is not considered
a public hazard.
There also are some spot areas of eroded joints and numerous open head joints that we
could see along the lower portion that need tuckpointing. Sealants, tuckpointing and
localized brick replacement and lintel repairs can be expected at other areas along the
building.
7. Other:
a. The concrete slab system in the main level seating area appears to be in good condition
based on our review of the floor surface the limited the limited ceiling area that we could
see from the basement level. Most of the slab extends over a plenum space that we could
view into from a wall opening along one of the basement hallways. Where the slab
extends along the west side of the stage there is a small amount of ceiling deterioration
along the concrete joists. A relatively minor amount of repair is expected in the grand
foyer area.

 Mr. Beal
July 30, 2013
Page 9 of 11

b. The concrete roof slab over the stage has some corrosion
related concrete spalls (approximately 30 sf at south west
corner and few minor areas in the concrete ceiling joists
in the vent room over the stage.). The loose concrete was
removed and no further leaking appears to be occurring.
We understand the roof above was replaced recently.
c. In 2007, the falling fan room walls over the grand foyer were replaced with OSB panels
with waterproofing along the seams. The panel are performing well, but may need some
minor waterproofing where the seams have opened a little a may be letting water in.
d. Fire escape stairs at exterior: We looked at the fire escapes occurring in the alley and
parking lot sides of the theatre from the ground level using binoculars. We also looked at
the fire escape along the east side and from the stage roof down to the lower roof. We
noted that the metal roof structure over the fire escape along the parking lot side was
removed in recent years.
The main triangular support brackets attached to the walls are in fair condition. We could
not see the condition of the anchors or members in the wall that support these brackets.
The floor members and stairs are experiencing a significant amount of deterioration at
several locations that as a minimum will require replacement of severely rusted members,
as well as new bolts at all stair step support angles. The remaining metal roofs above the
fire escapes also needs to be replaced or removed.
For budgeting purposes we suggest that you budget for all new flooring and stairs plus a
contingency for possible re-anchoring of some of the triangular brackets (test excavations
can be made to determine the condition and type of existing anchors.)

8. Steel Stairs: All of the interior steel stair section leading
from the basement to the balconies at north end and the
ones along the south end at each side of the stage are
severely corroded and need replacement including some of
the hanger rod connections that attach to the stair stringers.
The one at the northeast corner needs to be closed due to
the extent of corrosion damage. The others will need to be
monitored and should not be used for heavy loads.

LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
This report was prepared for the owner of the United Artist Building/Theatre to assist in evaluating
the overall condition of the building facade and to determine the general type of repairs expected
to restore the structural framing members close to their original condition. This effort does not
involve an analysis to determine if the structural design meets the original or current structural
code or other code requirements. The report is not intended for the use of or reliance on of any
other party. The information provided is for use with additional judgments regarding financial,
technical, and operational issues. It is based upon limited visual observations of the structure and
required certain assumptions to be made regarding existing conditions. The report is our
expression of our professional opinion to the best of our information, knowledge and belief, and
does not constitute a warranty or guarantee of the items noted, cost opinions, the present or future
conditions, or the discovery of possible latent conditions. This assessment provides planning and

Mr. Fred Beal
An inspection was performed at the above location on June 5, 2015. The nature of the inspection was to
review the existing structure and the existing shoring present for the structure. The building has been
vacant for an extended period of time and temporary shoring has been added at some time.
The existing shoring is present to support precast planks and steel beams for the second level of the
structure. A room was enclosed with masonry after the original construction was completed. The
existing shoring is present below the precast, but it would be prudent to add additional shoring to insure
that the structure will remain sound and prevent any possible collapses. Structural reinforcing of the
beams will be required to be determined prior to removal of the installed shoring if the building is going
to be functional in the future.
The additional shoring required for the precast is as follows. Additional shoring columns should be
placed between the existing 4x4 columns supporting the existing precast planks. The masonry wall at the
front of the projection room should also have a line of shoring towers installed. This area is currently not
shored and adding the shoring will provide insurance that a collapse will not occur in the future. The
shoring posts shall be placed at a maximum of 8’-0” on center and be located along the full width of the
masonry wall above.
The existing slab was found to be a minimum of 7” thick for the main floor. The slab will be capable of
supporting the loads from the shoring.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
