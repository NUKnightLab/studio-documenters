CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication from
DANIEL H. WINSHIP, M .D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for three (3) months, Contract No. 02- l 5983H with Trako Dental and Medical Supply, Inc., Round Lake Beach, Illinois, for the purchase of dental
supplies for Cermak Health Services of Cook County, Department of Public Health, Oak Forest Hospital
of Cook County and Stroger Hospital of Cook County.
Reason:

This request is necessary to allow sufficient time for the bid, evaluation, award and
implementation of the new contract for which bids are scheduled to be opened on February
23, 2006. The expiration date of the current contract was January 31 , 2006.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: February I, 2006 through April 30, 2006.
Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the County Purchasing Agent
be authorized to extend the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

CONTRACT AMENDMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated January 23, 2006 from
DANIEL H. WINSHIP, M.D., Chief, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization that the Purchasing Agent be authorized to lower and fix the unit pricing for
Contract No. 05-72-26, for Mail Order Refill Prescription Service with SavRx Chicago, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois.
As you are aware, when the bid specifications were prepared for the mail order pharmacy program, there
were no historical statistics upon which to project mail order prescription volumes. Since the program
was new and patient participation was voluntary, the Bureau of Health Services was only able to prepare
an estimate of what the Bureau thought the volumes would be. In order to not overstate the annual
contract volumes we advised the prospective bidders that the estimates were not guaranteed and that we
were not bound by the volumes. This obviously created a risk that was shared by both the County and the
vendor. As a result, the two bidders responding to the bid specifications, bid a tiered pricing schedule that
varied based upon annual volumes. The contract with SavRx Chicago, Inc. has an average cost of $8.92
per prescription filled. This price is based upon 333,000 being filled each year.
Since the inception of the program, the Bureau of Health Services has seen a steady increase in the
demand for mail order pharmacy services. In addition, the Bureau has utilized the mail order phannacy to
reduce the overall demand on the Stroger Hospital of Cook County, Fantus Clinic and the Provident
Hospital of Cook County outpatient pharmacies by utilizing the mail order service for refill prescriptions.
This has helped the hospital to keep pace with the growing patient demand and to reduce patient waittimes and lines. As a result of the overwhelming success of the program, the Bureau of Health Services
has achieved the first year estimated prescription volume within the first six months of the contract, and
are on pace to reach the full contract volume within twenty-four months.

574

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2006

In recognition of the rapid increase in volume and the economies of scale that should be enjoyed as a
result of the increase, we approached SavRx Chicago, Inc. and asked them to reconsider their tiered
pricing schedule and to request a price reduction. As a result, SavRx Chicago, Inc. has agreed to lower
and fix the cost at $7.92 per prescription. This represents a $1.00 savings over the current average cost.
In addition, SavRx Chicago, Inc. has also agreed to retrospectively adjust their monthly billing to reflect
the new cost for all billing periods beginning with October 2005.
Therefore, I respectfully request the approval of the above contract modification.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the request of the Chief of the
Bureau of Health Services be approved. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY I, 2006

Your Subcommittee has considered the following item:
I. The purpose of this meeting is to hear testimony from the public on delays that patients of the
County Public Health Care System may still be experiencing to receive their prescription
medications. This meeting is for infonnational purposes only.
Chainnan Maldonado stated that the purpose of this meeting is to hear from patients of the County public
health care system regarding the wait they experience in receiving their prescription medications.
Chainnan Maldonado further stated that this meeting is for infonnational purposes only.
Chainnan Maldonado stated that six months ago a public hearing was held to hear from patients of the
County public health care system regarding the wait they experience in recei ving their prescription
medications, and at that time the Committee stated that their would be a follow-up hearing. Further,
Chainnan Maldonado stated that the Hospital administration has infonned the Commissioners that many
improvements have been made in regards to the phannacy crisis.
Chairman Maldonado stated that first the Commissioners would hear from the patients to see if there is
consistency with the claims from the administration and the present experience of the patients. Once the
Commissioners have heard from the patients, the Commissioners will hear from any member of the
administration.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he appreciates the public attention that is being focused by Chainnan
Maldonado and the Committee members on this very important problem of public service and customer
service from the representatives of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services. He has had the
opportunity to tour Stroger Hospital of Cook County, including the phannaceutical dispensing facility
that is part of the hospital complex. A lot of improvements have been made, but continued vigilance is
going to be necessary to ensure that the County refines the delivery methods to make sure that the bulk of
those patients who have critical, life-threatening problems and require immediate attention as well as
those who are routine consumers of prescriptions are given timely service.
Vice Chairman Silvestri stated that it is important for the Commissioners as public officials to hear how
things are operating, especially when it comes to something as basic to the provision of heath care and the
provision of prescriptions . Further, Vice Chainnan Silvestri stated that progress has been made with the
mail order and the phannacy system; but sometimes the system itself is too big and needs to be reviewed;
that is what the process here at the hospital is.
Vice Chainnan Silvestri stated that he would like to take the opportunity while being at the hospital
faci lity to commend the doctors, nurses and the administrators who do a fine job of providing health care
to the many residents of the County who need to come to Stroger Hospital of Cook County and use these
faci lities. However, as a footnote, the provision of prescriptions is very key, and very vital to the
provision of heath care.
Chainnan Maldonado asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

realized that further improvement is still needed.

working hard to clean up the pharmacy and other departments under the Bureau. Further, the Bureau is
