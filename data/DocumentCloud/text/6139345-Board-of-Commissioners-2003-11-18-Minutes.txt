cards or data stored internally in the memory of the computer.
F. "Department of Revenue" or "Department" means the Department of Revenue of Cook County.
G. "Director of Revenue" or "Director" means the Director of Revenue of Cook County.
H. "Lease" or "rental" means any transfer of the possession or use of personal property, but not title

processing equipment, whether the time is fully or partially utilized, and specifically includes a
"nonpossessory computer lease."
The term "nonpossessory computer lease" means a nonpossessory lease in which the customer
obtains access to the provider's computer and uses the computer and its software to input, modify
or retrieve data or information, in each case without the intervention (other then de minimis

personal property. If any separately stated charge is not optional, it shall be presumed unless

or "rental price," in the case of a nonpossessory computer lease, includes all charges for the use of
the computer's hardware, computer software, computer programs and databases for any purpose
whether or not the charge for use is measured by the actual amount of time used or by some other
measure.
A transfer of the use or ownership of personal property, or a provision of a service, that is ancillary
to a nonpossessory computer lease shall be deemed a separate transaction for purposes of
determining whether the charge for the transfer or the service is includible in the lease or rental
price of the nonpossessory computer lease only if the transfer or service is optional. The charge for
a transfer or service that is not optional shall be included in the lease or rental price of the
underlying nonpossessory computer lease, even if a separate charge for the transfer or service is
stated in a contract or invoice. A transfer or service shall be considered optional for this purpose
only if the lessee could have obtained the same nonpossessory computer lease from the same lessor
without the transfer or service.

organization.

a location in the County.
E.

The first fifteen (15) properties are located in the City' s I 54th Area Project for
Neighborhood Revitalization, as outlined in the submitted enclosure. Upon receipt of the
properties, the City will implement a RFP for development of affordable housing on the sites.
This will encourage new growth by removing stagnant and blighted property and replacing it
with affordable new housing, new residents, new taxable sites, and most importantly,
returning neighborhood pride to the community.
The final site is a former pizza parlor that has been vacant and deteriorating for years. The
deterioration has extended beyond the actual structure and has negatively impacted the
adjacent homes and businesses. Upon receipt of the tax deed for this property, the City will
demolish it and make the site available for new business growth.
