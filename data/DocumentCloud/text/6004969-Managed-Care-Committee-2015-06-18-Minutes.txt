Report on CountyCare Health Plan (Attachment #1)
A. Metrics
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the Report on the CountyCare
Health Plan. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of slide 11, Mr. Glass provided information on the mandate and target set based on the
2011 Resolution from the General Assembly regarding mandatory managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries.
The legislative mandate was that by January 2015, 50% of Medicaid beneficiaries in Illinois must be enrolled
in some form of coordinated care; the implementation of that by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services focused on six major metropolitan areas, or regions, across the State - virtually 100% of the
Medicaid beneficiaries in those six regions were moved into mandatory managed care.
As referenced on slide 11, Mr. Glass stated that the 1.4 million Family Health Plan(FHP)/Affordable Care
Act (ACA) Adults represents the end result of the State’s effort to move people from fee-for-service into
managed care in the Greater Chicago Region. He noted that the Region’s total number will hover in that 1.5
million range from this point forward, unless some dramatic changes in eligibility are seen. Chairman Lerner
inquired regarding the number of people in the State who are still without insurance. Mr. Glass responded
that he and staff have asked that question, but the State has not yet released that data, so there are no

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
estimates yet. Chairman Lerner noted that, several years ago, he recalls that the statewide objective was to
cover 1.7 million people who either were uninsured or underinsured under the definition at that time, who did
not qualify for Medicaid or anything (uncompensated care beneficiaries). With the implementation of the
ACA, he wondered how many of that 1.7 million were covered, and of that 1.7 million, how many are in the
Greater Chicago Region? He is interested in determining where the gap is, because the gap is still going to
be covered by CCHHS. Mr. Glass stated that staff will continue to try to get that information, and will
present it to the Committee when it is received.
During the discussion of slide 13, Mr. Glass stated that the administration is working with leadership at the
CORE Center regarding efforts to have all members’ HIV medications filled at the CCHHS pharmacy. The
administration is scheduling a much higher level meeting to press on the importance of this and find ways to
move this faster. Chairman Lerner inquired whether there is anything that the Committee can do to help
move that metric in the right direction. Mr. Glass stated that the administration can vocalize the Committee’s
support and interest in this subject to the leadership at the CORE Center. Chairman Lerner suggested that, at
some point, it may be helpful for the leadership at the CORE Center to come in and talk to the Committee
about their efforts and how they are trying to move the patients to have their HIV medications filled at the
CCHHS pharmacy. Mr. Glass stated that he will let them know that this could be an upcoming step for them.
During the introduction of the presentation relating to Behavioral Health Services, Mr. Glass stated that the
Board will be receiving a much broader overview in terms of a behavioral health strategy next week;
CountyCare’s role in that is pretty significant and inclusive.
During the discussion of the information on slide 20, Mr. Glass provided an overview of how funding for
these services has been provided in the past, and how it has recently changed under the ACA. The way it
historically worked is that Medicaid dollars would come into the State, and would be split among the
different departments listed on the slide, for different types of Medicaid fund-eligible services; providers
would be paid by those departments on a fee-for-service basis. With the ACA, funding shifted into a
premium payment that had to be managed by health/managed care plans for a set benefit package that
Medicaid must cover.
Chairman Lerner remarked that, essentially the State can reduce its budgetary responsibility by consolidating
some of these costs into the ACA premium, and transfer the risk to the health plan. Mr. Glass concurred.
With regard to other risks, he stated that a lot of other mental health and substance abuse services get covered
by divisions under the Illinois Department of Human Service beyond service dollars - that is an area where
there is definite risk for reductions. Another risk right now relates to the shift/transition for the provider
community to work with managed care, particularly if they are not familiar working in a claims-based
environment.
Director Gugenheim noted that there is a lot of new information available regarding the actual provision of
care relating to substance abuse. This is a subject that the Committee may want to further review and
discuss. She added that there is in fact a whole range of drug interventions that are quite successful and are
very underutilized.
During the discussion of the information on slide 28, Mr. Glass clarified that CountyCare has transferred the
risk for care coordination for the ACA adults to Cenpatico, but not for FHP or Integrated Care Program (ICP)
members; the exception to that is for those FHP members who are assigned to the Medical Home Network.
Chairman Lerner inquired whether there are different case interventions for people with primarily medical
conditions versus those with primarily mental health/substance abuse conditions. Mr. Glass responded that,
with regard to the ACA Adults, yes; on the FHP and ICP side, that is what management is working to build –

Report on CountyCare Health Plan (continued)
they want to strengthen the network and make sure that a broad network of services and providers are
available. Chairman Lerner noted that, further down the road, as the administration needs to monitor the
quality or outcomes of the interventions on a medical basis, it also needs to measure the quality and
outcomes of interventions on a mental health basis.
Board Chairman Hammock referenced a mental health project involving the Cook County Sheriff; he
believes that the Sheriff created some sort of clinic on the Far South Side of Chicago; he asked Mr. Glass to
provide information on that next week, so there can be an understanding of what the Sheriff’s
thoughts/plans/actions are relative to behavioral health and the Department of Corrections.
Director Junge stated that she believes there are a huge number of ACA Adults who are justice-involved;
they may not be at Cermak Health Services but they may be on probation or have been recently released.
She reminded the Committee that recently-released detainees are 200 times more likely to die of an overdose.
Mr. Glass stated that one of CountyCare’s key partners is TASC; their focus is exactly on that subject, and it
is proving to be unbelievably complex and disjointed/uncoordinated. Discussions are being held regarding
how to coordinate that care; he indicated that the subject is likely to be reviewed and discussed in the
Committee’s next quarterly deep dive report.
