 FINAL Minutes of the October 22, 2015, Meeting of the
Midway Noise Compatibility Commission
APPROVAL OF MINUTES
A. July 23, 2015 Meeting Minutes

CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF AVIATION (“CDA”) REPORT
A. Renewal of the Intergovernmental Agreement
The Chicago Department of Aviation has initiated paperwork and introduced an
ordinance to the City Council requesting that the agreement, which expires at the
end of 2015, be renewed for the next five years with some minor updates. It is
scheduled to be heard in council chambers in mid-November. Following that, Mr.
Frame will send the formal intergovernmental agreements for execution by the
current members.
Chairman Baliga asked the age of the Commission and Mr. Frame replied that it
was established in February of 1996 making it 19 years old. Chairman Baliga
commented that because Forest View rarely participates, which impacts quorum,
their position as a member of the intergovernmental agreement should be
dependent on their willingness to participate in the future. Mr. Frame replied that
the signed agreements need to be returned by the village boards by December
25th so that finalizing can be completed by the end of this year. If an individual
intergovernmental agreement has not been returned by December 31st the
former member will not be included in roll call for January 2016.

near the airport as reflected in relation to the Midway 2018 Noise Contour. The

many complaints regarding arrival noise on 22L/22R. As a result new procedures
