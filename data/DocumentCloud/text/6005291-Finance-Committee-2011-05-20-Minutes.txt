regarding the following question: in working with unions, when the System has employees working in
communities, who are perhaps bilingual and/or culturally attuned to that community, can this attribute take priority
in a bumping process?

III. Action Items
A. Minutes of the Finance Committee Meeting, April 21, 2011
Director Golden, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved to accept the minutes of the
Finance Committee Meeting of April 21, 2011.
THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(C) Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items.
Nita Stith, Interim Deputy Director of Supply Chain, presented the requests for the Committee’s consideration.
She stated that request numbers 3, 4 and 8 are being withdrawn at this time due to Contract Compliance
reasons. She added that request numbers 7, 19, 20 and 21 are currently pending Contract Compliance.
Additional information was provided on the requests by the following individuals: LaVerne Hall, Director of
the Cook County Office of Contract Compliance; Joanne Dulski, System Director of Laboratories; Dr. Patrick
Dunne, System Chair of the Department of Radiology; and Michael Ayres, System Chief Financial Officer.
Ms. Hall provided additional information regarding request number 6; she provided an overview of the
technique used to review, consider and finalize the minority and women-owned business enterprise
(MBE/WBE) participation goals for the contract.
With regard to request number 20, Ms. Hall stated that the contract currently proposes a MBE/WBE
participation goal of 3%. Following discussion, it was determined that Ms. Hall will work to have the vendor
commit to a mentoring component as part of the contract; it was noted that, while a mentoring component may
not have an initial direct impact in meeting participation goals, it can have long-term effects on future goals.
Mr. Ayres provided additional information regarding request number 21; he noted that it is not atypical to use a
second Medicaid firm for denials. With regard to the fees, Mr. Ayres stated that they are contingency-based,
but there is a fixed-fee component, as well.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director O’Donnell, moved the approval of request
numbers 1 through 29, with the exception of request numbers 3, 4 and 8, which are being
withdrawn, and noting that request numbers 7, 19, 20 and 21 are pending Contract
Compliance, under the Contracts and Procurement Items, as amended, and Supplemental
Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED.
Chairman Carvalho abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 5.
Director Golden abstained and voted PRESENT on request number 11.
Note: At the Board of Directors Meeting on May 26, 2011, request numbers 7, 19
and 21 were withdrawn from consideration, as they were pending Contract
Compliance.
C. Supplemental Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
This item was considered concurrently with Item III(B).
D. Any items listed under Sections III, IV and VI

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Presentation of Lawson Financial Statements through March 2011 (Attachment #3)
Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, presented the Lawson Financial Statements through March
2011. During the Committee’s discussion of the information, it was noted that efforts are being made to
further refine the staffing data in relation to the budget, in order for a more comprehensive and meaningful
review of the financial statements.
Mr. Ayres presented the Cash Performance Update (Attachment #4). He noted that the information indicates a
liquidity problem driven by receivables not being processed on a timely basis. Following the review of the
information, which indicated that the turn-around time at the State for claims processing may be delayed,
Chairman Carvalho inquired whether any of the processes at the State have changed. He noted that the
Medicaid claims are not paid from the State’s General Revenue Fund, so it should not be a cash flow problem.
Randall Mark, System Director of Intergovernmental Relations and Policy, responded that he has posed this
question regarding any change of processes to representatives at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and
Family Services; the response is that there have been no changes to the processes. The Committee discussed
the subject further; additional information was provided regarding the difference between pending applications
and approved claims that are pending payment.

B. Notification of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #5)
In accordance with Part II, Section 2.8 of the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Procurement Policy
that states that emergency purchases be reported to the Finance Committee no later than at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, the Committee received information on the emergency purchases that have been made.
Also in accordance with the Policy, a communication in writing was sent to Chairman Carvalho and Board
Chairman Batts on this matter.

C. PricewaterhouseCoopers Transformation Presentation (Attachment #6)
G. William Luallen, of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), presented the Performance Improvement Update.
This update included information regarding the Performance Improvement Economic Plan, the Benefit
Detailed Summary, the Critical Items and Action Steps and Revenue Cycle Graphs. The Committee reviewed
and discussed the information.
During his presentation, Mr. Luallen noted that with regard to potential opportunities, the implementation of a
time and attendance system could save the System approximately $1 million per month. Chairman Carvalho
stated that the System is awaiting action by the County on the subject; he asked Mr. Ayres to provide an
update. Mr. Ayres stated that a committee was formed to work on the structure of the program; he has not
recently received an updated report from the County on the matter.

D. Coding Outsource Presentation (Attachment #7)
Mr. Ayres presented information regarding the outsourcing of Coding. This information included an analysis
of internal shared services versus outsourcing, and an overview of Health Information Management (HIM)
Facility Coding Issues and its impact to CCHHS. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
D. Coding Outsource Presentation (continued)
Mr. Ayres stated that the union was notified of this matter, following the April 29th Board Meeting; discussions
with the union are expected to take place soon. A request for proposals (RFP) has been sent out; he noted that
they are now working on the process of marketing this transition and bringing it forward. It was noted that
there is a five-month notice period to the union; this period will allow for a comprehensive review and analysis
of how the System will best benefit from this transition.

E. Capital Improvement Project Status (Attachment #8)
Note: this item was taken out of order.
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, System Chief Operating Officer, presented the Capital Improvement Project Status
Report. He noted that the changes that were approved by the Cook County Board, relating to the Strategic
Plan, total $53 million; as a result of these changes, a prioritization of projects was developed. He added that,
by working with the Office of the President, and prior to the final approval by the County Board, the System
was successful in securing the inclusion of $5 million in Fiscal Year 2011 for the development of the Oak
Forest Regional Outpatient Center. He added that, as a result of this shift in funding, this will push the
Strategic Plan a bit further into the future.
During Dr. Tedeschi’s review of the information presented regarding capital equipment requests, he noted that,
from an operational standpoint, it is very important that the System receive approval for these; there will be an
even bigger impact on the Strategic Plan if these requests are not approved.
Board Chairman Batts requested that information be provided with an overview of the operational
ramifications that will result, by not funding the anticipated Capital Improvement Projects that impact the
Strategic Plan.

F. Summary of the May 12, 2011 Meeting of the Cook County Board’s Health and Hospitals Committee
Dr. Terry Mason, System Interim Chief Executive Officer, provided an overview of the activity and discussion
that took place at the May 12, 2011 Meeting of the Cook County Board’s Health and Hospitals Committee. He
stated that there were two major items regarding the System on the agenda. First, the Committee had a
detailed discussion of the finances of the System; secondly, there was a hearing on the subject of the Cook
County Department of Public Health’s decision to discontinue participation as a contracted vendor for the State
in the Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Services (WIC) Program.

G. Impact of Health Reform on CCHHS

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
This is a request to increase the current contract with Gen-Probe Inc. to provide Mycobacterial and fungal probes
used for TB and Fungal Identification testing manufactured and distributed by Gen-Probe Inc. for the Department of
Pathology. A 25% increase in the number of positive TB results has been identified due to the centralization of the
Laboratory to Stroger Hospital. Provident and Oak Forest hospitals and CCHHS clinics submit TB tests to the Stroger
Hospital Laboratory for testing. When a mycobacterial {TB) culture turns positive, it is required to test each of the TB
probes to determine the accurate TB Mycobacterial species; there are four TB probes: Avium complex, M. gordonae,
M. kansasii and M. tuberculosis. Each of these species has specific isolation of patient and treatment protocols.
/

The Gen-Probe supplies are proprietary to the existing Gen-Probe instruments in the Department of Pathology:
LEADER 50 and LEADER 450 Luminometers. The firmware in these instruments is necessary for the running of
assays and is proprietary to Gen-Probe. Gen-Probe is the sole provider of this firmware.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
This is a request to increase the contract amount by $40,000.00 to correct the previous board approval request
submitted to the Board of Directors of CCHHS on 04/29/2011. The amount needed to provide upgrades to server
hardware and end user devices (computers, printers, laptops and monitors), and to provide additional storage for
clinical systems is $1 ,240,000.00. The previous board approval request was for $1 ,200,000.00. An additional
$40,000.00 is needed to complete the amendment previously approved by the Board of Directors of CCHHS.
This contract provides all computer equipment needed for Cook County Health and Hospitals System. The increase
is needed due to end user devices that require replacement to support the increased demands of throughput.
Included in this amendment will be upgrades to servers and end user devices that have reached their lifespan and no
longer support the current application demands. The increase in end user utilization frequently causes slow response
times and reduced productivity. Current utilization has 1, 700 to 1,800 users accessing the current system with
degradation experience experienced during peak shift times. This increase includes server hardware, additional
storage for ciinicai systems, and end user devices (computers, printers, laptops and monitors).

NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
As patient volumes dropped in the fall, the contract's billing structure was no longer valid given the volume
assumptions that the model for the contract was built off of. ARAMARK approached CCHHS in April and asked if
CCHHS would be willing to a) reconsider the billing structure going forward to recognize the new volume levels and
b) offer retro-payments back to 01/01/2011. CCHHS management has provisionally agreed to reconsider the billing
structure to recognize the current volumes at Provident Hospital. However, this retro payment will only extend back to
04/01/2011 and subsequently be in effect until 06/30/2011, or the end of the requested extension. All of the funds
required to pay these amounts for both the extension and retro payments are already encumbered within-tAe-exist~f-'19budget. Again, this is largely due to the material shifts in patient volumes at Provident Hospital over the past year.
This current situation arose in light of the fact that the Aramark Dietary contract at Provident expired 05/06/2011.
Pending contract completion, the prospective System agreement is scheduled to begin 07/01/2011. As such, CCHHS
Supply Chain Management asked Aramark if they would be willing to extend their contract with Provident Hospital
through 06/30/2011. ARAMARK's willingness to comply is contingent on the new billing structure being established
for the aforementioned time period. In order to avoid a disruption in food service at Provident Hospital, it is
recommended that the existing contract be amended and extended until the new System food and nutritional
services contract is executed.

PRIOR CONTRACT HISTORY:
The previous contract (07-72-354) was provided by a single source vendor for a 36 month period, with two additional
amendments extending and increasing the contract for an additional 7 months. The current contract expires June 30,
2011.
.
NEW PROPOSAL JUSTIFICATION:
The proposed contract is the result of an extensive and competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process involving
three vendors. Vendor presentations and proposals were reviewed by a selection committee who evaluated the
submissions based on a criteria matrix which included each providers current capabilities and ability to support key
performance indicators as expected under the new contract service levels. The team narrowed its selection to Quest
Diagnostics based on the lowest pricing structure and highest service level commitment. Quest Diagnostics is one of
three reference laboratories for University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC). This contract will result in direct service
expense savings for the all clinical laboratories in the system, as well as, positioning the system to maximize savings
associated with increased levels of compliance through the current GPO.
The. new agreement will become a CCHHS system agreement. Quest Diagnostic will provide diagnostic laboratory
testing services not currently performed within CCHHS. Results from these laboratory tests will be interfaced in to the
current Laboratory Information System so that this information becomes part of the medical record and is available
for ordering clinicians to review. Quest Diagnostics has a detailed implementation plan to ensure a seamless
transition for CCHHS Laboratories.

governmental payers of Healthcare services. The posting of these transactions significantly contributes to the
financial reporting and stability of CCHHS, as accurate insurance eligibility information results in more timely billing
and collections, reflects a more accurate accounts receivable, and helps to ensure timely collection of patient
services revenue due to CCHHS.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities and financial activities for the month ended March 31, 2011.
This discussion focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities
during the current month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial statements of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH); Oak
Forest Hospital (OFH); Provident Hospital (PHCC); the Department of Public Health
(DPH); the Ambulatory and Community Health Nefourrk (ACHN); the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS); and Cermak Health Services (CHS). Collectively, these entities provide
primary, intermediate, acute, and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their
ability to pay. The Bureau of Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and
policy activities of the CCHHS.

Accounts Receivable appears to be the result of an improvement in the capture of gross
patient service revenue. The System’s March recorded average daily gross patient
service revenue increased by 6.9% from the month of February. This increase in the
average daily revenue is primarily the result of work that Price Waterhouse Coopers is
performing to improve charge capture in all areas of the System. The increase in average
daily revenue is also the result of price increases that were recommended by Price
Waterhouse Coopers to make the System charges similar to other facilities in the Chicago
area. The increase in rates charged should also have a small increase in net revenue too.

The days of outstanding of uncollected revenue remained at the February level of 220
days by the end of March. The March month end level of uncollected Patient Accounts
Receivable is well above industry standards. The healthcare industry standards are
between 50 and 60 days of revenue outstanding for patients accounts receivable. The
System is taking steps to reduce the level of outstanding uncollected revenue and
improve cash collections. Those steps include improving follow-up of outstanding
accounts, training the staff, instituting the use of the new patient accounting system’s
automated work tools, and working with the State Medicaid program to reduce the
inventory of unprocessed applications for Medicaid.

Benefits - $45,684

It has been positive that unbilled inpatient and outpatient accounts have remained at
stable levels from month to month even though the average daily revenue has grown by
6.9%. Billed inpatient accounts grew by 4.2% in March. Some of this increase is the
result of the March increase in average daily revenue. Billed outpatient accounts grew by
13.1% in March. The System continued to focus on reducing unbilled accounts and
resolving the billed accounts in April. The days of outstanding Patient Accounts
Receivable were down to 205 days by the end of April.

SUMMARY OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The Cook County Health and Hospital Systems continues to undertake significant
restructuring with a focus on operational efficiency so that the system can better fulfill its
mission of serving the health care needs of the region. Effective in July, 2010 CCBHHS
engaged Price Waterhouse Coopers as its revenue cycle vendor to re-engineer the
revenue cycle process and to improve efficiencies within the expenditure process.

Supplies - $37,106

The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)

Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $36,689

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Nonoperating Revenue was $110,597. The largest portions of this are attributed to sales
tax in the amount of $57,770 and property tax in the amount of $27,326.
Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund.

Insurance - $18,212

Utilities - $2,610

Depreciation - $12,143

Salaries and Wages - $186,250

Operating Expenses at the end of four months was $340,695 broken down as follows:

and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.

revenue.
The outstanding Patient Accounts Receivable increased in March from the level
outstanding at the end of February by 37.9 million dollars or 6.9%. The increase in

financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are
comprised of fund financial statements.

that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

CCHHS Revenue Cycle Transformation
Patient Access Redesign


Patient Access Transformation: Transformational redesign and implementation efforts began in January 2011 for the
Emergency Departments, Centralized Scheduling, Outpatient Registration, and Inpatient Admissions/Bed Control.



Pre-Processing Center (PPC): The PPC for CCHHS was launched in the fall of 2010 at Oak Forest Hospital (OFH) and has
since expanded to include some services at Fantus Health Center (i.e., GMC Firm A). PPC Services were extended to additional
ACHN Clinics beginning in May 2011.
Total pre
pre-registration
registration completion percentage has decreased from over 70% to around 60% based on a significant increase in total
pre-registration volume, changes in schedule availability and volume staffing and availability.

 CCHHS Coding Analysis
Internal Shared Services versus Outsourcing
Updated April 11, 2011

Executive Summary
Definition: Coding is the transformation of verbal descriptions of diseases, injuries, and procedures into numeric or
alphanumeric designations. As the basis for reimbursement, appropriate medical coding had become crucial as
healthcare providers seek to assure compliance with official coding guidelines.
Problem: CCHHS like many healthcare organizations throughout the country is facing a critical shortage of qualified
medical coding professionals. The ability to recruit and retain coding professionals is extremely difficult in a market
where salaries are increasing the ability to work remotely is required to be competitive. Coding is a vital function that
if not supported can impact appropriate capture of revenue to meet financial goals needed to support the
organization’s mission.








Staffing
o

CCHHS has a total of 26 budgeted coding positions with only 12 currently filled by credential coding
professionals.

o

Nine non-credentialed CCHHS coders underwent a Certified Coding Specialist (CCS) prep course; only
two coders passed the exam and obtained their CCS credentials, which increased the number of
credentialed coders from 10 to 12.

o

Supplemental contract coding professionals are currently being used to support workflow and volumes at
Stroger and Provident facilities.

Training and Education
o

Compliant coding and CCHHS support of credentialed coders depends on training and on-going
education to the coding services staff, which is unbudgeted at this time.

o

ICD-10 implementation will require training costs for in-house coding services, with industry estimates of
$2000 per coder over the course of two years. Industry estimates that the learning curve for ICD-10 is 6
months, which will impact the timeliness of coding and the revenue cycle goals.

Coding Quality, Compliance and Productivity
o

Current CCHHS productivity levels are lower than published industry standards, which results in higher
costs to complete the work and achieve financial goals.

o

CCHHS coding accuracy rates are lower than published industry standards, which can result in
compliance issues and reduction in appropriate payments or possible sanctions.

Financial Implications
o

Recurring yearly economic impact projected if the coding function is outsourced: $3,000,000.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis performed with consideration of both non-economic and economic factors, the
option for total outsourced coding services is the best solution for CCHHS to reduce coding costs and improve coding
compliance, productivity, and overall coding quality.

 CCHHS Coding Analysis
Internal Shared Services versus Outsourcing
Updated as of April 11, 2011

Economic:


Analysis A: (Refer to page 5 and 6) Twelve months of 2010 discharges for all three facilities as reported
through Softmed coding application. The outsourced costs utilized in the analysis reflect current outsource
contract pricing per chart. Actual pricing for full outsource option would need to be obtained through formal
Request for Proposal process.



Analysis B: (Refer to pages 6 and 7) Five months of actual data for Stroger only. Provident and Oak Forest
details not available for this analysis; these five months of actual Stroger data include a one time backlog
reduction effort; thus, if annualized, totals would be inflated. The outsourced costs utilized in the analysis
reflect current outsource contract pricing per chart. Actual pricing for the full outsource option would need to
be obtained through formal Request for Proposal process.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis performed with consideration of both non-economic and economic factors, the option for total
outsourced coding services is the best solution for CCHHS to reduce coding costs and improve coding compliance,
productivity, and overall coding quality.

Non-Economic Challenges:
Credentialed Staff Summary


CCHHS job descriptions require the senior coder to possess credentials associated with coding expertise.
There were nine coders (5 senior, 4 junior) that participated in the offer to enroll and complete a CCS exam
preparation course. Only two senior coders passed the national CCS exam and will retain their job with a
promotion to the new pay grade. The three senior coders who did not pass will be part of the next round of
layoffs in May 2011. The 4 junior coders that did not pass the CCS exam will retain their job, but remain at
the lower level position that will be phased out through attrition. Overall staff credential percentages are
lower than expected for a hospital system this size. Industry practice is to obtain a 100% credentialed coding
staff.

Recruitment of qualified coders
Currently, there are 42 out of 71 responses that passed the TALEO screening process and are eligible for a phone
screen to validate their qualifications for the seven vacant senior coding positions at Stroger. Interviewing has not
commenced on these positions; the number of viable candidates included within this initial response group is
unknown at this time.
Training and ongoing education requirements for coders
Compliant coding and facility support of credentialed coders depends on the ability to provide ongoing education and
training for the coding staff. Additional planning and cost is associated with these factors:


Maintenance of coding credentials requires continuing education (CE) hours each year. Currently, CCHHS
has no organized training or ongoing education infrastructure to provide CE's for the coding staff. The
CCHHS budget does not provide reimbursement for CE education associated with any coding credential. If
the coding staff remains responsible for their own CE expenses they may consider other employers who offer
CE reimbursement, thus setting up a perpetual vacancy situation.



On-boarding new hires require continual training and quality assessment by seasoned, credentialed coders for
the at least the first six months. This training and quality assessment typically impacts the coding process
through reduced productivity for the seasoned coder assigned to train and provide quality assessments for the
new hire.



A new HIPAA compliant ICD10 coding classification system will be implemented nationwide 10/1/2013.
The CCHHS staff will require training for ICD10 CM and ICD10 PCS pre-go live. Industry predicted costs

 CCHHS Coding Analysis
Internal Shared Services versus Outsourcing
Updated as of April 11, 2011
Non-Economic Challenges (Continued):
associated with training coders are estimated to be as much as $2,000 per coder. CCHHS will need to budget
training costs for the existing staff and on-boarding coders prior to the years 2012 and 2013.
Current State Coding Productivity
The economic cost analysis, above relies on the premise that CCHHS coders would accomplish the total annual
volumes with the budgeted staff versus outsource coders coding the annual volume. In comparison to industry
standards, the current CCHHS levels for coding productivity is considered low for Inpatient, Same Day Surgery and
Emergency Department record types. This table illustrates industry coding productivity standards:

Low productivity is a contributing factor in escalating backlog issues and overtime costs and it is questionable if
CCHHS could staff the qualified credentialed coding staff and accomplish coding the annual volume without
continued reliance on external vendors to provide coding support.
Current State Coding Quality
Also notable, is even with a lower chart per hour rate, the inpatient coding assessment indicated a need for ongoing
coding quality oversight across all chart types based on lower than expected coding accuracy rates.
Highlights from inpatient coding assessment:


Provident Hospital Inpatient assessment: error rate of 30%; ten accounts were evaluated with three suggested
changes.



Provident net reimbursement change is $13,500. Changes are broken down as: one decrease of ($23,287) and two
increases totalling $36,787.



John H. Stroger Hospital Inpatient assessment: error rate of 15%; forty accounts were evaluated with six suggested
changes.



Stroger Hospital net reimbursement change is $10,202. Changes are broken down as: two decreases totalling
($4,904) and four increases totalling $15,106.



The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) guidelines indicate best practices for coding
quality in maintenance of 5% error rate related to coding and DRG assignment.

Compliant coding oversight practices are recommended in the form of internal and external coding assessments
throughout the year. The outsourced coding vendor would be expected to provide ongoing coding audits as part of
their internal coding quality measures. Additionally, a CCHHS driven external coding audit is recommended for due
diligence with coding compliance.

 CCHHS Coding Issues and Outsourced Solutions
Productivity
•
•
•

CCHHS coder productivity standard is overall 84% of industry norm
Actual productivity is approximately 72% of industry norm
Outsourced solution eliminates productivity issue through contractual performance requirements

Revenue Impact (CMI improvement)
•
•
•
•

Since the utilization of outsource coding services, the CMI has risen by 10%
Increase to reimbursement is $1300 per Medicare discharge (based on 7 months of paid history)
Reimbursement for Medicare discharges for 7 months ended 2/28/2011 totalled $1.2 million
Outsourced solution will result in improved CMI and Reimbursement

Compliance (Quality Control)

•

Accuracy rates in recent Coding Quality assessment resulted in fail rates of 15-30% across 3
facilities compared to industry benchmark of 5%
Outsourcing requires reduced expenditure for external coding quality reviews
Outsourced solution transfers primary responsibility and cost for periodic quality
reviews to vendor.

•
•

Organizational Impact (Resources)
•
•
•

Currently 27% of budgeted credentialed positions are filled; lack of experienced management team
Barriers include extended recruitment and hiring timelines; limited continuing education opportunities
Outsourced solution is responsible for providing experienced credentialed staff and maintaining
continuing education per contractual requirements.

Organizational Impact (Training)
•
•

CCHHS does not budget for regular continuing education opportunities required to maintain credentials
Outsourced solution transfers responsibility and cost for conducting continuing education to
vendor

FINDINGS
On avera
age, Cook County exp
pends morre than app
proximatelyy $100 million each year
y
on capital
projects. Of the prev
viously app
proved mullti-year projjects value
ed at appro
oximately $571 million, 52
projects were
w
identiffied as can
ndidates forr deferral, denial or re
estructuring
g for increa
ased efficiency.
The prev
viously app
proved pro
ojects now recommended for e
either denial or defe
erral represent
approxima
ately $88 million.
m
No additio
onal funding
g is require
ed for 2011.. The deferrral and den
nial of proje
ects totaling
g approxima
ately
$88 millio
on will allow

nd proceeds of
approxima
ately $216 million to meet a cuurrently pro
ojected additional req
quired fund
ding amoun
nt of
approxima
ately $319 million, ressulting in a projected a
additional fu

uirement off approxima
ately
$103 million over 3 years.

2011 Capital Improvement Program

April 20, 2011

HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
SUMMARY
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System operates in 5.2M square feet of
facilities built between 1908 and 2002. Projects for this operating group are
included at various locations throughout the County, including the John H. Stroger
Campus, Oak Forest Hospital, Provident Hospital, and Countywide clinics.
The Capital Improvement Program includes 31 new and current projects for the
Health and Hospitals System operating group, valued at $356.4M.
Key projects include:
 Cook County Hospital Redevelopment ($126M)
This project will renovate the old Cook County Hospital into administrative
office space and associated auxiliary functions for Stroger Hospital and will
replace 1900 W. Polk Street, which is inefficient for office use and not code
compliant. The Cook County Hospital building will continue to deteriorate and
lose value until the improvements are implemented.
 Stroger Parking Garage Expansion ($50.2M)
The project consists of the construction of a 1,760 space addition to the
existing 1,340 space parking structure at Stroger Hospital to yield a total of
3,100 spaces. Size and character of the parking structure expansion will be
coordinated with other development projects at this campus.
 New Fantus Clinic ($92M)
This project consists of the development of a new Fantus Clinic to replace the
existing building, which has obsolete systems and is poorly configured for
modern healthcare service.
 Fantus Clinic Systems Repair ($1M/year)
The project will provide critical repairs to the building systems at the existing
Fantus Clinic as necessary to meet health care standards until the new
Fantus Clinic is developed.
Due to the physical proximity and interrelated nature of these projects, it is
recommended that they be restructured for the most efficient delivery approach.
The projects will be considered individually but also as part of the Space Utilization
Strategy for the Stroger Hospital Campus.

 2011 Capital Improvement Program

April 20, 2011

CORPORATE
SUMMARY
The Cook County Corporate operating group utilizes 2.6M square feet of
facilities built between 1906 and 2002. Included in the Corporate operating
group are projects at facilities such as the County Building, George W. Dunne
County Office Building, Rockwell Warehouse, and the Hawthorne Warehouse.
The Capital Improvement Program includes 29 new and current projects for the
Corporate operating group, valued at $120.3M.
Key projects include:


Countywide Warehouse & Records Storage –Hawthorne ($26.3M)
The current project scope involves the build out of an older, high-bay
industrial building previously acquired by the County to provide a
centralized center for document storage and retrieval. The building was
purchased in 2004 for a value of $8M. To date, beyond acquisition,
investments of $3.8M have been implemented. The building, with the
storage racking system to be provided under the current project, will have
the capacity to store 800,000 file boxes for the Clerk of the Circuit Court
alone. Further, the development of this facility will provide a centralized
center for document scanning to reduce future facility requirements for
document storage. Other building occupants include the County Clerk, the
Health and Hospitals System, and Facilities Management.



Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracts ($20M)
OCPP has partnered with the Department of Environmental Control to
develop a Guaranteed Energy Performance Contracting Program (GEPC).
Through a competitive RFP process, companies have been selected to
identify and implement energy conservation measures that will generate
savings sufficient to offset the cost of implementing such measures.
Funding for the energy conservation measures has been included in the
CIP, but additional financing options include a tax exempt lease purchase
arrangement, shifting payments out of the bond and interest fund. OCPP
will work with the Finance team to identify the most beneficial financing
vehicle for these improvements. In partnership with Commonwealth
Edison, cost savings will be achieved through operating changes and
minor upgrades while the GEPC Program, which is expected to generate
major energy savings as well as emission reductions, is in development.

2011 Capital Improvement Program

April 20, 2011

STRATEGIC ASSET REALIGNMENT ANALYSIS
OCPP is responsible for the capital planning of the County Health and Hospitals
System, Court System & Corrections, and Corporate Facilities. This responsibility
encompasses over 100 buildings with approximately 17.5M square feet of space,
with facilities dating from the early 1900’s and in varying need of repair or
replacement.

Health and Hospitals System Space
Utilization and Facility Condition
Assessment

A robust space utilization and facility condition assessment is required to properly
assess the current status of countywide facilities. This assessment will establish
an understanding of the County’s Assets to develop a baseline from which a
comprehensive ongoing Capital Improvement Program can be developed.
Additionally, the County utilizes some leased spaces, of which further consideration
for need and space utilization is necessary. Plans to consolidate facilities and
dispose of surplus real estate will be developed as a result of space utilization
analyses.

Court System and Corrections
Space Utilization and Facility
Condition Assessment

Specifically, the recommended Space
Assessments will address the following:





Corporate Space Utilization
and Facility Condition Assessment

Utilization

and

Facility

Condition

Evaluate space usage and develop plan for efficient use of real estate assets
Evaluate physical building conditions and identify obsolete building systems
Ensure that proposed facilities meet program requirements
Confirm feasibility of projects with respect to Land, Cost, and Scope

The cost of these assessments is just over 1% of the proposed Capital
Improvement Program costs. As such, these assessments represent considerable
value in developing and implementing effective capital plans going forward,
supporting the County in making important decisions with comprehensive
information about the existing facility conditions, utilization of available space, and
recommended capital improvements.

 BRIEFING NOTE
Development of Extramural Funding:
Proposal to Establish a Centralized Sponsored Programs Administration at CCHHS
Background
CCHHS currently participates in externally funded programs totalling $50 million a year to provide clinical
care and undertake clinical research at CCHHS facilities. These programs enable CCHHS to deliver care
beyond what is reimbursed by other sources. For example; HIV/AIDS care at CORE Center, public health
programs and cutting edge novel therapeutics and diagnostic procedures.
CCHHS does not provide centralized financial oversight, development or support for extramural sponsored
programs. The vast majority of these functions are currently provided by an outside organization, the
Hektoen Institute of Medical Research. Although the relationship with Hektoen is long-standing, it does not
represent the most advantageous or effective model for CCHHS to expand and strengthen its sponsored
programs. Rather, CCHHS would be better served by pursuing internal capabilities to make grant
applications, monitor performance and issue reports to support individual clinicians who wish to be involved
in clinical research.
CCHHS needs to supplement the efforts of its highly effective Institutional Review Board which monitors
human subject protection, by providing strong central oversight of the grants that are being operated at
CCHHS.
As part of the transformation project started in the second half of 2010 a workgroup was established
comprising several senior clinical faculty and administrators. Their charge was to look at the way
extramurally sponsored programs are currently conducted at CCHHS and to make recommendations for
improvements.
Infrastructure Enhancement for Targeted Funding Opportunity
The workgroup examined the current internal and outsourced infrastructure of the administration of
extramural sponsored programs. The workgroup determined that while Hektoen provided meaningful
benefits that reduce certain administrative burdens, as an independent entity Hektoen does not adequately
promote CCHHS’s objectives of establishing greater financial responsibility, regulatory compliance and
accountability and of fostering aligned growth.
The workgroup conducted an analysis of current grant availability and discovered that, from the main
federal sources alone, there were over 1,300 active RFAs (Request For Applications) on offer, of which at
least one-third were appropriate for consideration by CCHHS. This list was refined further by consideration
of CCHHS's current strengths and centers of excellence.
The result was a targeted list of 100 grant opportunities worth over $200 million in total over the lifetime of
the awards equating to $50 million a year in additional funding to CCHHS. Since conducting that analysis
several more highly relevant RFAs have been published and a number of RFAs have expired and been
reissued. The availability of suitable grants does not appear to be limiting the growth of CCHHS's portfolio
of sponsored programs.
Proposed Future Operating Model
The workgroup proposes a future operating model that would facilitate the pursuit of targeted grants and
ease their operation once awarded, without impinging on the current processes that are succeeding and
without being burdensome to faculty.
The future operating model adds two new management entities to forge a strong collaboration between the
administrative and clinical professionals at CCHHS that will be focused on acquiring and operating new
sponsored grants.
1) Sponsored Programs Committee: SPC will include clinical faculty and senior administrators. The
mission of this Committee is to identify, encourage, and actively support extramurally funded
Page 1 of 2
Page 169 of 170

 projects, to foster collaboration, and to ensure alignment of activities with the mission and values of
CCHHS.
2) Extramural Funding Administration: EFA will provide day to day financial and operating
management of sponsored programs conducted at CCHHS. The EFA will report to the CFO and will
be led by a three person team with the following primary functions;
 Manage internal and outsourced grant accounting and administration.
 Work with external fiscal agents and collaborators on pre-award and post-award responsibilities.
 Assist investigators in writing non-technical portions of grants
 Develop and maintain a repository of needed demographic data on CCHHS facilities / patients,
proformas and precedent documents to facilitate grant writing.
 Develop budgets for protocols/programs.
 Streamline and track internal approvals.
 Facilitate the operation of institutional research policies such as protected time and distribution of
Indirect Costs recovered from sponsors.
These additional resources will be funded from incremental indirect cost recoveries generated from more
efficient revenue capture on existing grants and the increased volume of extramural sponsorship.
In support of these new procedural elements new policies will be established and existing policies relating
to research at CCHHS will be reviewed and updated if necessary.
Collaborations
The workgroup also identified the need for an improved framework for collaboration with academic
institutions locally, regionally and nationally. CCHHS already participates in a number of national
cooperative research programs and this is a trend that is actively encouraged by grant sponsoring
institutions. CCHHS is exploring the expansion of a number of our existing collaborations.
Fiduciary Agents
As CCHHS develops its infrastructure it will still need to continue using third party fiscal agents to assist in
carrying out extramural sponsored programs. However, improved CCHHS infrastructure will allow us to
ensure greater qualification, transparency and control of external fiscal agents. To this end we anticipate
issuing a Request For Information/Qualifications to identify multiple entities to fulfil these critical functions.
Next Steps
The workgroup is working with legal and financial representatives to finalize the operational details in order
to proceed with:
i.
Implementing the physician workgroup recommendations to permit the pursuit and operation of a
significantly increased level of sponsored funding.
ii.
Seeking new improved relationships with fiscal agents to secure managerial and financial
efficiencies in the operation of sponsored programs.
