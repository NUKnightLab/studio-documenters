 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Executive Summary

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

AMRP Program Background
The accompanying report provides the results of an examination by The Liberty Consulting Group
(“Liberty”) of the Accelerated Main Replacement Program (“AMRP”) that Peoples Gas Light and
Coke Company (“Peoples Gas” or “Company”) began in 2011. A senior Liberty team having
lengthy backgrounds in utility management (including natural gas system engineering,
construction, operations, and safety analysis experience), complemented with customer service
and regulatory management experience, completed this investigation.
Overall Conclusions
From a positive perspective, the AMRP program has proven essentially functional in replacing
high-risk, leak-prone cast iron and ductile iron pipe with new plastic pipe that should not leak. The
AMRP has used a sound approach to physical configuration, reasonably-effective engineering and
construction standards, experienced contractors selected through competitive solicitations, and
materials well suited to providing leak risk reduction, pressure increase, and meter relocation.
However, management of the AMRP beginning with the Integrys board of directors down to the
field supervision level has not been effective enough to support program needs sufficiently.
Liberty’s year-long investigation disclosed a lack of management expression or understanding of:
(a) likely overall program costs, (b) likely program duration relative to targeted completion of
leak-prone pipe replacement by 2030, and (c) the reasons why leak rates have not fallen
significantly after four years of accelerated replacement of cast iron and ductile iron mains. The
fundamental drivers of overall AMRP success should have much greater attention. Liberty also
found a need for major changes designed to optimize cost, schedule, and effectiveness. The
Company needs to make these changes to raise management, control, and oversight to a level that
Liberty considers reasonable for a program of the size, scope, and duration of the AMRP.
The significance, breadth, and immediacy of the improvements needed prompted Liberty to begin
discussions with senior Integrys and Peoples Gas leadership in September 2014. Liberty’s January
2015 interim report provides the results of those discussions, which produced general agreement
on improvement needs. Management described for Liberty, and has begun to implement, a series
of initiatives designed to make AMRP changes. Those changes will require massive effort and in
some cases more than a year to complete. Liberty’s accompanying final investigation report
identifies a more extensive list of appropriate changes, and describes the reasons for making the
changes (and those addressed in the interim report) necessary.
Getting a Handle on Program Drivers
Combining leak-prone pipe replacement with pressure increase and meter relocation work
promotes installation efficiency, but raises concerns about prioritizing pipe replacement work.
Peoples Gas limits annual expenditures to amounts not exceeding what Rider QIP allows for
accelerated rate recovery. It will take replacement of about 100 miles of pipe annually to meet the
AMRP’s 2030 completion target. The actual rate from 2011 through 2014 has been significantly
below that level. The Company’s lack of reliable installation targets and data on completed work
preclude both Peoples Gas and Liberty from estimating resulting overall schedule slippage with a
meaningful degree of accuracy. Liberty’s use of the limited data available indicates a loss of a year
or so. Losing a year to schedule in only four years of operation makes it appropriate to question
the Company’s current ability to complete high-risk pipe replacement by, or even close to, 2030.

The lack of sufficient information, however, precludes the ability for Liberty to offer a
determination of the likely schedule and completion date for the AMRP.
The Company has much to do to improve its management systems to a level that supports a reliable
schedule for AMRP completion. It should place a high priority on making that improvement.
Despite significant acceleration of gas main replacements (up from about 40 miles per year prior
to the AMRP’s 2011 inception), leak rates have not fallen materially in the last several years.
Before adjustments for accidental hits and harsh weather, leak rates have actually increased. The
Company uses a good method for identifying leaks and assessing resulting safety risks. However,
the persistence of high leak rates makes it timely to reexamine the criteria (and the weight given
to them) used to prioritize risk, and to decide what pipe to replace next. More importantly, adding
pressure increase work and meter relocation work to leak-prone pipe replacement work can delay
replacement of all but the very highest-risk gas mains, and extend the duration of the AMRP.
Coordination of AMRP work with City of Chicago street work also has potentially significant
AMRP implications. There is no guarantee that the City’s work plans, which Peoples Gas said will
expand significantly in coming years, will coincide with high-priority pipe replacement needs. The
Company adjusts AMRP replacement schedules to advance work to match City plans (thus
avoiding, for example, a moratorium on utility street work following City repaving). A substantial
increase in City work thus threatens to delay higher-risk gas main replacements further. The
persistence of high leak rates makes these issues critical for Peoples Gas to address promptly.
The AMRP experienced unusually large cost growth across its short history to date. The 2009
estimate of $2.63 billion grew to $4.45 billion in a 2012 estimate. The Company has announced
no estimate since. In addition to being out of date, this 2012 estimate includes no consideration of
inflation or contingency to cover unforeseen costs. When the Company finally completes a
credible estimate it should move substantially higher in cost. Liberty learned in mid-2014 that the
Company did not believe it had the modeling capability to produce a credible total program
estimate. More than six months later, the program remains without that new estimate. Liberty does
not know when the new estimate will emerge. Liberty considers AMRP program costs very likely
to experience a material increase from the 2012 estimate, when AMRP management provides a
new one. The nature and quality of current information, however, preclude Liberty from offering
a determination of likely annual and total AMRP costs.
Continued use of a flawed and significantly outdated cost estimate demonstrates a major gap in
AMRP management. The inability even to prepare a credible estimate raises a fundamental
concern about the quality of AMRP management, control, and oversight.

Management, Control, and Oversight Improvements
Many AMRP management, control, and oversight weaknesses have contributed to current
uncertainty about cost and schedule. Correcting these management failures will give opportunities
for optimizing AMRP program efficiency and effectiveness. First, Peoples Gas must bring all
AMRP management functions now located at Peoples Gas and at Integrys into one organization
headed by one program manager. Second, Peoples Gas must assign sufficient numbers of
dedicated, skilled resources to work solely on AMRP. The program should not continue to compete
with non-AMRP work for resources. Third, the new organization requires a full-time program
manager based in Chicago, where AMRP work occurs. Fourth, the program manager must staff
the management team with internal resources that displace many of the currently used consultants.
The priorities of the new organization must include development of a long-term program
management organization approach, matching required resources against current capabilities,
finding ways to meet short- and long-term resource gaps, instilling a commitment to active and
holistic cost management, and creating and effectively using skilled organizations and tools to
prepare credible cost, schedule, and resource plans and estimates.
Liberty has also identified a number of opportunities for improving the efficiency, effectiveness,
and safety of field work, and for strengthening engineering and construction standards. In
particular, employee safety requires a dedicated, executive-led focus and Company commitment,
as Liberty’s work some five years ago for this Commission found.
Liberty particularly emphasizes the need for AMRP program and project reporting to improve in
fundamental ways. The Company’s data collection does not support a sharp and well-supported
analysis of key program cost and schedule drivers. The existence of a suitable, well-informed
analysis of those drivers comprises an essential element of best practice. It will take substantial
skills additions, data collection, and reporting changes, and a commitment to continuous
performance analysis to make this element an effective component of AMRP management,
control, and oversight. Developing the required analytical capability should be a major priority.
Making the changes required will also lay the basis for improved senior executive and board of
director oversight of the AMRP. The structure of executive oversight has been cumbersome,
reporting has not highlighted the right information in the volumes of data presented, senior
leadership has not received focused analysis of performance issues, and oversight has not produced
a clear trail of problem identification, solution adoption, and follow-up.
Integrys and Peoples Gas have a great deal to accomplish to attain the “world class” status their
senior leadership acknowledges as the appropriate one for AMRP management, control, and
oversight. Prompt, full execution of the announced initiatives would make a strong, primary
contribution. Still, meeting the full range of needs identified in Liberty’s report will have to occur
and be sustained to reach this status. The size and complexity of the required changes, especially
in view of historical program difficulties, warrant retention of outside assistance to move the
change processes forward expeditiously, while assuring more than nominal improvement.

4. Gas mains and lengths intended for replacement each year
5. Determination of likely schedule required for program completion
6. Likely annual and total program costs
7. Development of a method for Commission monitoring of AMRP cost and progress
8. Appropriateness of program and project planning and scheduling
9. Program and project cost estimating methods and accuracy
10. Managing City permits and communication; material procurement
11. Program budgeting process and relationship to construction scheduling
12. Methods and factors considered in prioritizing replacements
13. Program and project management methods and practices
14. Facility engineering and design
15. Construction standards for new facilities installed
16. Construction methods, policies, and practices; right-of-way acquisition
17. Oversight of work quality and conformance to specifications
18. Conformance of work to plans, designs, and construction and materials standards
19. Use of subsurface investigation services and geophysical techniques
20. Procedures and practices for addressing unexpected field conditions
21. Methods for gaining access to indoor meters and cutting services over to new facilities
22. Quality and appropriateness of construction materials
23. Materials purchasing policies, procedures, and practices
24. Construction contract award policies, procedures, and practices
25. Contractor experience, qualifications, and training
26. Permit acquisition methods and timing
27. Relationship and communications with other public and business entities
28. Information and schedule sharing and plan coordination with the City of Chicago
29. City of Chicago issues regarding Peoples Gas and its work practices
30. Inspections of active AMRP construction sites
31. Violations and failures to follow government safety standards

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter B: Report Summary

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chapter B: Report Summary
1. The Peoples Gas Distribution System
The Peoples Gas system shares many characteristics in common with older, U.S. metropolitan
systems that distribute natural gas. Most significant in the AMRP context are large numbers of
cast and ductile iron mains, services also employing risk-prone materials, low-pressure operation,
large numbers of meters located inside customer buildings, and significant difficulty and expense
in gaining access to facilities located under city streets. The Peoples Gas system employs about
4,200 miles of main. Cast and ductile iron mains, some installed as far back as the 1800s, made up
about 40 percent of that total at the end of 2013. These 1,648 miles constituted the country’s fourth
largest inventory of such pipe at that time. Low pressure systems, frequently a legacy of the
industry’s early days of locally manufactured gas, also present safety risks not found in more
modern, medium pressure systems. Newer medium pressure systems also have capacity more
appropriate to supporting system expansion and increasing customer applications for and use of
natural gas.
Peoples Gas addresses cast and ductile iron replacement, system pressure increase, and the
movement of meters from inside to outside customer buildings through a commonly managed
program. The program focuses primarily on an approach that brings all three improvements
simultaneously to those City of Chicago neighborhoods designated for work over the long course
of the AMRP. The approach varies from the more traditional industry configuration of a single
main down the middle of the street to serve customers on both sides. The Company’s “double
decking” method uses two mains (generally located in the “parkway” adjoining streets), each
serving customers on its side of the street. Double decking imposes significant addition of
materials, but avoids a significant portion of the substantial costs and restrictions imposed by the
City on work involving street openings.
Liberty found that Peoples Gas has a sound knowledge of the numbers and locations of its problem
mains and services. The high number of these facilities warrants a much accelerated method for
accomplishing their replacement. The combined approach to managing work (pipe replacement,
pressure increase, and meter relocation) is generally appropriate, subject to careful consideration
of highest-risk facilities. Similarly, despite the added cost of double decking, it too reflects an
appropriate method, given City requirements. Liberty’s investigations also found, however, that
the Company needs to address a number of issues associated with its massive, long-term program
for system safety and operational improvements:
 The system suffers very large numbers of damaging incidents from third-parties working
in proximity to gas facilities.
 Peoples Gas has areas (as do other large municipal suppliers) that experience pressure
drops in extremely cold weather. These pressure drops impose service reliability risks. A
large number (88) of those areas exist, according to Company analysis. The factors used to
prioritize work should include the ability to sustain adequate operating pressure.
 Service valves provide important operating and safety risk mitigation devices. Good
practice requires verification of their operability. Peoples Gas does not, but should
routinely audit operability, and establish a metric that supports application of an operability
target for these devices.

Industry practice calls for testing medium-pressure mains and services at 100 psig. Such
testing supports increase, for example, to 60 psig in the future. Peoples Gas tests only to
50 psig. This practice reduces flexibility to upgrade new installations to higher pressure in
the future, where and as may be required.

2. AMRP Definition and Status
By any measure, the AMRP involves one of the country’s largest utility construction programs of
any type. Its scope includes the replacement of high-risk, leak-prone (the two terms are used
interchangeably in this report) gas mains and services. They consist principally of cast-iron and
ductile-iron pipe, generally of very old vintage. Peoples Gas has an unusually high amount of such
old, high-risk pipe The Illinois legislature authorized expedited recovery from customers of costs
incurred for the replacement, pressure-increase, and meter relocation work. A Qualifying
Infrastructure Plan Surcharge provides across a five-year term for the recovery of expenditures for
these purposes.
Since AMRP inception in 2011, costs have been rising, work appears to have fallen behind the
pace required to support 2030 completion, and leak rates have not fallen substantially, even though
replacement of leak-prone pipe has accelerated.
The AMRP calls for the replacement of high-risk facilities across a 20-year duration, expecting to
end in 2030. The massive quantities planned as part of leak-prone pipe replacement, pressure
increase, and meter relocation include:
 Mains: 3,056 miles installed, 2,028 miles retired
 Services: 296,391
 Meters: 406,927
 Interstation High Pressure: 63 miles
 Pressure Regulator Stations: 325 abandoned, 51 new
 City Gate Station Additions: 2.
The current estimate of total program costs by Peoples Gas amounts to $4.45 billion. It appears
that this amount will soon grow substantially, as the Company completes current work on a total
program re-estimate. Peoples Gas prepared the current, $4.45 billion estimate in 2012. The
Company has not provided another estimate since. Management acknowledged to Liberty in mid2014 that it did not have (but was developing) the capability to prepare a new, credible total
program estimate. The AMRP is too important and creates too much financial risk for Peoples Gas
and its stakeholders to have continued without a credible estimate of cost for so long.
The lack of a sound estimate and a lack of cost detail in AMRP reporting make it impracticable
for anyone, management included, to forecast total costs at present. Liberty therefore cannot
provide a determination of likely AMRP costs. The data that is available, however, indicate
significant cost exposure above the current $4.45 billion estimate. Peoples Gas has cited changes
in the requirements of Chicago’s Department of Transportation with respect to work affecting City
streets as a major source of unexpected costs, thus acknowledging, at least qualitatively, that costs
have exceeded expectations.

Phase One Final Report

Chapter B: Report Summary

Like cost, the schedule of the AMRP also faces significant uncertainty and risk. Peoples Gas has
managed the AMRP to limit annual expenditures to the amount that qualifies for expedited
recovery under the Qualifying Infrastructure Plan Surcharge. Extrapolating progress made and
costs incurred to date would suggest an AMRP duration of longer than 20 years. Across its first
four years of operation, replacement-rate data suggests a schedule loss already of perhaps a year
or more. One can only roughly gauge schedule loss, given the significant gaps in the information
that AMRP management reports. Management has observed, however, that uncertainty about
expedited rate recovery (accompanied by a late start to the 2014 construction season due to harsh
winter weather leading up to it) has caused progress to lag. The focus on limiting spending to the
amounts that qualify annually for Qualifying Infrastructure Plan Surcharge recovery, the short
duration set for such recovery, and the effect that recovery uncertainty has had in the past call into
question the nature of the Company’s commitment to a 20-year duration for replacing high-risk
pipe. The quality of the information available makes it impossible for Liberty to provide a
determination of the AMRP’s likely schedule and completion date.
Examining changes in leak rates comprises a principal means for assessing the effectiveness of
efforts to replace high-risk, leak-prone pipe. Acceleration of pipe replacement should reduce leak
rates, but it has not. Instead, leak rates have risen in recent years. Peoples Gas would adjust those
rates to account for: (a) accidental pipe hits that produce ruptures, and (b) recent, harsh winter
weather. The latter factor causes ground movement that produces leaks. Even accepting the
validity of the Company’s adjustments, its analysis shows only a marginal reduction in leak rates.
The scope of Liberty’s AMRP investigation included an assessment of reasonablenes, and
prudence, and whether the installations made are used and useful. The investigation requested a
forward-looking examination of the AMRP. Even a future examination relies to a significant extent
on where the program stands today and how it arrived there. In Liberty’s view, the management
of the AMRP falls short of good utility practice in some ways and short of best practices (or the
“world class” standard that senior Company leadership accepts as a valid comparator) in others.
Liberty’s examination did not, however, seek to render judgments about the past or to quantify any
harm that may have resulted from a failure of prior management to conform to the standards by
which the Illinois Commerce Commission may ultimately judge past performance. Liberty’s work
did seek to identify areas of future improvement. The standard applied in seeking such
identification was “optimization.” There generally exists a substantial range of performance
between prudent and optimum. Liberty’s work did not look only for improvements that would
bring performance to the minimum levels required to be deemed prudent. The work also sought
improvement opportunities that would move already sound performance forward; i.e., if the team
could find means to make the good even better it would identify them.
That said, Liberty undertook to answer the following prudence question, which conforms to the
generally forward-looking nature of this engagement:
Were Peoples Gas to determine to continue the AMRP in the future largely as it has been
and is doing now, could one conclude that the program is being performed reasonably and
prudently, in the absence of at least substantial changes along the lines recommended to
improve future performance?

The used and useful question presents somewhat different considerations. Liberty’s work does
enable a broadly applicable answer to the used and useful question in a historical and forwardlooking context. Liberty formed the used and useful question to be answered by this study as
follows:
Should the AMRP work performed to date be deemed used and useful, and is program work
planned for the future calculated to be so?
Company leadership has described a “stop-and-start” approach to the AMRP’s early years, driven
largely by uncertainty in rate recovery issues. The Company also cited changes in City
requirements associated with issues such as the extent of street paving, improvements to pedestrian
crossings at intersections, and boring techniques. Those factors may bear on a retrospective
examination of prudence. However, looking at prudence from a current perspective makes those
factors marginal, at most.
With conformity to good utility practice as a guide, Liberty found a significant number of gaps in
AMRP management, control, and oversight. One should anticipate an initial, material level of
inefficiency and a gradual development of adequate management, control, and oversight
approaches, resources and methods over an early shakeout period. The AMRP introduced a large
and likely unprecedented “shock” to the corporate systems of Integrys and Peoples Gas. Liberty
would have expected a number of the attributes forming the focus of the recommendations in this
report to have taken time to develop and evolve. Particularly for companies operating in the gas
delivery business, programs of this magnitude have arrived newly in corporate history and
evolution. Thus the lack of institutional experience and familiarity with a program like the AMRP
justifies a learning curve in identifying the particular management challenges presented.
Interestingly, the use of PwC as a source of outside expertise early in the program’s history gave
an opportunity to shorten that curve. Peoples Gas seized this opportunity early in the AMRP’s
evolution, but did not follow through on it with sufficient aggressiveness.
Liberty concluded that the Company moved more slowly than appropriate to the AMRP’s needs
in developing approaches, organizations, resources, plans, estimates, schedules, and processes and
tools important for ensuring effective and efficient AMRP planning and performance. Liberty
answers the prudence question it considers appropriate in light of this investigation’s scope as
follows:
It would be unreasonable and imprudent for Peoples Gas to continue the AMRP in the
future largely as it has been and is doing now. The program requires substantial
compliance with the recommendations of this report to bring it into sufficient conformity
with good utility practice and to incorporate best practices appropriate to the program’s
scope, duration, and public importance.
The concept of “used and useful” in utility ratemaking often becomes merged with the concept of
prudence. Liberty’s definition for purposes of this report separates them. The test that Liberty
applied examines whether operation of the facilities involved provide benefit to customers,
whether the existence of those facilities provides a needed service, or whether the facilities stand
ready to meet a near and present service need. In general, Liberty views as already settled for
Peoples Gas the question of whether replacing cast- and ductile-iron pipe, relocating meters from
the insides of customer premises, and upgrading delivery systems to medium pressure can be
May 5, 2015

deemed to provide customer benefits. Legislative and regulatory policy appear to compel the
conclusion that they do. Therefore, Liberty did not undertake to question whether producing these
three results does in fact benefit customers.
Liberty’s examination, which included substantial field investigations of work sites and
observations of active installations, confirmed that the nature and general quality of the work
support its use to accomplish all three improvements that public policy deems to provide benefit
to customers. Liberty’s field work found some instances of substandard installation, but at nowhere
near the degree required to question the ability of the installations to replace high-risk pipe, to
occasion the removal of meters to locations outside customer premises, and to upgrade the systems
serving Chicago neighborhoods from low- to medium-pressure.
The materials and equipment being installed suit these purposes. This report addresses concerns
regarding the failure to achieve significant reductions in leak rates, despite acceleration of main
replacements under the AMRP. In major part, those concerns relate to the combination of
performing high-risk pipe removal and to bringing entire neighborhoods to medium pressure as
factors in prioritizing work. The concern lies in the degree to which adding other considerations
to the work prioritization process may produce an under-emphasis on the AMRP-specific risks of
high-risk pipe. Persistence of high leak rates may well occasion a public consideration of the
balance among the objectives, but not to a degree that calls into question the usefulness of work
already performed.
A related consideration is the current inability of Peoples Gas to quantify the operating costs,
savings, and benefits of meter relocations and pressure changes. The Company cited them in
support of its plans. Liberty places importance on the ability to calculate operating cost savings
and benefits, as a continuing test of the “value” produced by relocating meters and increasing
pressure.
The vastly increased costs that Peoples Gas experienced and likely will continue experiencing for
AMRP, pressure increase, and meter relocation heighten the importance of ensuring a proper
overall limit on the use of capital. Expenditures involve a magnitude that substantially affects
customer rates. Leak rates from cast- and ductile-iron pipes failed to decrease substantially,
expenditures have run far greater than anticipated originally, and further, substantial increases are
highly likely (albeit indeterminable at present, given existing limits on cost modeling and
estimating capacity). Questions with public interest implications thus do not limit themselves
simply to determining whether all three system enhancements (iron pipe replacement, meter
relocation, and pressure increase) meet the used and useful test. When one considers the likely rate
increase consequences, questions arise about which type of enhancements prove most used and
useful and how to balance expenditures among them.
Liberty answers the used and useful question it considers appropriate in light of this investigation’s
scope as follows:
AMRP work performed to date is used and useful. Program work planned for the future is
generally calculated to be so. Nevertheless, the large and growing cost of the AMRP and
the failure of leak rates to fall substantially in the wake of accelerated replacement invite

consideration of the proper balance among replacement, pressure increase, and meter
relocation work and costs.

3. AMRP Management Plan
A program like the AMRP requires an integrated, multi-layered set of plans. At the top of this
planning hierarchy one should find a master plan (referred to sometimes as the Plan for
Management). Beneath and integrated with this master plan should lie a more detailed plan of
execution. At the lowest level of the planning pyramid rest the basic building blocks for setting
and measuring against detailed performance targets for cost, schedule, production, quality, and
resource requirements. An effective master plan should describe at a high level expected program
scope, cost, quantities, schedule, expectations, and resources. Answering the question, “What is
the AMRP?” should form the focus of this highest level plan. At the next planning level, the plan
of execution, “How will we manage the AMRP?” should become the focus. This plan of execution
should address the approach to managing the program as a whole, the approach for managing the
program’s individual projects, the organizations responsible for each area of management focus,
the cost and schedule programs that apply, means for assuring quality, the forms that high-level
oversight takes, and the controls that management will employ.
At the outset of the AMRP, Peoples Gas created the Project Execution Plan. It included a level of
detail that gave it the characteristics of the second hierarchical planning level. The AMRP did not
have then or now a summary-level master plan document. The Project Execution Plan represented
a strong initial effort, but fell quickly into disuse. Management has not updated it and the plan does
not appear to have a continuing, vital role in addressing overall AMRP planning.
The AMRP warrants a world class organizational approach, as senior Integrys and Peoples Gas
leadership acknowledges. The size, duration, and public importance of the program call for an
approach that reflects broad application of industry best practices. The AMRP management
organization, however, exhibited no such strength. Efforts to build an organization that brings a
full range of skill categories and strong owner participation has not been a priority. Plans to build
an organization that reflect a truly integrated group of Company and contracted resources have
given way to a contractor dominated AMRP management organization. Management has built the
organization without:
 A clear assessment of needed skills existing and required to be acquired or developed
 Actions designed to support a long-term organization
 Providing for a sufficiently strong and active level of owner participation
 Employing full-time, Chicago-based program management
 Effectively integrating the planning and execution of contractor versus employee-based
work activities
 Sufficiently integrating the planning and execution of employee-based AMRP work with
normal duties
 Succession planning for key positions.
The Company’s use of a matrix approach to program management (relying on a combination of
Peoples Gas, Integrys, and contractor personnel) has proven particularly unsuitable to meeting
AMRP needs. A matrix approach is a respected one for many industry applications. Nevertheless,
May 5, 2015

Phase One Final Report

Chapter B: Report Summary

ICC14GAS0002

the size and complexity of the AMRP, combined with barriers to effective integration of Peoples
Gas and Integrys resources, create a strong preference for a dedicated group operating under single
management. Moreover, poor performance during the program’s early years underscores the
validity of that preference here. Another aspect that has detracted from the cohesiveness of
program management arises from over-reliance on contracted resources from an outside firm. The
firm has a strong industry reputation, but Liberty found the degree of reliance placed on contracted
personnel too strong. Few internal Company resources populate the management team. The
program manager, an Integrys employee, is based outside of Chicago. Other Integrys members of
the program management team occupy more peripheral, rather than central roles. Peoples Gas is
not represented on this team, but manages its AMRP work under separate authority and
accountability.
The Company needs, as a matter of first priority, to re-examine the now disused Project Execution
Plan. The plan needs a fundamental overhaul to bring it up to date and to fully address AMRP
needs. In undertaking this plan revision, the Company needs specifically to address the failure of
the initial plan to remain vital, in order to ensure that its replacement does not fall into disuse as
well.
Peoples Gas should accompany this new Project Execution Plan with a summary level master plan
addressing the overall approach to key program parameters, including:
 Establishing a valid cost estimate using enhanced estimating, modeling and processes
 Developing realistic short-and long-term schedules, which need to integrate engineering,
permitting, construction, and completion activities
 Creating a structured, comprehensive set of resource planning processes that address
staffing and contractor use strategies, integration of AMRP and non-AMRP work by
Peoples Gas employees, training and development needs, and important production and
productivity measurements
 Instituting a cost management program that promotes a culture of cost control, and supports
it with skilled resources, critical performance analysis, and management and executive
level direction and oversight
 Employing a program that controls upward scope “creep” that unduly threatens program
cost and schedule on any program having characteristics similar to those of the AMRP
 Seeking contracting and procurement approaches that take full advantage of opportunities
the AMRP provides for favorable contractor, supplier, and vendor agreements.
Developing a sound, long-term organizational approach presents a critical challenge. Peoples Gas
needs to reorganize its approach to overall AMRP management to provide for a stronger, locallybased employee contingent within the organization. The Company needs to bring under a single
senior leader the responsibility and accountability for both the contractor- and employeeperformed work in the areas of planning, execution, and measurement. A structured assessment of
current skills gaps relative to program management needs must occur in the near term.
Development needs over the duration of the program (and consideration of what management,
leadership, and technical skills will be built for internal use after its end) also require assessment
and the creation of plans and programs for fulfilling those needs.

4. Risk Assessment and Replacement Prioritization
Best practice calls for the use of sophisticated methods for prioritizing pipe replacement. Such
methods should specifically and analytically assess the risks of breaks in pipe of various types,
vintages, and locations. Peoples Gas has used generally suitable means for assessing risk and for
prioritizing replacement for many years. The Company’s methods underwent outside review some
time ago.
At AMRP inception, Peoples Gas used its “Main Ranking Index” to apply information about pipe
characteristics in a manner that produces numerical rankings of risk. The highest ranked pipe
segments have priority in replacement prioritization. In 2013, the Company began to apply a
“neighborhood” approach. Dividing the City into 228 zones, this approach combines AMRP work
with a program of updating system pressures and relocating meters from the inside to the outside
of customer buildings. This other work qualifies for accelerated recovery under the legislatively
authorized Qualifying Infrastructure Plan Surcharge.
The introduction of the neighborhood approach created a sound overall means for combining
AMRP work with the other two priorities created by the Qualifying Infrastructure Plan Surcharge.
Liberty also observed that the Company follows its existing ranking systems in prioritizing work.
Liberty found counterintuitive and troubling, however, the failure of accelerated replacement to
produce a more substantial rate of leak reduction. The Company has not recently analyzed the
continuing validity of its ranking criteria and the weightings assigned to them. In particular, the
weight given to main installed before 1920 raises questions. Peoples Gas needs to examine the
continuing validity of those criteria and weightings in light of the failure of leaks to fall as
replacement work has accelerated. Should that examination confirm their validity, then Peoples
Gas still needs to examine means for refocusing efforts to bring leak rates down faster.
City street work has for some time formed a factor in prioritizing work, given, for example, bans
on street work after City repaving. A planned, substantial increase in such work by the City may
cause further diversion away from replacing highest-risk pipe first. This projected increase brings
more importance to ensuring that expenditures go sufficiently to the replacement of highest-risk
pipe.
Sound prioritization also depends on the accuracy and completeness of data. Best practice calls for
the use of a quality assurance and control program to ensure data adequacy. Peoples Gas does not
have, and needs to adopt and apply, such a program. The Company also needs to add soils
information to its roster of data used for prioritizing replacements. Building a data base of soil
conditions across the City will permit Peoples Gas, as AMRP work proceeds, to determine in an
analytically supportable way the degree to which different soil conditions may affect leak risk for
its mains and services.
Risk reduction should comprise the highest priority in identifying and prioritizing replacement
work. Peoples Gas has in the past justified expenditures on the basis of savings in ongoing
operations and maintenance costs as well. Liberty would strongly emphasize the continuing
primacy of high-risk pipe replacement, particularly given the lack of significant decline in leak
rates. Nevertheless, the Company does not have a method for soundly analyzing the differences in
operations and maintenance costs with and without work performed to replace leak-prone pipe,

increase system pressure, and move meters outside. Peoples Gas has expressed a commitment to
developing this capacity, which it should establish with dispatch, and then rigorously and
continually apply.

5. Cost Planning
A long-term cost plan provides an important foundation for planning and managing AMRP work.
The long-term estimate originally made for the AMRP used a comprehensive set of assumptions,
sound methods, and adequate scope definition. The estimate used reasonable for the time estimates
for materials, labor rates, and annual production rates. Assumptions regarding engineering costs,
unit meter installation rates, contractor unit costs, appeared low, however. The estimate did not
consider contingency, nor did it address cost and schedule risks quantifiably or analytically. It also
did not treat ramp-up and demobilization costs effectively.
The 2009 estimate projected $2.63 billion in total costs, which grew to $4.45 billion under a 2012
estimate. This nearly three year old estimate remains the latest produced. With estimated quantities
remaining largely the same, the major sources of cost growth have come in unit rates for work on
mains, services, and meters.
Neither management nor public stakeholders should consider the most recent estimate a reliable
indicator of final AMRP costs. Reports to Liberty of the pendency of a new estimate in mid-2014
turned into an announcement of commencement of a program that would first have to build the
cost modeling capability needed to produce a credible estimate. The lack of such a capability so
deep into the planned length of the program reflects a significant gap. It is discouraging that a new
estimate still remains sometime off in the future more than half a year later.
Another factor diminishing confidence in Company knowledge of costs arises from lack of
monitoring of quantities, unit costs, and productivity at a detailed level. Management (and in turn
senior leadership and board oversight) requires reporting and analysis of at least such data to gauge
the continuing reliability of the total AMRP cost estimate. Finally, management has not applied
(and monitored the rate of consumption of) contingency or reserve. That lack does not comport
with good practice on a program of the AMRP’s size, complexity, and duration. The program
remains exposed to internal and external sources of cost risk over time.
As a result, the AMRP currently operates without a long-term cost plan and a credible estimate of
final program costs. Efforts remain underway to correct this deficiency, but it should not exist at
this stage of the program. Development of such a plan and estimate need to address long-term cost
risk through an analytical and managed approach to contingency or reserve use. Management
needs to accompany the development of a long-term cost plan and estimate with a substantially
restructured and strengthened program for collecting the data that enable it to understand and
quantify the impacts of major program cost drivers. Doing so will support cost optimization efforts
and keep management, senior leadership, and outside stakeholders informed on a current basis
about final program costs and risks that threaten estimates of those costs.

6. Schedule Planning
The AMRP uses a projected annual spending amount to drive schedules. No long term schedule
exists. Rather, the approach taken effectively assumes that the Company will meet (or not meet)
twenty-year target program duration to the extent that pre-set spending limits end up supporting
the roughly 100 miles per year pace required. The first four AMRP years have produced an annual
rate of only 70 miles. This pace suggests the existence of a substantial threat to program completion
in 2030. Liberty found no Company analysis of the impact of the rate to date on the ability to
complete work in the planned 20 years. Liberty also found no evidence of recovery plans seeking
to support completion by 2030. Liberty concluded from these circumstances that an annual
spending limit, rather than targeting 2030 completion, serves as the driver of work scheduling.
Short-term scheduling addresses the work of contractors, who perform main and service
installations. It has not addressed engineering, design, or permitting. Short-term scheduling has
also not integrated the work performed by internal Peoples Gas crews. Contractors operate under
management by the Integrys Project Management Office. This Office operates under the Integrys
Business Support group. The Peoples Gas work focuses on making customer connections to the
replaced mains and services (e.g., tie-ins of new to existing mains, moving meters from inside to
outside customer facilities, retirement of old mains, gassing in customer buildings, relighting
customer appliances, relocating interior piping because of meter movement to the outside, and
other associated customer work).
The lack of schedule integration for all groups and activities supporting AMRP work has
contributed to problems in timely and effective work completion, and in managing relationships
with the City of Chicago. Meeting permitting requirements for work in public rights-of-way
comprises a central AMRP work element. Peoples Gas states that it has begun efforts to integrate
these short-term schedules in a way that will support efficient and effective work performance.
Executing the announced plans to place contractor and Peoples Gas Crew work under a single
source of day-to-day direction from a Peoples Gas-led manager should also improve work
integration.
Program management also needs to build installation quantity and personnel resource components
into scheduling. Management needs to complete work now under way to build time-based quantity
(production) targets into project schedules, in order to provide a better gauge of the rate at which
work progresses. Resource availability, particularly within Peoples Gas, has proven a barrier to
timely and effective work completion. The Company needs to consider all work performed by its
internal crews (not just AMRP work), in order to produce meaningful expectations about what
AMRP work those crews can accomplish and to identify required resource augmentation. The
Company also needs to develop and apply a structured and comprehensive program for identifying
recurring issues affecting schedule progress. Management then needs to analyze regularly the
information gained to assess the degree to which annual work (scheduled and performed) supports
2030 AMRP completion.

7. Resource Planning
The AMRP will require very large amounts of contractor and internal labor across a 20-year
duration. Effective resource planning requires balancing work among these two sources of

personnel, considering overtime and shift work, securing favorable work rules, analyzing long
term craft resource availability, and providing for sufficient training and development.
AMRP management has not prepared or used long-term resource plans to support optimization of
AMRP work. In the short term, the contractor/employee balance and the efforts to promote
efficient work rules have proven sound. However, for the longer term, Peoples Gas needs to
develop a meaningful level of internal capability to perform main and service installation. This
capability can serve as a hedge against the increased strain on contractor resources that could result
from increased use of accelerated pipe-replacement programs across the country. The Company
also needs to adopt a structured approach to determining resource allocation and to determining
the optimum use of overtime and shift work.

8. Scope Control
Controlling the scope of any megaproject or massive program like the AMRP requires dedicated
focus and constant attention. Like performance and execution problems (e.g., productivity)
changes in design, project requirements, and other drivers of total work can present worrisome
sources of cost increase. The importance that leak-prone pipe replacement plays in public safety
makes delay another critical variable to consider in controlling program scope. At the program and
at the senior leadership oversight levels, AMRP scope control has too narrow a focus. It focuses
overwhelmingly on contractor change requests. Addressing such requests carefully has merit, but
Peoples Gas needs to add a program level view of scope control. The AMRP budget grew from
$2.63 billion in 2010, rose to $4.45 billion in 2012, and appears destined for another significant
increase after the Company completes efforts required to support a new, credible estimate. The
Company needs to develop a more broad and structured scope control program, consisting of:
 A baseline supported by a credible total-duration estimate and schedule
 A process for promptly identifying changes to this baseline
 Technical analysis of proposed changes
 Structured assessments of the cost and schedule impacts of proposed changes
 A formal and documented process for management and senior leadership review and
approval of changes.

9. Cost Estimating
A sound approach to, organization for, tools supporting, and work products governing cost
estimating lie among the most critical resources for planning a program such as the AMRP. Beyond
the role of cost estimating in planning, however, comprehensive, current, reliable cost estimates
also play a central role in program and project management. Unfortunately, Liberty found the
AMRP operating in 2014 without the ability to establish a program cost estimate on a sound
footing. The program thus lacks a credible estimate. For a program already approaching $5 billion
dollars, that absence raises considerable concern. It is encouraging that Peoples Gas recognizes the
need for substantial strengthening of its estimating capabilities. Developing the capability must,
however, proceed with great dispatch and as a matter of first priority. The program simply cannot
continue long without a credible estimate. The lack of one not only substantially impairs the
Company’s ability to manage the program. It adds materially to stakeholder concern about how
large, long, and expensive the program will ultimately prove.

Developing the modeling tools required for sound capital and operating cost estimates, while a
critical starting point, will not alone prove sufficient. Peoples Gas needs to bring together what are
now fragmented groups responsible for cost estimating. This successor organization requires
formal guidelines and procedures, the introduction of professionals skilled in estimating (and
having sufficient technical knowledge of AMRP work requirements), and formal programs for
training personnel. The lack of regular updating of key cost inputs also detracts from estimate
reliability. Estimating also suffers from the lack of structured analysis of actual versus estimated
costs. Such analysis proves critical to maintaining current and reliable estimates.

10.Cost Management
The management of costs, particularly for large scale, long duration programs or projects like the
AMRP has moved well beyond an accounting focus. That traditional focus places primary
emphasis on cost data collection and reporting. How that information is used to optimize
performance has become the driving force behind best-practice concepts of cost management. The
AMRP, however, has operated in accord with that older and less useful concept. In significant part,
Liberty considers this approach a result of the use of annual budgets as the paramount work driver.
Spending up to the budget, but not over it emerged repeatedly as the mindset driving program
management, and in turn those responsible for reporting cost performance. One must consider
what role the limits on accelerated rate recovery have played in producing this focus.
Two principal concerns arise from this approach. First, the safety risk mitigation goals of the
AMRP require sustained production (i.e., replacement) levels. If not met, they both threaten a 20year completion goal and permit higher amounts of high-risk pipe to remain in operation longer.
Second, optimizing cost requires much more than examining conformity to total annual spending
levels. It requires analysis of the factors driving costs, in order to support the identification of
performance improvements. Liberty’s work shows the program already to have lost perhaps a year
of progress against overall program schedule. Cost performance also has not come near initial
expectations. Costs have grown by about 70 percent since 2009, and appear destined for another
significant increase in 2015.
Liberty recommended that Peoples Gas adopt a major change in addressing costs. The holistic
approach that would result involves:
 Adopting a robust cost-management culture that makes costs a priority
 Supporting that culture through strong and continuous executive commitment,
communication, and oversight
 Creating a structured plan that defines how cost management will occur and who will have
accountability for it
 Creating and using well-developed policies and procedures
 Developing supporting systems, tools, reports, and analytical skills.
The changes in organization, staffing, skills, tools, reporting, and analysis discussed in the
preceding cost estimating section will support this fundamental change in approach. Recently
begun Company initiatives to address AMRP needs include significant changes in cost estimating
and management. They do not, as yet, reflect a full transition to the holistic approach that Liberty
recommends. Reaching that state will involve a multi-year developmental period, given where the
program finds itself now.

11.Procurement and Contracting
The AMRP uses contractors to perform main and service installations, with Peoples Gas crews
responsible for making customer connections to the replaced mains and services. The costs
associated with these contracts drive the bulk of program costs. The costs and the very large scale
of work required from outside resources necessitate a structured and comprehensive method for
selecting and managing contractors. Use of contractors for this portion of AMRP work comprises
a sound approach. The Company, however, needs to examine use of internal resources for some
work, in recognition of the increasing focus across the country on leak-prone pipe replacement.
Developing an internal capability from which to leverage skills will operate as a hedge against any
large growth in demand for contractor resources in the coming years.
The packaging of work into a variety of “bundles” has supported participation in bidding by
contractors of differing sizes and by those occasionally experiencing limitations on large work
undertakings. The Company lets work under a competitive process. Peoples Gas has not, however,
sought long-term, partnership arrangements. Liberty believes that the AMRP lends itself to such
arrangements, given the attractiveness to potential contractors of a long-term, secure relationship,
subject to continued effective performance. A process for evaluating contractor performance
exists, but Liberty did not find evidence of its use in ranking contractors bidding on future work.
The arrangements with contractors employ fixed-price or unit-cost arrangements, which makes
change orders critical. The change order process governs contractor requests for increased
compensation to account for unforeseen developments. Those change orders produced nearly $150
million in added costs through 2014. Liberty did not find analysis of these changes in a manner or
at a level commensurate with their size. Moreover, Peoples Gas does not require contractors to
provide performance information, believing that the nature of the contracts places on contractors
risks of production and productivity shortfalls. This approach, however, fails to recognize the value
that such information has in assessing the validity of change requests and in estimating future work
cost and schedule requirements.
The AMRP requires very large amounts of material, generally consisting of fairly standard items.
Liberty found that the material procurement process supportive of program needs in a reasonably
efficient manner. As with contractors, however, Peoples Gas has yet to explore more aggressive
and creative ways of taking advantage of the AMRP’s scope and duration to develop creative
supply relationships.
Adequate systems exist to aggregate and manage material procurement and management. Data
confirm two measures of effectiveness; i.e., the absence of significant material delays and a general
lack of overstocking. However, the Company experienced a lag in 2014 production, accompanied
by an increase in material held in storerooms longer than expected. Project reports should address
this issue, in order to permit management to verify that transient production issues, rather than
problems in ordering, underlie any future imbalances in material availability.

12.Executive Oversight
The magnitude and duration of the AMRP require continuous attention by senior executive
leadership and by the gas and holding company boards of directors. Transparent priorities, goals,

Chapter B: Report Summary

and the forecasted time and costs required (and how they may change over time) are essential.
Public safety also comprises a paramount objective. Keeping the Illinois Commerce Commission
and stakeholders aware of how much, how expensively, and how timely risk is being mitigated
comprises an important priority. Top executive management and the boards should provide strong
commitment to meeting (and changing as circumstances require over time) expected total duration,
costs, and results. These important AMRP parameters involve considerable uncertainty.
Leadership should have a credible description of possible ranges of schedule, cost, and results
outcomes over the short- and long-term.
Liberty’s work through early fall 2014 did not find top leadership highly conversant with
performance issues. We did find attention to information about the program, but not under a
structured and well-defined set of oversight, monitoring, and decision authority guidelines,
information requirements, and points of control. Top-level oversight did not appear to operate
under a regular, consistent schedule, or require or use key performance metrics.
To a great extent, unmet needs at the program management level make structuring and executing
a top-level oversight program challenging. The development of needed AMRP plans, reporting,
and analysis capabilities and responsibilities will, when completed, provide a more sound basis for
providing senior executive and board leadership with the data and (more importantly) analysis it
needs to validate (and to adjust where warranted) the continuing propriety of AMRP cost,
schedule, and quality objectives and targets.
Liberty made a series of recommendations for improvements needed to support the execution of
senior oversight in a manner commensurate with AMRP needs. These recommendations address:
 Adopting comprehensive AMRP targets and priorities
 Ensuring the provision of insights into gaps in meeting them
 Establishing sufficient reporting at an appropriate level of detail
 Ensuring that senior-level oversight operates independently from program-level
leadership
 Ensuring that senior-level oversight occurs with sufficient frequency and at a suitable level
of detail
 Meeting the need for continual re-evaluation of AMRP expectations
 Creating and applying a structured communications plan for ensuring knowledge and
acceptance of program targets
 Ensuring effective communication of program status and gaps to outside stakeholders.

13.Reports and Analysis
The AMRP requires regular and comprehensive performance reporting and analysis. These tools
provide the basis for determining the degree to which performance meets cost, schedule, quality,
and safety risk mitigation objectives and targets. Where they do not, analysis of root causes and
corrective actions become necessary to optimizing performance, either through prompt adjustment
of objectives and targets that have become unrealistic as time passes, or through measures to
improve the ability to perform up to expectations.

Chapter B: Report Summary

ICC14GAS0002

The AMRP has not made effective use of performance data and program management has not
aggressively targeted performance improvements identified through the analysis of such data.
Program management issues regular reports, but Liberty found them of a scope or focus
insufficient to support sound performance measurement. The AMRP monthly progress report
forms the central program reporting tool. It provides much information, but often lacks context
(i.e., a basis for judging whether performance is good or bad), fails to provide some important data,
contains errors, and uses metrics not clearly related to performance effectiveness. Most
importantly, it lacks the analysis needed to draw conclusions about the attributes of performance
that drive cost up or down, lengthen or shorten schedules, and increase or decrease quality. At the
more senior levels responsible for program oversight, these problems become particularly
pronounced.
Key planning, budgeting, estimating, and schedule elements either have not existed or have not
exhibited sufficient credibility to serve as effective reporting bases. This gap contributes to the
difficulty of defining a credible reporting and analysis process that gives: (a) program management
the tools it needs to optimize performance, and (b) senior level executives and board members a
digestible, actionable basis for holding program management accountable for pursuing such
optimization. Preceding parts of this summary and the following report chapters discuss these key
planning and management foundations.
Effective reporting and analysis on a program like the AMRP requires a dedicated and highly
experienced group of professionals responsible for project controls. Liberty’s review of the
personnel who perform this function demonstrated a sound experience level.
Liberty recommended a fundamental revision of the AMRP reporting process, the creation of a
sound framework for identifying performance improvement opportunities, a redefinition of cost,
schedule, and production (levels and quality) performance standards, and the creation of a
corporate and program culture that emphasizes the value of and produces a programmatic approach
to insightful AMRP performance analysis.

14.Auditing
Regular testing serves an important purpose in ensuring the intended use of resources. Peoples Gas
used Integrys based Internal Audit Services and an internationally respected outside firm (PwC)
in a fairly typical fashion in designing and applying an auditing program that considers AMRP
risks. The Company, however, needs to augment its examining and testing of contractor and
material and equipment handling, in order more fully to meet the challenges of the AMRP. With
respect to contractors, reviews of the procedures by which contractors justify cost increases need
follow-up to verify adherence to those procedures. Issues that have arisen with respect to the
control of material and equipment produced a long-term improvement program. That program
requires dedicated executive sponsorship to ensure full and timely implementation. Finally,
Peoples Gas needs to act promptly to ensure the accuracy of material and equipment costs charged
to the AMRP.

15.Field Work Performance
Liberty’s field work inspections included a review of workmanship, suitability of materials used,
conformity to engineering standards and construction requirements, safety, and the skills of the
workforce. The vast majority of the material used comprise pipe, fittings, and valves of standard
types used in typical configurations. The new pipe observed at sites inspected by Liberty generally
met age and technical requirements and specifications. Liberty found material sufficiently
available to support installation requirements efficiently. However, Liberty also found an inability
to identify a solution for securing service risers by use of brackets in cases of crumbling or bowed
foundation walls.
Construction conformed generally to proper engineering standards, with three exceptions:
reinforcing straps on endcaps, testing the integrity of coatings for steel pipe, and sizing of thrust
blocks that hold mains in place. Liberty also found a need to address a number of training,
inspection, and auditing aspects as well. Contractor operator qualification and field inspector
training require enhancement. Construction inspection documentation requires more uniform
execution and documentation. Peoples Gas also needs to ensure consistent adherence to procedures
requiring verification audits of main and service installation compliance with Company
engineering standards.
Liberty’s field investigations confirmed the job site presence of applicable standards and
procedures. Work appeared to conform to engineering and design documents, except where
unanticipated field conditions required adjustment. Five specific issues that can cause cost
increases due to rework, cumbersome installation methods, or larger amounts of materials,
however, warrant attention:
 There exists confusion over what depth of cover is required atop installations
 Adherence to pre-designed main locations sometimes produces installations less efficient
than evident, available alternatives
 Rote application by one of the three Shops of a direct burial requirement to all mains of at
least six inches in diameter produces inefficiencies that the Company can avoid
 Multi-meter locations have sometimes produced interior piping runs of lengths greater than
necessary.
The section below (under Part Four) addressing Safety and Permit Compliance discusses the need
for improvements in ensuring worker and public safety. In terms of managing the field work,
Liberty found traffic control (an essential element in mitigating vehicle and pedestrian safety risk)
effective. Liberty’s field investigations encountered conditions having worker safety implications.
More broadly, however, it is important to observe that contractor worker safety far exceeds that
experienced by crews consisting of Peoples Gas employees. That result runs counter to Liberty’s
general experience, and underscores the need for the safety improvements discussed below.
The skills and experience of contractor crews installing mains and services appeared sound and
observations of their work disclosed no unusual level of difficulties or problems. Peoples Gas, like
all others in the energy distribution industry, suffers from the effects of a generally aging
workforce. The Company needs to adopt a set of measures that will:
 Induce experienced people to stay on board

Encourage movement from bargaining unit into first line supervisory positions
Aggressively address skill shortages in some areas
Limit job rotations that create critical AMRP vacancies
Develop a program that develops a core internal competency to serve as a hedge against
the risks that national expansion of leak-prone pipe replacement programs will leave the
Company facing a shortage of contractor resources.

16.Work Management
Modern practice bases the definition and management of work on the discipline of work
management. Modern work management systems create a system of defined work processes,
subject them to defined sets of procedural rules, define the data used to manage them, support the
establishment of resource and time requirements associated with them, and enable ongoing
evaluation of effectiveness in work performance and the identification of changes that will
optimize performance. Liberty found that AMRP program management employed reasonably
comprehensive work management processes, which appropriately support construction work.
Liberty did, however, determine that the Company should assign a project manager to each of the
projects comprising AMRP work, in order to provide a single source responsible for all areas that
create project risk (such as coordination of City of Chicago permits, which has remained a source
of significant performance and government relationships difficulties). In addition, the lack of
regularly reported, sufficient performance data inhibits the ability to undertake on a continuing
basis the robust review of work process improvement opportunities that a program of AMRP’s
size and duration present. Adding controls specialists would also enhance efforts to identify work
process improvements. The next two sections address compliance with public requirements and
coordination with the City of Chicago. For reasons addressed there, Peoples Gas should also
dedicate within the Project Management Office a single manager to coordinate, monitor, and
measure performance under the multitude of City permits required to authorize work involving
public rights-of-way.

17.Safety and Permit Compliance
Work on gas distribution facilities must occur in conformity with public and employee safety
requirements (federal and state) and with permits issued to work in and around pedestrian and
vehicular rights-of-way. Liberty reviewed safety violations over the preceding two years, and
examined compliance with permits to conduct work in and around City of Chicago streets (issued
by the City Department of Transportation).
Liberty found that the number and severity of violations continue (as we found in work performed
some five years ago for the Illinois Commerce Commission) to indicate the need for a seniormanagement led effort to escalate and to reinforce at all levels the need for making compliance
with safety and permitting requirements an integral element of performing work in the field. The
Company lost experienced inspection and supervision resources in recent years, and has vacancies
in these positions. The resulting gap contributes to its too-frequent instances of safety and permit
non-compliance.

May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter B: Report Summary

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

A number of field observations made by Liberty identified issues contributing to compliance
problems:
 Absences of field supervisors for some crews
 Inaccurate meter markings by inexperienced and insufficient (in numbers) personnel
 Low levels of experience on the part of contractor crew inspectors
 Dispersed responsibility and unclear authority in providing technical training and
performing on-site compliance monitoring
 Gaps in required operator qualification knowledge
 Questions regarding authority over quality control programs and training
 Lack of processes for sharing field knowledge to identify best practices.
The Company needs to address these issues though developing enhanced safety programs,
assigning an executive to champion the commitment to safety, instituting a strong safety
communications program, setting aggressive goals, regularly measuring performance, analyzing
the root causes of problems, implementing responsive improvement programs, increasing the
stability in and numbers of field supervision and inspection personnel, clarifying responsibilities
and creating training programs for technical training and for compliance monitoring, expanding
operator qualification training, and exercising more clear and direct authority over contractor
quality control programs.

18.Government Coordination
However well managed, a program like the AMRP must prove a substantial inconvenience to the
public. Occupancy of public rights-of-way, whether in the streets themselves or in the adjacent
parkways, means substantial physical disruption and barriers to vehicular and pedestrian mobility.
The City of Chicago uses a permitting system to manage that disruption and to ensure a postconstruction return to normal conditions. City requirements address when work may be performed,
what restoration requirements apply, and how work gets coordinated with that of other street
occupiers. The City also has rules that concern its own work, which includes projects like
scheduled repavings, upgrades (e.g., intersection ramps for wheelchairs), and work on
underground municipal utilities. Although large in its own right, the AMRP’s requirements only
add (and sometimes marginally) to an already extensive number of required permits. For example,
AMRP permits have involved as little as 13 percent of the permits that Peoples Gas has required
annually from the City. The Company must also meet state requirements for roads under Illinois
Department of Transportation jurisdiction and for rail crossings.
The challenges of working in and around the streets takes dedicated management and careful
attention to meeting public requirements. Experience across the early years of the AMRP strained
relationships with the City substantially. The City had to adjust to the work levels and the
inconvenience caused. More importantly, Peoples Gas had to plan for and work in accordance with
permit requirements that imposed time windows for work performance, along with substantive
requirements regarding that performance and the need for restoration work following completion.
The Company experienced very large numbers of permit issues. Lack of permits (which includes
permit expirations) and restoration caused the largest numbers of violations. To a large extent,
these problems exhibit planning and scheduling difficulties. Specifically: (a) AMRP management
has not integrated permit (and engineering) scheduling with construction scheduling, and (b)
May 5, 2015

Page B-18
The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter B: Report Summary

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas crews have experienced numerous delays in completing their work after contractors
complete main and service installations. These two weaknesses caused permit durations to fall out
of sync with construction activities, and for completion work to hamper and delay required
restoration activities.
Peoples Gas reorganized its City-contact function in 2014, assigning a management-level position
to replace a person who previously coordinated relationships with both the City and the State. The
Company also added to the complement of employees responsible for (among other matters)
permit issues. Senior level biweekly meetings now address interaction with and problems caused
for the City. The City considers these changes a positive development, as does Liberty. However,
they need to continue to remain effective. More importantly, they will ultimately prove ineffective
if permit compliance does not become a more important priority to AMRP management. Making
it a priority will take successful implementation of many of the program planning, management,
and field work performance issues recommended by Liberty, many of which Peoples Gas reports
to be in process of implementation.
Liberty’s specific recommendations (apart from the designation of project managers for individual
AMRP projects) included:
 Integrating engineering and permit activity schedules with construction work schedules
 Using what Peoples Gas says is an existing capability to develop and use a comprehensive
data base of permit applications and citations to manage compliance and identify
improvements
 Working with the City to identify reports of mutual value that the City Department of
Transportation systems can produce
 Improving the currency and accuracy of the database used to manage railroad crossing
requests.

19.Customer Coordination
Completing replacement work requires access to customer premises for required meter location
changes and to cut service over to new supply facilities. Effective customer interaction and
communication also serve to set reasonable expectations with respect to necessary disruptions to
streets, driveways, lawns and sidewalks. Communication timing and content play an important
role in minimizing customer dissatisfaction with what, in the best of circumstances, must be an
inconvenience.
Peoples Gas launched the AMRP without a finalized Customer Communications Plan. It operated
under a draft plan in 2011, but did not update it until 2014. Even at the time of Liberty’s field
work, the plan did not address means for: (a) dealing with customers who fail to cooperate in
permitting access, or (b) gathering current information on needs, expectations, satisfaction, and
feedback as the program progresses. Liberty also found that the Company did not operate under a
common set of customer communications methods, which risks customer confusion. This
approach can also produce inconsistent understandings between the common Contact Center and
field personnel that contact customers door-to-door. This confusion can produce uncertain or
erroneous information to customers. There is also a lack of integration between the current
customer information system and the system that the three Shops use to manage field work. This

linkage will not happen until the institution of a new customer information system (“Cfirst”) in the
next two years.
The Construction Complaints group handles customer complaints about the AMRP. It does not
have sufficient staffing to handle the complaint volumes. There are significant delays in first
contacts with customers following complaint receipt. The number of complaints unopened (i.e.,
awaiting assignment of a Company representative) grew substantially through 2014. Complaints
can take months to resolve. Complaints also increased after the decision last August to offer
Saturday appointments.
Liberty recommended that Peoples Gas address the gaps in its now final Customer
Communications Plan, standardize its processes for setting AMRP customer appointments,
ensuring the integration of customer information and work management systems to permit tracking
and communication of progress to customers, and increase staffing in the complaints handling
group. The Company also should begin to measure on a regular basis: (a) customer satisfaction
with their AMRP experiences, and (b) the effectiveness of AMRP customer communications and
service.

20.Liberty’s January 2015 Interim Report
Liberty’s scope of work did not contemplate an interim report. However, early work led to a
number of observations about a series of significant improvements in core elements of effective
AMRP oversight, management, and control. Liberty discussed these observations with senior
leadership of Integrys and Peoples Gas, beginning in September 2014. Those discussions led to
substantial consensus on where improvements could be secured. Liberty found senior leadership
open to major change and willing to question the continuing wisdom of its AMRP approach,
organization, staffing, responsibilities, systems, tools, processes, and activities. Liberty’s January
2015 interim report addressed a significant number of improvement opportunities with which
leadership agreed, and reported generally on initiatives to which management expressed a
commitment to implement.
Continuing work, which led to this final report generally confirmed the validity of those
observations, and produced a number of additional conclusions identifying the need for further
improvements in AMRP management, control, and oversight. As described, the Company’s
proposed initiatives together reflected a substantial response to the observations Liberty made as
part of last fall’s discussions. The prompt development and sustained implementation of these
initiatives, as described by Company leadership, would represent a sound start and make
significant progress in responding to the broader recommendations of this final report.
The effort to implement those initiatives and to address the full scope of this report’s
recommendations, however, will prove massive. In some cases, it will take more than a year for
corrective actions to become fully effective. Given a past history of not following through on
recommended changes, the size of the effort indicates a need for the Company to retain outside
expertise to assist in the change management process. Even so, the Company should be able (and
expected) to bring greater definition to its described initiatives by the time of this report’s issuance.
In many cases, it should be prepared to report that it is far along in implementation.

This report does not seek to evaluate those initiatives for three reasons. First, their status made
them in many cases amenable only to general description for Liberty. Second, most were not far
along in implementation. Third, and most important, this final report needs to provide a
comprehensive description of all the changes that Liberty considers appropriate and an explanation
of the reasons that underlie them.
Liberty found changes in leadership and openness to making fundamental changes to AMRP
management, control, and oversight encouraging. Uncertainty surrounding future ownership (and
therefore personnel continuity and change commitment) certainly make it prudent to temper
optimism. Inaction with respect to change in the past underscores the need to remain cautious
about outcomes. Therefore, while Liberty believes that aggressive pursuit of the initiatives remains
appropriate, we offer this final report as a stand-alone and more complete description of how
Peoples Gas has managed the AMRP and what improvements remain before it.

Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System
1. Background
This chapter addresses the following characteristics and conditions of the Peoples Gas system:
 Current inventory of problematic main and services materials and their location
 Whether the most leak prone mains and services are also those with the highest safety risk
 Metrics that determine which problematic materials must be replaced initially and which
can be deferred without reducing safety
 Past programs to reduce safety risk and improve safety via infrastructure improvements
 Lessons learned from the conduct of prior programs.

2. Findings
a. Typical Urban Gas Systems
The gas systems of large urban gas utilities combine very old with more modern components. One
disadvantage of older components arises because their interconnection with newer ones frequently
limits the ability to take advantage of the capabilities offered by the newer materials. The
continuing use of aged components, some of them more than 100 years old, however, raises a far
more important concern; i.e., gas leaks that pose major safety risks for customers and employees.
The country’s worst performing systems from a risk perspective typically share a number of
characteristics:
 Cast iron mains: brittle and installed in roughly 10 foot segments connected by unreliable
joints
 Ductile iron mains: subject to unpredictable breaks and also connected by unreliable joints
 Bare steel mains: subject to exponential degradation over time and numerous leaks
 Some early vintage plastic mains and services: found to consist of poor performing
materials
 Coated steel service and mains not adequately protected cathodically
 Services that employ similar, poor performing piping materials
 Low-pressure systems: not capable of upgrade to higher pressure operation, due to
connection to poor performing pipe
 Pressure regulating vaults and regulator systems for reduction to low pressure: typically
dating to the early 1900s
 Services not capable of shutoff from outside the building: often no valve exists or it cannot
be located or operated
 Inside meter sets: outside location is generally optimal.
Utility gas system configurations typically employ two flow modes, often in combination: (a) tree,
and (b) grid. Tree configurations typify rural systems having low customer densities. Tree
configurations use a main supply line as a trunk, from which branches spread to feed communities
or individual customers. Tree systems almost always operate at high or medium pressures. Damage
to the trunk can cause loss of service to all of its branches, thus making them subject to widespread
outages.

Grid configurations typify urban environments. They typically consist of interconnected mains,
visually much like the lines on a piece of graph paper. Grid configurations offer the advantage of
multiple feeds to each element of the grid. Undamaged nodes in the system flow into and around
a damaged section, minimizing the number of customers interrupted. Grid systems cannot fully
match the “graph paper” model; natural features and geographic limitations (e.g., river crossings)
impose insurmountable physical barriers. Utilities operate grid systems at low and at medium
pressures, depending on a number of circumstances. Increasing the operating pressure from low
pressure has advantages that include:
 Lower cost (often a two-inch main can be used in place of a six-inch main)
 The flexibility of smaller MP plastic piping lends itself well to trenchless installations and
takes up less underground space in a crowded urban environment
 Water intrusion is not an issue
 Excess flow valves can be used
 Smaller services can supply higher loads
 Customers have a greater choice of gas utilization equipment
 Gas systems are more easily segmented and repaired
 Plastic does not corrode
 Plastic does not have joints that are susceptible to leaks
 Plastics less subject to impact-induced cracks, compared with cast iron and ductile iron
 Plastics can experience ground movement with less likelihood of leakage.
b. Peoples Gas System Configuration
The Peoples Gas system operates primarily on a grid configuration. It employs 4,236 miles of
main. Cast and ductile iron mains make up almost 40 percent (1,648 miles) of this total. The system
includes piping that dates back to the 1800s. Peoples Gas identifies pre-1920 piping as the source
of a disproportionately large share of maintenance work, as Figure 2.1 demonstrates.
Figure C.1: Maintenance Activity by Main Vintage

U.S. Government data shows that the 1,648 miles in the Peoples Gas system at the end of 2013
gave it the fourth largest inventory of cast and ductile iron mains in the country. This data comes
from The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA), which regulates and ensures the safe and secure movement of

hazardous materials to industry and consumers by all modes of transportation, including pipelines.
The Peoples Gas inventory of cast and ductile iron mains, although comparatively very large,
leaves it far from alone in facing the hazards that such materials create. Gas companies in many
large cities share legacy mains dating back 100 years or more, when manufactured gas was the
only available source.
Manufactured gas came from a process that made a flammable gas from coal, coke, or a special
grade of oil. Difficulties in compressing manufactured gas meant locating production plants close
to customers. Distribution systems for this gas operated at low pressures. Tars and liquids present
as byproducts of the manufacturing process helped to protect the cast-iron mains then in use,
coating them and sealing some of their joints. The liquids prevented some of the joints from
“drying out,” which reduced leaks. The introduction of inexpensive natural gas via interstate
pipelines after World War II led to the end of gas manufacturing. Drier pipeline gas, which also
lacked other byproducts of manufactured gas, came to be delivered at high pressures, often over
long distances to the communities whose customers used it. The changes in the characteristics of
natural gas removed some of the natural protection that manufactured gas provided to cast-iron
mains.
Three categories of legacy gas piping comprise particular sources of safety risk today (in Chicago
and in many other large urban locations): cast iron, ductile iron, and bare steel. Peoples Gas has
eliminated bare steel main from its gas system, but continues to use much of the other two types.
Figure C.2 uses 2013 PHMSA data to compare companies having 500 or more miles of cast iron
and ductile iron combined. Only 18 of the country’s more than 1,400 gas utilities, including
Peoples Gas, continue to employ this amount of cast and ductile iron pipe.

c. Cast and Ductile Iron Pipe Characteristics
Cast iron (CI) and ductile iron (DI) present great risk because their failures can prove both
unpredictable and catastrophic in nature. Mains operating entirely leak free can suddenly fail,
releasing large volumes of gas the same day the failure occurs. Both cast and ductile iron mains
typically use bell and spigot joints (Figure 2.4 below), which are prone to failure. The bell side of
such joints has a larger diameter than the pipe. The spigot end has the same diameter and often a

ridge. After connecting the two ends and applying sealing material (typically jute or oakum), lead
(and on occasion cement) would be poured into the joint to lock the seal.
Figure C.4: Bell and Spigot Joint

Cast iron pipe tends to crack or break unpredictably. Ductile iron is more prone to breaking. Both
types of failure can occur without the prior warnings that small leaks can give to utility operators
in the cases of other materials. The unpredictability of catastrophic leaks makes managing their
risks complex. Sudden failures and high volumes of resulting gas migration make all cast iron
breaks and ductile iron breaks a major threat, particularly in densely populated, urban areas. For
example, when stress on a pipe relieves (via the break), the pipe typically breaks entirely around
its circumference, producing a large leak path for flowing gas to fill. Such a break can happen on
a pipe producing no indication of gas leakage at all, perhaps only minutes earlier.
Cast and ductile iron pipe have posed leak threats for many decades, but accelerated replacement
as a common solution has a more recent origin. Many urban utilities, as far back as the 1950s (and
through the 1970s), patched leaks as they occurred, in lieu of the major endeavor that large-scale
system replacement would entail. Continued aging of cast and ductile iron over the decades,
however, has increased risks. Cast iron undergoes graphitization over time. Graphitization
describes a natural process causing iron to degrade and weaken, making cast iron pipelines more
susceptible to cracking.

May 5, 2015

Phase One Final Report
Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System
ICC14GAS0002

Similar deterioration of ductile iron occurs. Graphitized mains fail comparatively readily when
placed under stress. Joint repairs also lose effectiveness over time. Companies have commonly
“joint repaired” cast and ductile iron joints many times over their lengthening lives. External and
internal joint repairs buy time, but do not offer a permanent solution.
As a consequence, the industry has moved strongly in the direction of replacement, as opposed to
continuing to “patch” aging iron infrastructure.
d. Legacy Low Pressure Gas Systems
At the same time, another legacy feature of older urban gas systems has come to affect strategies
for dealing with aging mains. These urban systems typically operate at low pressure (typically ¼
psig). “Pounds per square inch gauge” measures a unit of pressure relative to atmospheric pressure
at sea level, as opposed to pounds per square inch absolute (psia), which measures pressure relative
to a vacuum. As compared with medium pressure systems typifying more modern configurations,
they also entail a number of other safety (as well as operational and customer convenience)
disadvantages:
 Proneness to failure modes described above
 Inability to employ excess flow valves
 Water infiltration
 Collapse when exposed to water main breaks (cast and ductile iron can collapse when
undermined)
 Lack of ready shutoff capability in case of emergencies
 Excessively low pressures on cold days (due to insufficient capacity)
 Susceptibility to risks of over-pressuring the system
 Greater repair difficulty
 Lack of capacity to support system expansion
 Inability to support newer appliances
 Limited ability to allow expanded customer gas use. (e.g., larger boilers, back-up
generation).
Thus, building infrastructure that supports operation at medium pressure has importance in
addressing system infrastructure needs. Making the changes to support such operation, however,
can require major system changes. Increasing the operating pressure of a gas system requires a
major change of entire segments of the system to occur simultaneously. The legacy practice of
replacing 6” (low pressure) pipe with the same size material and using the same comparatively
short sections that repair needs require can continue to support reliability. It also looks economical,
from a strictly “maintenance” perspective. However, it consigns a system to low pressure operation
indefinitely. Thus, it becomes wise to consider the costs and benefits of a modernization program
that is more expansive and expensive, particularly when facing, as Peoples Gas has, massive
replacement needs for safety reasons. Specifically, that means consideration of wide-scale
replacement work to increase system capability to medium pressure, while simultaneously
addressing cast and ductile iron replacement.

e. Plastic Pipe’s Advantages
Advances in the use of plastic pipe since the late 1960s have been dramatic. Experience has led to
the development of materials shown through experience and testing to suffer no significant
deterioration as their lives progress. Typically gas distribution companies today use plastic as the
preferred material of choice for new distribution gas piping wherever possible. Plastic can bring
significant economies apart from its resistance to deterioration:
 2” plastic pipe can replace legacy 6” pipe when main pressures are increased
 Trenchless installations use less space in crowded urban environments
 Smaller-diameter services can supply higher loads.
Plastic pipe also has operational advantages:
 Eliminates water intrusion as an issue
 Supports use of excess flow valves
 Supports easier segmentation and repair of gas systems when shut off valves are installed
 Eliminates all forms of corrosion
 Eliminates joints susceptible to leaks
 Eliminates tendency to crack upon impacts
 Increases ability to avoid leakage on ground movement.
f. Complementing an AMRP
A comprehensive main replacement program can take decades to complete, even when carried out
on an accelerated basis. In the meantime, safety risks can continue to grow on sectors or
components awaiting replacement. Measures exist to address those risks, by taking work out of
replacement plan order where indicated.
Peoples Gas addresses the need for priority (out-of-AMRP-order) cast and ductile iron
replacement. It uses a risk tool to identify those mains with sufficiently high risk to justify
immediate replacement, regardless of AMRP schedules. The Company’s Main Ranking Index
(“MRI”) identifies those mains with a high likelihood of leakage. Peoples Gas seeks to replace in
the immediate term those mains with an Index ranking of 6 or greater (5 or higher for mains in
proximity to places of public assembly). Recently, Index-driven replacements amount to 1.5 miles
per year. The Main Ranking Index has a long history at Peoples Gas, which has used it since 1993.
Chapter F: Risk Assessment addresses its use in more detail. That chapter also discusses how it
combines with the neighborhood (or zone) approach that Peoples Gas has recently adopted to
combine pipe replacement with work seeking other operational and customer improvements
(medium pressure grid operation and movement of indoor meters outside).
Conceptually, overlaying replacements driven by use of the Main Ranking Index onto the
neighborhood approach makes sense. Chapter F discusses, however, how leak history trends reveal
a need to examine the effectiveness of Peoples Gas’ Index itself. Records show that replacements
over the past 10 years have reduced the miles of cast and ductile iron in the system by some 350
miles (20 percent). Despite this decrease, the incidence of breaks has gone in the opposite direction,
increasing by about 20 percent earlier in the period. Peoples Gas has presented leak rate changes
after normalizing them for weather and third-party damage breaks. Even accepting those

ICC14GAS0002

adjustments, however, still produces a rate that, in recent years, has declined only very marginally.
The rate of decline is less than an accelerated replacement program would be expected to produce.
A break trend line that corresponds more closely to the changes in miles of at-risk mains would
provide more reason for confidence that AMRP and Main Ranking Index driven replacements
together are succeeding in removing risk at a suitable pace. Report Chapter F: Risk Assessment
addresses means for optimizing the use of a conceptually effective replacement driver overlay (like
the Main Ranking Index) to address immediately highest-risk pipe in the context of a program that
combines safety with other drivers in identifying infrastructure improvement work.

g. Leak Management
Leak backlogs provide an important indicator of system safety. Gas distribution companies cannot
cost efficiently repair all leaks on their systems. Ranking them in order of potential risk to persons
or property typically guides decisions to repair them or, alternatively, to continue monitoring them
for increasing risk. Small joint leaks, particularly in systems with high amounts of cast iron, can
remain in place for many years. AMRP programs frequently place increased emphasis on
monitoring versus replacement for segments on the program schedule. Figure C.7 shows an
increase in leak backlog over the past 10 years. This rate far exceeds the more moderate level one
could expect to accompany an AMRP. Over this same period, as Figure C.8 shows, the number of
leaks actually repaired dropped moderately. These data show the need for careful examination of
the methods by which Peoples Gas ranks pipe in replacement priority. Chapter F: Risk Assessment
addresses those methods in detail.

h. Double Decking
Most cities use a single main down all but the widest streets to serve customers. Peoples Gas takes
a different approach. It installs “double deck” mains; i.e., runs one main down either side of each
street. Each serves customers on its side of the street. Double decking thus can produce as much
as twice the amount of main required to serve the same number of customers, when compared with
the more prevalent approach. The significant increase in linear feet of work would appear at first
glance to impose substantial cost disadvantages. Liberty inquired into the reasons for its use.
Without double decking, a single main would serve customers on both sides of the street, requiring
May 5, 2015

Phase One Final Report
Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System
ICC14GAS0002

services trenched across the street to reach such customers on the far side of the street. Street and
paving issues, however, make installing double decking (with its use of the “parkways” or
sidewalks paralleling streets) economical for Peoples Gas. It will also lessen the need for moving
or protecting its facilities in cases of future infrastructure work by others occupying the streets.
i. Other Safety and Reliability Considerations
As important as an AMRP is in ensuring public and employee safety, it must operate in tandem
with other safety-focused activities. Moreover, as the neighborhood approach embodies,
consideration of factors other than safety alone can provide opportunities to address other
important considerations. Liberty examined a number of other safety and reliability considerations
that in its experience have significant importance for systems like the one that Peoples Gas operates
in the City of Chicago.
i. Contractor-Caused Damage
Contractor damages offer another measure of performance in gas distribution system protection.
Peoples Gas has experienced contractor-caused damage counts approaching the highest among
companies reporting to The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Material
Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Further, among the one percent of companies having the
highest number of contractor damages, Peoples Gas has the highest number of damages per 100
miles of main. Figure C.9 compares data for the 16 companies having the highest numbers of
reported contractor damages. Peoples Gas observes that reporting differences serve to inflate its
count relative to other reporting companies. Nevertheless, Liberty finds these counts
extraordinarily high.

ii. Maintaining Operating Pressure
Effective operation of a gas system requires analysis of how system conditions (e.g., peak loads)
will affect system operations. Peoples Gas uses industry-standard Stoner Analysis to analyze gas
flows and pressures under a variety of assumptions. Addressing inadequate pressure comprises an
important element in ensuring reliable service. Operating in areas that experience harsh winters
underscores the importance of dealing with pressure issues. Peoples Gas does not give low pressure
a place in its neighborhood priority rankings. Its analyses have indicated that 88 main segments
would experience inadequate pressure during a peak hour.

Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System
ICC14GAS0002

iii. Contingency Analysis
Best practice calls for the use of contingency analyses to limit outage exposure. A typical output
of a contingency analysis shows those system components whose failure would produce the
highest number of customer outages by temperature brackets extending down to design day
conditions (i.e., the harshest considered in design). Peoples Gas does not consider this reliability
criterion in prioritizing neighborhood work.
iv. Operable Service Valves
Counts of operable service valves also provide insight into the general health of a gas system.
Peoples Gas does not employ such a metric. It does not perform operability audits.
v. Pressure Testing
At the time of Liberty’s field work, Peoples Gas was testing medium pressure services at 50 psig
and mains at 100 psig. The use of 50 psig conforms to present Company operating practices.
However, industry practice includes testing both medium pressure services and mains at 100 psig.
The practical significance of the Peoples Gas approach is that testing services at 50 psig limits the
ability to upgrade them to 60 psig in the future. Being able to operate the gas distribution system
at 60 psig would provide additional delivery capacity. This increase would improve the ability to
increase supply in high use locations and to mitigate some low pressure issues during design day
operation.
j. System Statistics
The appendix to this chapter charts the position of Peoples Gas relative to the group of 17 other
U.S. gas utilities that have at least 500 combined miles of cast and ductile iron mains. The
Company’s position relative to the others on those charts is:
 Bare steel services: 2nd lowest
 Ductile iron services: highest (total of 294)
 Cast iron services: 4th highest
 Main corrosion leaks: 5th lowest
 Main material or weld failures: 6th highest.

3. Conclusions
C.1

Peoples Gas has an overall sound knowledge of the numbers and locations of
problematic mains and services.

The inventory of problematic mains and services in the Peoples Gas territory consists of:
 1,406 miles of Cast Iron main
 242 miles of Ductile Iron main
 Small amount of poor quality plastic mains (Peoples Gas has quantity identified and
located)
 5,677 Unprotected bare steel services
 180 Unprotected coated steel services
 74 Cast Iron services

294 Ductile Iron services
13,824 Copper services (believed to be of lesser risk, but included)
Small amount of poor quality plastic services.

The Peoples Gas main and service records locate these facilities. The infrastructure-based sources
of highest risk in the Peoples Gas system consist generally of the presently targeted mains and
services of the AMRP. The populations that present highest risk (subject to adjustment based on
consideration of population to proximity) consist of:
 Existing ductile iron medium pressure mains and services
 Cast iron mains and services smaller than 12” that have been undermined or exposed to
ground movement
 Cast iron mains and services of the smallest diameter (the smaller diameter, the higher the
risk based on likelihood of breaking)
 Graphitized (weakened) cast iron mains and services
 Pre-1920 cast iron mains and services
 Poor quality plastic (“clear plastic”) mains and services.
C.2

Peoples Gas employs very high amounts of high-risk pipe in its system; a program to
eliminate it on the accelerated basis contemplated by the AMRP remains and will in
coming years remain a high priority contributor to public safety.

Cast and ductile iron are recognized throughout the gas distribution industry as prone to high rates
of failure. These facilities, which create major risks to public, customer and employee safety,
comprise an unusually large portion of the Peoples Gas system. The 1,648 miles in the system at
the end of 2013 (about 40 percent) give the Company the fourth largest inventory of cast and
ductile iron main in the country. Moreover, despite a program of retirements that has existed (in
various forms) for several decades, break rates remain high. Peoples Gas still has in place highrisk materials (unprotected steel, clear plastic, and copper) in its services, but they comprise very
low percentages of totals in this category. These high-risk materials nevertheless continue to
require attention in replacement program planning and execution.
These circumstances make continuation of accelerated replacement a matter of high public
importance. Moreover, as Chapter F discusses, an examination of trends in replacements versus
breaks warrants a focused examination of how the methods used to prioritize pipe for replacement
function.
The high amounts of cast iron and ductile iron piping and the bare steel services remaining in the
system create a significant safety risk for Peoples Gas, its customers, and the general public. The
system faces a need for modernization as well. Accelerated retirement of the cast iron and ductile
iron piping and bare steel services comports with good utility practices, and addresses first-priority
safety needs.

C.3

The benefits of transitioning to medium pressure operation on a wide scale and of
moving inside meters to locations outside customer structures warrants a carefully
managed combination of high-risk main replacement with work designed to produce
those other benefits.

A program like the AMRP will bring major customer service disruptions, however well planned
and executed it may be. Combining it with the transition to a medium pressure system makes sense
from a long-term operating perspective and in view of the added customer convenience and
benefits it can produce. The neighborhood or zonal approach for doing so can optimize work
efficiency.
Conceptually, the Peoples Gas utilization of a “neighborhood” approach with an overlay to address
pipe in most critical need of replacement is sound. It promotes economy in serving a broader set
of objectives, while focusing at the same time on reducing the safety threat risks posed by highrisk pipe. As Chapter F discusses, however, ensuring the optimal use of this overlay approach
requires a revisiting of the criteria used in measuring risk and the weight given to them.
C.4

Departing from the more typical approach of a single main to serve customers on
both sides of the street makes sense under the conditions that Peoples Gas faces, but
deploying the strategy without exception would not promote optimization.
(Recommendation C.1)

The “double decking” that Peoples Gas employs substantially increases some aspects of material
and construction costs, but generally responds effectively to the cost penalties that would apply to
the use of a single main (serving both sides of the street). A single main would require opening the
paved portion of public rights-of-way, because the City of Chicago will not allow directional
drilling of services under the street. A separate main serving each side of the street also offers
future advantages (e.g., avoiding disruptions when future in-street work by others takes place).
Finally, minimizing work in the streets mitigates the amount of public disruption that a program
as massive as the AMRP inevitably must produce.
The Company, however, should not conclude that new, double decking makes more sense in all
cases. Examining particular circumstances of each street as part of neighborhood work planning,
rather than a universally applied rule, should dictate the final choice. For example, it would appear
likely that some existing center-of-the street mains can remain in place, while being upgraded to
higher pressure. A 6” replacement project performed in 2006, but left to operate at low pressure
offers a case that would merit consideration. It takes case-by-case analysis to determine whether
doing so would prove more expensive than replacement again with double-decked pipe.
C.5

A number of other safety, reliability, and testing issues need to be considered in
conjunction with or on top of current Peoples Gas practices in AMRP planning or
execution. (Recommendations C.2, C.3, C.4, and C.5)

Peoples Gas experiences an extraordinarily high rate of contractor-caused damage counts. The
Company expresses a high degree of confidence that: (a) reporting distinctions account for its high
numbers compared to those of others, and (b) it operates effective prevention and mitigation
programs to address such damage. Replacement due to pipe condition, not third-party damage,
comprises the scope of this engagement. Therefore, Liberty has not examined the validity of these

two Company observations. However, confusion in break and repair numbers reported in Chapter
F of this report and recognition that contractor damage presents both large safety risk and high
costs warrant mention of this issue. The number of damage counts warrants attention by Peoples
Gas and their causes need improved transparency to the Illinois Commerce Commission.
Similarly ensuring the operability of service valves has important safety and operations
implications. The lack of a structured program for assessing operability does not conform to good
utility practice.
Addressing system weaknesses identified through analysis of operating pressure and of single
contingencies that can produce widespread outages comprise key elements in ensuring the
provision of reliable and adequate services. The work being done under the neighborhood
construct has the potential for resolving pressure and single-contingency issues, but it is not clear
that Peoples Gas considers those issues directly in planning.
Limiting testing to current operating pressures on systems that generally should support operation
at higher pressure unnecessarily constrains possible future upgrades, considering the difference in
test requirements to verify operability at higher pressure.
C.6

Peoples Gas reports a number of corrosion leaks that do not comport with materials
common in its system. (Recommendation C.6)

Peoples Gas reports no bare steel main, but does report corrosion leaks. One would not expect
reporting of leaks on plastic, cast iron or ductile iron to use corrosion as the classification. Liberty
thus interprets the reported corrosion leaks as coming on bare steel services or on protected coated
steel mains/services. The number of corrosion leaks shown in Figure C.10 causes concern. Peoples
Gas believes that some of these corrosion leaks comprise pitting on cast iron, not cathodically
protected steel mains.

ICC14GAS0002

Another concern is that Peoples Gas reports 104 corrosion leaks on mains. Unless reasoned
otherwise by Peoples Gas, this observation means that Peoples Gas’ protected coated mains are
corroding. The industry does not usually experience a significant number of corrosion leaks on
protected coated steel main, nor does the industry typically classify leaks on cast or ductile iron as
corrosion. Graphitization is a form of cast iron corrosion; however, it is unusual for gas distribution
companies to classify leaks on cast iron as corrosion.

4. Recommendations
C.1

Peoples Gas should include as an element of the neighborhood work planning process
an evaluation of the merits of taking an exception to the double decking approach.
(Conclusion C.4)

Double decking as a default option clearly makes sense for Peoples Gas. The planning process,
however, needs to include an element that verifies its superiority over other options in individual
cases.
C.2

Peoples Gas should more thoroughly study and report on the causes of extremely high
reports of contactor damage incidents. (Conclusion C.5)

The Company should perform a structured and analytically-based study of the cause and the safety
risks imposed by contractor-caused damage. It should complete such a study within six months,
and report its results to the Illinois Commerce Commission. The study should incorporate any
proposed changes to prevention and mitigation efforts.
C.3

Peoples Gas should undertake measures to verify the operability of external service
shutoff valves. (Conclusion C.5)

Peoples Gas should also institute a program designed to determine the locatability and
functionality of existing external service shutoff valves. Liberty specifically recommends a
random survey of 1,000 services believed to be controllable through outside shutoffs. The survey
should only include areas not scheduled for near-term neighborhood work under the AMRP.
Should the survey identify location or operability problems with more than 10 percent of the
services surveyed, Peoples Gas should expand the survey size to 5,000 services. If surveying
identifies more than a small number of valves as not findable or not operable, then Peoples Gas
should define, resource, and carry out a corrective action program.
C.4

Peoples Gas should examine the ability to address low pressure and singlecontingency outage risks in the neighborhood program. (Conclusion C.5)

Peoples Gas should conduct a structured analysis of where low operating pressure and single
contingency outage threats exist and match those locations to neighborhoods planned for work in
the near term. To the extent that these two threats prove material in any neighborhood, Peoples
Gas should consider the benefits of addressing them more promptly by moving the neighborhood
involved up in priority order.

C.5

Peoples Gas should test both services and mains to 100 psig. (Conclusion C.5)

Peoples Gas should test both service and main pressures to 100 psig on all new installations and
develop methods to retest previously installed services to 100 psig, to give the system the ability
to operate at a higher pressure in the future.
C.6

Analyze and report on the precise nature and numbers of corrosion leaks, and
determine whether protected and coated steel mains are experiencing corrosion leaks.
(Conclusion C.6)

Reporting problems may explain anomalous data about corrosion leaks. In any event, Peoples Gas
needs to verify sources of leaks in order to properly assess needed responses.

Chapter D: AMRP Definition and Status

Chapter D: Definition and Current Status of the AMRP
1. Background
This chapter:
 Discusses AMRP scope, plan, and execution structure
 Describes the individual projects that collectively define the AMRP
 Addresses Liberty’s review of reported AMRP progress to date, including comparisons to
initial plans and expectations
 Analyzes trends of the first few program years
 Discusses their potential long-term ramifications.
The AMRP comprises a 20-year multi-billion dollar initiative. Such a program calls for a definitive
plan and clearly reported progress versus that plan. Liberty examined the subjects of plan and
progress measurement with respect to program scope, production, costs, and schedules. These four
elements form fundamental building blocks needed to build and manage a program of the size and
scope of the AMRP. Program management cannot prove effective when these attributes are
unknown, confused, inconsistent, or wrong. A simplistic but essential notion, i.e.; “you can’t
manage what you can’t measure,” underlies each element. We expected to find consistent and
accurate data, not because this audit required it, but because effective AMRP management requires
it.

2. Findings
a. Early AMRP Years
Peoples Gas has replaced leak-prone pipe for many years. What changed recently is the
introduction of a substantially accelerated effort, debated and approved in 2009, with physical
work starting in earnest in 2011. The continuity of the program underwent disruption in late 2011
when the cost recovery mechanism was found to be inappropriate. A new cost recovery
mechanism, implemented in 2013, reestablished assurances that funding would be available for
the AMRP.
In hindsight, this temporary disruption, in the context of a 20-year effort, may seem small.
However, it led to major impacts on the AMRP. It might have led to re-planning, but that did not
happen. The time between changes in rate recovery mechanisms did not generate a comprehensive
and consistent approach to the AMRP. Thus, the program’s formative stage did not produce the
strong foundation one would expect as a massive, long-term program ramps up to a steady state.
To the contrary, some positive first steps appear to have been lost.
b. Defining the AMRP
Liberty began its review with the expectation that a multi-billion dollar and multi-decade program
would be well defined. That expectation proved incorrect. Early work, however, disclosed
significant barriers in forming descriptions of program scope and the nature of the Company’s
commitments. It became clear that some important questions about AMRP definition did not have
direct answers.

Chapter D: AMRP Definition and Status

ICC14GAS0002

A first example of the “fuzziness” arise from placing AMRP and non-AMRP work under common
program management. The approach makes sense from a management perspective, but the
homogenization of AMRP into something larger makes it impracticable to capture data specific
only to the AMRP. It was not clear that data presented on project progress included only AMRP
work, or, instead, represented the combined scope of the program management organization
responsible for both. During interviews with Liberty, Company personnel did not have the ability
to offer AMRP-focused information. In September 2014, the Company reported that “information
provided to Liberty that was created during and after the first quarter of 2014 was QIP focused”.
This Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge addresses rate recovery of work that includes, but
is not limited to, AMRP projects.
A second factor complicates determining the AMRP’s scope clearly. This factor exemplifies the
difficulty in isolating the AMRP from work directed at other important needs. Peoples Gas lays
out projects associated with the AMRP over a 20-year period. From time-to-time, it becomes
necessary and desirable to execute projects significantly earlier in the schedule. Municipal public
improvement projects occasionally cause the Company to complete some AMRP projects well
before long-term plans would indicate. Responding to such public needs as they arise reflects a
straightforward and logical approach, but has bred confusion about whether or not such work
actually comprises part of the AMRP.
Replacement work originally planned as part of the AMRP’s scope and the quantities installed
should undergo collection and reporting distinctly as part of AMRP program results. Early Liberty
interviews identified public improvements as a source of scope confusion. Months after conducting
them, however, a request for installed and retired AMRP quantities produced a February 20, 2015
response that:
“The quantities for AMRP main installed, main retired, and services installed do not
include Public Improvement projects. Total AMRP expenditures, budgeted and actual,
include Public Improvement projects”. [Emphasis added]
A third example of the difficulty in clearly defining the boundaries of AMRP scope came through
interviews with senior Company personnel. Liberty frequently sought to determine what
documents expressed clear commitment to a 20-year AMRP. The responses generally avoided
direct acknowledgement of the existence of the commitment, accompanied by assertions that no
document imposes it. As a result, Liberty concluded that those responsible for managing the
program could not find themselves able to subscribe to a fundamental parameter of the Company’s
commitment. In fact, Peoples Gas itself had stated in its original Project Execution Plan that:
Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company has typically replaced 40 to 50 miles of gas mains
per year throughout the City of Chicago. Replacement of the remainder of the low‐pressure
distribution system as well as the medium pressure cast iron and ductile iron mains will be
replaced with medium‐pressure plastic and cathodically protected steel pipe over 20 years.
The hedging nature of the interview statements apparently derived from the notion that this
commitment, written in 2011, occurred under a different regulatory recovery scheme, and might
no longer be appropriate, in their opinion.

These observations illustrate the need for careful attention in evaluating AMRP statistics and in
relating them to long term objectives. It makes sense to manage the work on a common,
homogenized basis. The integrity of AMRP reporting, however must remain distinct and
transparent. The AMRP responds to critical public needs and expectations. The primary
importance of those needs and expectations requires precise and complete reporting against the
commitments that the AMRP addresses. Combined management must not lead to a combined
reporting structure that diminishes the transparency of performance measurements specific to the
AMRP.
c. The Challenges in Measuring Production Performance
Gathering AMRP production data should prove fairly straightforward. Effective program
management and control depend on a comprehensive set of data from which the rates and
effectiveness of performance against plans, schedules, and budgets can routinely undergo
examination, analysis, and response by management. It proved, however, difficult to gather
meaningful production data. Liberty found that Peoples Gas was not collecting data in a manner
that makes detailed information readily available.
It has proven very challenging to gather statistics that profile main replacement progress over the
years on a sufficiently comprehensive, detailed basis. Liberty asked for these statistics in repeated
data requests, and discussed replacement progress during many interviews. However, data that
Peoples Gas provided to date has been incomplete and difficult to reconcile. Liberty has secured
information that permits identification of overall indicators of progress. Later sections of this
chapter discuss those indicators. However, the quality, scope, and depth of information necessary
for tight control and effective management of the massive and complex AMRP program were not
available.
The scope of this chapter calls for the presentation and analysis of numbers (e.g., how many miles
of pipe, numbers of services, and number of meters included in the AMRP and how many have
been completed so far). The reporting and analysis provided by Peoples Gas, however, limits the
quality of numbers reporting. The following discussion of the history of installed and retired pipe
exemplifies those limits. The table presented below provides the basis for the discussion that
follows. Its construction required three different information sources and a great deal of effort to
use the data. The nature and quality of data that Peoples Gas collected and reported to Liberty
requires the use of multiple information sources to produce even rudimentary understanding of
AMRP program progress.
Peoples Gas says that it has recognized the problem, and that it is has committed to retaining,
reporting, and analyzing data on a more effective basis. In the meantime, Liberty prepared this
chapter with the best information available.

d. Production History
Major public safety issues motivated AMRP creation. The priority of eliminating the most
dangerous pipe should be, and has been, paramount throughout the historical efforts to mitigate
public safety risks. Peoples Gas began its cast and ductile iron main replacement program in 1981.
In that year, cast and ductile iron main represented 86 percent of the total system (3,450 of 4,031
miles of distribution system main). The Company established the program largely in response to a
study concluding it would be reasonable to replace cast and ductile iron main by 2050.
Peoples Gas’ main replacement approach from the early 1980s until 1993 targeted gas main
segments based on vintage, diameter (primarily 4” and 6” pipe), and soil conditions.
Recommendations of an outside firm led Peoples Gas to target main buried in clay, considering it
more corrosive than other soils in the service territory. The Company retired an average of 77
miles of cast iron and ductile iron main each year from 1981 to 1993.
Peoples Gas established in 1993 a method for identifying poor performing main segments. This
Uniform Main Ranking Index supports identification of segments using installation year, operating
pressure, pipe diameter, and pipe material. The Company normalizes data to one city block for
evaluation purposes. Risk ranking criteria consider breaks, cracks at taps, pipe wall thickness,
visual observation, and incidence of leaks and other repairs. Each criterion has a multiplication
factor based on “Break Equivalents” which is then multiplied by the number of occurrences.
A 1993 follow-up outside engineering study led the Company to determine that clay soil actually
was not more corrosive than other soils. Peoples Gas then shifted replacement and retirement
priorities to the riskiest segments of main, as defined by a Uniform Main Ranking Index value
equal to or greater than 6. This change produced identification of many potential replacement

projects scattered across Peoples Gas’ territory. Peoples Gas used its field shop employees’ firsthand knowledge of pipe-segment maintenance and leak rates to prioritize replacement projects
further. The Company divided responsibility for its various field operations into three
geographically arranged “Shops.”
Peoples Gas modified this “Bang for the Buck” approach in 1996. The Company began to
introduce two additional ranking factors; i.e., risk ranking of main segments and public
improvement project needs. Renaming its efforts the “Capital Optimization Program,” Peoples
Gas began to identify poorly performing gas main segments using a method based on maintenance
history. During the period of 1994 to 2005 the Company retired, on average, 42 miles of cast iron
and ductile iron main annually.
From 2005 through 2008, Peoples Gas targeted for replacement those main segments that offered
the greatest reduction in future operation and maintenance expenses or uncollectible accounts
relative to the cost of the replacement. The Company manages moving inside meters to outside
locations in conjunction with the AMRP. Peoples Gas expected these moves to lower uncollectible
accounts by facilitating meter-reading and service shut-offs for delinquency. On average, Peoples
Gas retired 46 miles of cast iron and ductile iron each year from 2005 through 2008.
In 2006, Kiefner & Associates conducted a study of the system’s cast iron and ductile iron
facilities. The study concluded that the Main Ranking Index appeared to be ranking gas main
segments appropriately, based on prior maintenance history. The study recommended a staggered
retirement approach, based on pipe size and thickness, and focusing on replacing smaller pipe first.
Such pipe is generally considered more susceptible to breaks and cracks.
The Illinois Commerce Commission approved acceleration of cast and ductile iron main
replacement and related cost recovery in the 2009 Peoples Gas rate case. By the end of 2009, the
percentage of cast iron and ductile iron main in Peoples Gas’ distribution system had been reduced
to 46 percent (1,870 miles of cast iron and ductile iron main out of a total 4,086 miles of mains).
Peoples Gas began planning the AMRP in 2010, while it continued the existing annual cast iron
and ductile iron replacement program. In 2009 and 2010, Peoples Gas ramped up to begin
execution of the AMRP. Efforts focused on putting into place the resources to support the program.
The Company, however, significantly curtailed its level of capital spending for main replacement
in response to the nationwide 2008 financial crisis and continuing economic uncertainty. Peoples
Gas retired a total of only 40 miles of main in 2009 and 2010.
A 2011-2012 AMRP Construction Strategy White Paper documents the criteria for selecting
construction projects during the first two years of the 20-year AMRP. These criteria included:
 Illinois Commerce Commission commitments
 Areas where leak history indicated a need for attention
 Availability in the short term of Company and contractor labor resources
 Presence of infrastructure in place to support medium pressure system
 The likelihood of Public Improvement Projects within the two-year period
 The application of the Peoples Gas Main Ranking System.

Commitments made to the Illinois Commerce Commission prior to AMRP address general safety
concerns; e.g.:
 Replacing all main segments within one year of reaching or exceeding a replacement index
value of 6.0, regardless of location
 Replacing within one year of reaching or exceeding a replacement index value of 5.0 all
main segments that lie adjacent to schools, hospitals and nursing homes
 Replacing medium pressure ductile iron (AMRP) segments by the end of 2013
 Targeting replacement of cast and ductile iron main in the North District
 Replacing ductile iron, copper, and bare steel service pipes adjacent to schools, hospitals
and nursing homes by the end of 2011
 Replacing bare steel main by 2018
 Downsizing 15 high-maintenance “at risk” vaults annually.
Peoples Gas targeted the segments of main that satisfied these criteria in the first two AMRP years.
This approach caused a scattering of replacement work, in order to address “hot spots” across the
service territory. By the end of 2012, Peoples Gas’ replacement program had addressed most of
the projects identified through application of the Uniform Main Replacement Index criteria.
In 2011, the first year of AMRP, Peoples Gas installed 155 miles of new mains in the 2011 project
year. Several factors affected construction during the 2011 project year:
 Peoples Gas awarded construction bids for 2011 late in the year; the Company did not
award some 2011 project work until 2012.
 Peoples Gas chose to be aggressive during the first construction year, hoping to build
momentum quickly, instead of ramping up over the five-year period its contractor, Jacobs
Engineering, recommended. This approach made it difficult for other stakeholders (e.g.,
Peoples Gas Shops, City, city and state transportation officials) to accommodate the sudden
increase in workload.
 Permitting processes delayed construction, given the increased volume of requests by
Peoples Gas to the City and changing City requirements.
 Peoples Gas experienced increased coordination needs with respect to public improvement
efforts to minimize disruption.
 Contractors were no longer able to bore under streets due to cross-bore regulations; they
moved to open-cutting which lengthened project completion times.
 Peoples Gas had not communicated AMRP needs to affected customers during 2011; the
Company therefore at the end of 2011 had many “stragglers” still attached to the old main,
thereby prolonging retirements after replacement of that old main.
Retirement of a segment of old main cannot occur until: (a) installation of all service pipes onto
the new main, (b) installation of meters and regulators at customers’ premises, (c) gassing of the
new main, (d) transfer of all customers, and (e) degassing of the old main. These requirements
impose a natural lag time between crediting of new main installation and of old main retirement.
However, Peoples Gas focused primarily on getting as much pipe in the ground as possible during
the AMRP’s first year. Retirement and restoration comprised a lower priority. Peoples Gas
therefore retired only 19 miles of cast and ductile iron main in 2011.

Peoples Gas adopted a neighborhood-based approach to main replacement during 2013. This
approach divides the system into 228 neighborhood areas. The Company created a spreadsheet
model to rank the neighborhoods in terms of replacement priority. People’s Five-Year
Construction Plan forms the basis for neighborhood selection and phasing of the work. This plan
undergoes annual updates. In addition to neighborhood ranking, the plan attempts to:
 Balance workload across Peoples Gas’ three regionally-aligned shops
 Address needs and issues of aldermen representing the needs of their constituents
 Install sufficient high-pressure facilities to support the transition to medium pressure for
the distribution system as a whole
 Support the City’s current focus on accelerating replacement of water and sewer
infrastructure and other public improvement projects
 Coordinate with other utilities and the City’s paving program.
This approach continued for 2014, and comprises the planned approach for the next five years. It
permits Peoples Gas to shift priorities within the five-year plan in response to the main ranking
index scores, the City’s needs, and other needs.
From 1981 until AMRP start, Peoples Gas replaced 1,371 miles of cast and ductile iron pipe on
the system. The program assumes retiring approximately 100 miles of distribution main per year
for the next 16 years to complete the AMRP. The difference between retirements and installations
has significance in measuring AMRP performance. Amounts of high-risk main retired, not the
amount of new main required to replace it, constitutes an important safety risk reduction metric.
e. Analysis of Historical Production
The next chart summarizes main retirements since 1985.
Chart D.2: Cast and Ductile Iron Retirements History

Liberty’s particular focus lies on the period from the 2011 AMRP production start through the end
of 2014. The pattern before this period provides useful background nevertheless. The historic
pattern reveals that retirements in the most recent pre-AMRP years averaged less than 40 miles
per year. A fairly consistent level of twice that amount applied in the late 1980s. Given the
increasing national concern over leak-prone pipe, Liberty was surprised to see retirements at

Peoples Gas declining in the years leading up to the AMRP. Nevertheless, the historical data show
that the current annual AMRP production targets do not appear remarkable in light of rates
achieved in the late 1980s. The goal of 100 miles per year does not appear to require too great a
stretch from rates attained in the past, although replacement today poses different challenges.
Interpreting the data requires recognition of the difference between new installed pipe and pipe
retired. New installations generally exceed retirements. This difference is more pronounced under
the AMRP, primarily due to the practice of double decking. The use of double decking as a
construction approach results in the installation of two mains on a street, with each main feeding
one side of the street. In addition, Peoples Gas experienced significant time lags between the time
when some pipe is reported as installed and the corresponding retirement of the replaced pipe. The
following chart illustrates the historical difference between installed and retired pipe on a
cumulative basis.
Chart D.3: Installed Versus Retired Pipe Rates

The pre-AMRP ratio has run slightly above 1.0. That result is not unusual, because Peoples Gas
did not use double decking at that time. Without special circumstances, such as double decking,
one would assume that removed pipe would generally be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The ratio
has become substantially greater than 1.0 in the AMRP years, again, reflecting double decking and
the time lag. The latter factor has become particularly pronounced. The Company has not
expressed a targeted installed/replaced ratio befitting its particular circumstances. The pre-AMRP
ratio would clearly be too low. It would appear that the to-date AMRP ratio is clearly too high to
be sustained. For the longer term, the definition and use of a sound ratio target has significant value
to effective analysis and management. Such a target and the underlying data do not, however,
appear in Peoples Gas’ plans.
In order to derive a means for looking at the relationship between installations and retirements
(given the lack of a Peoples Gas metric) Liberty examined the 2014 planned quantities. Examining
data from progress reports yields a ratio of 1.28 for installed to retired miles of main. Liberty could
not find any recent longer-term data that would confirm or suggest revisions to this 1.28 ratio
calculation based on planned 2014 work. However, a review of the program cost estimate, as

May 5, 2015

Chapter D: AMRP Definition and Status

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

updated in 2012, shows a ratio of 1.54. Clearly, strong confidence in using such calculations is
not possible. Peoples Gas must address the lack of a target and of reporting against such a target.
f. AMRP Production
i. Mains
The next chart depicts miles of main installed and replaced since AMRP inception.
Chart D.4: AMRP Main Installation and Retirement Miles

Analyzing production to date requires clarification of the key parameters used. The AMRP targets
elimination of leak-prone pipe. This goal makes “retirements” the most directly relevant measure
of progress. However, retirements cannot take place until completion of replacements for the pipe
to be retired. Replacements therefore become an important measure. Moreover, analyzing costs
also brings attention to installation quantities. These quantities drive costs far more than do
retirements. Thus, while the correct measure of bottom line schedule achievement remains
“retirements,” sound management also required monitoring and managing installation
effectiveness, efficiency, and schedule. The lack of a clear plan defining installation quantities and
the absence of a metric employing the ratio of installed to retired miles make such monitoring
difficult.
Peoples Gas has measured AMRP progress using the next chart.

Chart D.5: AMRP Progress Measurement by Peoples Gas

The Company has updated this chart only through the end of 2012. Moreover, it contains incorrect
data. The December 2014 progress report, coming two years later, still shows this chart in its
incorrect state. Most significantly, management cited this same chart as evidence that the project
is on track, and in fact somewhat ahead of schedule. Peoples Gas’ reliance on this chart (with its
incorrect data points) as an indicator of program performance in 2014 provides a clear example of
the need for significant change and improvement in AMRP monitoring and oversight. The next
chart blows up and corrects the one that the Company has offered as an AMRP performance
measurement basis. The dotted line shows data from 2014 monthly progress reports. The
remaining data comes from the preceding chart.
Chart D.6: Corrected AMRP Performance Chart

The corrected information places AMRP progress actually behind, not ahead of, plan in 2012. It
remained so in 2013, and fell further behind in 2014. The deviation at the end of 2014 amounts to

about 100 miles, which equates roughly to one year of planned production. The production trend
after four full production years deviates from the plan, with the deviation growing in 2014. The
next table summarizes main quantities installed and retired on annual and cumulative bases.

Relatively high installed quantities may indicate good progress. One, however, cannot place
confidence in that result absent a sound targeted installed-to-retired ratio. That ratio comprises a
critical parameter in understanding performance but Liberty has seen no specification by Peoples
Gas of the required level. The importance of such a ratio flows from the fact that it sets the value
for how much new pipe must be installed. The 2012 estimate assumed 1.54 miles of new pipe for
each mile of pipe retired. If this requirement is correct, one could equate the installed pipe so far
(547.2 miles) to a corresponding amount of retirements presumably pending. The calculation
simply would divide the amount of installed pipe by the ratio. That calculation would produce 355
miles. One would therefore conclude that the high amount of installations, regardless of how it
compares to annual plans, nevertheless remains insufficient to support a 100 mile per year
retirement effort.
Using another method, one could plot the installation quantities required to support a 100 mile per
year retirement schedule. This approach (see the following chart) would require 154 miles of
installations, assuming use of the 1.54 ratio from the 2012 estimate. This method would indicate
that only the 2011 and 2014 installation rates supported a 100 mile per year retirement effort.

Projecting an AMRP completion date needs to consider the installment/retirement ratio.
Extrapolating retirement data to date suggests that a significant delay past 2030 completion looms.
Liberty describes below its basis for concluding that the program has already fallen a year or more
behind schedule. If in fact it has, extrapolating that delay across the long remaining AMRP life
produces a completion date far behind the one addressed in the 2009 rate case. The need for
corrective measures thus becomes clear. However, such an extrapolation is simplistic. It may prove
incorrect based on actual physical installation progress so far. On the whole, Liberty considers
pessimism to reflect the better judgment. This report addresses the many areas where program
management and control warrant material improvement. It also addresses problems with progress
information completeness and accuracy and the lack of analysis of data that does exist.
Absent top quality management and control, and lacking comprehensive and accurate performance
data and reporting, it becomes difficult to maintain the optimism required to anticipate strong
schedule performance. Super-projects (like the AMRP) invariably prove very difficult to manage,
even under the best circumstances. Current circumstances and the current AMRP management
mode make it proper to consider the Company’s ability to sustain required production levels
needed to support 2030 completion at high risk. Actual retirement progress also supports such an
assessment, although the treatment of the installed-to-retired ratio might mitigate that conclusion.
ii. Services and Meters
AMRP management generates even less data on service and meter installations than is the case for
pipe quantities. The next two tables summarize the limited data available. Liberty was able to use
multiple information sources to generate a simplistic depiction of production in these areas, but
not much more. Of particular note, data that shows planned versus actual installations is only
available for 2013-2014. The first of the two following tables shows this comparison.
Table D.9: Planned and Actual Service and Meter Installations

Table D.10: Annual Service and Meter Installations

The second of the two preceding tables shows recorded service and meter installations for the
AMRP. Substantial meter installations occurred in 2011 and 2012, but AMRP management did
not track them until after early 2012. Liberty expected, but could not find, a target or plan/budget

assumption that would allow comparison of these volumes to some clear standard. The lack of a
comprehensive 20-year plan setting forth such a standard precludes an effective answer from the
perspective of AMRP management. The data available to measure against plan suggests that
production lags behind intended levels. The absence of a long-term plan with quantified
expectations, however, prevents putting these measurements into perspective for effective use by
AMRP management, or for outside analysis by Liberty or others.
In order to provide some perspective, Liberty used the planned ratios for 2014. For this year all
planned data proved available. The ratios for 2014 are 106 services and 207 meters per mile of
installed pipe. Using such ratios is hypothetical (in terms of suggesting a long-term metric). They
do, however, provide at least one recent source for approximating the production necessary to
maintain progress and measure status. Using an annual main replacement target of 100 miles per
year of pipe, the 2014 ratios produce the service and meter replacement requirements (and resulting
deviations) through 2014 that the next table summarizes.

Later chapters of this report make clear that work at the front (main installation) end of the process
better supports AMRP progress. Contractors perform this role. Rather, difficulties have been much
more apparent in the back end of the process. Back end activities include service and meter work,
which Peoples Gas internal resources perform. This differential performance has occurred despite
the fact that the greater physical challenges of AMRP lie in the installation phase. Back-end
problems would appear to be easier to correct. If so, then our first scenario may overstate the
schedule situation. Liberty constructed a second scenario. It used ratios derived from the quantities
from the 2012 (updated) cost estimate. That information indicates the following data points for
relating key installation components: a ratio of 1.54 for installed/retired mains, 95 for services, and
134 for meters per mile of installed pipe. The next table shows the results produced by this
scenario. On balance, both sets of ratios would conclude that retirements and meters lie
considerably behind schedule, perhaps in the range of one year.

g. Cost and Productivity Performance
The next table summarizes AMRP spending through 2014. The table shows a planned, significant
ramp-up in 2014. An increase in the rate of spending did occur, but to a level significantly less
than planned. Spending in every major category ran below 2014 budget. At first glance, the levels
of production described earlier in this chapter would thus seem high, given the level of
underspending. If those spending levels reflect the application of insufficient resources relative to
plan, then high levels of production would not be anticipated, absent particularly high productivity.
Table D.13: AMRP Spending Summary

AMRP data makes reported quantities uncertain. The inability to gather this data on a consistent
basis substantially restricts the ability to conduct productivity analysis. Peoples Gas provided labor
hours for some internal work, but not for contractor work. Contractors perform the bulk of AMRP
work. Liberty observed a lack of reported contractor hours in other cases. However common the
practice may be in the industry, Liberty finds it inconsistent with best practice, and particularly so
on a program of the scope, magnitude, and duration of the AMRP.
Meter installations comprise the only AMRP area where productivity analysis can use hours
required to produce units of work output. The next table summarizes meter productivity data that
can be generated. Even for meters, however, no AMRP standard, assumption, or metric exists
against which to compare installation productivity. The existence of a baseline for measuring
productivity and the use of that baseline for continuous measurement and analysis is fundamental
to effective management of even projects and programs much smaller than the AMRP. For
example, the data in the next table shows a 10 percent drop in production from 2013 to 2014, even
though hours spent did not change substantially. Finding out why such developments occur
requires the use of standards and targets, the collection of actual performance information, and
ongoing analysis of deviations, which Liberty did not find to be a focus of AMRP management.

Table D.14: Meter Installation Productivity

Hours spent comprises the most direct means of analyzing productivity. The lack of AMRP labor
hour data in other areas, however, restricts productivity analysis to the use of dollars. Good project
and cost management requires a complete understanding of all labor hours. Chapter L: Cost
Management addresses the need to develop such an understanding, especially for contractors. The
data for mains installed has, as the next table shows, demonstrated improvement. Dollars spent per
mile installed have declined. Data for services allows no meaningful observations. The trend for
meters, as productivity measured in hours showed, is problematic.
Table D.15: Dollar-Measured AMRP Productivity

Peoples Gas stated that it has committed to making substantial improvements in its capabilities for
analyzing costs and productivity. The limits on current capabilities mean that program
management has much to do in terms of gathering consistent data and applying sound analysis to
that data.
From a total cost point of view, management of the AMRP still uses the original, 2009 estimate,
updated in 2012. Liberty believes that the resulting cost of $4.451 billion will prove too low.
Moreover, this estimate used 2012 dollars; i.e., it provides for no escalation of costs due to
inflation. In addition, the estimate provides for no contingencies which, for a twenty-year program,
generally prove substantial.
h. The Plan and List of Projects
Part Two of this report discusses AMRP planning. For purposes of this chapter, which summarizes
AMRP definition and status, the existing program plan lacks a number of important features. It
lacks an identification of key parameters. It does not address quantities, resources, installation
rates, unit costs, and key assumptions sufficiently. Generally, Peoples Gas has equated a plan with
a list of work. In that regard, a plan does exist. The AMRP does have a full list of the projects to
be completed over the 20-year timespan. The appendix to this chapter sets forth that list.

i. Company Analyses and Corrective Actions
The AMRP monthly report comprises the program’s primary source of reporting. This lengthy
document contains a great deal of data, most of which has no substantial usefulness for
management or for executives charged with project oversight. The most notable gaps lie in the
lack of analysis of performance and of direct and measurable recommendations for corrective
actions. The report also provides no work force data. This absence restricts the ability to measure
and verify adjustments to resources needed to accelerate schedule or mitigate delays.
j. Comparisons with Similarly-Situated Companies
Major main replacement work has become more common in the industry. It is useful to examine
the performance of others, in order to provide a benchmark for gauging one’s own approaches,
methods, practices, and results. Liberty’s inquiries uncovered no organized or documented
approach to meeting this need at Peoples Gas. Instead, Integrys senior managers cite the experience
of Jacobs Engineering, which leads and for the most part staffs the Project Management Office.
Integrys management considers the experience of its contractor sufficient to provide insight into
other companies’ efforts, making other efforts to compare approaches and performance with other
utilities unnecessary. Management also cites conversations by the Executive Vice President –
Natural Gas Segment. We have found no organized follow-up to those conversations.

3. Conclusions
D.1

Current AMRP plans do not provide for sufficient program definition and the
program has not been supported with sufficient assembly and analysis of
performance information. (Recommendations D.1 through D.6)

The AMRP should operate under a comprehensive and credible long-term plan that addresses all
major components in a complete and consistent fashion. Liberty found that the AMRP does not
have an integrated, up-to-date, sufficiently comprehensive program plan. Such a plan should
clearly state critical assumptions. Liberty found critical planning assumptions neither well defined
nor well documented. The kind of plan that the AMRP requires includes the provision of suitable
contingencies for growth and other uncertainties. Liberty found no provision for contingencies or
allowances to address the change and growth that are all but inevitable for a program of the
AMRP’s scope, complexity, and duration. Program management does not address these matters
on a long-term basis, but confines contingency use to annual planning, and even in that case,
largely limited to contractor work.
The program management organization does not have detailed information about progress to date.
Performance data is not consistent, fully reliable, or well-suited to the analysis that a program such
as the AMRP requires. Past performance does not undergo rigorous and continual analysis to
ensure optimization. Liberty has not found detailed, meaningful analysis of performance for the
purpose of identifying improvement opportunities. Neither did Liberty’s field work disclose
substantial documentation of corrective actions taken to address performance issues. Scope change
typically has a significant impact on programs like the AMRP. There should exist clear
documentation of the degree to which scope evolution has affected the program. Scope growth,
particularly in terms of expanding project requirements has had an impact on the AMRP. That
impact is not well-documented or quantified. The absence of data produces an inability of program

management and senior leadership to isolate AMRP activities and costs from those of other work
commonly managed with AMRP projects.
The following conclusions provide more detail regarding these general conclusions, and other
areas material to the definition and status of the AMRP.
D.2

Peoples Gas has not sufficiently defined AMRP scope. (Recommendation D.1)

The AMRP represents a massive commitment by the Company. Its reporting, both internally and
externally, must be crystal clear. At the present time, the nature of this commitment does not appear
to be universally understood internally. Moreover, scope is often reported as mixed with other
(e.g., QIP, but non-AMRP) projects. Senior Integrys executive management expressed to Liberty
the intent to establish a “world class” approach to AMRP management. Liberty considers that
commitment as appropriate, if the Company is to optimize program performance. It certainly
makes sense to apply such an approach to capital projects other than AMRP as well. Nevertheless,
AMRP reporting cannot be confused with other projects. The commitments are substantial, and
must be reported separately and clearly.
D.3

The collection, maintenance, and presentation of AMRP performance data falls well
below standard. (Recommendation D.2)

The quality of the data, after more than four years, does not serve a program of any substantial
size, let alone a multi-billion dollar super-project like the AMRP. Basic data remains fragmented,
inconsistent, dated, and in some cases in error. Assembly of data sets often requires more than one
source, with the result that anyone trying to analyze performance, whether internal or external to
Peoples Gas, cannot be sure of the validity of the data.
Costs are not presented in a manner that facilitates analysis. Planned quantities, except in a few
instances, are not presented nor compared to actuals. Labor data, perhaps the most important
management parameter, is lacking. That lack substantially constrains management’s ability to
gauge the potential impact of added resources. Productivity in most areas cannot be determined in
helpful ways. Moreover, some critical data, including the retirement data cited by management as
the most important measure, is in error, and has not undergone updating for two years.
D.4

The goal to retire 100 miles of leak-prone main per year is reasonably achievable,
assuming effective program management.

In the seven years between 1985 and 1991, Peoples Gas retired an average of more than 79 miles
of leak-prone pipe per year. The Company’s history includes more than 100 miles retired in 1991.
The 1991 production of 101 miles remains the peak performance level, even after four AMRP
production years. History suggests that the AMRP target of 100 miles is reasonably achievable,
especially considering the massive commitment of money and resources.
However, the requirements associated with replacing a mile of pipe in 1991 have not remained
static in the years that have transpired. The number of supporting installed miles now (given double
decking) is much higher. Public expectations and government requirements are much greater as
well. Nevertheless, the scaling factor (comparing to the late 1980s) in raw terms is only 25 percent,

May 5, 2015

Page D-17

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report
Chapter D: AMRP Definition and Status

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

but in real terms is likely more than 100. That factor appears manageable in the escalated
framework of an AMRP.
D.5

Production levels to date are not commensurate with program requirements or
commitments although the most labor-intensive parameter, main installations, is
somewhat encouraging.

Using retirements as an AMRP “bottom line” suggests that the 268 miles retired after four years
lags well behind the required 100 mile annual pace. Similarly, service installations have lagged
somewhat, and meter installations more so. It is encouraging that the installations comprising the
front end of the construction process (and the most labor-intensive part) have been proceeding at
a faster pace. Whether that pace is sufficient to maintain schedule, however, cannot be gauged
from the AMRP information that management can produce at this time.
D.6

After four years, the project is not “on target” as suggested by Integrys management,
but lags schedule and the trend is toward further schedule loss. (Recommendation D.3)

AMRP performance data certainly should, but does not support a reasonably precise estimate of
schedule performance versus 20-year requirements. Liberty took various approaches to
hypothesizing estimates in substitution for data that does not exist. These estimates led Liberty to
conclude that the schedule is at least six months and perhaps a year or more behind schedule. This
lag is disconcerting, given the short amount of time it has taken to lose so much ground. Liberty
acknowledges that our assessment uses limited and questionable data, but available information
does not permit a better assessment.
D.7

Peoples Gas has not mustered sufficient resources to support the AMRP in the last
two years, as evidenced by significant under-spending versus the annual budget.
(Recommendation D.4)

The AMRP lacks the resource plan it needs for planning and performance assessment purposes.
Absent the type of assessments such a plan would support, Liberty concluded that recurring underspending against annual estimates and performance at the back-end of the process (e.g., meters
and retirements) provide primary indicators that Peoples Gas has not applied sufficient resources
to sustain progress at targeted levels.
At the present time, the only visible resource reporting comes in the form of a homogenized chart
of all resources presented under the title of “jobs created” in the monthly progress report. We have
never seen project resources described or presented in such a manner. Such reporting may serve
other purposes, but it serves no evident program management purpose, particularly given its status
as the only resource metric provided. Further, the AMRP has no plan against which one can
compare actual staffing. Absent such comparisons, management cannot effectively determine
whether the data presented is bad or good in terms of optimizing program performance.

The very limited productivity analysis possible at this time suggests comparatively
stronger performance in main installations (performed by contractors) and a negative
trend in meter installations (performed by Peoples Gas internal resources).
(Recommendation D.5)

The unit cost of mains installed has been decreasing slightly year-over-year. Even small decreases
can be viewed as positive considering rising program demands and escalation in the unit costs of
resources from year to year. The Peoples Gas-managed elements, however, (notably meters), are
trending in the other direction, and require analysis and action, as appropriate.
D.9

Peoples Gas’ current project cost estimate significantly understates likely costs over
the full AMRP duration. (Recommendation D.6)

The most recent estimate is now nearly three years old and Peoples Gas has acknowledged that it
is no longer useful. A comprehensive, well-founded update is required as a matter of first priority.
The 2012 estimate does not consider escalation, and does not include any allowances for future
growth or uncertainty. Accordingly, one should expect that a new, comprehensive, long-term
estimate (prepared in accordance with good estimating practices) will evidence a substantial
increase over the 2012 forecast.

4. Recommendations
D.1

As part of the new planning effort now underway, Peoples Gas should provide a clear
and unambiguous description of the AMRP, including quantities for all parameters
important to management of the project. (Conclusions D.1 and D.2)

Part Two of this report addresses the requirements of effective plans. Such parameters include, at
a minimum, all production quantities, labor hours and costs corresponding to production quantities,
definition of “AMRP projects,” key milestones, details for support functions, and resource
requirements and plans.
D.2

Peoples Gas should accompany regularly reported performance data with insightful
analysis in order to make the data immediately meaningful to management oversight
and supportive of timely and responsive improvement and corrective initiatives and
activities. (Conclusions D.1 and D.3)

Chapter O: Reports and Analysis addresses reporting requirements. For the present, this chapter
has cited a number of examples of reporting gaps or weaknesses. Program management and
executive oversight depend on candid and insightful reporting of performance. Managers and
executives cannot provide effective oversight and instigate efforts to improve performance when
they receive inadequate information. Those charged with management and oversight have no
material use for meaningless data or information and analysis upon which they cannot act. What
has become a long-term set of performance reporting issues needs to be corrected with
communication.
D.3

Peoples Gas should provide a realistic schedule assessment based on an effective
program plan. (Conclusions D.1 and D.6)

Peoples Gas must correct promptly its inability to access short-term performance and, more
importantly, the long-term schedule outlook. Peoples Gas needs performance targets based on
May 5, 2015

long-term program requirements immediately. Simply providing a plan to make up the current
schedule deviation over the next 15 years is likely to be simplistic and of little value. A more indepth analysis is required, together with a front-end-loaded corrective scheme.
D.4

Peoples Gas should prepare a soundly derived, detailed resource plan and provide for
full coordination between the annual budget and resulting resource requirements.
(Conclusions D.1 and D.7)

The lack of a resource plan precludes effective spending plans and subsequent analysis of program
schedules and performance. The gap was evidenced in 2014 when management sought contractor
action to mitigate schedule delays, but did not have a sound basis to judge original contractor
staffing plans and subsequent contractor staffing increases. The same problem existed with Peoples
Gas engineering and crafts.
D.5

In light of apparent decreases in productivity, Peoples Gas should promptly complete
an analysis of productivity associated with the installation of meters. (Conclusions D.1
and D.8)

Compared to the first two years of production (2012-13), the third year of meter installations
(2014) suffered a productivity decline of about 10 percent. Absent a proper baseline for
comparison, Liberty notes that this observation does not mean productivity was good in 2012-13,
but only that productivity in 2014 was worse.
D.6

Peoples Gas should promptly complete a new program cost estimate consistent with
good estimating practices. (Conclusions D.1 and D.9)

Chapter K: Cost Estimating discusses estimating requirements. The new estimate should include
sufficient consideration of escalation and allowances for uncertainty and growth.

Chapter E: The Plan for Management
1. Background
This chapter:
 Discusses the overall or “master” plan for management of the AMRP, its relationship to
lower levels of program and project management, and the procedures and process for
effectively carrying out program and project management
 Describes the fit between the Integrys and Peoples Gas organization and resources and
approaches to providing for AMRP management, oversight, and control
 Addresses the importance of selecting an effective model or approach to AMRP
management, oversight, and control
 Assesses the management plan adopted for AMRP management, oversight, and control
 Discusses AMRP scope, plan, and execution structure
 Evaluates key overall elements of AMRP management at the program level.
The utility industry recognizes the need for an effective master plan for projects or programs of
substantial size and duration. The need for an effective plan to manage such projects or programs
has equal importance, but less universal recognition. The “plan for management,” or the “plan for
execution,” lies below the project master plan in planning hierarchy, but makes an equally critical
contribution to effective and efficient performance. The next illustration shows the planning
hierarchy appropriate for a program like the AMRP.
Illustration E.1: Plan Hierarchy

The master plan describes overall program scope, cost, quantities, schedule, expectations, and
resources. Effectively answering the question of “What is the AMRP?” should comprise its
principal focus. The question of “How will we manage the AMRP?” should form the focus of the
plan of execution. This second level plan should address the program management approach, the
approach for managing the program’s specific projects, the organizations responsible, the cost and
schedule systems that apply, the means for assuring quality, the forms that oversight will take, and
the applicable controls. The final level of the hierarchy (procedures, work plans, schedules)
describes the details that guide actions that the plan of execution contemplates.

Peoples Gas adopted at the outset of the AMRP a plan to which Liberty’s report makes a number
of references. The contents of this so-called Project Execution Plan make it largely a plan for
execution. Its level of detail extends well beyond that contemplated by a master plan.
An effective master plan defines the scope and commitments of the program in terms of production
requirements, cost, progress and performance goals, organizational approaches, skills and resource
needs. This top level plan should provide a summary-level treatment of each element needed to
communicate the nature of the program. It should provide a clear picture of management’s
commitments and expectations. The communication aspects of the master plan serve a critical role.
For a program like the AMRP, the master plan must define what will be done. Its clarity and
completeness in providing this definition serve a purpose outside AMRP management as well. It
should be sufficient to allow regulators and stakeholders to form correct and sufficient expectations
and understandings of management commitments.
The management plan, or the plan for execution, describes the management of the program. The
approach to project management, roles and responsibilities of participating organizations, cost
management approach, scheduling and schedule control, resource planning, quality management,
procurement, management systems, oversight, and controls exemplify the elements required in a
sound management plan.
Comprehensive detailed procedures, plans, schedules, and other implementing activities, systems,
and tools must also exist. They promote effective and efficient execution of the management or
execution plan. The remainder of this Part Two and the chapters of Part Three of this report address
them. The top-level plan for management should not contain this extensive detail, given its overall
role and purpose. The plan for management should lay a strong foundation for giving confidence
to executive management and the board of directors that program management has created and
operates under sound day-to-day direction. The management plan thus comprises a strong
contributor to effective oversight and governance. Too much detail diminishes its effectiveness, as
happened in the AMRP’s early years. The management plan effectively operates as a contract
among program management, executive management, and the board of directors. It should provide
a clear and comprehensive baseline for defining and measuring the effectiveness of management’s
execution of the program.
A plan for management must reflect the specific attributes of the organization that will execute it.
An organization may have weaknesses (or strengths) in certain attributes or cultural characteristics.
The plan for management should recognize such attributes. It should adopt, for example, specific
features to mitigate organizational weaknesses. Creating elaborate systems and tools does not
promote effectiveness and efficiency where systemic or cultural constraints preclude their effective
application. Such constraints can prove difficult to identify. Personnel inside an organization often
have no awareness of them, or in some cases the willingness to disclose them.

2. Findings
a. Organizational Assessment
The plan for management must align with the attributes and attitudes of the organization. For
example, inordinate priority for engineering perfection can make control of scope very
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

cumbersome. An objective self-assessment of the organization should take place before
establishing a plan for the management of a program of the AMRP’s size, complexity, and
duration. The need for such an assessment often goes unrecognized. When it does, plans formed
on the basis of assumptions that do not comport fully with program and organization needs often
result.
That was the case with initial AMRP planning. A self-assessment at the outset of the AMRP
planning would have identified circumstances like the following:
 The program’s 20-year duration and multi-billion dollar costs make a “world class”
management program and organization both appropriate and affordable.
 Peoples Gas/Integrys had insufficient in-house skills, management capabilities, and
management systems to provide world-class management of the program. The
management plan therefore needed to provide for the acquisition and development of
needed skills, capabilities, and systems.
 Internal relationships between Peoples Gas and Integrys would not permit the fully
cooperative effort required for a program of this magnitude. That relationship effectively
ruled out a “weak” project manager approach. A matrix approach (in which the project
manager has limited direct authority over the managers critical to program success) works
well for many organizations and projects. It effectiveness, however, depends on the
particular circumstances at hand. At Peoples Gas, a “strong” management structure would
best serve to nurture (or force) the requisite level of cooperation.
Liberty observed internal conflicts and cultural issues at Peoples Gas and Integrys. Such
circumstances are not unusual in parent/subsidiary relationships, particularly following
acquisitions. In the case of Peoples Gas, the conflicts and cultural issues concern apportionment
of responsibility, specifically between program management (Integrys) and construction (Peoples
Gas). Integrys management had limited ability to direct performance and to influence Peoples Gas
construction responsibilities. As schedule performance in the Peoples Gas scope declined, program
management personnel lacked the ability to bring about corrections directly.
Senior leadership at Integrys recognized this issue. Appointing an executive vice president with a
broad enough job description and responsibilities to cover both organizations reflected an effort to
manage conflicting approaches and priorities. However, that appointment did not resolve the
issues.
Five years into the program, the need for response to these circumstances remains. Senior
leadership, however, does appear committed to new initiatives to restructure the program in a
manner designed to address them. However, a great deal of work lies ahead in turning those
initiatives into meaningful and lasting change.
b. Management Plan
Best practice views the plan for management as separate and distinct from the plan of execution.
Some organizations, however, merge some or all of the characteristics of the two into a single
planning document. Early in the AMRP, Jacobs Engineering took the lead in drafting for Peoples
Gas a Project Execution Plan (“PEP”). That extensive document incorporated many characteristics
that define an appropriate plan of execution. It represented a sound first step in providing for strong

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

and effective management of the AMRP. The principal failings associated with its introduction lie
in the lack of follow-up work to build upon that plan and its execution. Over the AMRP’s early
years, some of the Project Execution Plan’s valuable ideas and concepts failed to mature
sufficiently, or fell by the wayside. Thus, despite the thought and care that went into this plan, four
years later, it has become difficult to see how the document serves the AMRP.
The Project Execution Plan may have proven premature, in the sense that the Project Management
Office could not meet the standards it set. The plan’s 113-page length may have contributed to its
failure to become a central and ongoing part of program management as well. Its length is certainly
daunting for use at executive and oversight levels. A simplified and more concise expression for
those responsible for top-level oversight may have led to more effective use of the plan as a source
for building a better program management, control, and oversight structure. Liberty found,
however, that the AMRP has not developed (as discussed in other chapters of this report) an
approach that makes sufficient demands on program management, in terms of ensuring scrutiny
over and challenges of program management decisions and actions.
The original plan’s authors also contemplated an annual update. Management has not followed
through on that schedule. Liberty found no updates. Senior leadership has committed to a
significant effort to revamp the document, which Liberty finds appropriate. The need to do so,
however, illustrates its diminishing role as a source of definition and guidance across the AMRP’s
early years.
Liberty found the Project Execution Plan a quality product exhibiting knowledge about what to
do. Some of the expectations it created in fact reached for an industry-leading position. The plan
called, for example, for the “transformation of PGL from a reactive system maintenance
organization to a state-of-the-art modern, progressive and proactive gas utility.” AMRP
management would find itself in a much better position today, had it provided the attention and
support needed to approach the status contemplated by that plan.
Observing the lack of follow-through in pursuing the original Project Execution Plan has particular
relevance today. New senior leadership at Peoples Gas has expressed a notable commitment to
making improvements in the management and execution of the AMRP. That commitment includes
a stated initiative to revise the plan and to make it a cornerstone of program management. The
lesson that history at Peoples Gas teaches concerns the ability to sustain that commitment and to
make the new plan more than a “shelf document” as the program progresses. It will take a level of
persistence and dedication that did not occur before, and that must be considered at risk still.
Liberty’s began discussions with new management about improvement initiatives last September.
Those discussions produced the observation that management recognizes the propriety of healthy
skepticism about the ability to make real and lasting change. That skepticism places a heavy burden
on management to present strong solutions and credible implementation plans, to provide for their
full and prompt execution, and to ensure their continuation and further evolution across the
AMRP’s long remaining duration.
Summarizing some of the Project Execution Plan’s important features, Liberty found that it
contained a reasonable, although too detailed, scope. Given the current state of the AMRP and its

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

controls, Liberty considers it appropriate to place particular emphasis on several key control
processes in the revised program plans, including:
 A cost estimating capability supported by processes that: (a) establish a valid cost
monitoring base, and (b) forecast final program costs with an appropriate level of
confidence and in the context of a comprehensive addressing of risk, or contingency
 A scheduling organization and processes that produce realistic schedules at all levels,
containing the details required to support engineering, permitting, procurement, work
planning, construction, and contractor activities
 Resource planning that employs staffing strategies, crew allocations, contractor
management, training requirements, and productivity measurements
 A work management process that supports the facilitation of work activities that extend
from design through construction to completion
 A cost management program that promotes a culture of program cost control, and supports
it with organizational clout, experienced and professional resources, and an emphasis on
enhancing effectiveness and efficiency
 Cost reporting designed to precipitate corrective and improvement actions
 Scope control that identifies potential scope growth, to minimize cost and schedule impacts
 Procurement strategies that take advantage of large purchases to obtain favorable pricing,
timely deliveries that support the program, above average service, and other benefits
derived from the leverage that the AMRP gives Peoples Gas in dealing with providers
 Contracting management that takes advantage of the magnitude and long-term nature of a
mega-program to develop beneficial and creative relationships with contractors.
c. Choosing an Effective Operating Model
The AMRP requires managing in a manner consistent with the requirements of a multi-billion
dollar mega-program having a multi-decade duration. Doing so requires clear assignment of
responsibilities under an organization structure that provides dedicated resources to all planning,
permitting, design, procurement, construction, completion, and project management and control
functions. Each of those functions must operate under a clear and comprehensive description of
the activities required to support overall program success.
The organization must operate under active and dedicated owner leadership and management. A
twenty-year program provides an opportunity Peoples Gas should take to develop a dedicated core
of internal personnel in program management positions. Doing so will enhance program
management and oversight and will provide a unique opportunity for leadership development
generally.
The AMRP organization must provide strong resources (in numbers and talent) and high levels of
system and process sophistication. Only experienced people operating in a sound structure and in
sufficient numbers can make sound overall strategies and plans work effectively. A program such
as the AMRP spans much of a career-long duration. It calls for significant investment in
development and retention of field, supervisory, management, and executive employees.
A recent PwC review observed the absence of a formally defined operating model or project
delivery strategy recognizing new regulatory cost treatment. PwC also observed gaps in associated
May 5, 2015

The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

processes and controls. Peoples Gas reported during mid-summer 2014 Liberty field work that the
AMRP leadership model remained an open issue. PwC also reported finding executive recognition
of “the need to define and re-establish a formal project delivery strategy and operating model,”
and that “the responsible executives are proceeding with these efforts.”
Liberty learned early in its work that the operating model question remained open primarily
because of leadership issues at Peoples Gas and Integrys. Peoples Gas announced the retirement
of its president in April of 2014, but did not name his successor until early September. In June
2014, Integrys also promoted the AMRP’s executive manager to the position of Executive Vice
President of Integrys’ Gas Business Unit. This promotion made him responsible for management
of Integrys gas utility operations beyond those of Peoples Gas. His replacement, or to whom the
AMRP would report, had not yet been identified.
Nine days after the promotion of this Integrys senior executive, Wisconsin Energy announced that
it would acquire Integrys. That announcement came with the statement that the proposed acquirer
did not contemplate that the new executive vice president (or any other Integrys or Peoples Gas
executive) would form part of the post-acquisition senior management team. Wisconsin Energy
stated that:
Upon completion of the transaction, [Wisconsin Energy’s current CEO] will become
chairman and CEO of the combined company. [The current Integrys CEO] will remain in
his current roles with Integrys until the closing of the transaction, when he will retire. The
other senior leadership roles in the combined company will be filled by current senior
officers of Wisconsin Energy.
Liberty’s discussions about AMRP planning, organization, and structure thus came in the midst of
large uncertainties caused by present and pending changes in senior leadership. Very senior
Integrys management personnel stated to Liberty that some questions about program structure
would be for post-acquisition management to address. Liberty was given to understand that major
policy issues were “on hold” pending the leadership transitions at Peoples Gas and Integrys.
A special analysis team Integrys formed in January 2014 had responsibility for addressing issues
about project delivery strategy. Its work appropriately took an end-to-end focus, seeking process
improvements from long-term plan to project close-out. Liberty’s observations of this team, which
worked with PwC, corroborated the need to address overall AMRP planning. Their concerns, as
well as those of PwC, bear substantial similarity to a number of those developed by Liberty,
including:
 Inconsistent perceptions about how AMRP management would operate in the future
 Definition of long-term plans and roles of the Project Management Office
 Facilitating and emphasizing “ownership” of key processes
 Assigning accountability for work tasks
 Providing for a full understanding of program and project roles.
As of September 2014, action on addressing team recommendations was reported as awaiting
completion of a change in the top Peoples Gas executive position. That transition has now
occurred. As discussed throughout this report, that transition has produced expressions of

ICC14GAS0002

commitment to a number of important initiatives. New leadership has shown attention to a broad
series of changes. However, Liberty considers the future of current new management at Peoples
Gas to be in doubt, given the pending acquisition.
d. Program Management
i. Approach
The choice of how to structure and design a project organization has far-reaching implications.
Two primary options have common industry application, with variations in between them.
The first approach employs what the industry terms a “weak” project manager: While it may sound
negative, a “weak” project structure often proves very effective. The next chart illustrates this
approach. A weak approach uses a largely matrix-type organization. The functional groups (e.g.,
engineering, construction, procurement, quality) take day-to-day technical direction from
functional management and project direction from the project manager, usually via a dotted-line
relationship. Decision-making occurs at the functional level and functional managers have limited
accountability to the project manager.
Chart E.2: Typical “Weak” (Matrix) Project Structure

The second approach employs a so-called “strong” project manager. The term does not refer to the
project manager’s capabilities or style. Rather, it denotes the use of a dedicated project
organization that employs full-time (not matrixed) functional groups reporting to the project
manager. These groups may also have a dotted-line relationship for technical support and direction
back to a functional leader. The project manager has full authority.

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chart E.3: Strong Project Manager Structure

A broad spectrum of choices exists between the two approaches pictured above. Organization
designers have many workable options. The following illustration shows the differences and the
range of options.
Figure E.4: Features Differentiating Project Approaches

There is no universal, correct choice. The weak project management approach often serves as the
optimum approach. It actually requires a strong manager; i.e., one who gets things done by
consensus building or “jawboning,” rather than by exercising direct authority. Approaches moving
toward the “weak” end of the spectrum require increasing degrees of cooperation and teamwork.
The strong approach brings advantages in a number of circumstances. First, only the largest
projects can afford large groups of dedicated resources. The smaller the project, the more likely
the need for sharing resources. Second, technical expertise theoretically becomes weaker, because
one no longer has call on the entire technical organization and leadership. Project success, under
strong project management, becomes more dependent on the capabilities of dedicated resources.
Liberty does not consider the choice of a weak project management approach for the AMRP
optimum. First, the relationship between Integrys and Peoples Gas did not commend an approach
that relies more on cooperation among organizations with different priorities and approaches.
Equally important, the size and duration of the AMRP make a dedicated organization with
comparatively larger numbers of qualified people more affordable. Management can secure strong

ICC14GAS0002

contributors, assign them only to the AMRP, sustain a large and dedicated staff over the program’s
life, and offer career-length opportunities for many.
A program like the AMRP cannot function effectively as a “tack-on” to day-to-day responsibilities
and activities of a company like Peoples Gas. Regular program functions, not to mention inevitable
crises, require a dedicated structural approach to serve program needs fully, while allowing
sufficient attention to other matters. The scope and importance of those matters will not generally
diminish. Management of a mega-program will demand attention on a recurring, long-term, and
sometimes unpredictable basis. Even the best organization simply cannot perform normal duties
with an AMRP treated as an add-on. Problems that the AMRP experienced with respect to the back
end AMRP work (meter installations, for example) performed by internal Peoples Gas resources
exemplify this situation.
ii. AMRP Program Management
Successful performance of the AMRP depends on a strong emphasis on program management
commitment and oversight. Early Liberty work raised concerns about that commitment, as
evidenced by a number of indicators:
 The role of Peoples Gas or Integrys employees in the management of the program was
limited and indirect
 The lack of a strong owner presence with a corresponding level of leadership weakened
management, oversight, and control
 This approach to owner involvement resulted in a near total reliance on a contractor (Jacobs
Engineering) for staffing program management functions
 The lack of a long-term plan and efforts to build internal skills and capabilities existed
 There was limited owner program management presence in Chicago
 That management did not bring sufficient coordination and control of engineering and
construction resources in performing key AMRP work activities.
The Integrys Project Management Office had responsibility for managing the main and service
installation portions of AMRP work. A senior Integrys person headed that organization, but
operated from outside Chicago. Liberty learned that the plan had been to create a truly integrated
contractor/employee Project Management Office. Early interviews indicated a plan to add Integrys
personnel in leadership roles to the management organization largely staffed by an outside firm.
Liberty observed, however, only limited numbers of Integrys personnel. Moreover, they filled
roles more on the periphery of the organization than in leadership. The Project Management Office
chart provided literally superimposed the few Integrys members on the organization chart
populated by contractor personnel, placing internal employees along one of the chart’s edges.
As a result, the AMRP’s Project Management Office continues to rely on personnel from Jacobs
Engineering to provide project management of the main and service installation portion of the
AMRP. This is not to criticize the outside firm, but to observe insufficient owner management and
direction.
There was thus no Chicago-based, dedicated, owner-centric management group responsible for
main and service installations. Moreover, responsibility for critical, last-stage tie-in, meter setting,

and relighting work resided outside the Project Management Office. Each of the three,
geographically-divided “Shops” of Peoples Gas performed such work using employee crews.
Coordination of effort between the Integrys and Peoples Gas organizations was not strong. The
lack of dedicated, common management of all AMRP activities contributed to the lack of
coordination.
Liberty considers the following attributes, all of which were lacking in at least some form on the
AMRP, to be those best suited to optimizing the performance of such a major program:
 High level, full time, on-site program management
 Long-term organizational vision for the life of the project
 Owner expertise to lead or guide, and at least actively participate in, all core functions
 Permanent, as opposed to transient, identity of an elite project team
 An integrated organization
 Clear executive commitment and support, actively and continually exercised and
communicated
 Accountability for performance and the ability to enforce it at both the program manager
and functional levels
 Sound philosophy on high level usage of contractors
 Strong technical and analytical skills in management controls in the Project Management
Office
 Effective reports with strong analytical components that identify performance issues and
their causes, together with potential corrective measures
 Ability to forecast on a real-time basis final program cost
 A comprehensive long-term resource planning processes for engineering and construction
resources
 An up-to-date succession plan for key management and supervisory positions.
iii. Management of AMRP Projects
How Peoples Gas has managed the overall AMRP comprises a principal focus of this study. The
requisite project management skills address the planning, flow, execution, and management of
more than a thousand people. Personnel with senior-level skills need to direct and coordinate many
organizations, and many stakeholders, in order to keep the program moving with efficiency,
effectiveness, and transparency.
However, project management skills need to exist at another level as well; i.e., the individual
projects that collectively comprise the AMRP. Individual projects within the AMRP involve many
organizations, complex coordination challenges, many millions of dollars, and skill requirements.
Government coordination, contract management, safety, quality, cost, schedule, and labor
management provide some examples of these needed skills. The skills required have similarity to
those that program management requires, but have application at a different level. The program
management function executes through a wide array of managers, mostly at high levels. In
contrast, individual project managers interact with people much closer to the work. Both levels
require substantial experience and the ability to bring people together. They form prerequisites of
an effective program and project management organization.

An option for addressing project level challenges would assign a project manager to every project
or neighborhood to assure effective management and coordination of all work elements involved.
The AMRP did not operate under this approach. The Company assigned project managers only to
“high risk” projects. That included four projects: (1) Calumet Transmission, (2) High Pressure
Interconnect, (3) Public Improvement Projects, and (4) the Loop Project. The Company has stated
that it is in the process of staffing up to enable it to assign a manager to each AMRP project.
The key roles of project managers associated with the four high risk projects include:
 Complete all project planning activities, thoroughly and completely.
o Develop all components of the project plan as specified in the project management
methods
o Ensure joint ownership of the project plans by including participation of team leads,
subject matter experts, and key stakeholders in development of the plans
o Work closely with the project sponsor to ensure that clear deliverables, project
measures, and critical success factors are documented
o Facilitate development of time, cost, functionality and safety parameters for the project
o Work with the Project Leadership Team to ensure project funding and a project team
appropriately resourced with skilled personnel
o Recommend timing of formal milestone reviews and participate in getting the project
approved
o Ensure the plans are communicated, understood, approved by management and boughtinto by project team
 Set up project team and structure and ensure understanding of project team roles and
accountabilities.
o Negotiate with business and technical resource managers to gain commitment of skilled
resources to the project
o Ensure identification of key internal stakeholders, solicit their input, keep them up-todate in project communications, and use them as a proponent for changes in their
functional areas
o Recommend appropriate incentives, as necessary
o Ensure project team roles and accountabilities are clear and understood
o Assign project activities to team members based on skills, desires and growth
opportunities (identified by the resource manager)
 Execute the project against plan to assure functionality within cost, time, and safety
parameters.
o Work closely with the project team and with leadership to assure project progress as
planned, project cost control, and realization of project benefits
o Actively engage project team members, ensuring they understand weekly expectations
o Reinforce cross-functional team and business unit cooperation
o Maintain up-to-date project plans and cash flow projections
o Review (at least weekly) progress against the project plans (tasks, milestones,
deliverables, costs, resources, schedule)
o Track and resolve issues; elevate issues that cannot be resolved by the team to prevent
impacts to the project schedule
o Track and resolve changes, balancing the needs of stakeholders and impacts to
functionality, deliverables, cost, and schedule

o Track project risks, implementing mitigation strategies
o Coordinate project with other related projects (deliverables, timing, overlapping
resources)
o Ensure administrative task completion, including time recording and project
documentation
o Acquire final project sign-offs and acceptance
o Ensure smooth implementation, focusing on communication and change management
o Conduct review of performance and lessons learned; publish post-project report
Communicate key project information with project leadership team, project steering
committee, and project team.
o Ensure a common understanding of strategic, business, and project vision; share how
each team member contributes to project success
o Conduct regularly scheduled project team meetings (progress, issues, upcoming
activities, expectations for the week, scope changes)
o Conduct regularly scheduled project leadership meetings; participate in in project
steering committee meetings
o Ask questions of team members to understand true project status
o Publish complete and accurate status reports to team members, project leadership team,
project steering committee, and project champion
o Recommend to project leadership team timing and content of proactive project
communications
o Ensure active engagement of business unit leaders to assist with change management
and implementation
Effectively lead the project team through team development stages.
o Advocate for the project and project team
o Gain personal and team commitment to the project
o Seek ways to recognize and reward project team members
o Reinforce team collaboration
o Resolve interpersonal conflict and team dynamics issues
o Foster a solution-focused team attitude
o Host the project celebration to recognize and reward project team.

The above description illustrates the demands that a weak project management imposes and the
challenges of getting things done with limited authority.

3. Conclusions
E.1.

A strong first effort at instituting a plan for the management of the AMRP occurred
in 2011, but fell into disuse after failing to gain traction. (Recommendations E.1 and
E.2)

A strong start in defining how to manage the AMRP came in 2011. Unfortunately, sound program
ideas and some strong statements of objectives have not translated into a plan for management that
effectively guides the AMRP today. Committing to such elements of the Project Execution
Program’s effectiveness and building upon the principles it established would have placed the
program in a more desirable place than exists today. A number of possible inquiries may explain
why the plan did not become a foundation element of AMRP management:

Was the plan ahead of its time; i.e., put in place before the organization had the skills and
capability to implement it?
Was it too detailed, too complex?
Did it cover too much ground?
Was its content suitable for day-to-day reference?
Did management properly introduce it, set good expectations for its use, and communicate
a commitment to following it to the organization?
Did its external authorship (Jacobs Engineering) detract from internal acceptance?
Were its details prepared too soon; i.e., with insufficient time to build and develop the
processes needed?
Did management assign anyone the responsibility of maintaining and keeping it up to date?
Did the commitments and instructions not fully align with management’s intentions, thus
potentially invalidating the plan? (e.g., “Transformation of PGL from a reactive system
maintenance organization to a state-of-the-art modern, progressive and proactive gas
utility” does not appear to be a concept with which management agreed).

Answers to these questions would be speculative, but Liberty did find sufficient reason to conclude
that a lack of management backing has played a major role. Words on paper alone do not produce
results. A strong management commitment, regularly reinforced, must accompany them.
E.2

The early years of developing the AMRP management organization have not brought
sufficient skills, capabilities, and systems to provide the world-class management that
the AMRP warrants. (Recommendation E.3)

A program of the magnitude and duration of the AMRP deserves, and can afford, a sophisticated
organization. It should be staffed by a team having first-rate qualifications and experience. It
should operate with the use of leading edge tools and systems. The Project Management Office,
however, lacks a breadth of experience in some skill categories. Efforts to build the needed
organization appear to have had low priority across the program’s early years.
Resource planning for the AMRP management organization must determine the quality of
management the Company needs to employ across the program’s life. The program’s history
indicates that senior management did not begin program work with the correct perception of what
a program of this magnitude entails. On an absolute basis, the project’s dimensions include, for
example, 2,000 miles of pipe to replace, more than $5 billion in total expenditures in all probability
(and maybe significantly more), and a need for a compelling level of management, executive, and
board attention for two decades. It dwarfs by comparison any typical Peoples Gas program or
initiative. It seems clear that the Company did not understand, and certainly did not respond fully
to, the magnitude of the challenges involved in ramping up to very high levels of production and
sustaining them across twenty years.
Liberty has not examined and therefore does not draw any negative conclusions about the attention
that Peoples Gas has paid to building its internal capabilities through the years. They may have
been sound for business as usual. They should not, however, have produced confidence that
organizations built for traditional utility projects would sustain a burden vastly greater than that of
traditional work. Liberty’s work in the electric industry found a similar phenomenon with
companies undertaking nuclear plant construction in the 1980s. Peoples Gas cannot go back four

or five years to change how it viewed the challenges of the AMRP. The Company can, however,
change for the future. It is essential for Peoples Gas, Integrys, or whoever owns and operates the
Chicago gas utility in the future to accept the need for a fundamental revision to thinking about
meeting those challenges. The challenges will remain and they may grow bigger as the years pass.
Utilities (and Peoples Gas is no exception) tackling a super-project (which the AMRP certainly is)
need to enhance their management capabilities extensively. By definition, internal organizations,
designed and built for traditional work, cannot absorb a program far more challenging.
E.3

A series of staffing decisions (whether explicit or implicit) have constrained the ability
to manage the AMRP and to build a reliable, long-term, qualified management team
for the program’s still long future. (Recommendation E.3)

Peoples Gas’ staffing decisions made when moving into the AMRP and during its early years of
operation worked against developing a strong management approach and team. A number of
AMRP elements warrant substantial improvement in this regard:
 Lack of clear assessment and definition of the skills needed to manage the AMRP
 Lack of a plan to acquire and develop requisite skills
 Lack of a long-term organization philosophy and design
 Failure to recognize the need for very active owner participation in key management
positions
 Over-reliance on contractors
 Failure to assign full-time, Chicago-based project management
 Lack of common, single leadership of the planning and execution of program activities that
were distributed among the Integrys-led Project Management Office and the Peoples Gas
North, Central, and South Shops
 Failure to develop or acquire strong internal program controls skills
 Failure to soundly integrate AMRP with non-AMRP planning, resourcing, and scheduling
as they concern field work and supporting services performed by Peoples Gas
 A resulting inability to marshal adequate resources to meet AMRP priorities
 Lack of succession planning for key managers.
E.4

Peoples Gas lacks a credible plan for the acquisition and development of resources to
manage and execute the AMRP. (Recommendation E.3)

Liberty found that program management lacked sound knowledge of the required program skills,
numbers of people, and overall capabilities to form a sound program management resource plan.
The Company cannot develop such a plan without first identifying needs through a structured
review and analysis. The planning process therefore must get underway as soon as possible, with
definition of needs being the first step. That process requires a long-term focus to complement
short term efforts to fill the most critical positions. The AMRP’s length gives it more the nature of
permanent organization, which can attract dedicated, high-quality personnel. Identifying and
filling personnel needs in a revised AMRP management organization lies among the initiatives
that management states are now underway, following discussions that began with Liberty last
September.

E.5

Chapter E: The Plan for Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The use of a matrix-type approach to AMRP program management did not prove
optimum. (Recommendation E.4)

A program of the size and duration of the AMRP can justify a dedicated set of resources. A matrixtype organization also requires a high level of teamwork and cooperation among participating
organizations and a project management team skilled at facilitating and maintaining those
attributes. For the AMRP, factors such as these favor a dedicated organization, and a strong project
manager approach.
E.6

The current approach and organization for program management produces too little
authority and engagement by internal management resources. (Recommendation E.5)

The AMRP applies substantial resources to project management and Jacobs Engineering has
supplied many quality people at Peoples Gas’ request. The overall organization and approach
selected, however, have not been fully effective. The organization consists largely of Jacobs
Engineering personnel, with limited leadership from Peoples Gas. The Integrys full-time program
manager directing the work that Jacobs Engineering personnel largely perform was not located
full-time in Chicago. This arrangement detracted from the ability to continuously follow and
interact with project resources and engage on issues. Other Integrys members of the program
management resided on the organization’s periphery, not in key leadership roles.
Concern arises from the fact that Peoples Gas has managed the AMRP as a “project”; i.e., treating
the program as temporary and its people as engaged in transient assignments. A quality, dedicated
workforce will become far easier to build, should Peoples Gas treat the program as it should; i.e.,
as a massive, long term initiative.
E.7

Peoples Gas should not limit the use of project managers for AMRP projects to only
high risk cases. (Recommendation E.6)

The nature of the AMRP projects makes them complex, expensive, a challenge to coordinate, and
difficult to manage. The lack of a single, project management focal point for every substantive
project has not served the program well.

4. Recommendations
E.1

Peoples Gas should complete a full replacement of the plan for management (the
Project Execution Plan) addressing all key elements of AMRP management and
control. (Conclusion E.1)

A strong basis for the new document exists in the original Project Execution Plan. Liberty believes,
however, that adding a more summary-level document to the replacement of the Plan would best
serve to gain support and traction. In addition, Liberty recommends that the plan discuss a number
of specific processes at a summary level:
 A cost estimating process that establishes a valid cost monitoring base and forecasts with
confidence final program costs
 Scheduling that develops realistic schedules at all levels with appropriate details to support
engineering, procurement, work planning, construction, and contractor activities

Resource planning that employs staffing strategies, crew allocation, contractor
management, training requirements, and productivity measurements
A work management process that supports the facilitation of work from design to
construction to completion
A cost management program that promotes a culture of program cost control
Cost reporting designed to precipitate corrective and improvement actions
Scope control that identifies potential scope growth to minimize cost and schedule impacts
Procurement strategies that take advantage of large purchases to obtain favorable pricing
and supportive deliveries
Contracting management that takes advantage of the magnitude and long-term nature of a
mega-program to develop beneficial and creative relationships with contractors.
Current developmental plans for a new Project Execution Plan should specifically
address prior failures and how they will be avoided in the new plan. (Conclusion E.1)

In considering potential reasons for failure of the early plan, Liberty concluded that a lack of
sufficient management commitment contributed significantly. The lack of credibility that seems
inherent in the failure of the early plan naturally raises questions about management’s current
commitment to the new initiatives as well. Answering the question of “What is different this time?”
thus becomes important in sustaining credibility in the change initiatives underway.
E.3

Peoples Gas should prepare a long-term AMRP management resource plan that
specifically addresses: (a) requisite skills needed both on an immediate and on a
longer term basis, (b) current gaps in internal capabilities, (c) the optimum balance
of owner versus contractor personnel, (d) acquisition and development of resources,
and (e) succession plans. (Conclusions E.2, E.3, and E.4)

This work should adhere to the guiding principle that the AMRP requires and can afford a top tier
organization and staff. Liberty does not recommend a “money is no object” approach. Rather, so
much money is involved, and the risks and opportunities for savings are so great, that acquiring
the best people comprises the best approach for managing risks and pursuing opportunities and
thus the most cost-effective option.
In defining skill requirements Peoples Gas should apply high standards. The Company should
identify where gaps exist in those skills in the current organization. A simple, but highly effective
approach would:
 Identify the standards and levels of capability appropriate for the AMRP
 Identify those areas worthy of analysis; i.e., where a mismatch might exist
 Identify gaps between standards and current capabilities
 Prepare an implementation plan for improvement / upgrade of capabilities
In performing this review, the Company should not just look at specific skills, but instead view
existing resources holistically by seeking answers to questions like:
 Do we have people with these skills?
 Are there enough of them?
 Are they in the right positions?

Do they have the organizational standing to get their job done?
Do they have the appropriate systems and processes at their disposal?
Where they have weaknesses, do available and communicated developmental opportunities
address them fully?

These questions presume that the existing workforce will continue to have a big role, despite the
changes required. The goal is not to replace incumbents. The goal is to develop further the
capabilities of existing resources, align them properly, and supplement them with new people
where needed. The long-term nature of the AMRP particularly opens incumbent development
avenues to a greater extent than programs of shorter duration typically would.
Planning also must recognize the impracticability of staffing certain, highly specialized positions
internally, and of staffing less specialized ones internally in the full numbers required. Peoples Gas
therefore will continue to face the challenge of optimizing the employee/contractor mix, but should
act pursuant to the goal of using the program’s length to secure in-house resources in areas where
the Company has traditionally relied strongly on contractors.
E.4

Peoples Gas should move toward a project organization that makes significantly more
use of dedicated resources under a strong project manager approach. (Conclusion
E.5)

The nature of the AMRP and the internal relationships among Integrys and Peoples Gas argue
against a matrix-type organization and a move toward a “strong” project manager approach.
AMRP experience to date further compels a re-thinking of the organization approach. AMRP size,
cost, and duration indicate that dedicated resources are appropriate for many functions. There is
no reason the AMRP should have to compete for resources or go begging. Having qualified people
on hand and focused on this singular priority for the next 15 years presents a superior option from
performance, quality, cost, and effectiveness of management perspectives.
The AMRP internal issues also argue for a strong approach to project management and greater use
of dedicated resources.
E.5

Peoples Gas should prepare a specification for a new program management function,
correcting the weaknesses in the current process. (Conclusion E.6)

In designing a new program management organization and process, the following attributes should
form a part of the specification:
• High level, full time, on-site program management: The large number of AMRP resources
in Chicago demands that the program manager and the bulk of the Project Management
Office be located there full time.
• Unquestioned executive support, whether a strong or weak approach applies: Whatever
approach is adopted requires the unquestioned support of executive management.
• Owner expertise: To lead, at least guide, or at least actively participate in, all core functions.
The level of owner participation can remain flexible, but what stands as critical is
reinforcing the perception that the owner leads the effort, and has skills as strong as anyone
else on the project. A mere figure-head or peripheral role will not work effectively.
• Permanent, as opposed to transient, identity: A project usually has a transient identity,
reflecting its comparatively short life and the temporary nature of most positions. That

transient identity places limits on the kind of people willing to work on the project and the
kind and number of people that management will hire. However, at a duration of twenty
years, the AMRP can hardly be viewed as “temporary.” Acting in accord with a belief that
it is, produces a naturally weaker approach to staffing.
An integrated organization or not – no halfway: Peoples Gas has taken a split approach to
its role in the program management. Liberty recommends active participation and a strong
leadership role for the owner. An integrated organization can accomplish this result.
However, doing it halfway, with limited positions, limited owner skills, or limited owner
authority, can prove worse than using an organization and a management role completely
provided by a contractor. At least in that case, accountability remains clear.
Accountability for performance: Accountability and the ability to enforce it at both the
program management and functional levels is important. Accountability for performance
will not alone prove sufficient for strong performance but it certainly is necessary.
Strong technical and analytical skills in management controls in the Project Management
Office: Strong technical and analytical skills on the part of controls personnel often
comprise the greatest asset an executive oversight and program manager can have.

Peoples Gas should test its AMRP organization development plans and activities by providing
candid and full answers to questions like:
 To what extent must AMRP compete or beg for resources?
 To what extent does the AMRP have to rely on part-time or non-dedicated resources?
 Are lines of accountability and authority clear?
 Is the owner clearly in charge?
 Is the owner fully involved?
E.6

Peoples Gas should assign a project manager to most, if not all, AMRP neighborhood
projects. (Conclusion E.7)

Even at the individual level, these non-high-risk projects still tend to have very large scope and
size. Liberty’s experience produces the expectation that each would have its own project manager.
Compared to typical electric or gas utility projects, they are more complex, expensive, customersensitive, and carry local regulatory challenges.

Chapter F: Risk Assessment and Replacement Prioritization
1. Background
This chapter addresses Liberty’s review of the related topics of Risk Assessment and Replacement
Prioritization. Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System focuses on overall design of the
AMRP, including its use of a neighborhood approach. The specific areas that Liberty’s review
addressed in this chapter include:
1. Systems, tools, and resources for generating and integrating data required for risk
assessment
2. The quality of resulting data
3. How Peoples Gas addresses gaps in that data
4. Accuracy, vintage, and use of key data types (e.g., leaks and soils)
5. Risk models, methods, and factor weighting
6. External factors (e.g., repaving programs, other Company programs, such as meter
replacements, meter movement outside) and inspections
7. Methods for identifying and prioritizing infrastructure replacement candidates
8. Consideration of alternatives to replacement
9. Quality of replacement decisions
10. Effectiveness of replacements in reducing leak rates
11. Model updating and consistency with industry practice
12. Short-term optimization of risk reduction versus cost
13. Evaluating upcoming projects to test application of risk assessment and prioritization goals,
approaches and methods
14. Judgmental factors affecting/overriding risk model output.
a. Replacement Prioritization
The work required to address aging gas infrastructure subject to failure requires a sophisticated
approach to the assessment of safety risk. It also requires a structured and comprehensive set of
methods for prioritizing repair and replacement efforts. The risk that each component in question
presents for public and employee safety must drive prioritization. Chapter C: The Peoples Gas
Distribution System addresses the basis for planning AMRP work in a manner (the
“neighborhood” or “zonal” approach) that supports efficient replacement of high-risk pipe in
conjunction with other operating improvements. Chapter C also addresses the Main Ranking
Index, which Peoples Gas uses to address immediately that highest-risk pipe which may not be
addressed immediately under the neighborhood approach. This chapter focuses on how
determinations of risk occur and what role those determinations play in work prioritization.
The measurement assigned to particular risks should correlate: (a) the likelihood that failure events
will occur, and (b) the likely consequences should such failures occur. Regarding the latter
consideration, gas transmission mains fall into four classifications, driven by the nature of the areas
(generally reflecting the number of people at risk) that might be affected by their failure:
 Class 1: Forest and farm areas, where failures have comparatively much lower likelihood
of significant safety consequence
 Class 2: Relatively lower densities of homes
 Class 3: Higher home densities or places of public assembly

Class 4: Significant numbers of buildings four stories or higher.

Location largely drives potential consequence. A main down even a large city street surrounded
by parkland presents different consequences from one running past high-use structures. Likely
consequences increase even further if those structures pose barriers to swift evacuation (e.g., an
elementary school or a hospital). Equipment configurations also drive consequence. For example,
the existence of operable excess flow valves can significantly affect the consequences of pipe
failures. They can limit the amount of gas that can escape via a major failure (such as break in the
service pipe). It is generally difficult to control the locational determinants of risk, apart from
relocation options that may exist from time to time.
The likelihood of failure comprises the other main factor in the calculation of risk determination.
The likelihood of failure generally lends itself to greater control. For example, the clearly marked
and maintained rights-of-way that often typify transmission corridors reduce the likelihood of hits
during third-party excavations. Third-party education and communication programs, facility
surveys, proper mark outs, and posting inspectors at work sites also can mitigate this component
of risk. More pertinent to the review here, different pipe materials, ages, diameters, and other
conditions combine to produce different likelihoods, even within a particular type (e.g., cast or
ductile iron) of material. Moreover, the degree of mitigation resulting from various activities (e.g.,
leak monitoring, repair, and replacement) differs as well.
Companies like Peoples Gas therefore need to conduct periodic risk assessments that measure and
combine likelihood and consequence to identify highest-risk facilities and the effects that various
forms of mitigation can have on measured risk. Those assessments need to drive prioritization of
mitigation efforts and produce the investment (in capital or O&M programs and initiatives)
necessary to keep risk at acceptable levels.
Liberty’s focus in examining prioritization (and the risk measurement that must underlie it to make
it effective) concentrated particularly on overlaying Main Ranking Index-driven replacements on
top of the neighborhoods approach addressed in Chapter C. Liberty examined the resulting
performance in addressing pipe exhibiting the highest levels of risk. This chapter also addresses
details underlying the risk assessment and prioritization processes used to plan work under the
neighborhood approach.
b. O&M Savings
The neighborhood approaches’ combination of main replacements with other work (increasing
pressures from low to medium levels and the relocation of meters from inside to outside customer
structures) will produce future operations and customer benefits. Peoples Gas addressed changes
in operations and maintenance costs that it estimated would flow from AMRP work. It did so last
in 2009 testimony before the Illinois Commerce Commission. Liberty did not seek to validate or
critique that testimony or its supporting modeling and analysis. It was outside of the scope of this
engagement.
Liberty did examine the ability on a present and going-forward basis to consider changes in O&M
costs as a function of investment in pipe replacement. The examination also included a review of
the ability to perform analyses of changes in O&M costs resulting from work undertaken in the

context of the neighborhood approach. This approach combines pipe replacement with other work.
This broader examination becomes material, as promoting work efficiency through the
neighborhood construct has the potential for affecting the pace at which Peoples Gas eliminates
high-risk pipe from its system. Knowing the full “value” (which includes offsets to operations and
maintenance costs) achieved through completion of neighborhood work (both pipe replacement
and other) might, under certain circumstances, influence the pace of pipe replacement.
Another portion of this chapter also addresses questions of potential balance (particularly over
time) between replacements driven by the Main Ranking Index and by the neighborhood construct.
Optimizing that balance takes full knowledge and robust consideration of all the advantages
produced by alternate approaches, including their operations and maintenance cost effects.

2. Findings
a. The Main Ranking Index
Peoples Gas has employed its Main Ranking Index to prioritize replacements for many years. The
Index employs a variety of data to generate replacement rankings. At AMRP inception in 2011,
the Index operated as the only prioritization driver of AMRP work. Since the beginning of 2013,
it has operated in parallel with the zonal, “neighborhood” approach to planning and scheduling
replacement work under the AMRP.
Peoples Gas uses the Main Ranking Index to give each distribution and transmission system
segment a numbered risk ranking. Higher numbers reflect higher risk. Annual application means
that a segment’s rankings can, and some do, change each year.
Rank calculations use an equivalent likelihood of a main break. Breaks create the principal safety
risk of low-pressure, cast iron mains. Ductile iron mains suffer from a similar failure event. The
likelihood of main breaks increases as main diameters decrease; i.e., smaller-diameter pipe is more
likely to break. Soil type and construction in proximity to pipe can also affect the likelihood of
breaks. The Main Ranking Index accounts for a range of break-risk factors, including numbers of
breaks, cracks at taps, visual observations of cracks, pipe coupon equivalent breaks, and main
repairs adjusted to breaks. Peoples Gas has gathered data about its gas system for use in the Main
Replacement Index since the Company began using it about 20 years ago.
Each break-risk factor has an equivalence rating, used to determine the likelihood it will break.
The relevant factors undergo correction for environmental conditions. The amount of paving and
location in a business district with building-to-building paving are among these corrections.
Peoples Gas standardizes index results to city-block lengths of 660 feet. This standardization
accounts for the fact that discretely-captured pipe segments can range from a foot to a mile in
length.
The Company replaces segments ranked six or higher within a year, irrespective of whether such
replacement would coincide with the schedules developed under the AMRP’s neighborhood
construct. Peoples Gas also replaces some segments ranked at level five within a year. They
include the segments in proximity to buildings of public assembly (“BPAs”) whose conditions or
occupants limit quick evacuation (e.g., schools, churches, day- and elder-care facilities, prisons).

Peoples Gas does attempt where practicable to schedule “neighborhood” work (upgrades to
medium pressure and relocating indoor meters to outside locations) to coincide with the segments
requiring replacement within a year. The presence of medium-pressure mains in the neighborhood
involved serves as a major determinant of the ability to do so. In any event, where combining
priority replacements with other work is not practicable, Peoples Gas makes the replacements with
substitute materials “like-for-like,” based on physical size and pressure.
Use of the Main Ranking Index model requires up-to-date information about preceding-year
retirements and main replacements. Peoples Gas adds this new data in re-computing segment Main
Ranking Index scorings every year. The Company also runs the calculations that prioritize work
on a neighborhood basis each year. After starting work in a neighborhood, however, it continues
until completion regardless of whether the succeeding year’s calculations change its relative
ranking. A significant movement of other neighborhoods up in the list, could, however, cause
adjustment of the schedule for a neighborhood requiring multi-year phasing.
The numbers of main segments replaced because they ranked six (or five in specified cases) has
remained stable. About 10 segments come onto the list each year, as ten ranked from last year get
removed by virtue of being replaced. The Main Ranking Index underwent an Illinois Commerce
Commission-mandated review by an independent consultant in the mid-2000s. This review found
Index-driven replacements appropriate, given declining rates of cast iron main breaks.
b. The “Neighborhood” Approach to Prioritization
The second, neighborhood (or zonal) method of replacement-work prioritization came into
existence in 2012 for work performed during the 2013 construction season. Its introduction sought
to increase the efficiency of capital work by combining high-risk pipe replacement with: (a)
upgrades to medium pressure, and (b) relocating customer meters from inside buildings to outside.
By 2014, the neighborhood approach had come to drive most of the main and service replacements.
Main Ranking Index level six and partial level five replacements still operate as an override to
work scheduled under the neighborhood approach.
Peoples Gas uses a 228-neighborhood Chicago division to prioritize and plan work. The
neighborhood construct also uses risk ranking to prioritize neighborhoods. The large size of many
of the more than 200 neighborhoods has led Peoples Gas to break work in them into phases. It
takes more than one construction season to complete work in these neighborhoods. A ranking
structure for the phases considers a number of attributes that can cause failures. The driving factors
that Peoples Gas considers material include:
 A belief, based on past experience, that mains installed prior to 1920 (the oldest system
components) have the highest likelihood of failure
 Services installed or renewed prior to the advent of mandated cathodic protection also have
high failure risk
 Areas that have already experienced high failures are prone to do so in the future
 High- or medium-pressure cast iron or ductile iron feeder mains have a higher consequence
of failure

ICC14GAS0002

Small-diameter cast iron mains fail at a higher rate than do large-diameter mains. (Other
operators share this observation.) Their thinner walls provide less protection from cracking
when undermined or graphitized.

Peoples Gas therefore applies to each neighborhood a ranking determined by a set of specific
factors. Each neighborhood’s ranking predominantly drives its priority ranking under the
neighborhood construct. Unlike the segment-specific Main Ranking Index approach, an entire
neighborhood gets a single rating. This rating reflects the collective condition of its infrastructure.
Subject to the Main Ranking Index overlay, this neighborhood ranking also predominantly drives
its priority for main and service replacement.
External factors can provide a source of moderate adjustments to the scheduling of work in the
highest-ranked neighborhoods. The same applies to some extent to Main Ranking Index-driven
work as well. Peoples Gas takes into account city, state, and other utility infrastructure
improvement plans when scheduling its infrastructure work. Street repaving schedules also have
an impact. Peoples Gas cannot obtain permits to work in a newly-paved street unless it will repave
the entire street. Short-term rearrangements among the highest-priority neighborhoods or
replacements occur as required to account for such external factors.
c. Data Gathering Systems, Tools, and Resources
i. Leak Tracking
Peoples Gas has employed a leak-tracking system since the mid-1970s. The Company also
employs long-standing systems to manage property records that address main and service
locations, replacements, construction materials, size, and other parameters. Peoples Gas integrated
data from these systems into the Main Ranking Index in the 1990s. Additional refinements to
include mapping leaks on geographic-information-system-type models, which makes tracking and
inquiries less labor-intensive. The knowledge of leak experts in each of the three Shops into which
Peoples Gas divides its field operations supplements property records and leak histories.
ii. Capturing Leak Data
Companies must provide leak data to the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and
Hazardous Materials Administration (“PHMSA”). Peoples Gas has been using computer and
automated programs to capture leak data for many years. These programs assign a leak
identification number, and then schedule follow up measurements based on Company procedures
and regulatory requirements. Leak tickets track repair activities. Work orders track costs and
associated work. Minor gaps due to issues such as the time between leak discovery and repair
always exist. Prior audits, however, demonstrate that Peoples Gas tracks leaks with sufficient
accuracy. Grade/Type 1 leaks require immediate repair, for example, while Grade/Type 2 leaks
may be held for future repair, and Grade 3 leaks must be surveyed with no requirement for repair.
The next two graphs show the number of leaks discovered and repaired in recent years.

Figure F.2: Main Leaks Repairs by Grade

Liberty examined several different leak data tracking sources. This review disclosed significant
differences in the number of Type (or grade) 1, 2 and 3 leak totals. Liberty could not reconcile
differences in various reports about leaks. Re-grading of leaks often produces mismatches, but
these differences could not be explained away completely by concluding that Peoples Gas changed
some leaks to a lesser grade or type. The differences appear too substantial to be explained by regrading leaks to non-hazardous classifications.
iii. Planned Infrastructure Work by Others
Peoples Gas compares Main Ranking Index and neighborhood modeling outputs against planned
work by other government and utility entities. This comparison permits adjustment of program
work schedules as needed. City of Chicago requirements have caused Peoples Gas to choose to
place new mains on both sides of the street. This requirement generally necessitates the use of the
“parkway” or sidewalk corridors. Thus, city-street construction per se does not present an
overriding factor. However, intersections, where gas mains may require relocation because of
conflicts with new water or sewer lines, become a more important factor.

Chapter F: Risk Assessment

iv. Soils Data
Soils can play an important role in determining comparative rates of cast iron pipe degradation.
Soils should factor into risk modeling. We found no indication that Peoples Gas information
directly or judgmentally considers soil condition as part of the Main Ranking Index or
neighborhood rankings.
The lack of soils data has more consequence for the Main Ranking Index than for neighborhood
rankings. Liberty considers soil type a break-risk factor. One can expect the Company’s highly
localized, individual pipe segments that comprise fundamental units of the Main Ranking Index to
lie in relatively uniform soil types. The presence of unstable soils could and should be considered
a risk factor for each segment is evaluated under the Main Ranking Index. The wide areas
encompassed by neighborhoods likely produce less homogeneous soil conditions. This factor
makes soil condition a less pertinent factor in ranking them.
v. Addressing Erroneous and Missing Data
Peoples Gas sometimes lacks material data, such as the exact location of a service line to its
customer or the facilities of another utility. It requires contractors in such cases to locate
underground facilities by digging test holes. This practice sometimes proves inefficient. Peoples
Gas has found it more effective, however, than placing special crews on standby to perform custom
locating, or using high-tech locating devices.
For directional drilling, Peoples Gas requires contractors to locate sewer mains and laterals via
video-camera examination. Following drilling, but before new main activation, another video
examination must take place. This video verification supplements test holes and other locating
efforts (e.g., marking services and mains on the surface).
Contractors have found main and service location errors on some Peoples Gas maps that show
locations by using property lines. Peoples Gas has adopted a program to address such errors. It
consists of locating all new and newly-retired mains and services on updated maps. Liberty’s
inquiries did not disclose the existence of a structured, controlled method for ensuring timely
correction.
Liberty examined the Company’s use of assumptions to account for missing data. Particularly for
older, large urban systems, missing data presents an unavoidable problem. Liberty did not find
broad needs to make assumptions to account for missing data. The use of neighborhood-wide
rankings tends to marginalize the impact of data errors on individual segments. The primary need
that Liberty observed occurs in determining the ages of particular segments, and particularly for
use in ranking under the Main Ranking Index. Peoples Gas makes an appropriately conservative
assumption of pre-1920 installation when it cannot verify an actual date.
Errors with respect to leak and break locations could have a material impact on Main Ranking
Index rankings. Liberty knows no practical way to address old, untraceable data, however. The
existence of multiple leaks would diminish concern about a missing record of a single leak, or
about recording visible cracks during an inspection. With respect to missing environmental factor
data, Google Maps offers a means for checking. Except for failing to consider soils data in the

Main Ranking Index, Liberty found no substantial concern about the ability to use existing data
and to apply reasonable assumptions to feed models driving replacement prioritization.
Peoples Gas rounds Main Ranking Index scores to the nearest 1/4 point. This feature has
significance in connection with the “must repair” status of all segments that achieve a ranking of
at least six and a defined portion of those that achieve a ranking of 5. Rounding up, for example,
to make a score of 4.88 become 5.0 and a score of 5.88 become 6.0 would include a level of
conservatism into the rankings.
vi. Locating Services
The Company uses property line measurements to locate new services. It plots them in the
geographic information system. The principal difficulty in using this approach arises when
property line data associated with old services proves inaccurate. One of the three Peoples Gas
Shops addresses this issue by requiring meter markers (when they locate the installation point for
new meters) to locate on a drawing and sometimes on the property where the old service penetrates
the foundation. This practice should increase success in finding the location of the old services.
The lack of accurate locations for some existing service lines has caused some contractors to make
large excavations in the parkway and sidewalks. That response increases the costs of main and
service installations and restoration over the long term. The marking practice of the one Shop
should be communicated to the other two as a best practice.
d. Risk Ranking Model Operation
i. The Main Ranking Index
The Main Ranking Index’s algorithm uses a number of factors to calculate an Index score (“MRI”).
Several factors determine an equivalent crack number, which then undergoes adjustment to a
standard segment size equivalent to one typical city block (660 feet or so). The depiction below
sets forth the equation used to calculate an MRI, which then gets rounded to the nearest 0.25 to
determine the Main Ranking Index.

Figure F.3: Main Ranking Index Algorithm
MRI = B + C + VPE+ KU + RE
Where:
B = Break equivalent based on breaks.
C = Break equivalent based on cracks at taps.
VPE = Break equivalent based on visual observations of the main.
KU = Break equivalent based on pipe coupon analysis on the segment.
RE = Break equivalent based on repairs done on the main
Each of the above components is then broken down with various attributes.

B = K1 * B1 * MR20
(Analysis includes number of breaks, operating pressure, street classification (business versus
residential), and pavement coverage multiplied by a Break Equivalent Factor).

C – Break Equivalent Based on Cracks at Taps:
(Analysis includes number of cracks at taps, operating pressure, street classification (business
versus residential), and pavement coverage multiplied by a Break Equivalent Factor.)

VPE – Break Equivalent Based on Visual Observations of the Main:
(Analysis is based on a visual inspection ((Poors versus Goods) (or coupon analysis if available))
and also takes into account material, operating pressure, main size, street classification (business
versus residential), pavement coverage multiplied by a Break Equivalent Factor.)

KU – Break Equivalent Based on Pipe Segment Coupon Analysis:
(Analysis includes physical evaluation of material condition, operating pressure, street
classification (business versus residential), and pavement coverage multiplied by a Break
Equivalent Factor.)

RE – Break Equivalent Based on Repairs Performed on the Main Segment:
(Analysis is based on a visual inspection (Poors versus Goods) and also takes into account material,
operating pressure, main size, street classification (business versus residential), pavement coverage
and (or coupon analysis if available) multiplied by a Break Equivalent Factor.)

Other factors applied address operating pressure, whether a coupon has been taken, and whether
inspections have been performed. Numerical values for all factors get added together. The next
figure shows a recent (August 2014) run of the Main Ranking Index model. The figure presents
all of segments having a ranking of 6 or more. This run produced some interesting features (note
the shading):
 It tends to confirm the small-diameter cast iron factor (11 of 12 entries)
 It tends to diminish the significance of pre-1920 construction (6 of 12 entries).

At present, the Main Ranking Index cannot and does not operate on a probabilistic basis.
Probabilistic models use long-term histories of all main-failure events, and total understanding of
the environment of mains and services, in order to develop probabilities of particular failures.
Probabilistic models may prove more efficient in programming high-risk main replacements, but
the amount of data they require entails significant time and cost. Moreover, some of the data may
not be available. Thus, such models, to Liberty’s knowledge, have not yet been used for mainreplacement risk assessment and prioritization.
ii. Neighborhood Modeling
The next table shows the criteria weightings for rankings under the construct used to prioritize
combined high-risk pipe replacement, medium pressure upgrading, and meter moving work in the
designated 228 neighborhoods.

The Company also tracks “at risk” services (unprotected steel, clear plastic, copper) to determine
how many to replace. Peoples Gas seeks to reduce the number of problematic low pressure
regulators by eliminating them when a neighborhood transitions to medium pressure.
Work planning divides each neighborhood into a number of more manageable phases where
required by dimensions and work requirements. The construction order of these phases considers:
 Availability of medium pressure
 Whether other contemporaneous infrastructure work necessitates moving the gas main
 Whether there is a planned repaving project.
The ability to combine AMRP work with other planned construction may accelerate work
compared with what its risk ranking would otherwise indicate. Planning also seeks a degree of
work levelization among the three Shops. Levelization seeks representative levels of work progress
across the City, and avoidance of work overloads in a particular Shop. Preliminary work plans
under the neighborhood approach to planning use five-year windows. Adjustments, mindful of
minimizing out-of-priority-order work, then occur based on cross-checks against third-party plans.
The numbers of leak-prone services do not affect a neighborhood’s ranking. Peoples Gas does,
however, track and replace such services as part of the work under the neighborhood’s plan and
schedule. The transition to medium pressure and the relocation of meters outside as part of
neighborhood work supports efficient replacement of leak-prone services (bare or unprotected
steel, clear plastic, and copper).
The following table shows the results for the initial five-year replacement plan.

*Based on 100% design
e. O&M Savings
Peoples Gas has confirmed that it does not have current data or analysis addressing how operations
and maintenance costs have recently changed or would change as a function of investment in pipe
replacement. The Company confirmed that it incorporated the most recent such data and analysis
in its 2009 testimony before the Illinois Commerce Commission.
That testimony came in support of a then-proposed acceleration of the replacement of leak-prone
pipe. The analysis presented at that time addressed two scenarios (Scenarios 2 and 3). Scenario 3
reflected a 20-year AMRP; Scenario 2 reflected a “business as usual” pace that would complete
the replacement of leak-prone pipe much later. Any flaws that analysis may have had have been
rendered moot by changing conditions. Peoples Gas has agreed to the development of a cost model
for analyzing the costs associated with the AMRP program. The Company intends that this model
include the capacity to address not only investment costs, but also those associated with operations
and maintenance.

3. Conclusions
F.1

Peoples Gas has substantially changed the nature of pipe replacement activities over
what is now a long period of addressing the need.

Over the last 20 years Peoples Gas has used several methods to determine how to replace mains in
the most cost effective manner. Early methods relied solely on highest Main Ranking Index scores,
in an effort to address the highest risk mains each year. The Index yielded a comparatively small
amount of mains to be replaced in 2004, as the next chart demonstrates.

Starting in 2004 additional considerations led to the replacement of about 44 miles, excluding
system expansions. It foreshadowed the neighborhood method insofar as it targeted areas for
replacement while attempting also to upgrade pressure. In 2010, an expanded Capital Optimization
Program, or COP, began. This program added consideration of nearby public improvements and
risk-prone services, and calculated the resulting savings from existing and future leaks and work.
It considered small-diameter, old cast iron installed prior to 1920.
Peoples Gas decided to implement the parallel operation of the neighborhood and Main Ranking
Index rankings and drivers of replacement projects in 2012/13. Enlargement of the neighborhood
model and breaking neighborhoods into phases sought to obtain economies of scale and promote
more effective work planning. Those changes have improved the efficiency of performing
replacements, and have well served conversion to medium pressure.
F.2

The neighborhood approach offers a sound construct for efficiently replacing highrisk pipe, while contemporaneously increasing the delivery pressure and moving
meters outside.

The neighborhood construct permits main installation and conversion to medium pressure without
having lengthy interruptions in service. It allows build-out of medium-pressure infrastructure,
while low-pressure mains remain in service until the Company can switch all customers served
from a main to medium pressure. This approach may defer retirement of some old, low-pressure
system components, but it ensures that all customers have gas service almost continuously. Shortduration outages may occur while Peoples Gas ties in a new outside meter, but these outages should
be minimal in duration.
Before moving to the neighborhood construct, Peoples Gas would find itself, when undertaking
replacement of high-risk pipe, possibly extending medium-pressure feeds deep into areas without
the ability to tie customers into them. Deferring the work necessary to make those connections not
only forced customers to wait for medium-pressure service, it also substantially increased costs by
requiring eventual tie-ins to occur under an entirely separate installation process.

Past reliance solely on the Main Ranking Index to drive replacements also tended to produce
widely scattered and more isolated work. That also increased costs, when compared with a
program encouraging work that the Company could more economically perform through
commonly marshalling resources and equipment to work more pipe in the concentrated area
achievable under the neighborhood approach.
F.3

There is no clear indication that data inadequacies threaten proper prioritization, but
Peoples Gas lacks a data quality control function that exposes its risk modeling to
potential sources of error. (Recommendation F.1)

Peoples Gas does not appear to have a data quality control program in place to evaluate current or
past data. Such a program makes sense under normal circumstances, and has greater importance
given the importance and magnitude of the work that will engage Peoples Gas for many years to
come. The three Shops were addressing data issues, but did not seem to share best practices.
Reports showing differing leak totals provide one example of data inconsistency that Liberty’s
examination uncovered. Liberty could not reconcile leak totals to determine a single, reliable
number of leaks and leak rates of Grade/Type 1 and 2. This difficulty raises the question of how
Peoples Gas determines them. The large differences appear to negate the otherwise likely
conclusion that differences result from timing or leak re-grading issues. The material variances in
data provided to Liberty addressing similar measures do not have clear and logical explanations.
Liberty found no clear indications that quality and completeness of data used for risk modeling
and replacement prioritization are fundamentally unsound. A structured assessment of gaps and
potential consequences is nevertheless warranted to assure that risk models continue to operate
effectively. However, Peoples Gas does not operate a structured program for validating data after
its entry into the systems that feed the prioritizing models.
Each of the relative risk models uses historic records and property records to determine the most
at risk segments or neighborhoods, based on the each model’s requirements. Many, particularly
older, records are likely to be missing, as is the case generally for utilities serving large cities with
extremely old infrastructure. The breadth of the ranking models and the wealth of data available
to populate them moderates the risks of inaccuracy. Peoples Gas has been populating data for use
in replacement prioritization for decades.
Another factor that mitigates concern about data completeness and accuracy is the rounding feature
of the Main Ranking Index. This feature serves to heighten the priority (six and above and some
five ranked segments) of the facilities requiring immediate replacement whatever their ranking
might be under the neighborhood construct.
F.4

Not including soils data in risk modeling fails to address a factor material to failure
risk. (Recommendation F.2)

Peoples Gas does not appear to be using soils data in either risk model. Such data should be
considered in differentiating the risk of corrosion and breaks, even within particular classes of
high-risk pipe. Soils data is important for locating potential areas of high corrosion, and thus wall
thinning of mains. Currently neither risk model used by Peoples Gas appears to use soils data in
developing risk rankings. This data may not be as useful in the neighborhood model, which

identifies replacements on a large-area basis. The data has more applicability for “hot spots,” where
corrosion proceeds at accelerated levels.
F.5

Despite the improvements that replacement has brought, the failure to achieve a
decrease in leaks raises questions about effectiveness in identifying the highest-risk
pipe and slating it for replacement. (Recommendations F.3 and F.4)

The failure of leaks to trend significantly downward for a number of years calls into question the
process used to select highest-risk mains. After so many miles of main replacement, one would
anticipate a large reduction in leaks. The data simply do not show such reductions. Even after
considering Company adjustments for third-party damage leaks and normalizing for degree days,
Peoples Gas has experienced only a nominal reduction in hazardous or potentially hazardous leaks
(Grade/Type 1 & 2) over the last several years. Several outside consultants have concluded that
the Company measures the correct parameters. That conclusion points to the weightings being
used in the models that drive replacement as a subject for evaluation. The Main Ranking Index
model weightings have not changed over a number of years.
The neighborhood ranking calculation significantly weights the amount of small diameter and pre1920 pipe in each neighborhood. It thus tends to favor larger over smaller neighborhoods, with all
else being equal. The combined amount of small diameter and pre-1920 pipe comprises a full 40
percent of the neighborhood risk ranking. This emphasis causes the initial selections for work in
each shop area (in the first five-year program increment) to consist primarily of the largest
neighborhoods in each shop area. The selected areas also include those neighborhoods that have
not had many replacements, because the miles of pre-1920 small diameter main remaining is the
largest driver on the ranking scheme. Medium pressure ductile iron mains get the next-largest
weighting. Meanwhile, unrepaired leaks and inside meters contribute the least to neighborhood
risk rankings. Neighborhoods with the highest leak rates may fail selection for the first five-year
window simply because they are physically small, do not contain a large percentage of pre- 1920
cast iron mains, or do not have much small diameter main.
Leak rates fell in the early years of cast and ductile iron replacement. The pace of reductions were
consistent with a conclusion that considerable reduction in risk was occurring. A downward trend
continued following the introduction of the Main Ranking Index in the mid-1990s. The risk
reduction line has now flattened (or slightly increased), even as more leak prone and higher risk
segments undergo replacement.
The current risk models continue to target what certainly used to comprise the highest risk
segments; i.e., small diameter pre-1920 cast iron segments (due to their highest break potential).
The once considerable amounts of such pipe, especially the smallest diameters, however, have
fallen considerably, as replacement programs have continued to target them. A going-forward
replacement rate of over 100 miles per year will continue their rapid elimination. However, the
reduction in risk that each mile replaced from here forward will produce will continue to diminish,
if one makes the logical assumption that the remaining segments pose less failure risk than those
already replaced.
Cast and ductile iron remain at far greater risk of failure than do modern materials, such as plastic
and cathodically-protected steel. At the same time, elimination of the most risky cast iron and

ductile iron segments reduces their risk relative to other system components. Note that the number
of mains scoring near 6 under the Main Ranking Index continues to decrease. That number
currently consists of less than 20 segments and less than 1 mile of mains. Between 2003 and 2013,
the number of miles of small-diameter (8” and less) cast iron main decreased from 1,323 miles to
1,032 miles (22 percent in 11 years). The next table (from PHMSA yearly reports) shows the miles
of cast iron remaining in the distribution system at year-end.
Table F.9: Remaining Distribution System Cast Iron

The same source, adding both repaired main leaks and leaks pending/scheduled for repair, shows
that the overall leak count has not decreased significantly over the same 11 years.

The numbers of repaired and pending-repair leaks in the annual reports show that the number of
repaired leaks either has remained constant or slightly decreased. Nevertheless, the number of
leaks pending repair has increased. Several possible explanations for decreases in repaired leaks
exist (e.g., avoiding repairs mains scheduled for replacement, deferral of repairs to reduce O&M
costs). It could also be that the overall leak rate has increased to the point of overwhelming the
resources that do the repair work, in which case the backlog is growing. Liberty believes that
finding the appropriate explanations for the failure of leak rates to decline should be a priority for
AMRP management. Given the level of replacement activity, an increase in explosion or fire
incidents caused by leaks would be unacceptable.
An examination of Peoples Gas monthly Type 1 and 2 leak reports for the last several years shows
that leaks rates have not decreased as anticipated.

Based on data that the Company has supplied, leak costs per mile of cast iron/ductile iron main
have been trending downward for several years. The chart below shows that trend by plotting
maintenance repairs per foot of main, separated into pre- and post-1920 vintages. During this same
period, Peoples Gas relied only on the Main Ranking Index to determine replacement priorities.
The neighborhood models targeting pre-1920 main should cause this trend to continue.

Showing degree days demonstrates that weather may account for part of the trend. Warmer winters
tend to reduce leak numbers, and therefore repairs. Colder winters with deeper frost penetration
may, on the other hand, accelerate leaks due to breaks. The 2013/2014 winter was one of the
coldest in recent times, which may account at least in part for an uptick in leak rates then.
Table F.13: Maintenance Repairs per Foot of Main

F.6

The weight given to pre-1920 main may no longer support greatest risk reduction per
mile replaced. (Recommendations F.3 and F.4)

Leak rates for pre-1920 cast iron mains decreased steadily and substantially from 1995 through
1999. By contrast, those rates have remained essentially flat during from 2010 through 2013.
Hazardous leaks (Type 1) have increased, but declines in non-hazardous leaks (Type 3) have
essentially offset the increase.
A number of factors complicate reaching definite conclusions about causes of leak-rate changes in
the past ten years or so. The number of miles replaced in more recent years decreased, with
uncertainty about rate recovery. Most recently, the extreme cold of the 2013/2014 winter brought
increased frost-cracking potential for brittle cast iron mains. Peoples Gas still replaces segments
having a Main Ranking Index ranking of 6 or greater (and 5 for certain conditions). The rankings
that drive neighborhood work tend to emphasize small mains installed prior to 1920, because they
are the most leak-prone.
Peoples Gas last commissioned a focused review of its risk-ranking effectiveness in 2007. The
outside firm conducting the review observed continuing leak reductions, and discussed the merits
of examining a date of 2038 or later for replacement completion. A fundamental premise of the
finding of effectiveness at that time has no longer applied for a number of years. Liberty believes
it is time to re-examine the weightings used to rank risk. In particular, the Company should
consider the weight that small-diameter, pre-1920 cast iron mains should receive.

ICC14GAS0002

Pre-1920 and post-1920 main repair rates are approaching each other. Targeting pre-1920 cast iron
main for replacement may not be yielding the largest reduction in leak rates. Rather, leak history
in a neighborhood may offer a prioritization criterion for main replacement neighborhoods.
Normalizing leaks, both repaired and open, per the number of feet or miles of main to be replaced
in each neighborhood would also tend to produce the greatest reduction in risk per foot replaced.
F.7

Peoples Gas does not employ a meaningful metric that can directly relate costs
expended to risk mitigation accomplished; Liberty continues to work with the
Company to determine one. (Recommendation F.5)

Liberty examined the potential for identifying a metric that could directly and simply address
effectiveness in identifying: (a) the right mains and services to replace, and (b) cost-effectiveness
of replacements in relation to that identification. Such a metric would measure cost-effectiveness
in terms of success in risk mitigation produced. Peoples Gas does not use such a metric. The
recommendation implementation monitoring process that will follow this report should include
efforts to develop such a metric.
A primary difficulty in defining a meaningful metric arises from the time lag between installation
of new mains and retirement of the mains being replaced. Lags approaching one year can occur.
For example, before retiring the old main, Peoples Gas must move all customers to a new, higherpressure main. Thus, delays in locating and installing a few - perhaps even one - new meters delays
retirement. The accounting process also delays recording retirements already physically
accomplished. Updating property and tax records produces discontinuity in measuring the effects
of replacement work.
F.8

A review of upcoming projects confirms that Peoples Gas does use the results of its
two ranking systems to prioritize work on what those systems identify as highest-risk.

Liberty examined 2015 planned replacement projects to test their conformity with the
neighborhood ranking process that Peoples Gas uses to select them. The next table lists 2015’s
major neighborhood replacement projects. Many carried over from 2014. Vulnerable services
include bare steel, early clear plastic, copper, and any ductile iron services.

The August 2014 run of the Main Ranking Index model identifies only about one mile (slightly
less than 5,000 feet) of main segments having a score of 6 or more. The characteristics of these 12
(all cast iron) segments are:
 Lengths between 2 and 763 feet
 Both medium and low pressure
 Installation dates between 1902 and 1956
 6” (11 segments) and 12” (1 segment) diameters.
These results illustrate that small diameter (6”) cast iron now dominates pipe ranked as highest
risk.
Both neighborhood and Main Ranking Index-driven 2014 work correspond to the results of the
modeling that Peoples Gas uses to prioritize work. Planned 2015 work will eliminate the mains
that reflect highest risk as scored by Peoples Gas. The low amount of highest-ranked main under
the Main Ranking Index, however, indicates that it is timely to evaluate whether more immediateterm, index-driven work would produce greater risk reduction in a cost-effective manner. This
improvement could occur by lowering the Index score that qualifies segments for immediate
replacement, even where they do not lie in top-ranked neighborhoods.
Cases have occurred in which Peoples Gas has altered work schedules driven by the neighborhood
and Main Index Ranking prioritizations. The Company checks its plans and schedules against
planned work by the City of Chicago and by others. Other underground utility infrastructure
improvements and repaving plans can make those changes appropriate, or even required. For the
upcoming year’s work, Peoples Gas sought to complete the design and engineering work required
to have construction contracts in December or early January.
This work proceeds with knowledge of existing plans, but changes, particularly by the City, require
continuing attention to schedule. In 2014, schedules for some of the North Shop area’s Portage
Park replacement work moved forward from 2015. Those not affected by changes in City plans
moved back to 2015.
On occasions where City infrastructure work is being performed in a lower-risk neighborhood,
moving the priority up on a neighborhood basis may prove particularly problematic. Changing
pressure may require some additional infrastructure work by Peoples Gas, such as running
medium-pressure feeder lines, supply sources, and detailed engineering analysis. These situations
undergo evaluation on a case-by-case basis.
Changes to adapt to schedules for City improvements sometimes take a partial form. For example,
where planned City work precedes the schedule for main replacement by a short time, the
Company may perform installations at street crossings contemporaneously with City work, but
save the balance of the work for later. This partial-replacement work avoids the need for later
disruption, because intersections require open-trench construction. Irrespective of whether the City
shares in paving and restoration, Peoples Gas saves money (as well as minimizing the public
inconvenience during street openings) by coordinating work with the City. When Peoples Gas
works in streets recently improved by the City (a so-called “moratorium street”), it must re-open
the street, and then re-pave the entire area. (The City requires curb-to-curb repaving.)

Peoples Gas does not have a reliable method for identifying the operating and
maintenance costs associated with AMRP, pressure increase, or meter relocation
work. (Conclusion F.6)

Peoples Gas has confirmed that it does not have current data or analysis addressing operations and
maintenance cost changes as a function of investment in work covered by the Qualifying
Infrastructure Plant Surcharge. Peoples Gas has agreed to the development of a cost model that
will incorporate this capability.

4. Recommendations
F.1

Peoples Gas should develop, staff, and implement a data quality control program.
(Conclusion F.3)

The Company should develop and implement a data quality control program, in order to verify
that its risk-prioritization models and processes continue to provide accurate results. The AMRP
has produced a significant body of work under both models currently used. The data should support
sampling of the documentary foundations for segments and neighborhoods completed in order to
determine what kinds of information were missing, and what errors available data may have
contained. Particularly for work driven by application of the Main Ranking Index, the Company
should validate that assumptions and allowances made for missing or erroneous data. The
validation should test the sufficiency of conservatism used to give confidence that the Index
continues to identify what truly represent the highest-risk segments appropriate for immediate
replacement.
Peoples Gas needs to develop a structured program for sharing experiences and problem solutions
among the three Shops, as Chapter Q: Field Work Performance reports. Addressing issues of data
accuracy should comprise one of a broad range of subjects for such sharing.
Peoples Gas needs to develop a single database combining all leak data. The Company should
ensure that all data in various forms, such as PHMSA reports and monthly leak discovery and
repaired data, is checked for accuracy and that totals are corrected for errors. Large differences
exist between data that Peoples Gas provided to Liberty in several different data requests. The
differences show that when leak data is checked against other lists, there are significant variations
that cannot be explained by re-grades or timing issues.
F.2

Peoples Gas should develop a database of soils data already collected, and populate it
further with soils data taken at new excavations. (Conclusions F.4)

The development of a soil database should serve, when reasonably populated, as a factor in
determining replacement priorities, particularly for highest-priority segments identified through
the Main Ranking Index. When data population reaches a level supporting defensible correlations
between soil conditions and risk, Peoples Gas should determine whether and how to turn the data
into a quantifiable ranking factor, or alternatively, how to apply it judgmentally in driving
replacement priorities.

Chapter F: Risk Assessment

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should conduct a structured study of alternative criteria and weightings
for the Main Ranking Index and for the neighborhood approach. (Conclusions F.5
and F.6)

It is time for Peoples Gas to engage in a structured, comprehensive, and analytically-driven review
of other weighting, parameters, and additional inputs to its Main Ranking Index and its
neighborhood rankings. For example, the repair rates for pre- and post-1920 cast iron are
equalizing. Eliminating that distinction and giving greater emphasis to small-diameter cast iron
mains may prove warranted. The Company also needs to address the bias that its zonal approach
creates in favor of larger neighborhoods. Normalizing the lengths of small-diameter cast iron may
prove beneficial. Another element of the review should be to consider leak history, as opposed to
open leaks alone.
F.4

Should Peoples Gas not change the current criteria and weightings, the Company
should develop additional measures to reduce leak rates further. (Conclusions F.5 and
F.6)

Clearly, leaks have not decreased at rates one should expect this far into an accelerated main
replacement program. Liberty’s review of Type 1 and 2 leaks found that the opposite has occurred.
Leak rates at Peoples Gas have increased. Data from 2009 through the third quarter of 2014 show
leaks increasing by over 10 percent (from slightly under 3,000 per year to around 3,400). Peoples
Gas offered adjustments to account for third-party damage leaks and to normalize for colder winter
weather. Even after accounting for them, the rate of decline for the most recent years of the AMRP,
2012 through 2014, remains only nominal. Reports to federal authorities on repaired and pending
repair leaks show a much larger increase (1,800 to 2,400) in the decade ending in 2013. Peoples
Gas may attribute some of the difference to Type 2 leaks (considered to be potentially hazardous
and thus requiring eventual repair) being downgraded to Type 3 (which never need to be repaired
because they are not considered hazardous). However, such downgraded leaks are not sufficient
in number to account for the difference.
Liberty expected the amount of main-replacement activity in recent years to show a correlation
with decreasing numbers of Type 1 and Type 2 leaks. That correlation is not evident. The lack of
correlation raises questions like: (a) whether the “right” mains are being replaced, (b) whether the
leak rates for remaining mains have grown dramatically, or (c) whether the last, severe winter
triggered large numbers of additional failures. Peoples Gas needs to examine these events to
determine the causes of the anomalous leak/replacement relationship. Another factor that Peoples
Gas needs to consider is the number of third-party damages each year and how infrastructure
replacements of all underground utilities affect that rate.
F.5

Peoples Gas should determine on system, segment, and neighborhood bases the level
of acceptable risk and metrics that will support appropriate adjustments in
replacement rates. (Conclusion F.7)

Peoples Gas needs to develop a set of forward-looking metrics that will predict changes in risk
level with replacement. Doing so will allow it to adjust replacement rates to meet future increases
and decreases in the risk level. Peoples Gas should determine an acceptable risk level for each
segment and neighborhood, and use that level to design a plan and schedule of main replacements
to reach it.

Chapter F: Risk Assessment

ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas has not determined an acceptable level of risk for the general public, its customers
and individuals working on the gas system. This tolerable level of risk needs to be determined so
that both main-replacement risk models can be operated to reach the desired level. The acceptable
level will not be static, but will change year to year, based on the mains already replaced, the
activity of the prior year, and the continuing aging of mains not yet replaced.
We have discussed with Peoples Gas the identification of metrics that would relate costs incurred
and replacements made to risk mitigation produced. Such metrics would provide benchmarks for
assessing the amount of risk reduction achieved for the money spent. Liberty will continue to work
with Peoples Gas to determine how to construct such a metric in a fashion that available data can
support meaningfully.
Using average numbers of leaks and average main replacement rates (or average numbers of leaks
over several years and main replacements over prior years) presents a possibility of developing an
appropriate metric to measure risk reduction. Defining such a metric would need to take into
account the fact that unusually cold weather can cause leak-rate spikes that can produce anomalous
results. Using leak rates averaged over a number of years can help address this impact. Averaging
replacement rates over multiple years may also help to correct for lags in physical completion and
accounting recognition of retirements. Liberty anticipates that the search for applicable metrics
will require an exploratory process, accompanied by deeper review of data issues. Thus identifying
whether such metrics exist, and defining them properly if they do, will require an iterative
approach.
F.6

Peoples Gas should develop a cost model that addresses O&M costs associated with
AMRP and related work. (Conclusion F.7)

This model needs to permit detailed forecasting, estimating, and analysis of operations and
maintenance cost changes occurring as a function of investments made to replace main under the
Main Ranking Index, and of investments made to serve the purposes of the neighborhood
approach.

Chapter G: Cost Planning
1. Background
This report chapter:
 Discusses the nature of cost planning for the overall duration of the AMRP
 Addresses the sufficiency of the overall AMRP cost estimate
 Evaluates the use of contingency or reserve to address the uncertainties that the AMRP
presents long term
 Assesses the quality of management’s grasp on the drivers of long-term AMRP costs.
A program such as the AMRP requires a comprehensive approach to planning and managing costs.
Its duration calls for a long-term cost plan, which this chapter addresses. Other chapters (K: Cost
Estimating and L: Cost Management) address cost estimating and the management of costs in
accord with the long-term cost plan and with shorter-term project cost estimates.
In 2009, Peoples Gas presented testimony before the Illinois Commerce Commission in support
of its request to accelerate replacement of cast and ductile iron pipe. The Company also sought to
upgrade low-pressure systems (normal operating pressure of about 0.25 psig) with a medium
pressure system (normal operating pressure of about 23 psig). The Company estimated that
accomplishing these two objectives would involve completion of the units of physical work
summarized in the following table.

2. Findings
The AMRP should be managed in a manner consistent with the requirements of a multi-billion
dollar “mega-project.” Peoples Gas should have a forecasting capability that supports continuing
projections of final AMRP costs with a high degree of confidence, addressing the material levels
of uncertainty necessarily associated with such a program.

a. The Cost Plan
i. Total AMRP Cost Estimate Background
Peoples Gas prepared the AMRP’s Original Estimate of $2.63 billion to support the cost recovery
mechanism (Infrastructure Cost Recovery) proposed in the Company’s 2009 rate case. This early
2009 estimate used 2008 information, and presented costs in 2010 dollars. The current estimate,
prepared in early 2013, used information available in 2012, and presented costs in 2012 dollars.
This estimate revised total AMRP total cost significantly upward, to $4.45 billion. This revision
came in the context of the latest update in Illinois Commerce Commission Docket No. 14-0496.
This estimate used actual costs for the first two years of AMRP work, a current estimate of 2013
costs, the budget for 2014, and a projection of costs for the program’s remaining 16 years. This
chapter reconciles the original and this current estimate below.
ii. Assessment of Total Cost Estimate Methods
Preparing a total cost estimate for a project of the size of AMRP comprises a major endeavor.
Significant effort and thought went into developing the Original Estimate, which considered the
collective experiences and relevant information available at the time. The next table summarizes
Liberty’s observations about its methods.

iii. Company Reconciliation of Original and Current Estimates
A first 2012 cost estimate produced a cost of $4.86 billion, which management followed shortly
with a downward revision to $4.56 billion. Following the availability of more actual (versus
estimated) costs, a further reduction occurred, producing 2012’s official Total Cost Estimate of
$4.45 billion. The next table shows the Company’s reconciliation of the cost estimate growth from

Several observations arise with respect to this cost growth of 69 percent, just two years into the
AMRP.
First, program management costs increased by three times, due to changes in assumptions and
management strategy shifts. The original estimate, while unrealistically low, reflected only
incremental AMRP costs. It did not include several elements initially thought to be covered inhouse. Second, the bulk of construction costs lie within the main replacement and the services and
meter installation categories. These areas experienced a collective cost increase of almost 68
percent in two years, much of which included revising the primary installation method from direct
bore to open cut. Optimizing performance requires close monitoring and management of
construction performance, using estimated unit rates as a measurement basis. The next table shows
the very large changes in unit rates that one can determine from the two estimates. There has yet
been no stable, accurate basis for measuring AMRP performance. The unit rate changes shown in
the next table demonstrate the instability. A failure to monitor and manage unit rates carefully
tends to cause construction performance to drift unfavorably.

iv. Program Contingency
Liberty found it surprising that the revised, 2012 estimate contained no contingency. A program
cost growth of 69 percent in two years indicates that project cost and schedule risks have not been
carefully addressed. That rate of growth should also signal to management that uncertainties in a
major program of this magnitude and duration require recognition and treatment in the long-term
cost plan. Even without the warning signals presented by the first two years of experience, a
program of the AMRP’s size, complexity, and duration calls for a clear and direct treatment of
contingency.
The term “contingency” has different connotations to different people in the industry. A general
perception is that it is meant to provide reserve for use whenever extra funds prove needed. Further,
some operate with the view that explicitly recognizing the potential need for added funds makes
them inevitable and implicitly acceptable. This view causes some to avoid the use of contingencies
in estimating. The best practice view, however, recognizes that good estimating requires the use
of contingency, for both small and large projects and programs. Determining the proper amount
requires careful judgment, but ignoring contingency does not offer a sound alternative.
Peoples Gas does not use contingency in its long-term program cost plan (i.e., across the full
AMRP 20-year duration). The Company, however, does include contingency in its annual budgets.
The primary use of contingency in these budgets is to address growth in contractor costs. Annual
budgets use two categories of contingency: allocated and unallocated. Allocated contingency
includes the costs required to manage known events or issues. Allocated contingency includes
requests (Field Order Authorizations and Change Orders) in progress but not yet approved.
Allocated contingency also includes the effects of emerging trends that management can attribute
to a specific cost account or project. An example of such a trend might be a change in City of
Chicago Department of Transportation requirements. Unallocated contingency consists of the cost
required to manage unknown events or issues. The program manages unallocated contingency
through a line item in the budget. Management transfers unallocated contingency amounts to more
specific accounts as circumstances dictate. The AMRP Senior Project Manager must approve any
transfers from the unallocated contingency account.
b. Maintenance of the Cost Plan
AMRP management established the current Cost Plan by laying out the annual gas main quantities
it needed to replace. Design analyses supported this planning foundation. The gas main quantity
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter G: Cost Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

required to be replaced amounted to about 2,000 miles. Management identified the other categories
of work involved (such as new gas main installation, services, meters, pressure regulator stations,
and city gate stations), and established estimated quantities for those categories. Material cost
calculations used available vendor information. Estimates of labor costs to move and install meters
used historical data. Management approached the estimation of installation costs for gas mains and
services by analyzing information from reasonably current bids. Support group costs (e.g., design
engineering and construction inspection) also required estimation and monitoring.
At a minimum, quantity, unit cost, and productivity require close monitoring and control. Peoples
Gas, however, has only tracked the annual installation quantities of gas mains, services, and
meters. The Monthly Status Report provides this tracking. Four years into the AMRP, one can find
little focus on how the program has performed with respect to the original estimate assumptions,
apart from current year production. The current AMRP cost management philosophy focuses on
spending the annual budget and doing the best it can to reach 100 miles of main replacement. The
failure carefully to track and focus on construction performance and project cost trends undermines
attention on and eventually the capability for producing a credible estimate of final, total AMRP
costs. Liberty also found no plan or set of structured processes defined and documented to monitor
projected total program costs.
The Project Management Office (“PMO”) displayed particular sensitivity to addressing the
potential impacts of future uncertainties. Liberty acknowledges that a long-term, complex, multibillion project spanning 20 years makes a deterministic, or single-point estimate of final costs
unhelpful in managing the AMRP. That difficulty, however, does not justify avoiding treatment
of such uncertainties. The AMRP requires a number of cost planning elements that it does not yet
possess. These elements include a long-term estimate, the ability and commitment to track against
it continually, and processes for assessing and trending scope additions and subtractions. Peoples
Gas acknowledged during Liberty’s field work the need for developing new tools essential for
bringing these elements into existence.
Liberty learned from field work during mid-2014 that management had underway an update of the
total program cost estimate. The Company led Liberty to believe that it would produce reviewable
results imminently. Management agreed to provide a presentation of the new cost estimate on a
preliminary basis. Canceled at the last minute, the presentation never happened, and AMRP
management informed Liberty that Peoples Gas had abandoned efforts to produce a new estimate
in the near term.
Instead, management hired a Planning & Forecast Manager, who has strong construction
background. Management tasked this individual with developing an entirely new cost model, after
taking a broad view of AMRP direction and consideration of the risks the program faces. That new
model was to form the basis for a new total cost estimate. The Company has also advised that new
modeling capability will incorporate the ability to address changes in operating and maintenance
costs associated with capital investments in replacing high-risk pipe, moving meters to outside
locations, and increasing pressures from low to medium levels.
Management estimated that it would take six months to complete work on a new cost model for
use in generating a new estimate of total AMRP costs. Current initiatives continue to address these

objectives. Three months after the end of management’s six-month time estimate, however, the
AMRP continues to lack an announced new cost plan and a current estimate of total program costs
at completion. Liberty has no reliable information on when Peoples Gas plans to issue a new
estimate.

3. Conclusions
G.1

The AMRP does not have a long-term cost plan that provides a credible estimate of
final program costs; management is only now creating the modeling capability to
produce such an estimate. (Recommendation G.1)

The original (2009) Cost Plan contained sufficient detail, and used appropriate assumptions to
establish production quantities and unit costs. The 2012 estimate updated total program costs, but
its $4.45 billion estimate used 2012 dollars. The use of 2012 dollars significantly understates
expected final costs. The AMRP needs a new cost plan that will provide a current final cost
estimate. An effort to provide such an estimate collapsed in mid-2014.
We found, as Peoples Gas has acknowledged, that it could not provide a meaningful total estimate
of AMRP costs without first developing new cost modeling capability. Sound estimates comprise
a critical element in effective management of AMRP costs. Peoples Gas has embarked on efforts
to develop that model. It needs to complete model development, and estimate work expeditiously.
Moreover, the results of the modeling effort need to address more than the direct costs of AMRP
work. Peoples Gas also needs to develop the modeling capability to address the ongoing O&M
costs and savings over the long term. The Planning and Forecasting Manager has responsibility
for cost model development.
G.2

AMRP estimates break program costs down into suitable major categories by year,
but management does not use that breakdown to inform cost tracking at either the
program-wide or project-specific levels. (Recommendation G.1)

Managers cannot manage what they do not monitor, and cannot monitor what they do not measure.
Cost tracking needs to provide information at a significantly enhanced level of detail.
G.3

The AMRP program’s lack of reserve to cover cost growth fails to reflect potential
cost exposure. (Recommendation G.1 and G.2)

Best cost estimating practice regards contingency or reserve as a necessary part of a total cost
estimate. Cost estimates need to recognize uncertainties that make full cost driver definition
imprecise. A specific portion of funding should be earmarked to account for unforeseeable
elements of cost. Hence, owners often add contingency or reserve to an estimate to provide for
uncertainties in defined scope and in internal and external cost drivers.
A traditionally derived contingency amount will likely prove inadequate in forecasting the costs
of a major, long-term program. Liberty therefore favors the term “reserve” or “management
reserve” to account for the many uncertainties that exist within and outside program scope as
currently defined. Scope changes will almost inevitably occur, and likely have substantial impacts.
This broader definition allows a more robust portrayal of forecasted final costs.

Management does not compare AMRP costs and performance with what others in
the industry have experienced. (Recommendation G.1)

Major main replacement work has become more common in the industry. It is useful to examine
the performance of others, in order to provide a benchmark for gauging one’s own approaches,
methods, practices, and results. The AMRP appears to use no organized or documented approach
to meeting this need. Instead, project management simply cites the experience of Jacobs
Engineering, which leads and staffs most of the Project Management Office, as providing insight
into other companies’ efforts, making such comparisons unnecessary in its view.
In the development of the revised Total Cost Estimate, Peoples Gas did make use of some industry
data; i.e., a conversion factor published by the Handy Whitman Construction Trend of Utility
Construction – North Central Region to price out most of the major commodities. The next table
summarizes that information.

Peoples Gas does not sufficiently understand and quantify major cost drivers.
(Recommendation G.1)

A cost driver is an activity or component that adds significant cost to a project or program. Periodic
cost analysis of actual data can yield relationships or linkages between events and contributions to
cost increases. Examples of such contributors include contractor change orders, restoration
contractor costs, material pricing, changes in City requirements, labor costs, and escalation. Cost
professionals in the cost management organization should perform such analyses.

4. Recommendations
G.1

Peoples Gas should develop a new Cost Plan Model that includes comprehensive
measurement bases and critical assumptions regarding scope, quantities,
productivity, labor costs, unit costs, and regulatory requirements; a reserve should
be included as part of the overall program costs. (Conclusions G.1, G.2, G.3, G.4, and
G.5)

A first deliverable of this Model will be the new Total Cost Estimate. For Peoples Gas to be able
to project final AMRP costs on a continuous basis, it has to establish a new capability to estimate
on an almost real-time basis the total program costs. Liberty understands that a new AMRP cost

Phase One Final Report

Chapter G: Cost Planning

ICC14GAS0002

forecasting model will be developed by the Planning and Forecasting Manager. Features important
to consider in development of that model include a number of elements that will assist in making
the cost plan a sound, comprehensive baseline for continually measuring performance.
Key parameters to measure at the program level include:
 Cost Metrics (input related)
o Program-to-date costs by year expended
o Potential cost impacts from Cost Trend Program
 Production Metrics (output related)
o Program-to-date miles of main installed
o Program-to-date miles of main retired
o Program-to-date services installed
o Program-to-date meters moved/installed
o Program-to-date pressure regulator stations installed
 Productivity Metrics (output versus input)
o Average cost per mile installed
o Average cost per mile retired
o Average cost per service installed
o Average cost per meter moved
o Average cost per pressure regulator station installed.
A comprehensive cost plan should incorporate the following elements:
 Effective cost control tools
 Specifically defined tools for each key element of the AMRP project costs
 Ability to promptly identify and respond to cost issues during the course of each project,
facilitating corrective action and providing meaningful and timely forecasts
 Agreement among the team on the structure and viability of the tools and resulting reports
 Understanding by the managers regarding the tools and commitment to their use
 Ability to document that AMRP project costs were prudently managed during the life of
the program.
Such a plan should take the following approach:
 Senior Management communicates cost management expectations
 Responsible manager assists in developing the cost element plan
 The cost element plan is evaluated
 Performance is measured by compliance with the cost management plan.
The plan should seek to establish:
 Accountabilities for specific cost elements
 Tools to be utilized, including how and when
 The tasks required of the manager, cost analysts, and others
 Data and reports, including when prepared and to whom distributed
 Analytical expectations
 Corrective action responsibilities.

Chapter G: Cost Planning

ICC14GAS0002

Other guidelines for developing the cost plan include:
 The plan should identify tasks that represent a disproportionate cost risk or otherwise
require special treatment (this identification should include tasks that have a relatively high
work-hour budget)
 An assigned cost analyst should prepare the cost element plan with input received from all
involved managers
 The cost element plan should undergo review and approval by AMRP project manager
before its inception
 The cost element structure should be simple, and consist of one to two pages.
Important features of the cost element structure include:
 Breaking the AMRP down into specifically identified cost elements
 Structuring the elements in accordance with their control characteristics
 Elements that might include engineering, planning and support functions, materials, mains,
services, meters and regulators, other construction items, such as intra-stations, city gate
stations, and pressure regulator stations, for example
 A total population of 8-12 elements, of various size and importance
 Element features that define the following:
o A cost estimate, including its basis and assumptions
o The manager responsible for the costs associated with the element
o A cost engineer or cost analyst assigned to track and analyze its associated costs
o Its control category based on its controllability and the sophistication of control
demanded:
A = High importance – maximum control activities
B = Either less important or less controllable, but still significant and some
degree of special attention is appropriate
C = Inconsequential – hence ignore.
The plan should also include a Cost Element Database having the following characteristics:
 The cost element database serves as the repository for all of cost element information
 The database structure supports collection of cost estimates and documentation of changes
to them
 The sum of the cost elements at any point in time produces the “defined cost.”
Each element falling into Category A or B elements (as described immediately above) requires a
cost management plan with the following characteristics:
 The plan can be anywhere from one to a few pages, and may include supporting
attachments.
 It defines the specific actions that will be taken to manage costs.
 It is both a tutorial and a procedure.
 It is likely to include key metrics and specifically what is to be done with them, required
reports by contractors and others, a requirement for monthly analysis by the cost engineer,
specific actions required of the manager, and update requirements for the model.
 Plans should be maintained and updated in a cost management manual.

One suggested approach for the AMRP would develop Individual Cost Management Plans to focus
on the major cost elements:
 Main Installation
 Service Installation
 Meter Installation
 Other Construction Items
 Engineering
 All Other Support Groups
 Materials.
These major cost elements focus on cost issues common to all projects or phases of a project,
producing a template like that shown in the next illustration.

Management should prepare and continuously maintain a detailed cost management plan for each
element.
Monitoring proves essential to making a cost plan function optimally. Given the AMRP’s long
duration, management should monitor annually the following areas: unit cost of main installed,
unit cost of main retired, unit cost of services installed, and unit cost of meters installed. The
following charts show examples of monitoring depictions.

Illustration G.7: Depictions of Annual Monitoring Components

Explanations of the source of data on the preceding charts include:
 2008 – Historical data up to that year
 2009 – Original AMRP Total Cost Estimate ($2.63 billion)
 2012 – Current AMRP Total Cost Estimate ($4.45 billion)
 2014 – Actual based on completed projects.
Note that unit costs in the 2012 Current Total Cost Estimate would provide the monitoring base
until management completes a new Total Cost Estimate.
Other important elements in tracking total AMRP costs should include:
 The defined and expected costs become the standards for tracking program costs
 As the defined costs change, the amount of reserve remaining erodes, and the pace of such
erosions becomes a key metric
 Expected costs may undergo periodic revision if and as the pace of erosion becomes too
fast or too slow
 The key metrics can be displayed over the full 20 year period, but a shorter window can be
selected to supplement the long-range view as warranted.
The next charts show simplified, hypothetical means for depicting erosion in the cost plan.

Illustration G.8: Depicting the Erosion of Program Reserve

Two important aspects should apply with respect to model updates:
 The model produces real-time cost forecasts; i.e., changes in the defined program costs as
they are revealed
 The assigned cost analysts or cost engineers initiate model changes, based on reconciled
cost trends and monthly analysis of cost elements.
After completing the current work to establish a new final AMRP cost estimate, Peoples Gas needs
to develop an effective cost forecasting capability, in concert with the cost management program.
G.2

Peoples Gas should establish a Cost Trend Program to monitor potential, major costaffecting items. (Conclusion G.3)

Such a cost trend program serves as an early-warning system for potential cost deviations. Potential
cost changes should get reported immediately, by an assigned cost analyst or cost engineer.
Interventions can be initiated to mitigate correctible problems or minimize cost impacts. The cost
trend program is a valuable tool that provides up-to-date information that enables Peoples Gas to
forecast the final AMRP costs on an almost real-time basis.

Chapter H: Schedule Planning
1. Background
This report chapter:
 Assesses long-term schedule planning and the schedules that drive replacement work in
the immediate term
 Discusses the organization and resources that perform and support the scheduling function
 Examines the tools and processes that support scheduling functions and activities
 Reviews the use of production quantities and personnel resources in scheduling
 Evaluates the means used to monitor schedule performance and update schedules.
Good project scheduling provides real-time visibility on where a program or project is heading in
comparison with clear milestones. Scheduling outputs should provide a common platform for the
whole project team, focusing attention on important activities on critical paths. Good scheduling
will ensure effective and efficient project and program execution.
Liberty evaluated the appropriateness and credibility of AMRP schedule planning. The
examination addressed the AMRP’s overall long-term schedule plan and the more detailed nearterm schedules. The latter should form part of and be integrated with that long-term plan. Bulk
quantities (feet or miles) of main to be replaced in each schedule time period comprise a paramount
driver of program schedules. Overall, the AMRP’s main replacement target, both peak and average
over the 20 years, should drive overall planning. It defines the level that must be maintained to
support the eventual replacement quantities in the field. Integrating engineering and procurement
activities, considering the drivers of work planning, ensuring activity coordination, addressing
permitting, and aligning contractor and employee resources form important elements in
constructing achievable, but appropriately aggressive schedules.

2. Findings
Work by PwC, which has consulted for AMRP management for a number of years, has produced
a good summary of the program’s scheduling management process. The next chart depicts that
process.

Illustration H.1: Schedule Management Process

a. Master Schedule Plan
No AMRP Master Schedule exists at the long-term, program-wide level. The approach to
scheduling has been to use the annual budget to drive the schedule. This approach will support an
overall 20-year duration, provided that annual cost limits can support the average target completion
rate of 100 miles per year for 20 years. However, the first four years produced an average annual
rate of only 70 miles. Liberty found no assessment on the impact of the current progress rate (70
percent of that required to meet 20 years) on total duration. Liberty also found no long-term
schedule recovery plan or evidence of focused efforts to identify any. The lack of assessments and
recovery planning evidence that annual spending limits prevail in the minds of management over
completion within 20 years as the AMRP time driver.
Scheduling for 2015 (see the next table) addresses projects already active plus incomplete projects
(or project phases) started in 2011 through 2014. The two active 2015 projects consist of Portage
Park and South Austin.

b. The Scheduling Function
Program management develops an annual schedule with development of the annual budget. To
date, program schedules only address construction, excluding, for example, design and permitting.
AMRP management uses schedules provided by the contractors performing main and service
installations to begin schedule development. Management adds to these contractor schedules
required back end work, such as meter installations, performed by the internal Company
workforce.
i. Construction Scheduling
The activities involved in assembling the annual construction schedule for input into the
scheduling system follow this sequence:
 Engineering generally completes the design of projects or phases of a project by the end of
the preceding summer
 Bid invitations issue at the beginning of November
 Contractor bid awards occur at the end of January
 Preliminary meetings with contractors (about 15 days later) discuss construction baseline
schedules
 Contractors provide construction schedules for import into the scheduling system (P6) in
mid-February
 The three Peoples Gas Shops provide scheduling information for the employee-performed
AMRP in March, as the construction season approaches commencement.
ii. Contractor Scheduling Process
Management terms this overall contractor schedule the Construction Project Schedule. Each
project passes through three schedule phases, developed for the stages through which each
progresses.
Management terms the first schedule that each project uses the Preliminary Project Schedule
(“PPS”). Bid packages to which contractors respond define work sequences for each project phase.
Contractors must submit a Preliminary Project Schedule (using critical path method scheduling)
when providing a price proposal as part of bidding for particular projects.
The Preliminary Project Schedule of the contractor selected covers first project activities, and
eventually provides the foundation for the next, or Project Baseline Schedule. The Preliminary
Project Schedule provides a preliminary logic plan for the project, divided (for multi-phased
projects) at the phase level. Management depicts the Preliminary Project Schedule as a network
diagram. The diagramming uses a “Sample Logic Model” provided by the Project Management
Office’s Senior Scheduler.
This summary-level diagram depicts a work breakdown structure, at the level required eventually
to produce a fully developed baseline schedule. A Preconstruction Conference, scheduled within
fifteen calendar days after bid award, uses this basic logic to support a discussion of more detailed
requirements, reporting, logic, and expectations.

Chapter H: Schedule Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

A project’s second schedule, the Project Baseline Schedule, comes from the contractor. It becomes
due within fourteen calendar days following the Preconstruction Conference. Contractors submit
these fully developed baseline schedules for review and acceptance by the Project Management
Office. The Project Baseline Schedule submittal presents the contractor’s complete plan for
executing work in accordance with bid and contract documents. Contractors work with the three
Peoples Gas Shops, in order to allow sufficient time for the Shops to identify their work activities.
Submission to the Project Management Office occurs after this coordination between contractors
and the Shops. The Project Management Office’s Senior Scheduler reviews these schedules, and
must accept them.
A project’s third schedule stage, the Project Schedule Update, involves weekly contractor reviews
and schedule updates that seek to incorporate all current information. The data considered includes
progress, identifies approved adjustments of logic and duration, and proposes any changes
required.
At the time of Project Baseline Schedule development, contractors produce schedule narratives for
each project. These narratives overview each project as a whole. The narratives discuss details of
contractor execution plans, the sequencing plans that the Shops provide for their work, contractor
crew loadings, the sequencing plan, explanations of lags and constraints applied when scheduling
activities, and contract milestones tied to the applicable dates from the Project Baseline Schedule.
Contractors prepare and maintain these three types of Construction Project Schedules. Their
contracts define start and completion dates. Contractors must establish progress rates required to
meet the finish dates defined in purchase orders. Contractors use these Construction Project
Schedules to plan, organize, and execute work. These schedules also provide reference points for
recording and reporting performance and physical progress. They show how the contractor plans
to complete all remaining work as of each progress report.
Project Baseline Schedules provide the basis against which management monitors and measures
project production and progress. These schedules use project scope dimensions, specified
milestones, and completion dates from the applicable contract. These schedules use critical path
method (“CPM”) scheduling. The construction industry very commonly uses this, so-called CPM
method and the Precedence Diagramming method.
Critical path method scheduling generally consists of constructing a project model that:
 Lists all work activities required for completion, generally using a work breakdown
structure (a breakdown of a project into smaller elements to enhance the detail available
for use in cost estimate and schedule development and control)
 Identifies the duration required to complete each of those activities
 Identifies the dependencies that exist between activities, and the activity start and
completion dates (or interim milestones) required to accommodate those dependencies
 Identifies logical end-dates and deliverables associated with them.
The Precedence Diagramming Method (also commonly used) employs a box and line diagram that
identifies activities (nodes) connected by arrowed lines showing dependencies.

These Project Schedules thus show the sequence and interdependence of activities required for
complete performance of the work. They begin with the Contract Start Date, and conclude with
the Contract Completion Date. The maximum duration of any physical work activity cannot
exceed twenty working days, unless approved by the Project Management Office’s Senior Planner.
iii. Scheduling Tools
The AMRP Project Management Office uses the industry-accepted Primavera Advanced P6 tool
to maintain project schedules. Liberty engaged in a demonstration with the organization’s Senior
Planner. This demonstration covered the hierarchy from the master schedule at the top down
through detailed level schedules. The demonstration addressed both engineering and construction
scheduling.
Management has online access to baseline and updated schedules. The schedules for work in 2013
and 2014 began with construction schedules developed for use in the field. Engineering schedule
development came later, and sought to produce the work required to support construction schedule
requirements. Program management appears now to be approaching completion of efforts to
integrate engineering and construction schedules. The goal was to begin producing integrated
schedules for 2015 work. In addition, the AMRP has now reached a point where it can load the
Peoples Gas construction work into master schedules as well. Earlier construction schedules
included only contractor work.
There has not been a plan, beyond engineering and construction, to develop schedules for other
work groups, or to integrate their activities into engineering and construction schedules.
iv. Scheduling Logic
All AMRP contractors must use a “Logic Model” for project schedule creation. The next diagram
illustrates the model’s required work breakdown structure and correct logic sequence for work
activities for a sample project (from 2013). Specialized projects (e.g., high-pressure mains) have
unique Logic Models. The Peoples Gas back end work is integrated with contractor construction
work. The Logic Model identifies all required activities for each project, phase and street/block
number, establishing the level of detail required for each.
The Logic Model depicts a “zero total float critical path.” Float identifies the amount by which an
activity can be delayed without threatening the project’s end date. An activity with zero total float
has no float. Thus, any delay in completing it will delay total project completion. The model
ensures that contractor baseline schedules will contain a zero total float critical path. Contractors
receive an electronic file of the Logic Model (compatible with AMRP management’s automated
system, Primavera P6), enabling contractors to use it as the basis for building a project schedule
in Primavera P6.

c. Production Targets in Schedules
To date, the AMPR tied no schedules to quantities of work performed. the industry commonly uses
S-curves to depict quantities installed over time. These curves display cumulative quantities, costs,
labor hours or other variables plotted against time. The term derives from the fact that curves
typically are flatter early, become steeper in the middle, and then turn flatter again at the end of a
project. This shape typifies most project courses, which follow a slow but increasing early pace,
and experience a decelerating end phase as required work approaches completion.
Peoples Gas agrees with the need to begin to tie schedules with quantities, and has reported an
initiative to develop and employ that approach. If completed expeditiously, this initiative should
produce significant enhancement in progress and performance monitoring and management. The
Company has recently required both their internal workforce and contractors to submit quantitybased schedules. Some contractors reportedly need to deal with logistics and phase-in difficulties
in meeting this requirement. Two of the six major contractors have already demonstrated the
capability to submit compatible schedules with quantity S-curves. Management expects that all
2015 installation schedules will be quantity-based.
Peoples Gas currently submits its work quantities to contractors. Through an interim, manual
process, contractors then submit their and the Peoples Gas quantities to an AMRP analyst for
inclusion in Weekly Progress Reports and Monthly Status Reports. Plans are underway to enable
the contractors to report installed quantities electronically through the project schedule tools. In
July 2014, AMRP planners began to analyze contractor performance against goals. Monthly
comparisons addressing the production of each contractor now form part of the Monthly Status
Reports. The next charts illustrate the performance comparisons that began in July 2014.

d. Resource-Loaded Schedules
Resource-loaded schedules provide a timeline that details resources allocated to planned activities
and preset milestones. Such schedules provide a visual representation of how available project
resources align with specific, scheduled activities. These schedules depict the planned use of
project resources throughout scheduled project time. This depiction permits continual evaluation
of the sufficiency of resources and of their effectiveness in meeting established schedule
milestones.
AMRP management did not resource load the construction schedule for the Peoples Gas internal
workforce, citing bargaining unit objections. There was also a concern about maintaining the
ability to divert resources from AMRP work to perform emergency work. An initiative now
underway seeks to incorporate resource loading and crew make-up, in order to enable monitoring
of production in the “Meters/Regulators/Transfers” activities of Shop construction schedules.
During the early part of each calendar year (after the bid-winning contractors submit their
schedules), AMRP management seeks to allocate the internal resources needed to install and move
meters in step with contractor main and service installations. Loading the internal resource at the
city-block level requires assumptions about availability and productivity of internal work crews.
Collaborative planning sessions with Shop supervisors, using NetPoint, seek to support this
resource-leveling process. NetPoint is an industry-accepted tool that supports interactive and
collaborative planning and scheduling in a manner that promotes real-time adjustments and visual
depictions.
Contractors then receive the resulting activity durations for incorporation into their schedules.
Competing demands for internal labor resources, variability in the resources required from block
to block, delays in service markings, and delays in obtaining permits from the City, however,
exemplify the difficulties that make production estimated by this model challenging to meet. Such
issues also made maintenance of the model and the contractor schedules complicated.
AMRP management responded by limiting resource leveling and duration forecasting to the phase
level (i.e., abandoning the block-by-block approach) for 2014 AMRP projects. This revised
approach bases productivity assumptions on the number of meters that the internal workforce in
each Shop can generally produce on a given day. This approach does not consider the particular
mix of meters involved or difficulty in obtaining access to work on specific blocks or at specific
addresses. This output of this revised process provides contractors with: (a) an estimated overall
duration for Peoples Gas Meters/Regulators/Transfers activities, and (b) a forecasted date for
completion of retirement activities by project phase.

The Construction Planning Group also uses these models in information exchanges with the City,
to provide anticipated dates (by quarter) of retirement and final restoration. Using planned
retirement sequences, management applies NetPoint to levelize Peoples Gas resources, and project
completion dates for the installation of meters in a given phase. Following levelization,
management forecasts retirement and final restoration dates.
AMRP contracts generally use unit-price or lump-sum pricing mechanisms. Contractor schedules
have not been resource-loaded. Tracking their crew counts occurs weekly, as the next illustration
depicts.

e. Schedule Changes and Updates
When project changes make schedule delay expected, contractors complete a “Schedule Impact
Notice.” These notices identify causes affecting work activities, and include a fragmentary
network (fragnet). A fragnet displays a sequence of new activities proposed to be added to the
existing schedule (e.g. due to a change in scope). A Form of Authorization process can be initiated
to secure additional funding to address the work changes involved.
Liberty sought to identify any schedule variance analyses performed by AMRP management on a
periodic basis. Peoples Gas observed that the monthly status report explains all schedule variances
by project. The following table (extracted from the year-end 2014 report) shows almost 80 percent
of projects behind schedule (108 out of 137). Liberty has not found any analyses of these delays.
Such analysis would enable identification of common or systemic issues that should be addressed
by corrective action plans.

3. Conclusions
H.1

The AMRP Plan does not include schedules at an overall program level; detailed
generic schedules existed at the construction level, but not the production support
level. (Recommendation H.1)

The AMRP plan should include, at a minimum, schedules at an overall program level, at a
production support level, and at a detailed process level. Management has not prepared or used
them.
The AMRP does not have the capability to assess in a credible way whether the program’s 20-year
duration remains achievable. Nor can management quantify the length of any anticipated delay.
The program has used detailed generic schedules addressing construction activities only for the
current and the following year. These generic schedules reflected physical work only. They did
not address the work activities needed to support construction.
H.2

Individual project schedules initially reflected only contractor work, but now include
physical work performed by the internal workforce, and Peoples Gas is integrating
engineering schedules into them. (Recommendation H.2)

Schedules should reflect the requirements of each work group required to support overall
production targets. That has not been the case historically for the AMRP, which until recently,
included schedules only for contractor work.
Project schedules normally begin with the engineering and design phase, and then integrate
construction and completion work. The AMRP scheduling function begins in reverse, with the
completion of contractor schedules for projects. AMRP scheduling then adds the back end work
activities of the Peoples Gas crews. Then, management develops engineering schedules for the
projects, based on the construction schedules. Efforts underway now seek to provide for the
development of engineering schedules first. The construction schedule can then be developed by
adding to the Project Baseline Schedule (provided by the awarded contractor) the associated work
activities performed by internal Peoples Gas personnel. This new approach will ensure a natural
flow of scheduled project activities from inception to completion.
H.3

AMRP schedules have not been quantity driven, although efforts underway seek to
make them so. (Recommendation H.5)

Schedules should contain sufficient detail to define the expected contribution to total estimated
quantities to be installed, using clear production targets for each replacement project or group of
such projects. The AMRP, however, has only recently begun to develop quantity-driven schedules
that will begin to meet this need.
All in-house and contractor crews should remain aware of the production expectations underlying
their work activities. Quantity-driven scheduling, now under development, will bring this
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter H: Schedule Planning

ICC14GAS0002

awareness a step closer to achievement. The effort remains underway. Four contractors must solve
logistical issues in moving to such scheduling. AMRP management expects resolution of the
problems in time to support schedule development and monitoring during 2015. Completing the
transition to quantity-driven scheduling will also give Peoples Gas a single source of reporting for
quantities installed. Management has not had this tool so far.
H.4

Detailed work schedules of individual projects are consistent with higher-level annual
plan schedules.

Peoples Gas needs to develop and maintain its detailed work schedules in a way that provides
consistency from the highest levels down to the schedules that guide construction work crews. The
AMRP scheduling meets this need. The short-term generic schedules Liberty reviewed show
consistency with higher-level schedules. The use of a well-respected tool in the industry
(Primavera P6) supports such consistency. Liberty also found capable professionals in the AMRP
scheduling function.
H.5

Peoples Gas resource-loads detailed schedules for the internal workforce, but not
contractors, and not for other work groups whose efforts support AMRP field work.
(Recommendation H.3)

Detailed work schedules should be resource-loaded. The Company’s effort to do so for the work
that its employee crews perform has a sound basis. Peoples Gas, however, has not implemented it
with full effectiveness. The Company faces significant competition between the AMRP and other
needs met with internal resources. Liberty did not find sufficient efforts to assess the adequacy of
internal resources to meet all requirements, including, but not limited to AMRP work. The
Company’s history shows that the emergence of other urgent needs has diverted resources assigned
to AMRP. Scheduling alone cannot solve that problem. However, proper and complete resource
loading of AMRP work will permit a more informed understanding of the impacts of other work.
Resource loading will also lay a foundation for considering the degree to which Peoples Gas should
dedicate minimum levels of its resources to AMRP work.
Liberty also found construction inspection resource loading an area of concern. The Company has
an appropriate target of one inspector per contract crew, but has yet to achieve it. More attention
to the resource-loads of this inspection group will promote needed enhancement in efforts to
oversee the quality and production of main and service installation work.
H.6

The AMRP has not used focused analyses of the AMRP schedule delays experienced
to date, and has not demonstrated a pattern of aggressive action to address such
delays. (Recommendation H.4)

Project activities experience delay for many reasons, some controllable and some uncontrollable.
Construction management, which manages work daily in the field, discusses sources of delay in
weekly progress meetings. Some of the problems encountered (e.g., permit issues and securing
property owner access permission), while repetitive, do not lend themselves to correction by crews.
Liberty found no consistent effort to analyze the root causes of recurring problems and to
recommend solutions to mitigate them.

4. Recommendations
H.1

Peoples Gas should develop a Scheduling Master Plan. (Conclusion H.1)

The Company recognizes this need, and has begun a significant effort to develop a Master Plan. It
needs to incorporate a master schedule plan that conforms to a well-defined AMRP scope and a
newly formed, credible cost plan. To maintain this master schedule plan on a real-time basis,
Peoples Gas also needs to develop the capability to assess how cost issues may affect schedule,
and (vice versa) how schedule issues will affect costs at the AMRP program level.
H.2

Peoples Gas should develop a complete project schedule for every new project, and it
should address all aspects of the work required, from engineering to construction and
through completion. (Conclusion H.2)

After four years, AMRP scheduling development has not matured at the pace required. Scheduling
should address all major steps required to prepare a project for service. At a minimum, generic
schedules should delineate, interrelate, and define the schedule requirements for: project selection,
design, preliminary cost estimate preparation, contract bid and award, final cost estimate
preparation, project authorization, City permit approval, permitting, material requisition,
document control, work planning, field planning, construction scheduling, material delivery, gas
main installation, services installation, gassing mains, meter and regulator installation, service cutoffs, restoration, inspection, and project close outs. Identifying and depicting all essential activities
permits support groups to plan logically to ensure the availability of resources adequate to support
projects on a timely basis.
H.3

Peoples Gas should resource-load schedules to address all physical work resources
(including internal workforce and contractors) and construction inspectors.
(Conclusion H.5)

The Company needs to complete promptly the effort currently underway to resource-load the
schedules for the internal workforce. Peoples Gas should load the lump-sum and unit-cost
contractor resources into the schedule as well. This enhancement will give construction
management the visibility to gauge the sufficiency of contractor resources. At present, AMRP
management must wait until production falls behind schedule to identify resource shortages. The
change will also give Peoples Gas the ability to assess, for long-term resource planning purposes,
the comparative productivity levels of contractors. This information will support the development
of performance targets, and assist Peoples Gas in assessing the benefits of and planning for the use
of internal workforces to perform some main and services installation work.
H.4

Peoples Gas should regularly perform schedule variance analyses to identify
recurring or systemic issues, and plan corrective actions. (Conclusion H.6)

In 2014 alone, 108 out of 137 phases of projects experienced delay. This experience dramatizes
the need for a timely and effective source of analysis of the causes that drive schedule delay.
Peoples Gas needs to develop, and then regularly apply the capability to determine what impact
uncontrollable events (e.g., inclement weather) have had, and are likely to continue to have on
schedule progress. It must then seek regularly to isolate the impacts of remaining influences. That
isolation will enable management to determine which are subject to full or partial control, what

changes it will take to mitigate their impacts, and the costs of and benefits to be gained from taking
mitigating actions.
The Company needs to understand all of the root causes that underlie schedule delays. It also needs
to meet the challenge of gaining that understanding with the recognition that what appears
uncontrollable at first can often be affected after full explorations of causation. Regular, ongoing
analysis of schedule delay provides the basis for gaining that understanding and for planning and
executing effective corrective actions. The permit problem with the City of Chicago offers an
example. Schedule delays have caused deterioration of relationships with the City. Lack of
permits, expired permits, and failure to perform restoration when and as required by the City
caused a large number of permit violations.
H.5

Peoples Gas should complete promptly its efforts to ensure that construction
schedules become quantity-based for the internal workforce and for contractors.
(Conclusion H.3)

This recommendation may prove largely to be a function of resolving the logistics problems that
four contractors now have in providing quantity-based schedules. At any rate, Peoples Gas needs
to ensure that the effort to develop such schedules comes to fruition as soon as possible.

Chapter I: Resource Planning
1. Background
This chapter:
 Examines the overall strategy for planning AMRP craft resources
 Assesses the planning processes used to ensure sufficient craft resources
 Evaluates craft availability and training
 Reviews planning and staffing for the engineering and inspection resources required to
support AMRP work.
Resource plans require close integration and consistency with cost and schedule plans. The
assumptions driving resource plans require sound derivation, structured documentation, and
continuing examination and revision as work progresses, and as experience with resource-related
drivers grows. Plans for producing the particularly high AMRP production quantities contemplated
also require careful consideration of resource availability. That consideration ensures that plans
for acquiring resources recognize quantity and quality in relation to what the marketplace can be
expected to offer. Liberty evaluated the AMRP’s staffing strategies and the support underlying
them. This review included the sources of work crews, productivity assumptions for the required
categories of craft workers, overtime assumptions, and unit costs. Liberty’s inquiries extended
beyond direct construction resources to include support group resource adequacy.

2. Findings
a. Overall AMRP Craft Staffing Strategy
After approval of the Infrastructure Cost Recovery (“ICR”) rider, AMRP management developed
an overall annual installation target to increase replacement of high-risk gas mains from about 50
to between 100 to 150 miles per year. Averaging about 100 miles per year would put the AMRP
on a 20-year completion course. At that time, crews consisting of Peoples Gas employees were
performing most work needed to maintain the network (e.g., addressing instances of leaks and
corrosion). Contractors were performing most capital work. A basic principle behind this approach
was consistency over time in internal resource numbers, while using contractors to perform work
above the base, sustained level, and thus subject to variation. This strategy applies widely in the
gas and electric industries. It can provide overall economy, and avoid disruptions that come with
frequent increases and decreases in employment in affected positions.
What differs principally among utilities are the uses and amounts of contractor resources. At
AMRP inception, management determined that contractors could perform main installation work
more productively and with better quality. Making this approach work required the Company to
work with its bargaining units to secure flexibility needed to make major portions of the
significantly expanded work of the AMRP open to contracting. Management viewed that
flexibility as providing a method for avoiding the need to procure major equipment and develop
internally a suitably trained and experienced workforce to handle the much increased work load.
Peoples Gas secured two important changes; i.e., a substantial compression of the bargaining unit
progression system, and increased cross-assignment of personnel. Peoples Gas succeeded through
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter I: Resource Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

renegotiating an existing agreement in creating a new “utility worker” classification. It allowed
craft workers with appropriate training to perform multiple types of work. New utility workers
could attend a six-month training program that would significantly shorten progression through
the hierarchy of bargaining unit positions.
Peoples Gas also secured some strike-related agreements that involve contractor use. The approach
developed between the Company and the bargaining units provides for notice of labor supply needs
that allows union efforts to ramp up resources. Workers would be qualified by the union, which
would have the opportunity to supply the necessary resources. Should they prove unable to do so,
the Company could acquire non-union workers to meet deficits. Liberty found no reason to believe
that the management of relationships with the bargaining units involved has produced any resource
constraints.
Peoples Gas did not undertake any structured or documented analysis in determining the
contractor/employee strategy that has guided the division of AMRP work since program inception.
Liberty did find it generally consistent with what one would expect as an overall strategy for
providing the substantially increased craft resources and the major equipment needed to support
the AMRP. It makes sense to continue examining the balance as the AMRP proceeds, recognizing
that the division now existing has resulted from give and take between the Company and
bargaining unit representatives.
To the extent that relationships remain sound, the benefits of continuing them in that form comprise
an important factor to consider in examining any change in that balance. Effective resource
management involves continuing efforts to examine the optimum allocation between internal and
external resources. Liberty has found no such examination in the past four years. Program
management believes that the present division between contractor and internal resources remains
the optimum balance.
b. Master Craft Resource Planning
Peoples Gas has no comprehensive master resource plan for the AMRP. Such a plan would address
resource needs as they may change over the life of the AMRP, assess their availability, and address
efforts to fill potential short-falls. AMRP program management focused on the short term with
respect to resource planning. Annual resource planning springs from the completed designs
released by the Central Planning Group for immediate-term construction. The fairly recent
decision to combine management of AMRP and non-AMRP work pursuant to the Qualifying
Infrastructure Plant Surcharge requires consideration of total resource demands higher than when
AMRP resource decisions considered just AMRP needs. Peoples Gas needs to plan combined
demands together, but the approach to staffing from a planning perspective has been ad hoc.
Liberty did not find a resource plan for either the immediate or long term.
Interviews with program management did not indicate conversance with structured notions of or
approaches to long-term resource planning for craft or engineering resources. There existed a clear
division of responsibility between the performance of the internal workforce and contractors. The
utility has made efforts to develop a pool of resources, but its decisions and activities have not
occurred in the context of a long-term AMRP staffing plan.

Peoples Gas currently does not have a suitably sophisticated range of resource planning tools.
Recognizing the need for enhancements in resource planning, however, the program has recently
brought on a resource manager. This manager will have responsibility for resource planning and
management. Liberty anticipates that the new manager will be developing tools to support the
exercise of these responsibilities.
c. Craft Resource Management
As other chapters of this report make clear, contractors perform gas main installations (what
Liberty has termed the “front end” of the process), while internal crews perform the back end work.
The AMRP cost estimate reflects this division and actions concerning staffing conform to this
strategy.
Liberty found, however, a lack of focus on resource management. AMRP monthly reporting
provides a good example. The 42-page Monthly Status Report contains a single page devoted to
resource information. As the following table shows, this page presents the split between internal
and external full-time equivalent resources (“FTEs”). Even this limited information, however,
raises questions about the degree of focus that exists on the use of AMRP resources. First, the chart
shows the split on a whole-company basis. It does not address uniquely the resources employed
on the AMRP. Second, the chart does not support any analysis of resource management, but rather
seeks to show the number of jobs created. Job effectiveness and efficiency, rather than the raw
numbers, are what is critical to AMRP performance optimization. This chart provides no ability to
examine those critical factors.

Liberty found no structured analysis of or plans for the use of overtime or multiple shifts. The
AMRP considers shift work only during emergencies. The annual budget allows for 10 percent
overtime. Liberty found, however, no formal guidelines addressing how the Company manages
overtime levels for the various types of AMRP work. Management did not provide information
responsive to our requests for historical overtime percentages. The response stated that AMRP
management does not require contractors working on unit-price or lump-sum contracts to report
work hours (straight time or overtime). The response also did not provide any overtime information
concerning the internal physical workforce and other work groups. A follow-up question appears
to confirm that Peoples Gas does not closely track or manage overtime.
The Company entered a new, five-year contract with Local 18007 in 2013. This agreement
contains two provisions that should help increase daily production and reduce overtime:
 Craft workers now can report directly to the jobsite, which allows them to start productive
work near the beginning of the work shift
 Craft workers can work across district lines, which facilitates prompt movement to
locations with work waiting.
Sound productivity measurement comprises a central element in resource planning and
management. AMRP reporting, however, focuses on production, without an emphasis on
productivity. The Monthly Status Report exemplifies the totality of the focus on production, to the
exclusion of the units of work it takes to support that production. The monthly report (see the
examples in the tables below) displays quantities of mains, services, and meters installed.

Chart I.4: Monthly Report Sample – Main Installations

Resource planning for a long-term program also requires consideration of productivity changes as
work progresses through different stages. The current AMRP estimate places final costs at $4.45
billion. The next table shows key labor unit costs it incorporates. Management applies the same
unit costs for the AMRP’s full 20-year duration. Estimates do not reflect productivity changes over
that period. Five-year ramp up and two-year ramp down segments should bring different
productivity levels. Moreover, establishing and monitoring against a targeted productivity
improvement level during the AMRP’s “sweet spot,” is appropriate. The AMRP requires regular
monitoring of productivity and monitoring against more than a 20-year flat line assumption.

d. Craft Availability
Management expresses optimism about the long-range availability of resources, both internal and
among AMRP contractors. That optimism is consistent with AMRP experience to date, but Peoples
Gas has not supported its expectations of resource availability with any focused analyses or
examinations.
A training partnership with the City Colleges of Chicago (a network of seven community colleges
across the City) supports the ability to increase the workforce with reasonable dispatch, when
circumstances require. The Company also views good relationships with contractor unions and the
attractiveness of remaining in the Chicago area to workers as assets in securing access to resources.
Participation in bidding on AMRP contract work has remained robust through the program’s early
years. Peoples Gas therefore considers the training school a sufficient backstop for securing needed
apprentices through the training partnership.
The most recent construction season (during 2014) demonstrated a resource-based response to less
than expected progress. Mid-year increases to contractor resources produced an acceleration in
desired main and service installation rates. The increase would bring those rates to a level nearly
sufficient to make up for a gap that grew during the first part of the construction season. This
recovery effort, did not, however demonstrate integration with the back end work performed by
Peoples Gas crews. AMRP completion work competes for resources with non-AMRP work
performed by the same internal personnel. Despite early recognition of resource problems on the
Peoples Gas side of the work, the Company was not able to make up for the lack of progress there.
e. Craft Training
Mechanics must complete four training courses (involving 168 classroom training hours) and four
years of on-the-job training and experience to become fully qualified. The next table summarizes
training and time requirements.

As discussed earlier in this chapter, a new program covering “utility workers” now exists. The
program resulted from collaboration with the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) – Local
18007, the UWUA Power for America Training Trust Fund, and the City Colleges of Chicago.
The program has an affiliation with the Utility Workers Military Assistance Program. This
program assists veterans to transform their military occupational skills into natural gas industry
career opportunities. The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (“DCEO”)
acts as a program funding partner.
Participation in the utility worker program condenses much of the training that otherwise takes 10
to 12 years of skills development and safety training courses. A recently developed, full-time
student program has a seven-month duration. Training covers all types of work, including the
installation of mains, which contractors now perform. Instructors consist mostly of former Peoples
Gas supervisors or lead craft workers.
Service veterans predominate among the students. That composition makes the group generally
disciplined and committed. Peoples Gas guarantees graduates entry into the apprentice program.
Assigned to mentors, apprentices ride with mentors as part of on-the-job training. The mentors
evaluate readiness for entry into the permanent workforce at the end of 180 days. One measure of
the program’s success is that only two students have failed to make the program to date.
Students can earn 52 Associate’s degree credits. Graduates receive a Gas Utility Worker Advanced
Certification from a City College of Chicago. The program has produced some 150 graduates; 90
have accepted Peoples Gas employment offers. Mid-2014 enrollment included 19 students on track
for summer graduation, with 25 more scheduled to begin studies at that time.
f. Engineering and Inspection Resources
Engineering and construction inspectors comprise the two largest groups that support work in the
field. Neither group has resource plans. Neither do the other support work groups, such as planners
and quality inspectors.
i. Engineering
Management supporting AMRP work describes its role as a reactive one. Liberty’s observations
confirm this view, with engineering reacting to near-term demand without a plan or a
comprehensive grasp on current or future resource status and needs. We could not glean from
discussions with engineering management a firm grasp on longer-term work demands.
Management cited City requirements changes and schedule, as opposed to resource-driven
planning, as major sources of uncertainty in identifying workloads. Engineering thus has used
reliance on contractors when needed. An effort is reportedly underway to lay out skill sets, training

requirements, an appropriate mix of engineers and designers, and the most effective balance of
internal and external resource mix. It has yet to produce conclusions or resulting plans.
Engineering currently has five openings. Filling them has become an issue. Reportedly, the
pending acquisition of Integrys reduced authorizations to fill the five openings to only three.
The Company uses a rotation program to enhance its ability to fill engineering positions. The
program provides the Company’s Illinois-based engineers with the opportunity to develop
technical skills and expanding knowledge, while providing cross-functional business exposure.
Engineers receive hands-on experience in key business areas, such as Distribution/Design, Field
Operations Shops & Operator Qualification (“OQ”) Training, Compliance, and the Centralized
Planning Process. The Company’s individual performance management program provides twice
yearly reviews involving General Managers and Senior Leaders from Peoples Gas, North Shore
Gas, and Integrys Business Services – Gas Engineering and Gas Supply. Rotation assignments
offered as part of the performance management program consider employee performance, length
of time in current assignments, past rotation assignments, and business needs in identifying
rotation opportunities. There also exists a succession plan for key positions in the engineering
organization, but none for the Project Management Office.
ii. Construction Inspectors
Six major contractors are installing mains and services for Peoples Gas. Construction inspectors
should play a significant role in maintaining production levels and in ensuring schedule adherence.
They should also ensure quality work. Liberty’s field visits confirmed that the construction
inspectors do conduct their work in furtherance of these needs. The program’s approach of
targeting one inspector per contractor work crew (of eight members) comprises a sound approach.
Peoples Gas has difficulty, however, in filling the vacant construction inspector positions. The
current inspector complement is 19 and there exist 16 open positions. Assigning one inspector per
contractor work crew reflects a new approach. Inspectors have major construction supervision
responsibilities. It takes time to select candidates with appropriate qualifications and experiences.
Each inspector undergoes a reasonably thorough training program. Training includes two weeks
of field shadowing and two months of classroom work. Class work includes modules such as
Company procedures, as-built drawing accuracy verification, fusion work (making plastic pipe
connections), and work orders, for example. Peoples Gas largely draws from a pool of its retired
craftsmen or foremen.

3. Conclusions
I.1

The AMRP lacks the long-term resource plan required for optimizing long-term
program performance. (Recommendations I.1 and I.6)

A program like the AMRP requires resource plans defined by skill for each organization critical
to production and to construction support. Peoples Gas has no resource plans. Some short-term
planning occurs. Even that planning, however, confines itself to main and installation work
performed by contractors and the work performed in the field by Peoples Gas crews. Other support
groups, such as engineering and construction inspection, do not appear to use any resource
planning, either short-term or long-term. One result has been understaffing.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter I: Resource Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The Company agrees that it needs long- and short-term resource plans, and that it needs to monitor
performance against them. Company initiatives developed since discussions began last September
between Liberty and executive management call for redefining the program organization structure,
and populating it with resources identified through structured resource plans.
Peoples Gas also needs to address immediately its shortages of engineering and construction
inspectors. The current practice of performing quality inspections of one contractor per quarter on
gas main replacement, service installation, anode installation, cathodic protection, and directional
boring does not serve sufficiently to ensure contractor quality. An enhanced contractor quality
inspection program will thus also impose additional resource requirements.
I.2

Consistent with the overall AMRP strategy, the Company’s short-term resource
plans make an appropriate overall assignment of contractor and employee roles, but
do not properly identify internal personnel to install meters and contractors to
perform main replacement, service installation, and ground restoration.
(Recommendations I.1, I.3, I.5, I.6, and I.7)

AMRP resource plans must identify where the utility will use external and internal personnel. The
strategy the utility used to define the overall roles of contractors and internal resources is
appropriate for the short-term. However, changes in resource availability in the future may leave
the Company in a reactive mode. Peoples Gas cannot rely exclusively on the short-term plans to
accommodate future circumstances.
Failure to develop more substantial levels of internal workers skilled in replacing mains and
installing services will force near total reliance on contractors for the life of the AMRP. Should
the future bring a tighter market for resources (as more utilities accelerate replacement programs)
a lack of internal resources will threaten completion of the AMRP on the current overall schedule.
Increased competition in the industry for resources may also pose cost escalation risk.
I.3

The AMRP lacks a structured and analytical approach to determining optimum
resource allocation. (Recommendations I.1 and I.6)

The AMRP should, but does not, base optimum resource allocation on study and analysis of factors
such as wage rates, productivity, work quality, and resource availability. Peoples Gas presently
does not have the capability to perform such studies. Liberty expects that some capable managers
have sufficient familiarity with the operations to perform such analysis effectively. Current limits
with respect to data, however, would make any such analysis ineffective. The Company needs to
begin developing this capability, and to support it through improvement in data quality and
completeness.
I.4

Resource plans do not consider overtime use and multiple shifts as a strategy for the
internal workforce; Peoples Gas regards overtime for lump sum or unit price
contractors as irrelevant. (Recommendation I.1)

AMRP resource plans do not include a strategy for planned use of overtime, and, where
appropriate, shift work. Workload should be translated into work-hours. A sound process for
optimizing resource allocation must consider the internal workforce’s straight time hours, its

May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter I: Resource Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

overtime hours, and contractor hours. Failing to capture and use contractor work-hours, even under
lump-sum and unit-price contracts, foregoes a valuable resource management tool.
I.5

Peoples Gas’ current resource plan assumes, probably correctly in the short-term,
that there is no contractor resource availability problem, but relying on that
assumption for the longer term is risky, as main replacement programs extend across
the industry. (Recommendations I.2 and I.6)

Resource plans should address how suitable staffing will be ensured long term. The next two charts
show that the internal workforce is only going to perform about 10 percent of the work over a span
of 20 years. The consensus within Peoples Gas is that contractor availability will never be a
problem. However, Liberty believes that growth in demand for contractor resources (as natural gas
use expands due to fundamental changes in price competitiveness and as other utilities tackle the
massive amount of leak-prone pipe remaining in the industry) creates a real risk over time.

Chart I.8: Cumulative AMRP Resource Allocations

I.6

Current, short-term resource planning considers craft and engineering training.
(Recommendations I.1 and I.6)

AMRP resource plans also need to address key training and development needs. Short-term
training needs are considered. When the Company develops long-term resource plans, it must
consider training and development needs. The replenishing of retired craftsmen provides one
crucial piece of information in the resource planning process. Trainee ability and speed to develop
into full-fledged operation qualified mechanics are also important factors to be monitored and
managed.
I.7

Current resource plans do not consider rising productivity, or monitor overall
program productivity. (Recommendation I.4)

The long duration of the AMRP makes it important to use productivity assumptions that match
program phases, and that target improvement over time. Peoples Gas is developing a new AMRP
Total Cost Estimate using a Planning and Forecasting Model under development. The model must
incorporate rising productivity into the estimate. Likewise, the resource planning tool that the
newly hired resource manager is charged with developing should take the expected rising
productivity into consideration in future resource planning.

4. Recommendations
I.1

Peoples Gas should develop a long-term resource staffing plan that reflects the
numbers, skills, and experience needs of all key positions. (Conclusions I.1, I.2, I.3,
I.4, and I.6)

The Company’s long-term staffing plan should take into consideration workload demand, labor
supply, attrition, retirement, training, and productivity. To ensure the adequacy of resources
needed to complete AMRP work efficiently and timely, Peoples Gas needs to consider the merits
of integrating planning and scheduling resources and processes.

May 5, 2015

Page I-11

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter I: Resource Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The Company should create and use a workforce planning model that integrates workforce
demographics, training requirements, resource acquisitions, attritions, expected retirements, and
productivity variations. Such a model should have the capability to match these essential
determinants with short-term and long-term workloads for planning, scheduling, estimating, and
performance measurement purposes.
Peoples Gas is presently undertaking a long-term personnel planning effort intended to define
resource requirements over the life of AMRP. This effort also seeks to optimize the balance
between internal and external resources. The effort should identify core competence, transition,
development, training, and recruiting needs.
I.2

Peoples Gas should develop the in-house capability to replace gas mains and install
services on a larger and more long-term basis. (Conclusion I.5)

Contractor availability has been sufficient so far to meet AMRP needs. Longer term planning needs
to consider that many other utilities and their regulators face large inventories of high-risk pipe
and long (some extraordinarily so) durations for eliminating them. The contractor availability
situation can change materially and perhaps rapidly. The contractor workforces are facing a similar
aging problem as well. That is why developing internal skills is important.
Peoples Gas should move toward increasing the use of internal resources for main and service
installations. One model to use as a planning basis might be to set a target (e.g., up to one quarter)
of baseline AMRP work to be performed by the internal workforce. Working gradually towards
that goal would allow the Company to verify that there are no adverse work cost or quality
implications. Doing so would also provide some protection against potentially diminished
contractor availability. It would also address more generally (i.e., outside the strict confines of the
AMRP) the need for sustaining suitably trained and capable resources in the wake of turnover in
the current workforce.
Transitioning to such greater use of internal resources could begin, for example, under a structure
that divides work as follows:
 For individual projects or phases of a project less than 1,000 ft. in length, assign to internal
workforce
 For medium projects or phases of a project between 1,000 ft. to 4,000 ft. in length, award
the work to the blanket contractors
 For large projects or phases of a project above 4,000 ft. in length, award the work to the
major contractors via competitive bidding.
Initially, internal workforce performance may not be as strong as that of contractors, but a paced
implementation of this approach, accompanied by close measurement of both internal and
contractor performance, can serve to determine whether internal resources can perform
competitively. This approach will also require some initial investment in vehicles and equipment
and supporting personnel. Beginning modestly, monitoring employee/contractor performance
carefully, and gauging how demand on contractors and their ability to respond are changing with
time, however, will enhance the capability to deal with future threats to contractor availability,
while working toward development of the resource capabilities necessary to address current,
graying workforce issues more generally.

I.3

Chapter I: Resource Planning

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should act immediately to address the need for sufficient internal
resources to perform back end AMRP work as planned and scheduled. (Conclusion
I.2)

Conditions experienced in 2014 with respect to work such as meter installation need to be avoided
in the future. Meter installation is less affected by weather than are main replacements and ground
restoration. Performance information at the shop level made it apparent that production started to
lag as early as March. Peoples Gas was unable to perform sufficient actions to correct performance
lags, despite regular attention to the matter by all three Shops.
I.4

Peoples Gas should bring enhanced productivity measurement and management to
resource planning. (Conclusion I.7)

As noted in a number of this report’s chapters, Peoples Gas has focused on production quantities,
and not on the resources it is using to produce them. It is important to evaluate regularly and
accurately the relationships between what is produced (output) and what has been used (input).
This key metric can readily warn of AMRP program overruns.
Liberty examined a sampling of completed projects. The sample included 102 projects or phases
of a project. Peoples Gas needs to monitor productivity in installing the three major AMRP
components; i.e., mains, services, and meters. The Company must, of course, know its cost
performance in retiring mains. The charts below show program results to date, and provide an
example of how the Company needs to monitor these unit costs.
Chart I.9: Installation Productivity Measures

These charts show the kinds of unit cost observations that require analysis and may, depending on
the root causes for them, also require corrective actions. For example:

Mains installed: overrun of 25 percent
Services installed: underrun of 7 percent
Meters installed: close to par, with a 4 percent underrun
Main retired: overrun of 63 percent.

The sample size is small, but the exercise illustrates the importance of monitoring unit costs. Such
metrics also have substantial importance in providing solid information for current efforts
(focusing so far on developing a new cost model) to produce a comprehensive and credible forecast
of final program costs.
I.5

Peoples Gas should more closely monitor contractor resources and production.
(Conclusion I.2)

The Company should analyze every completed project or phase of a project to understand the rootcause of cost growth. This report describes elsewhere the importance of such analysis for cost
management purposes. Here, its importance is in supporting sound assumptions about future
resource requirements.
Peoples Gas must require contractors to report work-hours, even for unit cost or lump-sum
contracts. First of all, calculation of safety metrics requires the information. It will enable the
analysts to undertake wage range analysis and comparison. The work-hours will give the
supervisors a greater sense of workload size. Managers will have increased ability to foresee where
and by how much the schedule will suffer, should contractors put inadequate numbers of workers
on the job.
I.6

Peoples Gas should establish a centralized resource planning group or function.
(Conclusions I.1, I.2, I.3, I.5, and I.6)

Resource planning comprises a major and important function. The AMRP needs a group of
planners with sophisticated skills. Peoples Gas should centralize this function:
 To analyze workload demands and coordinate the labor supply
 To evaluate the proper mix between internal workforce, overtime, and contractors
 To maintain the resource planning model mentioned in Recommendation I.1
 To recommend staffing strategies, crew allocation, contractor management, and timing of
training requirements.
I.7

Peoples Gas should evaluate regularly the performance (e.g., wage rates, quality,
productivity, expertise, safety, dependability) of the internal and external workforce.
(Conclusion I.2)

Liberty understands the performance of internal workforce and contractors cannot be compared on
a completely equal footing. Comparisons nevertheless need to be made, in order to optimize
resource alignment. Bigger projects having greater lengths of main replacement generally have a
cost advantage. If contractors offer more specialized services, they have an advantage that can lead
to greater productivity. On the other hand, the internal work crews should be more familiar with
the procedures and facilities and may bring a greater sense of “ownership,” which can produce a
quality advantage. As long as work differences are understood, the insights gained from

comparison will be important in any rebalancing of work that leads to the use of internal resources
for moderate portions of main and service installation in the future.

Chapter J: Scope Control

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chapter J: Scope Control
1. Background
This chapter evaluates the approach, processes, and activities for controlling the scope of work
included in the AMRP.
Project managers generally recognize control of scope as a primary challenge on large, long
duration programs and projects. Loss of scope containment often drives extensive cost overruns
and long schedule extensions.
From a cost engineering perspective, the term “scope changes” has a narrow meaning. Changes
under this definition generally involve items like design changes, adding of equipment and
components, introduction of new project requirements, or expansion of project processes. For
purposes of this report, Liberty has treated the subject of scope change more broadly. Liberty’s
review considered any deviation from the project plan, other than performance or execution, that
has an influence on program cost or schedule.
Effective control of scope requires a process of early identification of potential changes, definition
of cost and schedule impacts, analysis of possible alternates, and an associated decision-making
process. Given the risk of growth on a large, complex project, such a control system comprises a
major priority.

2. Findings
a. Overview
The best performing organizations emphasize the control of scope at all levels of management.
Implementing procedures tend towards more, rather than less comprehensive processes. An
important source illustrates the industry standard for project management. The “Project
Management Body of Knowledge” (“PMBOK”) affords Project Scope Management a full chapter
of its own.
Liberty found scope control of the AMRP lacking. Liberty’s work disclosed no apparent processes
or controls in place. Peoples Gas appears to view scope control as a contract administration
challenge. Program management directs scope control activities at contractor requests for contract
changes. Such attention to the contract process must form one important element of control.
Changes in the overall program dimensions, processes, and requirements have broad significance
as well, however. Contractor changes, significant in their own right, measure in the tens of millions
of dollars per year. By comparison, changes at the program level can (and did) amount to billions
of dollars.
The lack of a program-wide view of scope and scope management therefore represents a significant
issue. The original program estimate has grown from $2.63 billion in 2010 to $4.45 billion in 2012.
The new estimate, planned for 2015, will very likely exceed 2012’s $4.45 billion. Management
reports that much of the growth to date has resulted from scope changes, including changes in
work methods, program requirements, and expanded program management.

Chapter J: Scope Control

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

b. AMRP Scope Control at the Program Level
Liberty inquired about AMRP scope control on a number of occasions. The first inquiry requested
“any AMRP processes intended to control scope.” Peoples Gas responded by providing flow charts
of the field processes associated with contract change requests, including reviews and approvals
of them. This response focused solely on contract administration challenges, but not the program
as a whole.
A second, more direct Liberty request sought, “the process by which scope is controlled at (a) the
AMRP program level and (b) individual project levels.” The full response to this question was:
“Overall program scope is well defined and controlled via the five year plans and
subsequent updates. Public Improvement Projects are also taken into account. Installation
quantity is reconciled annually against remaining quantity to adjust plans for subsequent
years.”
This response provides an important foundation for Liberty’s concern about the lack of a process
for program level scope control. This process should include at a minimum:
 A formal process for the identification of proposed changes as soon as possible
 A formal process for management review of:
o Proposed changes
o Impact on cost and schedule
o Reasons why the changes are necessary
o Alternates to consider in lieu of or to mitigate the proposed changes
 A formal approval process whereby:
o Management approves defined changes and the associated funding
o Those changes get incorporated into program controls, such as budgets and schedules
 A formal reporting process that provides for tracking such changes and managing them to
the approved levels
 Adjustment of program cost forecasts to reflect the changes.
Liberty did not find these elements in its AMRP review. Liberty has not before seen a case where
a significant project or program lacked a formal scope control program to support oversight and
control.
c. Scope Control of Individual AMRP Projects
Scope control at the project level also limits itself to contracts only. This approach does not
comport with good practice. Peoples Gas reports that “at the individual project level, scope is
controlled via enforcement of the contract documents.” Control of contract documents has clear
importance, but does not alone provide a meaningful scope control system. Addressing changes in
project scope only when and as proposed for inclusion in a contract document comes too late.
Prompt identification of changes comprises an essential ingredient of effective scope control,
allowing management timely control over how the change proceeds. Awaiting a contract document
delays this process by months or more, surfacing issues only after work completion, or, at least,
when the ability to avoid or mitigate the impact of change has become diminished or lost.

3. Conclusions
J.1

The AMRP has not operated to date under an effective scope control program.
(Recommendation J.1)

Liberty found concerns with AMRP project-level scope control on two levels. First, the focus on
contracts obscures management visibility with respect to changes originated through other means.
For example, changes made in engineering often require incorporation into bid documents.
Contract change controls will not identify them. Second, the time delay between a change and its
evolution into the contract change process eliminates the possibility that it can be analyzed and
mitigated.
A program like the AMRP requires a formal set of processes for the control of scope at the program
and at the individual project levels. Scope control processes should focus on the early identification
of potential changes, structured evaluation of the need for them, determination of their schedule
impacts, and alternatives for addressing the needs underlying them. A proper hierarchy of required
approval levels should exist.
The AMRP lacks these scope control attributes, instead maintaining that control of contractor
change requests is sufficient. The narrow approach that AMRP management has taken does not
comport with program needs or with Liberty’s experience in the industry.
Liberty found no scope control processes at the overall program level. Some scope control
processes do exist at the project level, but Liberty did not find them sufficient. The AMRP does
seek to control scope at the project level, but only when changes directly affect a field contract.
Other project-related changes (those not associated with an already-executed contract) do not face
scope control processes. Also, by definition, changes associated with an already-executed contract
may not come to management’s attention until after options for addressing them are substantially
restricted, if not gone entirely.
At the program level, scope changes may have been included and partially documented in cost
estimate updates. Liberty, however, found no indication that they underwent analysis and approval
processes.

4. Recommendations
J.1

AMRP management should promptly design and implement a two-pronged scope
control process: (a) at the program level, and (b) at the individual project level.
(Conclusion J.1)

Scope control processes should contain, at a minimum, the following features:
 A baseline definition of scope: The program master plan should frame this process,
supported by associated documents such as estimates and schedules. The baseline scope
serves as a control foundation only if well documented. The documentation must define
underlying assumptions completely and include them in the plan.
 A process for prompt identification of proposed changes: Chapter K: Cost Estimating
proposes a cost trend report. Those proposing or discovering potential changes air them

promptly. Immediate publication of proposed changes does not wait for details, cost
estimates, or other, detailed supporting information. The process places a priority on
prompt identification, so that management, if it chooses, can intervene before significant
time passes, and options diminish.
Technical analysis of proposed changes: Effective control requires an objective
evaluation of proposed changes. Proposed changes often come in proposals by
organizations with a high level of technical expertise. Proposals through an authoritative
voice can tend to cause others to take them as “given.” Providing for technical analysis by
a third party of commensurate stature supports sound analysis and alternative
identification, which enables best-informed decision-making.
Cost and schedule impact of proposed changes: Cost engineering personnel must
evaluate changes for cost and schedule impact, and report them to management.
Sponsoring organizations often underestimate these impacts. They either lack the ability to
estimate them, or do not have awareness of the full implications that proposed changes may
have for the project involved. Full and correct identification of the impact may lead to
withdrawal of a proposed change. Even if a change occurs, management should understand
impacts fully before allowing a change to proceed.
Documentation of management’s decision-making process: Scope changes often serve
as a principal driver of project cost increases. Management needs to be tasked with
demonstrating that it handled such changes prudently. Making a full and complete record
of management’s actions when learning of the proposed change and of management’s
considerations in approving the change supports such demonstration.

Chapter K: Cost Estimating
1. Background
Chapter G: Cost Planning addressed longer term AMRP cost planning. This chapter, focuses on
more near-term cost estimating. It:
 Describes the organization and resources dedicated to cost estimating
 Addresses the procedures and guidelines that apply to cost estimating
 Assesses the types of cost estimates produced
 Evaluates the tools and data sources used to produce and evaluate estimates
 Examines how management uses contingency to reflect uncertainty in project cost
estimates
 Addresses the sufficiency of measures for reconciling estimated to actual costs.
Managing a program such as the AMRP requires current, comprehensive, and reasonably accurate
cost estimates at the individual project level and at the program level. The primary function of cost
estimating is to provide a standard or baseline for control and for managing performance. Meeting
this critical need requires credible and rigorously executed estimating processes and outputs. Lack
of a strong cost estimating capability creates a major impediment to effective cost management.
A comprehensive cost estimate starts with scope definition based on engineering design,
quantities, required materials, labor costs based on past performance or productivity, overhead cost
to account for all the supporting personnel, and contingency to account for shorter range
uncertainties at the project level and longer range uncertainties at the overall AMRP level across
its long duration.
Good estimating capability requires experienced cost estimators. They must have the capability
and experience to visualize particular projects at a detailed level, understand direct and indirect
requirements, identify comparable cost elements from previous similar projects, and adjust them
for anticipated new conditions. The data sources for cost estimate development require regular
updating and careful maintenance. Updating should occur at least annually and on a structured,
comprehensive basis. Key inputs include historical productivity rates. An accessible and current
cost performance database should contain historical data. Cost per foot of main, cost per service,
and cost per meter installed provide examples of such data.
An effective cost estimating capability enables the following benefits:
 It provides managers a valid baseline to monitor productivity (measurement of
accomplishments in relation to expected expenditures)
 It enables managers to receive early warning of potential project issues, thus supporting
timely corrective actions
 It supports timely assessment of and response to changing conditions and emerging cost
trends
 It can provide a final AMRP program cost estimate regularly updated and possessing a
suitable level of confidence.
In summary, a credible estimate establishes a standard of performance that forms the basis for
effective management of the work.

2. Findings
a. Cost Estimating Procedures and Guidelines
No formal written guidelines or procedures exist to describe the AMRP cost estimating process.
Project Management Office leadership justified absence of such guidelines, stating that the fairly
straightforward nature of estimating makes establishing procedures a low priority. Liberty believes
that an “anybody can do it” attitude makes consistent and credible estimating unlikely. Cost
accuracy gaps that result from undisciplined estimating threaten effective capital program
management generally. A disciplined approach has even more relevance in managing a multidecade, multi-billion dollar, multi-project program like the AMRP.
b. Cost Estimating Function
No dedicated organization performs AMRP cost estimating. The AMRP Cost Manager has
responsibility for coordination and completion of individual project estimates and yearly budget
estimates. The AMRP had no full-time cost estimator in its early years. Only after Liberty’s review
started did the Project Management Office hire a full-time cost estimator from outside Integrys.
Even after this hire, the organization misplaced the estimator by locating the position in the
Contract Management Organization. Estimating must encompass a much more pervasive scope
and set of responsibilities than those associated with contract management. Contract management
is a critical component of AMRP project success, but a narrow one when all needs are considered.
Estimating involves much more than contract management. It must operate in the broad context of
all the interrelated activities that affect cost.
Section 3.3 of the Project Execution Plan, established at the inception of the AMRP, envisioned
that cost estimating responsibility would begin with the engineering function. The Plan, however,
anticipated a fairly promptly transfer (by the fourth quarter of 2011) to a project controls group.
The transfer would occur as the Project Management Office developed its needed resources. The
primary cost estimating responsibilities defined by the Project Execution Plan include:
 Perform cost estimating and management to meet design‐to‐cost objectives
 Develop a comprehensive cost estimating model for management of design, and provide
alternate summary level cost data
 Perform detailed estimating for each project phase and work request
 Update cost estimating assemblies and templates at least annually
 Update Work Management Information System labor units costs ($/hour) annually (by the
Work and Asset Management team).
These intentions demonstrate that the Project Management Office contemplated the use of a
professional cost estimating group, a formal cost estimating model, and annual updates of unit
rates. Each of these factors form important elements of effective cost estimating, and in turn cost
management. Peoples Gas has not, however, executed the original intentions, even after several
years of AMRP operation. The Project Management Office Director explained the delay by citing
an original intent to transition the estimating function from Engineering to Project Controls “as
resources allow.” Failure to act in accord with the program’s early intentions with respect to
estimating has set the AMRP back. The failure to follow through effectively meant that
management treated AMRP estimating as it would other, less intensive, shorter-term work.

c. Types of Cost Estimates
The AMRP uses three types of cost estimates.
The first type, the Preliminary Cost Estimate, covers an entire project or individual phases of
projects that extend across longer time durations. These preliminary estimates emerge in a
project’s first stages. They come after the issuance of estimates of main and service work
quantities. The design organization provides those quantity inputs. These installation quantities go
into the Contractor Cost Estimating Template, sorted by size. Those responsible for estimating
multiply these quantities by their corresponding, pre-determined unit rates. These historical unit
rates vary with the range of available installation methods. Principal types of such methods include
street open cuts, parkway open cuts, sidewalk open cuts, curb line open cuts, parkway directional
bores, and sidewalk directional bores. Management has not kept this Contractor Cost Estimating
Template up to date. It continues to use 2012 dollars. Following development of a contractor cost
estimate, Peoples Gas adds 29 percent (a historically derived amount) to account for metering
installation and other transfer costs. Management updates this adder annually. The Work
Management Information System requires the development of these types of project cost estimates.
The second estimate type, the Final Cost Estimate, can also cover an entire project or phases of
larger projects. Following completion of design, the Project Management Office sends bid
invitations to contractors pre-authorized to bid on the work package. The value of the awarded
contractor’s bid becomes the estimate of construction costs. By this stage, clearing accounts have
served to charge all engineering and support costs to the project. Material costs also become
available. Peoples Gas applies a factor equal to 38 percent of these contractor costs (again using
historical experience as a guide) to cover construction labor for back end work performed by
internal Peoples Gas crews. Examples of such work include installation of meters and regulators
and transfer of services to new facilities. Management updates this factor annually. This Project
Cost Estimate guides the process of securing management approval to proceed with the
construction of particular projects.
The third estimate type, the Three-year Spending Budget Cost Estimate, serves budgeting
purposes. Peoples Gas began the use of three-year spending budgets following institution of the
Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge. This three-year budget thus includes more than the
AMRP. For each of the three years covered, two major categories of work apply; i.e., AMRP and
non-AMRP. Estimated amounts for AMRP main installation work for 2014, 2015 and 2016
include multiple phases of three major neighborhood projects. The estimated amounts for the next
three years include Portage Park (Phases 1 to 10), South Austin (Phases 5 to 7, 9, 10 to 14), and
South Shore (Phases 6 to 7, 10, 12 to 25). Estimates also exist for some High Pressure Project
work for the next three years. Peoples Gas began these Budget Cost Estimates with estimates by
the design group of the quantities of mains installed and retired, services installed, services retired,
meters, low pressure to medium presume vault retirements, and high pressure to medium pressure
vault installations. The design group provided this information by year and by phase for these three
neighborhood projects. The Company added (again using historical experience) a 25 percent
management reserve to each construction cost category, in order to arrive at an estimated AMRP
budget. The total budget amounts of AMRP and non-AMRP are identified separately.

d. Cost Estimating Tools
The Project Management Office has not produced a cost estimate at the program level (i.e., AMRP
wide across its full duration) in about three years. It has intentions of doing so now, but, as
described earlier in this report, it has delayed a new estimate. Management cited the need to
develop the capability to model costs sufficiently well to support such an estimate as the reason
for the delay.
The AMRP does develop estimates at the project level for annual budgeting purposes. The Cost
Estimating Template, an Excel spreadsheet, serves as the basic tool for supporting estimate
development. The following illustration provides a copy of this template. As observed in a number
of other cases, it assumed 2012 unit pricing levels.

e. Data Sources
Compatible Units form an important element in comprehensive and consistent project cost
estimating. These planning tools identify meaningful assemblies of material items, and associate
them with labor and equipment requirements. The Project Management Office has not updated the
materials portion of the compatible units in more than three years. Management cited resource
shortages as the source of this long delay. Design engineers use a variety of factors to account for
material cost inaccuracies that have become known.
Support costs also form an important part of effective cost estimating. The Company’s financial
system allocates the costs of supporting organizations on a monthly basis to active projects. The
AMRP cost manager adds other overhead costs. Historical information (updated annually) serves
as a guide for determining these overhead costs.
As discussed above, the construction cost portion of estimates uses costs as proposed by the
contractor awarded work on the project. Program management has confidence in this approach,
because bids from all the qualified bidders tend to have spanned a fairly tight range. However,
Peoples Gas does not require the contractors, who perform generally under lump-sum or unit-rate
contracts, to supply information traditionally used to monitor and manage performance (e.g., workhours, crew size, worker skill levels). Therefore, program management does not accumulate the
information needed to assess independently contractor progress or effectiveness in managing work
underway.
f. Contingency
The AMRP does not provide for contingency at the program level. The program does apply
contingency for annual budgeting purposes, creating a funding reserve to cover contractor
overruns. Those overruns result principally from contract change orders that must receive Peoples
Gas approval.
g. Cost Estimate Reconciliation
The AMRP estimating process does not include a feature that incorporates follow-up analysis of
actual costs. Such a feature would enable management to validate the quality of estimating
methods, understand the drivers of unexpected cost increases, and address the nature and extent of
those drivers. Examples of such cost drivers include scope growth, quantity changes, schedule
delays, interferences, and productivity variances. In discussing initiatives to improve program
management and oversight with Liberty, senior Project Management Office leadership cited
imminent completion of a study performed to reconcile actual costs to project estimates. Liberty
has not yet had an opportunity to evaluate the depth and quality of this study, or to determine what
changes the organization plans to make upon analysis of the study results.

3. Conclusions
K.1

The AMRP cost estimating process is fragmented and lacking in attributes key to its
use as an effective basis for measuring AMRP work. (Recommendation K.1)

Each project estimate essentially consists of three different parts provided by personnel from three
separate groups:
May 5, 2015

Page K-5
The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter K: Cost Estimating

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

1. The design engineer normally estimates engineering and materials costs
2. The manager of the Cost Management Group adds overhead costs, which include the
monthly allocation of charges from the personnel of all the supporting organizations
3. The Change Management Group provides the estimated construction costs, based on the
awarded bid of the selected contractor.
A primary purpose of a cost estimate is to provide a valid cost monitoring base. The current AMRP
approach tends to actualize the engineering costs, focus essentially only on the contractor bids,
and rely on the expectation that time charges by Peoples Gas employees will fall in line with the
historical assumptions used. The AMRP cost estimates developed have limited consistency, and
do not promote confidence with respect to their use in providing effective cost management of
individual AMRP projects.
K.2

Data underlying the compatible units used to perform cost estimates do not have
sufficient reliability, given the lack of regular updating. (Recommendations K.2 and
K.5)

Data sources used in estimate development need to be maintained and updated at least annually.
Design engineers try to compensate for the failure to do so in different ways and degrees when
performing AMRP work. Continuing to use 2012 contractor unit cost pricing for the Cost
Estimating Template reflects another weakness, and supports the need for creating a dedicated cost
estimating group to compile and analyze actual data of a repetitive nature.
K.3

There presently do not exist cost estimating capabilities effective to meet AMRP
needs. (Recommendations K.1 and K.5)

No formal, written cost estimating guidelines or procedures exist. The cost estimating skills of the
individuals preparing estimates vary significantly. In the absence of formal procedures and
training, the quality of project estimates developed also vary greatly. The recent hiring of the first
professional cost estimator for a program of this size reflects recognition of the need for
improvement. One estimator will not prove sufficient, however, given the size, scope, and duration
of the AMRP.
K.4

Peoples Gas does not perform cost estimate reconciliations to understand and to deal
with cost deviations, or to capture lessons learned. (Recommendation K.3)

The Project Management Office does not undertake any structured analysis seeking to reconcile
cost estimates with actual costs. Such analysis is necessary to secure understanding of why project
actuals vary from expectations. Analyzing the sources of variances supports the identification of
root causes, which management can then use to identify corrective actions.
AMRP management appears to consider the change management process governing contractor
requests for costs increases sufficient to justify cost increases. This approach does not conform to
best practice. Reconciling estimated and actual costs, even for fixed-price or unit cost contracts,
comprises an important element in optimizing costs. Knowing what drives contractor costs is
central to judging increase requests and to developing cost estimates for future work.

Liberty accepts program management’s assertion that weekly field progress review meetings give
an opportunity for lessons to be learned and to be incorporated into the planning and performance
of future work. However, a systematic and programmatic approach to reconciliation on an annual
basis will make the analysis more insightful, and promote a cost control culture and awareness
among all contributors.
K.5

The current cost estimating practice focuses on individual projects for the purpose of
annual budgeting; as Peoples Gas recognizes, it has not had the capability to create
(and therefore has not produced) a cost estimate at the AMRP program level.
(Recommendation K.4)

The Company acknowledged this gap as far back as September 2014, and has been working since,
assisted by outside resources, to develop the modeling capability necessary to produce such an
estimate.

4. Recommendations
K.1

Peoples Gas should establish a cost estimating capability by formulating a clearly
communicated cost estimating philosophy, formalizing a cost estimating process,
preparing procedures, and developing effective tools. (Conclusions K.1 and K. 3)

Liberty and the Company began discussing planned initiatives to address central program
management, control, and oversight needs last September. Peoples Gas has stated that actions to
address this recommendation are underway. The urgency of addressing program cost, however,
needs to be underscored, in order to accelerate the pace of implementation. Those efforts would
be materially advanced by securing the services of outside, professional cost estimators (two or
more for a period of approximately six months) to develop a programmatic approach, define
processes and procedures, and provide training to those individuals performing cost estimates in
the new organization that Peoples Gas plans to manage the AMRP.
K.2

Peoples Gas should maintain and keep updated a set of historical databases that
address cost estimating variables. (Conclusion K.2)

Historical data should be collected and analyzed for at least the following key variables: installed
quantities, unit costs, wage rates of craft workers, productivity, and the ratio of installed to retired
pipe. Productivity information should include at least number of work-hours per mile of main
installed, number of work-hours per service installed, number of work-hours per meter moved.
Comprehensive and current information about these variables will improve the quality of future
cost estimates at the individual project level. The information will also supply valid data for the
cost model being designed and constructed to forecast final AMRP costs.
K.3

Peoples Gas should perform project cost estimate reconciliations to understand major
cost deviations, analyze performance and document lessons learned. (Conclusion K.4)

This information will improve the ability of construction supervision to manage cost effectively
by taking appropriate actions to improve performance.

K.4

Chapter K: Cost Estimating

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should expand the development of cost estimates at the individual project
level and at the program level. (Conclusion K.5)

Following sound development of cost estimates for individual projects, management can develop
projected AMRP final costs in a bottom-up fashion. Improved costs estimates will permit easier
and prompter detection of cost deviations at the project level. More effective and timely
identification and execution of responsive actions and initiatives can then occur.
K.5

Peoples Gas should establish a centralized cost estimating organization to maintain
and sharpen the cost estimating skills. (Conclusions K.2 and K.3)

The capabilities of estimate preparers fundamentally drive cost estimate quality. The recent hire
of one cost estimator takes a first step, but not one that can prove sufficient by itself. Too much
work remains to establish sound estimating, and then to continue executing it through the course
of the AMRP. It will particularly take more resources to support the cost model being developed
to restore the ability to forecast final AMRP program costs credibly.
Peoples Gas needs to hire at least one more cost estimator and one cost estimating supervisor to
oversee the cost estimating activities required to support the AMRP appropriately. The new
supervisor should report to the AMRP cost management director (a position discussed
subsequently, in Chapter L: Cost Management).

Chapter L: Cost Management
1. Background
This chapter:
 Describes how management defines and approaches cost management and the management
of AMRP costs
 Assesses the structure and content of the program through which management addresses
the management of program and of project costs
 Evaluates the sufficiency of cost management organization, and resource levels and
capabilities
 Assesses the sufficiency of AMRP cost systems and tools
 Examines the sufficiency of cost management training and support (or empowerment)
within the AMRP management organization.
Modern notions of cost management have moved well past the traditional focus on simple
collection and reporting of cost information. The traditional definition of cost management took
much more of a cost “accounting” focus. What it generally lacked was the use of a professionally
staffed cost management organization that: (a) combines cost analysis training and experience and
knowledge of the underlying work, and (b) uses those abilities to determine how to contrast
expected and actual performance to identify means for optimizing cost performance.
Best practice now involves the creation of an organization possessing substantial training and
experience in cost analysis. The organization undertakes such analysis for the purpose of
identifying how data collected about work execution suggests methods for improving efficiency
and effectiveness. Such an organization needs to:
 Know what information to collect
 Have access to systems and tools for using it
 Possess sufficient knowledge of the nature of the physical work to make sense of the data
 Have sufficient organizational “clout” to make its work both available to and valued by
program management and more senior levels of oversight
 Be continuously engaged in examining performance data, in order to identify trends,
problems, and potential solutions before adverse performance has significant negative cost
consequences.
Making the transition from the traditional, reporting-focused approach to cost management to an
action-focused one requires what Liberty terms a “holistic approach to effective cost
management.” This holistic approach begins with establishing and reinforcing the notion of cost
as a major program or project priority. As noted, it also requires the establishment of a dedicated
and experienced organization, not only to reinforce this priority, but to generate the information
and examination needed to address cost analytically and aggressively.
The holistic approach that Liberty considers particularly important for programs like the AMRP
turns in large part on recognizing and addressing the distinction between “oversight” and
“control.” The distinction highlights the different types of skill sets of the people required, their

accountabilities, and management expectations. The distinctions between cost control and
oversight include:
 Cost control is generally real-time (or in-process); cost oversight is generally after-the-fact
 Cost control is anticipatory; cost oversight is reactive
 Cost control focuses on managing costs; cost oversight focuses on reporting costs
 Cost control is integrally involved with work management and execution; cost oversight
occurs at arm’s length
 Cost control applies flexible guidelines; cost oversight more generally relies on rigid
standards
 Cost control relies on good judgment; cost oversight focuses on conformity to procedure
 Cost control emphasizes analysis of the numbers; cost oversight recapitulates the numbers.

2. Findings
a. The Focus of AMRP Cost Management
The AMRP’s Project Management Office defined cost management in the traditional way,
focusing overwhelmingly on simple budget monitoring. In other words, approaching but not
exceeding budgeted expenditures served as the main method for defining success. Consideration
of the efficiency and effectiveness of those expenditures (i.e., the physical “value” received as a
function of the dollars spent) had, at best, been secondary. Focusing on this budget-control metric
means that tracking concentrated on success in matching budgeted total expenditures; i.e., no more
and no less than that budget. The existence of an accelerated cost-recovery method (more precisely,
the limits it includes) would raise rate issues, should expenditures exceed amounts recoverable on
an accelerated basis. Spending less (again, particularly considering accelerated recovery) would
have earnings consequences.
Liberty found this simplistic approach unsuitable to AMRP goals and needs. Meeting the AMRP’s
public safety objective requires meeting production levels, whether or not they can be attained
through budgeted expenditure levels. When expenditures fail to produce those production levels,
cost management requires more than simply deferring work to the next budget period. It requires
detailed and timely analysis of means for improving cost efficiency and effectiveness, in order to
allow budgeted expenditures to produce greater production. It very frequently proves impossible
to improve efficiency enough to meet production targets within budget. Thus, the second value in
effective cost analysis comes in making informed judgements about how budgets must change to
continue to support production targets, particularly in a long-duration program such as the AMRP.
To the extent that the rate recovery structure forecloses consideration of this second search for
improvement, the safety improvement objectives of the AMRP may become compromised.
AMRP management has stated that it does consider production levels a priority, but commitment
to that priority is not clear. Liberty believes that the circumstances observed and the perspectives
offered by program personnel indicate an approach that has the following dimensions:
 Achieve the performance attainable for the fixed amounts budgeted
 Where that performance fails to meet targeted production or installation rates, rely upon
the long remaining program duration to make up the gap.

AMRP management has approached annual work by awarding more work (to contractors
performing gas main and service installations) than budgeted, while carrying over work planned
for prior years but not completed. This approach reflects the hope that the result would be to attain
the 100 miles per year target and to reduce the gap in production from prior years.
The chart below shows what AMRP management depicts as its cost management flow diagram.
The diagram shows the sources of cost information and the systems that this information feeds.
The diagram’s lack of any analytical, feedback, or corrective action cycles illustrate the focus on
cost reporting, as opposed to corrective action.

b. Managing Contractor Costs
The costs of contractors installing gas mains and services comprise a primary driver of AMRP
costs. Program management takes the view that lump-sum and unit-price approaches to contracts
for gas main and service installation mitigate the need for active cost management. This view led
to the belief that contractor costs present only a contract “administration” rather than a cost or
construction “management” challenge. AMRP management considers that contracts using fixed
or unit prices make the drivers of their costs (e.g., labor unit costs, work-hours, productivity) the
responsibility of contractors to manage. Peoples Gas does not require AMRP contractors to
provide data addressing these drivers (the same as those influencing the costs of internal Peoples
Gas resources). A broader and more appropriate view would require contractors to provide such
data. Having such information would permit AMRP management to undertake effective analysis
of field performance, evaluation of corrective actions, and forecasting of future project costs.
An example of the problem with the lack of such data came in 2014. AMRP management asked
contractors to provide schedule acceleration plans after observing that work had fallen behind early
in the construction season. Management should have had a sound set of data from which to
evaluate contractor plans and resulting impacts. As it was, the lack of data forced AMRP
management to rely much more on contractor conclusions than on its own about how to address
the need to accelerate progress.

Management prepared a lengthy Project Execution Plan (PEP) at the outset of the AMRP. Chapter
E: Plan for Management of this report discusses this Plan in more detail. The Project Execution
Plan called for a Project Controls Group to have responsibility for cost forecasting and control,

May 5, 2015

Chapter L: Cost Management

reporting, scheduling, and document control services. Some of the cost control functions that this
Plan specified reflect traditional cost control practices. Program management in 2013 split this
organization into three separate groups, focusing on cost, scheduling, and documentation control.
The Project Management Office Director made the split in order to provide better focus on what
he views as three separate functions.
The change, however, led to gaps in responsibility. Some of the original cost functions (e.g.,
forecasting and performance analysis) fell to other groups. Some functions were not performed at
all due to resource limitations. The cost organization now consists of four individuals (the Cost
Manager and three analysts). Direction reportedly comes from the Integrys Cost Manager, whose
reporting relationship is at the senior oversight level; i.e., above AMRP management, rather than
to AMRP management. Liberty did not find substantial direction of AMRP cost management work
by Integrys.
Liberty’s discussions with cost personnel failed to disclose clear definition of roles and
responsibilities. The Project Management Office Director and AMRP Senior Project Manager
could not articulate with clarity what he expected of the AMRP Cost Manager’s group, other than
budget monitoring, assembling cost reports, and invoice processing. The Cost Manager (under the
AMRP Delivery Director) came to the program within the past year. Liberty found the structure,
role definition, and resource numbers dedicated to cost management insufficient to meet the needs
of the AMRP. The group appears to continue to focus on the cost “oversight” role that Liberty
considers too narrow to support AMRP needs.

The AMRP had no functional cost modeling tool prior to the Integrys Cost Manager’s assignment
to this program. This manager had to track annual expenditures versus the budget on a spreadsheet.
Recently, an outside firm developed an interim cost modeling tool. It uses MS Excel™ to automate
the monthly cost reporting process, and to provide traceability for input data. The AMRP intends
to use this interim model for cost reporting until an enterprise-level cost management tool can be
implemented.
The input/output framework of this interim cost modeling tool operates as follows:
 Inputs: Provide the various data sources that feed the calculations, including annual
budgets, project cost estimates, change logs, budget transfers, historical PeopleSoft data
(contractor purchase order amounts, including change orders, with cross-references to
work order numbers and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Account numbers),
PowerPlant cost outputs (actual payments to all vendors with cross-references to AMRP
project names and phases, and work order numbers), and metering data.
 Calculations & Outputs: Calculate data from across the various input sources, primarily by
work order number, with resulting data aggregated by project/phase or by cost account on
both year-to-date and program-to-date summaries.
The next table summarizes the fundamental features of this cost modeling tool.

ii. Monthly Status Report
The monthly status report provides the program’s “official” cost management information. The
first page of this report provides a Program Performance Summary in the form displayed in the
following illustration. The summary addresses 2014 progress at year end. This chart shows that
Peoples Gas expended $263 million in 2014 (82 percent of budget) to retire 69 miles of main (61
percent of the revised plan of 112 miles).

The year end 2014 monthly report also contained a one-page summary of budget performance.
The report, however, provided no explanation or analysis of the work and cost underruns that
occurred. It did not discuss major issues affecting progress.

Following this summary, the December 2014 monthly report provides a chart, shown in the next
illustration, tracking monthly expenditures. No discussion or analysis accompanies the chart. Work
for the year started to fall in March (very early in the construction season), and had lagged further
by June. Liberty, at that time, questioned management about corrective actions being taken.
Eventually, management began a big “push” on main replacement and service installation by the

contractors to close the gap. This push substantially accelerated main and service installations. At
the same time, limits among Peoples Gas internal resources prevented the Company from catching
up on meter installations.
Illustration L.6: AMRP Monthly Expenditure Tracking (December 2014)

Effective cost management requires tools that can and continuously do supply management with
early warning of potential problems. These signals must be accompanied by analyses that facilitate
timely corrective actions. Simply tracking expenditures in numerical or graphic displays does not
comprise effective cost management. There needs to be analysis of what work got accomplished
for the money spent and the resources used, identifying both the positive and negative forces,
factors, and events driving performance.
The use of a one-page, unrevealing cost summary in a 42-page monthly report evidences the
narrow approach that AMRP leadership takes to cost management. Moreover, overly focusing on
the current year can obscure positive and negative trends and development that emerge over a
longer time. Liberty’s inquiries failed to disclose the comprehensive set of cost data required to
enable management identification of the causes of adverse cost performance and trends. The lack
of such information comprises a major gap in identifying methods for optimizing program
performance.
e. Cost Management Training and Support
Effective management requires that managers understand their cost management responsibilities
and receive the training and support required to execute them. Liberty’s discussions with managers
and supervisors interviewed disclosed that no basic training in cost management concepts and
techniques had been offered to them. This result conforms to a fairly common, but unsound
presumption that managers somehow acquire cost management skills as a result of their general
backgrounds and experience in operations and management. Most managers that Liberty has
encountered do in fact operate with cost consciousness, and try their best to contain costs when
making daily decisions and carrying out routine operations. Nevertheless, ensuring a consistent
and sufficient focus on cost management requires giving this discipline a distinct cultural bent.
Management must provide focused training and development. Best practices; i.e., those called for

by the size, complexity, and term of the AMRP, demand no less in ensuring success in managing
cost.
Liberty’s interviews with Project Management Office personnel and (especially) management and
supervision in the three Peoples Gas Shops, made it clear that those managing and supervising
work are left to performing the cost analyses that they determine necessary and feasible, without
support from the cost management group.
f. Summary of Cost Management Capabilities
Peoples Gas does not place a high priority on developing and maintaining a strong cost
management culture. This lack of priority inevitably causes cost management capabilities to fall
short. What distinguishes the situation here is the level of cost management focus that a program
like the AMRP requires. Management operates under an overly narrow approach to budget
monitoring, rather than robust cost management. Management has not provided proper tools and
has left the cost management group understaffed and improperly organized. Roles and
responsibilities lack definition and management has not communicated clear and comprehensive
expectations.
Liberty found no substantial cost analysis. Even basic factors, such as root-causes behind the
relative performance of the shops, the factors behind differing performance levels by contractors,
dollars per mile results, and the evolution of costs over the AMRP’s first few years remain
unanalyzed.
Peoples Gas has very limited cost estimating capabilities and no formal written guidelines or
procedures. As Chapter K: Cost Estimating details, Liberty found a fragmented cost estimating
process, lack of maintenance of the compatible units used to perform cost estimates, insufficient
numbers of professional cost estimators for a program of this size, absence of project contingency
(and hence lower cost estimate accuracy), and no cost estimate reconciliation addressing cost
deviations and capturing lessons learned.
Peoples Gas has not updated its original cost model, and finds itself presently (until completion of
work now underway) without a cost model usable for forecasting the final AMRP costs.
Discussions between Liberty and senior executive management have led recently to initiatives and
plans (whose development is underway, and in some cases at the execution stage) to address areas
where Peoples Gas could make substantial improvement.

3. Conclusions
L.1

The AMRP has not employed a formal cost management program, leaving the
function too weak to fully support program cost management needs and to contribute
effectively to program cost optimization. (Recommendation L.1)

The AMRP Project Management Office views cost management as essentially equivalent to
budget-tracking. Spending to but not above the budget has formed the predominant goal of cost
management.

May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter L: Cost Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Early program history made it clear that spending the full budgeted amount would prove unlikely.
Progress during 2014 is consistent with that history. For example, management reduced the
original 2014 goal of 153 miles to 112 miles. The December 2014 Monthly Status Report stated
the year-end actual retired quantity was 69 miles. Regular program reports provide no analysis of
the variance. All Liberty found was a statement indicating that 10 miles did not make an
engineering submission deadline.
The Monthly Status Report overly focuses on annual performance. Longer-term AMRP program
status information, such as program-to-date costs, program-to-date retired miles, projected final
cost and schedule information is unavailable. The lack of such data makes observations about and
analysis of trends versus expectations unavailable as well. The addition of non-AMRP work to
reports addressing AMRP work in the first quarter of 2014 further limits the ability to assess true
AMRP progress.
A program like the AMRP requires a structured, well-defined, and rigorously executed approach
to managing costs. Such an approach includes defining the key cost elements, making clear how
management will track and manage each, setting firm expectations for managers and cost support
personnel, employing specific reporting requirements, setting clear expectations for the analysis
of the data contained in each report, appropriately structuring a cost management organization,
and providing the specific skill sets required. Peoples Gas has announced a series of initiatives to
address these issues, and has begun work on many of them. It will take major effort and significant
time to implement them, even if the Company gives them a high priority and dedicated resources.
L.2

Concentration on contract administration and annual budgeting produced much too
narrow a focus on cost management. (Recommendations L.1 and L.2)

Main and service replacement work occurs under contracts with outside contractors who employ,
secure, and manage the resources required to provide completed main and service installation
work. The use of lump-sum and unit-rate price contracts led management to view contractor cost
management from a contract administration viewpoint. Liberty found insufficient focus on labor
costs, labor work-hours, hourly labor rates, productivity, and other such determinants of cost. The
nature of Peoples Gas’ construction contracts affects the way Peoples Gas should manage costs,
but it does not diminish the need for Peoples Gas to manage costs actively. Specifically,
management’s understanding of the labor parameters mentioned above must produce a working
knowledge of what drives costs and what deserves management scrutiny. Measuring the
effectiveness of current performance and developing a sound basis for future cost expectations
depend on such knowledge. Peoples Gas lacks the information needed to develop that knowledge.
AMRP management tracks annual budget performance principally from the perspective of total
expenditures. Management appears to define cost management success strictly in terms of
conforming to budgeted expenditures. A focus on rate recovery may well be incenting this view.
Management has stated that production is a priority in its cost management framework. Liberty
did not observe the kinds of cost tracking and reporting or the level of commitment to corrective
actions that would demonstrate the commitment it takes to establish production as a material
priority.

L.3

Chapter L: Cost Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas lacks the cost management capability needed to support AMRP needs
fully. (Recommendations L.3 and L.4)

AMRP Management has adopted too narrow a scope for cost management. The cost group is
tasked to manage the annual budget, process invoices, and manage cost reporting. The roles and
responsibilities of cost management personnel do not have clear definition. Staffing is not
sufficient to meet the requirements of a robustly and appropriately defined cost management
function.
Peoples Gas needs to define key cost elements, identify tracking methods, set clear and challenging
expectations for managers and cost support personnel, identify and use specific reporting
requirements, determine what is to be done with each report, establish and staff a much expanded
cost management organization, and provide the skill sets required to make cost management
effective. These baseline needs exist for any large program, and have greater significance for one
of the scope, size, and duration of the AMRP.
L.4

Peoples Gas lacks essential cost management tools. (Recommendation L.1)

The cost modeling tool now in use was designed for use on an interim basis. Management
developed it to track incurred costs and annual authorized spending levels. It is too labor intensive
to maintain, and makes the process of ensuring data integrity difficult. Moreover, this tool’s
displays of performance to date (versus the current year) fail to include some performance data for
periods prior to 2014. This gap makes the tool’s accuracy questionable. The tool’s design for
tracking incurred costs also leaves it with limited value in managing total costs. The Company
states that it recognizes the current tool as an interim fix only. Announced initiatives include
expanding the capabilities of cost modeling to address the gaps.
L.5

No formal training in cost management concepts exists to assist those with cost
management responsibilities, and program management and supervision do not have
access to designated cost support personnel to assist in analyzing cost and
performance. (Recommendation L.5)

The absence of a formal cost management program for the AMRP means that managers try to
control costs under varying methods, according to their background and experience. The lack of
cost management professionals produces a lack of needed cost analytical capability.

4. Recommendations
L.1

Peoples Gas should implement a holistic cost management program. (Conclusions L.1,
L.2, and L.4)

Meaningful AMRP cost management requires appropriate processes that professionals
knowledgeable in both the work being performed and cost-related skills employ. These
professionals need to analyze anticipated and actual execution of the work in a data rich
environment. Comprehensive and accurate information enables them proactively to identify and
secure management commitment and action to improve efficiency with the ultimate objective of
optimizing expenditures.

Chapter L: Cost Management

This essentially holistic approach to cost management requires establishing and reinforcing the
need to think about and to address that at a strategic and policy level, as opposed to an accounting
level. Companies that succeed in this approach establish cost as a priority, design an organization
and structure it to promote cost effectiveness, and integrate cost into the other management systems
that guide a program and its projects. A shift in thinking must occur at all levels of program
management, to encourage a move away from a narrow focus on numbers and reports and toward
a structured use of expanded analysis and an aggressive set of actions.
To achieve the above goals, a holistic approach to cost management operating under the overall
structure shown below is in order.
Illustration L.7: Holistic Cost Management Approach Structure

The holistic approach employs three main components:
 A guiding philosophy towards cost management, supported by strong executive
commitment and oversight, operating through defined priorities and policies.
 A formal, structured cost management plan that defines how costs will be managed,
establishes individual accountabilities, and identifies global issues (systemic and cultural)
that require specific focus and methods.
 A comprehensive set of tools and tactics, which comprise the building blocks that facilitate
effective implementation of the plan, including systems, metrics, analytical tools,
measures, focused initiatives, implementing procedures, reports, analytical skills and
predictive capabilities.
Given where Peoples Gas stands, it will take several years to move to a fully effective, holistic
approach to cost management. This approach has high importance in optimizing AMRP costs long
term. There are short-term and long-term objectives that can be achieved. Liberty provided a
checklist (below) that offers a roadmap to developing such an approach, identifying the time
frames applicable to each feature that the Company should seek to implement.

May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter L: Cost Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Effectively implementing a holistic approach to cost management begins at the executive level.
Senior leadership needs to set a foundation, and provide clear direction. This direction
communicates a guiding philosophy on how cost management fits in the Company’s strategy. It
also establishes where cost falls in the hierarchy of priorities. In most companies, it will not lie at
the top, but it remains important for employees to understand how it does rate. Ignoring the
question reduces effectiveness and makes the challenge of balancing cost against other priorities
that much harder for managers.
The guiding philosophy will provide a framework for emphasizing management’s expectations. It
will define policies and priorities for employees. It will also put in place appropriate oversight
mechanisms to assure executive management that the philosophy and its accompanying policies
are being aggressively implemented.
The second key element of design comes through a formal, structured cost management plan, or
set of plans. Such plans define how an organization will carry out the cost management function.
This set of plans should define how costs will be managed, the organizational approach to be used,
accountabilities, and any specific issues, including systemic or cultural cost issues that must be
addressed.

ICC14GAS0002

The presumption that those rising to management levels will inherently have acquired cost
management skills is wrong. The plan helps educate managers and support personnel on the actions
expected of them and how the cost management system functions. It will not be a general
document, and the plan for one organization is unlikely to serve another.
The third element resides in the set of tools used in implementing the program. These building
blocks bring the cost management approach, foundation, and plan to life. They include the cost
tools and reports that organizations traditionally use. These tools, however, only contribute to, but
do not constitute, the end result. They neither comprise the whole program nor define it. Rather
they combine with the other building blocks to deliver desired outcomes. Other blocks include the
skills and capabilities of cost professionals, predictive capabilities, implementing procedures,
focused initiatives directed at specific cost issues and the many other activities and capabilities
necessary for effective cost management.
Peoples Gas needs to establish a new program for estimating costs in order to have the capability
to project final AMRP costs reliably and on a continuous basis. The Company has been working
for some time to create a new cost forecasting model. It has committed to creating a model that
will bring the capability to estimate direct program costs and ongoing operating and maintenance
costs. Peoples Gas needs to expedite completion of the model and to verify its reliability, which is
critical to the production of meaningful capital and operating cost estimates. AMRP management
then needs to use this new model to prepare expeditiously a new baseline total cost estimate for
the program. Finally, AMRP management must also develop a structured approach, supported by
an adequate organization, to continuous cost forecasting in the future.
L.2

Peoples Gas should establish a structured, well defined approach to managing AMRP
costs at three levels: the long-term total program outlook, the individual project level,
and the annual budget view. (Conclusion L.2)

Individual projects form the basic building blocks of the AMRP. The estimates for these individual
projects must be improved. Program costs can then be established bottom-up by summing the
projects (and/or phases of projects) completed, the cost estimates of the active projects (and/or
phases of projects), and the projected costs of projects yet to be designed. The cost estimates of all
the active projects need to be sequenced so as to feed the budgeting, scheduling, resource planning,
and project management processes timely and effectively.
L.3

Peoples Gas should define appropriate roles for cost management professionals,
including all activities, responsibilities, and accountabilities important to holistic cost
management. (Conclusion L.3)

An effective organization must move beyond numbers and reports, so that it can perform
meaningful analysis and identify corrective actions. Only people can make that translation of
numbers to action. People skills and experience thus become the most significant contributors to
success.
The defined roles of cost professionals, along with clear responsibility and accountability for
performance in those roles include the following:
 Direct support to work group management, helping and encouraging management to carry
out cost management responsibilities

Chapter L: Cost Management

Continuing preparation of analyses that directly lead to recommended corrective measures
Assuring that the case for cost is heard in balancing program and project priorities
Providing a focus on predictive methods and techniques, early identification of cost threats
and elevation of cost issues while mitigation remains an option
Developing and implementing tools and processes that support cost management.

Peoples Gas must develop the requisite skills in its cost staff in a manner fully consistent with
these new demands. The AMRP cost organization must become familiar with the technical details
of the physical work. With time, such development efforts and integration of new skills will
produce the staff of cost professionals required.
L.4

Peoples Gas should establish a cost support organization that: (a) resides
organizationally at a level and in a place consistent with treating cost management as
a high program priority, (b) serves the cost management needs of all levels of
management, (c) develops a force of skilled cost professionals and assures those skills
are continuously improved, and (d) has overall accountability for the development
and implementation of the cost management program. (Conclusion L.3)

Organizational decisions by necessity must be carefully tailored to the particular traits of the entity
involved. One should therefore avoid prescriptive recommendations on how to structure an
organization. That said, Liberty’s experience does lend itself to identifying approaches and
methods that have worked in the past.
The most successful cost management organizations feature a high reporting level. Establishing
organizational “clout” underscores the importance of cost and the credibility of the people
responsible for the programs designed to manage it. Peoples Gas should place the cost management
manager or cost director directly under the senior leader of the AMRP. In addition, the cost
manager should have the flexibility to build reports as the cost organization sees fit. This
empowerment will facilitate upward communication to executive management and the Board as
the manager deems necessary. This placement of the cost management organization will leave no
doubt as to its standing as a corporate priority. More importantly, analyses performed by the cost
management organization must remain objective, candid, and free of influence from the
organizations directly responsible for performing physical work.
In Liberty’s experience, a matrix approach to cost management can work. A matrix approach is
often dictated when a specialized skill is needed in a local organization but will be difficult to
acquire, nurture and retain in that organization. This may well be the case for the cost professionals
Liberty envisions as appropriate for the AMRP. They are needed at the local level, and should
report to the local manager. They could have a “dotted line” relationship back to the central cost
management organization, which would be their organizational “home.” That organization would
be responsible for their technical direction, supporting them with staff capabilities and providing
training and career development.
Establishing a career path in cost management can be a valuable contributor to attracting and
growing a strong cast of skilled cost professionals.

L.5

Chapter L: Cost Management

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should provide training for managers, supervisors and cost support
personnel in cost management techniques consistent with the holistic approach.
(Conclusion L.5)

Training proves especially important where expectations for managers and support personnel are
high, as should be the case for a program such as the AMRP. Liberty’s experience teaches that
such training is welcomed by the managers receiving it.
Training is also essential to permit managers to make rational decisions about their information
needs. For example, in developing Peoples Gas new cost management tools, such as the Primavera
Unifier, the needs of managers must provide a critical input. However, in the absence of adequate
training, it is difficult to see how managers can operate with full effectiveness in defining their
needs. Peoples Gas should, therefore, consider cost management training a prerequisite to that new
system’s development.
L.6

Peoples Gas should continue aggressively to pursue the recommendations made by
Liberty in discussions leading to the interim report. (All conclusions from this chapter)

Liberty recommended pursuit of the following cost management goals during discussions, which
began in September 2014, with senior Integrys and Peoples Gas executive leadership:
 Promotion of a cost effective culture
 A cost management program that promotes a culture of program cost control
 Objective to go beyond cost tracking and budget performance
 Enhancement of cost estimating capabilities
 Development of cost analytical capability to identify root causes of major cost issues
and quantify cost impacts
 Training of key managers, supervisors, and cost professionals on cost control and
management concepts
 Documentation of corrective actions and resulting effectiveness
 Development of effective cost forecasting capabilities.
Peoples Gas states that it has committed to and begun several initiatives in response to LibertyAMRP executive discussions. Most of the announced improvement plans appear designed to get
a good handle on tracking actual costs, and managing the annual budget plan. Peoples Gas remains
a long way from the holistic cost management approach (described in Recommendation L.1).
Nevertheless, its announced initiatives reflect a sound start and should prove effective if pursued
with diligence, and with recognition that baseline completion of the initiatives agreed to by Peoples
Gas provides a foundation, rather than a completed structure.
The Company’s cost management do not take a program-focused, long-term view. The near term
activities are designed to get a good handle on managing the annual budget plan. That is
appropriate as a first step, but Peoples Gas will need to move beyond the current focus on cost
tracking. Discussions with leadership indicate that further planning details of the cost management
initiative will be forthcoming.
Liberty nevertheless, is not prepared to express optimism about the very near term prospects for
reaching what we would describe as a holistic cost management program. For one thing, Peoples

Gas lacks the cost management capabilities and resources required to implement such a program.
In addition, current circumstances still preclude a credible estimate of total costs over the AMRP’s
total duration, despite efforts to develop new cost modeling capabilities. As noted above, a full
transition to a more holistic approach to cost management, while warranted as a measure to
optimize long-term AMRP performance, may prove a multi-year effort for Peoples Gas,
considering its current philosophy and capabilities.

Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
1. Background
This chapter:
 Describes the approach taken to material purchasing
 Examines the organization responsible for material purchasing
 Assesses material purchasing effectiveness
 Determines how well material availability has supported construction
 Addresses the contracting strategy for the AMRP
 Assesses the organization responsible for contractor management
 Evaluates the sufficiency of contractor management.
The purchasing of routine materials for a large project or program usually remains in the
background, unless issues in material availability affect construction. Most utilities have developed
reasonably sophisticated supply chain operations. One does not often find significant issues with
the procurement of standard materials. The AMRP relies on a great deal of standard, rather than
specially engineered, materials. Regular reports of purchases for the AMRP show very large
numbers of purchases and of volumes of mainly standard materials. There is thus nothing
particularly unusual about materials procured for the AMRP, except for their volume, which in
turn produces substantial aggregate costs.
Contractors provide most AMRP labor. Their work on mains and services makes up 83 percent of
the current AMRP cost estimate. Labor does not comprise this entire amount, but contractor labor
illustrates the vast impact of contracting on the AMRP. The effectiveness of contracting and
contractor management thus comprises a material contribution to AMRP success.
The potential for twenty years of contracts featuring largely repetitive work should present
valuable opportunities for contractors. Significant opportunities therefore exist for Peoples Gas to
obtain the best available skills at a reasonable cost, and to forge long-term contractor relationships
that can assure an effective and efficient flow of resources.
Selection and management of contractors requires a mature set of skills. Contractors prove creative
in rationalizing the need for work delays and extra costs. Management must routinely discourage
such creativity and minimize cost exposures through strong management of contractors and the
contracting process.

2. Findings
a. Procurement
i. Overview
The Integrys Supply Chain organization exercises responsibility for procurement through its
materials management group. This Green Bay and Chicago-based group has 63 employees.
Blanket purchase orders comprise the predominant means of securing materials for the AMRP.
Various electronic systems, including the Advanced Planning System (“APS”), support materials

ICC14GAS0002

procurement. This system provides information on the needs, inventory, lead times, and other
factors important in determining what materials to hold available in storage. The Advanced
Planning System automatically places the order for project materials based on demand signals it
receives from engineering, whose design work identifies the near-term installation quantities that
drive needs for materials.
The materials management group aggregates material requirements estimates to produce
aggregated materials forecasts, arranges logistics and transportation of materials to the job, and
manages freight, warehousing, investment recovery (salvage), and inventory.
Engineering conducts design work that defines materials requirements, and enters these
requirements into the Work Management Information System. Detailed bills of materials list the
final material requirements for projects and other jobs. A need date corresponding to the start of
construction is specified. Much of the material requirements consist of stock items that the
materials management group obtains, and places in storage until drawn from inventory by a
contractor or Peoples Gas crews for a particular project. Systems specifically track materials
during installation by lot, identified by a number printed on the material.
The Supply Chain group operates warehouses throughout the Integrys property. These warehouses
hold materials prior to their need dates at job sites. Supply Chain tracks quantities and needs, and
replenishes materials as necessary. The City of Chicago permits no job site storage of materials
when work is not actively underway. AMRP contractors therefore also require storage remote from
installation locations.
Interviewees all stated that they had no substantial issues with the materials processes, which they
believe have worked well. These interviews include the work of Liberty’s field inspection team at
job sites and in interviews with field supervisors and managers. Liberty’s field inspections also
failed to identify any materials inefficiencies associated with a lack of material availability at job
sites. Supply Chain expressed continuing confidence in being able to meet the high volumes of
materials that the AMRP will continue to require. The significant challenge (one common to the
construction industry) comes when dealing with changes that generate materials requirements
revisions in the field.
ii. Material Delays
A critical bottom line for procurement is the extent to which materials do not arrive in the field
when and as needed. Peoples Gas identified 17 cases during 2013 and 2014 when materials were
not available as required. The following table briefly summarizes their causes. Considering the
magnitude of the AMRP effort, the number of shortages does not raise concern. The “change in
standards” and the “operational preferences” items do not appear excessive. Moreover, they were
supported by appropriate explanations, with some arising from outside forces. On balance, the data
and Liberty’s direct observation support a conclusion that material availability adequately
supported AMRP progress.

Table M.1: 2013 and 2014 Instances of Materials Shortages

iii. Strategy
The size and duration of the AMRP present large challenges, but also offer substantial
opportunities in a number of areas. Procurement would appear to provide a source of advantage.
The AMRP involves large quantities of materials stretched out over a 20-year timeframe. Volume
and duration should allow Peoples Gas to obtain most-favored status in the form of lower prices,
better service, and long-term partnerships with important vendors.
Supply Chain management indicates that it seeks multi-year deals on materials, which would
further the objective of optimizing performance. Management does not, however, appear to pursue
a focused strategy that: (a) fully recognizes the buying power of Peoples Gas, (b) identifies where
and how benefits can and should be sought, and (c) builds resulting tactics into the procurement
effort.
iv. Procurement Systems
Three systems support the process of ensuring the materials support that the AMRP needs. First,
as noted above, the Work and Asset Management System captures the materials required from the
input of design information. Next, the Advanced Planning System aggregates materials required
for all projects entered into the Work and Asset Management System. This information forms the
basis for materials and equipment ordering. A PeopleSoft module captures the balance and the
value of material and equipment available. The PeopleSoft module permits material and equipment
status reporting, which regularly takes two forms.
 Fulfillment Rate, which tracks demand against supply, targeting a 95 percent on-time
delivery rate
 Inventory on Hand past Due, which tracks how much material remains on hand after the
dates expected for it to be required based on design information entered.
The first of these measures provides an indicator of whether too few materials are on hand. It does
so by reporting failures of delivery when scheduled. The second provides an indicator of surplus
material and equipment. It does so by reporting whether materials remain on hand after they were
expected to be removed for delivery to job sites.
Liberty reviewed fulfillment rate charts for the last six months. This review demonstrated that
procurement supported Peoples Gas needs, including AMRP requirements. Deliveries meet or
exceeded the 95 percent on time fulfillment target regularly. The system reports this information

Phase One Final Report
Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
ICC14GAS0002

for eight different utility business units, all of which experienced fulfillment rates comfortably
above the 95 percent level.
Liberty also examined the Inventory on Hand Past Due metrics. They show past due amounts of
about $1.5 million for the period since AMRP start. This amount covers all of Peoples Gas, but a
very substantial portion of the amount appears assigned to AMRP projects. A very large portion
of this $1.5 million appears to have accumulated in 2014, when early construction season delays
commonly occurred. The amounts may thus relate principally to these delays. Nevertheless, the
numbers indicate a need for regular reporting of procurement metrics such as these. Such reporting
will ensure timely material and equipment delivery without purchasing too far in advance of
realistic construction start dates.
These metrics confirm the observations of Liberty’s field inspection team. The team found material
and equipment availability to pose no problems in completing work inspected. The metrics also
confirm observations shared by field personnel, who reported that a period of some availability
shortage in 2013 has not recurred since. The second metric provides an indication as well that
suitable availability has not come at the expense of an overly conservative and potentially costly
overstocking approach.
b. Contracting
i. Organization
The Integrys Supply Chain organization conducts the contractor procurement process through its
strategic sourcing group. This Chicago and Green Bay group has 25 employees. The group
assembles the bid packages, but evaluation of bids falls under the responsibility of the Project
Management Office. Following contract awards, this Office has responsibility for contract
administration.
Contract crews perform construction and installation of mains and services, and have responsibility
for full restoration work behind their crews. Management seeks to assign contract inspectors to
every project. Construction management provides day-to-day direction of contractors. This
assignment leaves administrative tasks as the Project Management Office’s primary responsibility.
Administrative tasks include contract administration, negotiation of contract changes, and review
and approval of invoices.
ii. Strategy
Peoples Gas chose a strategy that relies heavily on contractors for most parts of the AMRP,
including essentially total reliance on them for main and service installations. Such a strategy
makes sense, although Peoples Gas has not provided any analysis supporting it. More importantly,
Peoples Gas has not offered a strong implementing strategy; i.e., one which will extract the most
value given the attractive nature of the workload to contractors. Peoples Gas explained its
contracting strategy to Liberty as one of “packaging” into contracts. Contractor selection is based
on work volume, resource availability, the need for specialty subcontractors, and project
performance. Contract packaging applies the following criteria:
 Project Duration

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation

Phase One Final Report
Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
ICC14GAS0002






o Work scope for completion within one construction year (management, however,
does design work into packages that permit awarding more work than can be
completed in a calendar year, in order to support construction flexibility)
Geography
o Distribution of work across all three Peoples Gas districts (North, Central, South)
Contract Value
o Work bundled into packages appropriate to bidder ability, based on experience and
resources
o Small projects (e.g., Public Improvement Projects) bundled to create cost effective
packages to manage
Resource Availability
o Large projects broken into multiple smaller components to move work to smaller
contractors with resource capacity.

The Peoples Gas “2011-2012 AMRP Construction Strategy – White Paper” states that “PGL
implemented a competitive bidding strategy aimed at extracting value from the contracts based on
construction volumes.” Liberty found no clear evidence, however, of how the Company did so, or
of what success its strategy had. The Company reported in this regard that:
 It grouped projects into bundles based on work complexity and quantity, so both large and
smaller contractors could participate. In addition, the Company broke bid bundles up or
reorganized them, based on bidder feedback and resource limitations due to existing work
for Peoples Gas. For example, a contractor’s capacity limitations due to ongoing work
could lead to re-letting a bid package in smaller pieces, although the Company states that
this approach does not usually lead to a re-bid.
 This approach has succeeded according to the Company; the contractor pool has increased
from four to six; contractors remain busy according to their resource availability, and
contractor costs have proven competitive and relatively stable.
 Future plans continue to seek development of the contractor pool to expand available
contractor resources, and to maintain stable cost structure.
The AMRP’s long-duration and multi-billion dollar budget should encourage contractors to form
partnerships with Peoples Gas. Liberty expected reasonably lower prices, higher efficiency, higher
quality, better performance, and strong working relationships to result from such partnerships.
Contractors have significant incentives to conduct themselves in accord with this long-term
opportunity. Liberty did not, however, find substantial indication that Peoples Gas has tried to
reduce contract labor costs using the advantages present. Supply Chain indicated that it has sought
multi-year deals with material suppliers. The group has, however, shown reluctance in applying a
similar approach with contractors. Supply Chain finds the pool of contractors in the Chicago area
too limited. Liberty does not necessarily agree that this is a limitation. Peoples Gas expressed
confidence in the current and long term ample supply of contract labor. Liberty has seen no
evidence that Chicago is a labor seller’s market, and continues to believe that the AMRP represents
a buyer’s opportunity.
Liberty believes that other approaches, apart from long-term deals, exist to encourage contractors.
Without pursuing a more direct strategy towards this objective, Peoples Gas cannot assure Liberty
or the Illinois Commerce Commission that it is optimizing AMRP efficiency for the long term.

iii. Management of Contractors
aa. Contract Administration
In exercising its role in contract administration, the Project Management Office appears to limit
its primary efforts to change management (discussed in the next section below). Liberty reviewed
typical AMRP field contracts with the intent of discussing their administration with program
personnel. That review did not find the responsible people, including those from program
management, contracts, scheduling, and construction, substantially aware of contract terms.
Specific areas where Liberty found this lack of awareness include:
 The contract mandate for each party (Peoples Gas and the contractor) to name a
Relationship Manager, and the identity of that person for each contract. The Relationship
Managers serve as each party’s primary liaison with the other, and act as each party’s
representative for the resolution of disputes. This requirement is important. The Peoples
Gas representatives should know who is responsible to speak and commit for the
contractor. Further, the contractor may not charge for this function. Peoples Gas cannot
enforce the requirement if it does not know who the person is.
 The nature, or even the existence of, the contract mandated Joint Steering Committee and
its mandated quarterly meetings.
 The nature, or even the existence of, the contract mandated annual executive meetings.
This requirement, together with the previous requirement, establishes the governance
structure for the work, and thus proves important in establishing the framework for
management and ultimate accountability.
 The nature of mandated contractor reports. Contracts define reporting requirements, as well
as monthly progress meetings and required attendees. Proper reporting maintains an
adequate management process, and assures a uniform approach by each contractor.
These requirements address central elements of contractor management. Liberty’s review,
however, found key AMRP management people unaware even of their existence.
bb. Contract Change Management
The Contract Manager group in the Project Management Office, staffed predominantly by Jacobs
Engineering personnel, has responsibility for management of contract changes. This role
comprises one of the most important and high risk positions of the AMRP program, given the vast
amounts of money that flow through it. Liberty found that the assigned people have strong
credentials, suitable educational background, and considerable experience.
AMRP uses Field Order Authorizations (“FOAs”) and Change Order Requests (“CORs”). The
former occur first, when the need for a contract change becomes known. An estimated price is
agreed upon, and work is approved by the Project Management Office. A defined delegation of
authority structure exists. The Contract Manager evaluates the estimate on behalf of AMRP,
perhaps with the assistance of construction subject matter experts. This Manager does not,
however, have professional estimating support. Subsequently, the contract change becomes fully
documented and incorporated into the contract in a Change Order.
Management fully documents changes, but the next level of oversight, management, and
monitoring of the change order process is weak. Except for a single page in the Monthly Report,
May 5, 2015

Phase One Final Report
Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
ICC14GAS0002

which has questionable value, management prepares no summary level reports prepared on the
topic of changes, conducts no reporting on the status of changes on a project or contract, and
performs no analysis of overall change levels on the program as a whole.
The expenditure of the large sums involved require much more extensive oversight. AMRP work
appears to proceed without even a basic reporting structure.
The December 2014 AMRP monthly project report includes a chart showing the amount of Change
Order Requests approved in 2014. These requests totaled $28.6 million. The report provides no
information to put that amount into context. It has a small magnitude by comparison with the
annual budget of several hundred million. What cannot be determined, however, is how it
compares with the values of contracts whose work is underway. There is also no forecast of final
end-of-contract costs. The next table summarizes change orders by year. Again, no reporting or
analysis provides context for judging the significance of these amounts.
Table M.2: AMRP Change Orders by Year

cc. Contractor Data
Peoples Gas, like most utilities, requires little data from its contractors. This approach protects
contractors from disclosure of their internal costs, productivity, staffing levels, supervision ratios,
cost and schedule assumptions, and other competitive information. Peoples Gas considers such
information irrelevant to its management of the AMRP. Management takes the view that the
contractor has an obligation to deliver in accordance with the contract and the price. That view
oversimplifies the case. Change order experience shows that AMRP “fixed prices” are not really
fixed. The contract prices, or at least the unit rates, are fixed from a narrow perspective. The large
number of changes that have occurred, however, means that prices are not fixed from a practical
perspective. AMRP management must assess the propriety of change requests. Doing so without
data about the contractor’s starting plan, assumptions, or anything other than key performance
determinants undercuts that ability.
Schedule delay issues in 2014 led to direction from AMRP management that contractors develop
acceleration plans to recover. The lack of data available to AMRP management, however, inhibits
the ability to know whether contractor staffing met planned levels in the first place. How Peoples
Gas determines that the “new” plan indeed represents an increase suitable to the challenge is also
unclear in the absence of baseline data.
These examples demonstrate why People Gas should require appropriate project control data (e.g.,
internal costs, productivity, staffing levels, supervision ratios, cost and schedule assumptions, and
other competitive parameters) to accompany contractor bids. Moreover, contracts should also
require continuing reporting of such data. Utilities claim that contractors refuse to provide such

Phase One Final Report
Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
ICC14GAS0002

data, but Liberty’s experience shows another pattern. Moreover, it would appear unlikely for
contractors to walk away from a 20-year opportunity, just to preserve confidentiality.
dd. Contractor Evaluation
A structured evaluation process forms a central part of selecting and managing contractors.
Management should disqualify (or at least penalize) poor performers and those making
unreasonable demands in future bidding. On the other hand, the Company should favor contractors
who demonstrate special attention to maintaining a partnership approach, in order to preserve their
20-year position. A formal contractor evaluation process should document performance, and
assure its reflection in subsequent bid evaluations.
Management advised Liberty of the existence of such a process. Follow-up by Liberty, however,
indicated that the Supply Chain group applied it to only one year (2011). Supply Chain notes that
any such evaluations today would be the responsibility of the contract administrator; i.e., program
management.
After these initial discussions, program management apparently developed and implemented an
evaluation process in 2014. The process features surveys of AMRP participants. They rate the
contractor in a wide variety of categories. The Company provided five examples of such surveys.
Lessons learned meetings occur subsequently with each contractor to review survey results. The
Company’s description of the process suggests that the purpose is more for improved performance
from feedback to contractors, as opposed to use in future bid evaluations.

3. Conclusions
M.1

The procurement process for AMRP materials functions at a level that supports
program schedule and quality.

Numerous organizations, including Supply Chain, Engineering, and Construction support the
process. Liberty found no indication that any significant weaknesses exist.
M.2

There may be opportunities for a more aggressive effort in seeking benefits associated
with the size and duration of the AMRP’s materials needs. (Recommendation M.1)

Peoples Gas offered only “multi-year procurements” as a strategy to seize the benefits of scale that
should be expected from the AMRP. It may be possible to pursue other avenues for such benefits
as well.
M.3

Procurement metrics support the availability of adequate material and equipment to
support AMRP installation activities, but regular reporting of the available
information does not take place. (Recommendation M.2)

Information showing procurement order fulfillment indicates rates consistent with ensuring
material and equipment availability at levels that support program work. A metric that gives insight
into materials kept on hand longer than expected shows a fairly substantial amount, particularly in
2014. That metric highlights the need for regular reporting and analysis of both material equipment
underages and overages.

M.4

The large scope and long duration of the AMRP creates opportunities for contracting
efficiencies, but it does not appear that Peoples Gas is pursuing such efficiencies.
(Recommendation M.1)

The AMRP seems to be taking a “typical” approach to contracting, and doing a reasonably good
job in applying that approach. However, the AMRP is not typical and the Company’s approach to
contracting should not be typical either. The AMRP produces opportunities to obtain favored
treatment in light of the long-term benefits of the program to contractors. The Company’s failure
to take advantage of such opportunities does not optimize program performance.
M.5

The contract administration function, excluding change control, does not take a
sufficiently broad view. (Recommendation M.2)

Discussions with key personnel revealed a lack of awareness of the contracts they have
responsibility to administer. The contract sections discussed were important and basic to contract
management, but key personnel were not aware of them.
M.6

Management oversight

of

too

narrow.

AMRP management approved a total of $145 million of change orders. Despite the magnitude of
this amount, Liberty observed little in the way of reporting on the results of the management
program. Management reports change order costs monthly, but do not address whether those
amounts are good or bad, expected or unexpected.
M.7

The Company’s analysis of contract changes provides insufficient insight into the
quality of performance. (Recommendation M.4)

Contract changes have proven very large, both on an absolute basis ($145 million) and on a relative
basis (152 percent). Management knows the general causes of such changes. Liberty did not find,
however, analysis linking the changes to performance. Such analysis has importance in addressing
potential areas of change, such as future contract terms and project estimates. Adding a routine
level of suitable analysis is necessary to the effective management of contract change requests.
M.8

Peoples Gas does not require contractors to provide information necessary to
facilitate contract management of performance and analysis of changes.
(Recommendation M.5)

The view that risk lies with the contractor and that AMRP management therefore does not need
contractor data misses an important opportunity. The magnitude of change orders makes clear that
Peoples Gas bears substantial risk. Managing this risk makes it essential for the Company to
understand the details behind bids. Tracking the same data later becomes essential for day-to-day
management of AMRP projects. Sound project management monitors performance against a
defined standard, which in this case is the contractor’s bid. It is not possible to manage performance
without an understanding of the contractor’s initial assumptions. Management should be
examining issues that include whether unit rates being achieved are consistent with the bid plan,
whether staffing is consistent with the bid plan, whether quality goals are being met, and whether
adequate supervision is being provided. Addressing important management and oversight issues
must become a critical Peoples Gas responsibility. Doing so requires a change from the view that
such issues represent contractor responsibilities.

M.9

Peoples Gas has a process for ongoing evaluation of contractors, but there is no
indication of its use in the bid evaluation process. (Recommendation M.6)

It is important that Peoples Gas incorporate contractor performance into subsequent bid
evaluations.

4. Recommendations
M.1

Peoples Gas should develop a formal strategy to ensure that the Company gets aboveaverage terms and below-average pricing in view of the long-term opportunities
afforded by the AMRP. (Conclusion M.2)

The efficiencies that can be realized by vendors in the AMRP environment, plus their motivation
to secure and sustain long-term business, means that Peoples Gas has an advantageous position
when it comes to negotiating terms. The Company should exert more effort towards defining where
opportunities to gain procurement benefits exist, revising the procurement strategy accordingly.
M.2

Peoples Gas should regularly include in program monthly reports information
showing procurement fulfillment and past due rates. (Conclusion M.3)

The large increase in material held past reported due dates that occurred in 2014 highlights the
value in reporting information that permits management to determine the degree to which
procurement activities support program work without unduly advancing procurement orders.
M.3

Peoples Gas should develop a formal strategy to ensure that the Company gets
optimum terms and pricing in view of the long-term opportunities afforded to
contractors by the AMRP. (Conclusion M.4)

The efficiencies that contractors can realize in the AMRP environment, plus their motivation to
secure and sustain long-term business, gives Peoples Gas substantial leverage in securing favorable
contract terms. The Company should exert greater effort towards defining where opportunities to
gain contract benefits exist, revising the procurement strategy accordingly. Peoples Gas should
pursue partnering opportunities with proven contractors.
M.4

Peoples Gas should determine those contract administration tasks that it considers
required, and assure that the Project Management Office executes those tasks.
(Conclusion M.2)

AMRP management has not implemented important contract administration functions, as defined
within standard contracts. The Company should review the contracts, decide which features
warrant implementation, and then require the Project Management Office to implement them. The
Company can remove from the standard contract features that it deems unnecessary.
M.5

Peoples Gas should apply a program of enhanced management oversight to the
contract change process. (Conclusion M.3)

With the enormous dollar value of changes at issue, it is essential that the Company control,
monitor, audit, and subject to the closest of management scrutiny the contract change process.

ICC14GAS0002

M.6

The Project Management Office should implement enhanced analysis of its results in
managing contract changes. (Conclusion M.4)

It is not currently possible to draw performance conclusions on the contract change management
program. The Project Management Office only publishes raw numbers; i.e., the total cost of
contract changes. The resulting lack of context precludes substantial management understanding
of how the program is performing. Analysis of the changes, their cause, their value versus
expectations, and, most of all, analysis of whether or not they could or should have been avoided,
provide the essential information that the Project Management Office is not currently providing.
M.7

The Supply Chain and Project Management organizations should require contractors
to provide key data that supports their plans and bids. (Conclusion M.5)

Required information should include:
 Clear descriptions of their assumptions
 Detailed resource plans (numbers and skills)
 Correlation of expenditures and labor hours to schedule
 Overtime and shiftwork plans
 Non-manual support (e.g., supervision, controls, administration, quality, safety) planned
 Any other data that the team believes will help them manage the contractor and future
claims.
M.8

The Project Management Office should link the results of its contractor evaluation
program to future bid evaluations and awards. (Conclusion M.6)

The evaluation program is relatively new, just starting in 2014. In the future, its results should be
applied to consideration of evaluated contractors for future bid awards.

Chapter N: Executive Oversight
1. Background
This chapter:
 Describes how parent and utility mission, vision, and strategic plans address the AMRP
 Addresses the sufficiency of the allocation of capital to the AMRP
 Evaluates the AMRP oversight roles and responsibilities of executive management and the
boards of directors
 Assesses how senior leadership and the boards monitor AMRP status and progress.
Developing and executing a sound management approach to the AMRP begins with the most
senior leadership. This chapter addresses how senior leadership has acted to define the dimensions
of the AMRP, supported its requirements through the dedication of sufficient financial resources,
and remained engaged in overseeing performance against well-defined objectives and metrics.
The AMRP has depended on holding company-level resource allocation decisions, including
funding and access to capital for the program. Funding constraints from the Integrys board of
director or executive levels that affect capital resource allocation and prioritization could
materially impair program efficiency and effectiveness. Top executives and the boards must ensure
the application of adequate financial resources, based upon clear plans that senior leadership
directs and oversees, and against which it continually measures.
Public safety comprises a paramount objective and customers must eventually bear the costs
involved in securing it. Thus, customers and other stakeholders have a strong interest in remaining
aware of plans and results. Keeping the Illinois Commerce Commission and stakeholders aware
of how much risk, main replacements mitigate, how fast, and how expensively, have special
importance for a program like the AMRP. The program will consume vast amounts of resources
year over year for a long duration.
The existence of sufficient detail regarding milestones, schedules and expenditures, and the quality
of estimates for spending in the capital budgets and long-term plans comprise important tools for
supporting senior executive management and board oversight.
The boards should have approved the AMRP initially, receive regular updates, and continually
oversee changes in dimensions of the program. The boards need to treat the program as a strategic
initiative. It merits ongoing formal updates and status reports that provide measurements against
key indicators.

2. Findings
a.

Mission, Vision, and Strategic Plans

The AMRP has vast cost magnitude. Its primary goal - mitigation of safety threats - addresses
operating risk (for both the public and the Company) of first-order magnitude. Program size
presents significant financial risk. Successful AMRP management requires Peoples Gas to manage

regulatory and rate risks. One should expect considerable guidance, direction, and oversight from
utility and parent executives and their boards of directors.
A prominent strategic plan and planning process that includes the AMRP has much importance in
gaining the input and support of executive management and the boards. Strategic plans, which the
industry generally revisits annually, represent the primary process for planning on a long-term (or
strategic) basis. Key components of effective plans include strategic initiatives or major projects
(such as AMRP) that will prove crucial to meeting financial and operating objectives.
i. Integrys Mission and Vision
Integrys developed vision, mission, values and expectations statements a number of years ago. The
Company addresses them in internal communications as well as in the parent annual report. The
vision statement provides simply, “People creating a premier and growing energy company.” Key
phrases of the Integrys vision include:
 People creating: Our ability to achieve the vision rests with our people, who are
actively working to make the vision real.
 Premier and growing: We strive to be the best at what we do, both internally and
externally, and are constantly changing to meet customer needs and expectations.
 Energy company: We are focused on the energy business in regulated and the
nonregulated sectors.
Integrys executives believe that the AMRP offers a “perfect fit” with a strategic focus to invest in
utility infrastructure. In the years before AMRP initiation, the Integrys non-regulated energy
trading business was a primary earnings driver. The business had reached 40 percent of Integrys
net income, and was growing. However, the national financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 caused
severe liquidity issues in energy trading. Integrys subsequently sold most of the trading business
in 2010. Integrys then refocused its strategy to seek a portfolio of regulated utilities that would
bring 90 percent or more of parent earnings from utility operations, and focus on internal growth.
Peoples Gas was then experiencing equity returns the parent considered poor. Programs like the
AMRP would generate rate base growth. Ongoing operations were not otherwise forecasted to
bring significant growth. Integrys viewed the AMRP as an opportunity to invest in a growing
regulated rate base. AMRP-induced rate base growth could drive long-term earnings growth for
Integrys. The investment in utility infrastructure also conformed closely to the Integrys vision and
business model.
Executive leadership sees the Wisconsin Energy acquisition in similar terms. Statements by the
acquirer confirm this observation. The AMRP provides an acquirer with the ability to invest more
equity capital in utility operations. Wisconsin Energy, for example, has recently been buying back
stock rather than investing in rate base growth.
ii. Integrys Strategic Planning
Strategic planning for Peoples Gas takes place at the Integrys level. The Integrys Strategic
Planning Vice President manages and coordinates the process. The senior executive staff (of
approximately 12 senior officers) collectively has responsibility for developing the plan. A small

strategic planning staff facilitates meetings that help drive the planning process. Each business unit
head acts as a subject matter expert for topics in the areas of his or her responsibility.
The planning staff starts with a sequential list of activities to develop strategic plans. It includes:
 Analysis of the external industry environment
 Trend monitoring (e.g., energy pricing, energy efficiency, renewable programs)
 Review of operating and financial performance by existing Company businesses
 Development of a “view for the future” supported by analysis of potential scenarios and
possible outcomes
 Proposing strategic initiatives (e.g., selling or buying businesses, developing new
opportunities, changing the existing business lineup)
 Performing business plans for selected opportunities.
A Long Term Financial Plan acts as a “scorecard” for strategic planning. The underlying planning
model produces a five-year plan that measures results of potential strategic moves. The model
examines potential outcomes “with and without” initiatives. Scenarios performed using the Long
Term Financial Plan serve as the foundation for strategic planning. The strategic planning process
culminates in the presentation and discussion of the plan at the Integrys Board of Directors
strategic retreat, which usually takes place in June of each year.
The key financial target for base scenario analysis is the production of targeted growth rates for
Integrys over the long term. Capital expenditures for major programs, like the AMRP, are expected
to meet the earnings per share target growth rate before inclusion in the strategic plan. Integrys
also targets a total annual return to shareholders, including dividends and growth.
iii. Historical Strategic Plans
Liberty reviewed the strategic plans presented at the Integrys board of director’s annual planning
retreat for each year from 2010 through 2013. Integrys did not prepare a strategic plan in 2014.
Management cited the Wisconsin Energy acquisition as the reason.
The 2010 strategic plan began with a brief definition of an Integrys “base strategy.” It included
plans to invest in capital and infrastructure replacement, attain first quartile operating performance,
and earn near the authorized utility returns on equity. The 2010 plan lists the Integrys “strategic
objectives,” which included: increase rates of return and earnings per share growth, dispose of the
energy trading business, develop management processes, achieve top quartile operations
performance, and explore solar businesses and growth opportunities. The 2011 Integrys strategic
plan identified eight “strategic initiatives,” which included the AMRP.
The 2012 strategic plan presented financial analyses comparing the previous year’s base case
strategic plan to one year of actual results and to a new forecast. Results of the new five-year
forecast fell significantly below those of the previous year. The strategic plan then looked at several
scenarios that involved major changes to strategic direction, such as divestiture.
The 2013 strategic plan focused entirely on the utility businesses, with no discussion of nonregulated businesses. Some of the slides emphasized that Peoples Gas and North Shore gas are
“perfect fits” for the Integrys strategy. The presentation focused on regulatory treatments and on

equity returns authorized and earned. Another major section of the 2013 strategic plan included a
focus on major utility projects during the 2011 to 2015 period, including the AMRP project.
iv. Integrys Strategic “Initiatives”
The AMRP’s importance and size make it typical of programs that gain substantial attention at the
highest levels. This attention makes such programs strategic, as opposed to operational initiatives.
Such initiatives call for continuous monitoring at the highest level. The Integrys CEO presents to
the board each December a strategic initiatives letter. Its initiatives define the most important
priorities for goal setting and planning. The CEO’s letter treats them at a high-level and with a
strategy orientation. The letters do not provide progress updates. Liberty reviewed the “key
initiatives” letters issued since 2010. The key initiatives letters go to management and all
employees to communicate the Company’s strategic direction in the upcoming year.
The list of 2011 strategic initiatives treated the AMRP as follows:
Complete the planning phase of the project management process and begin the
Accelerated Main Replacement Program in Chicago, ensuring safety objectives,
schedule and budgets are met, and that stakeholders are informed
The 2012 and 2013 letters included the AMRP among 8 to 10 key initiatives addressed.
The Integrys board and senior executives have receive updates addressing the strategic initiatives.
For instance, a December 2013 update included the goal to “successfully execute rate cases and
related proceedings to ensure timely and appropriate recovery of and return on our investments
and to improve reliability and reduce risk associated with our regulated utilities.” This update
specifically identified the AMRP.
A 2014 initiative stated the following with respect to major projects, which specifically included
the AMRP among three others:
Execute major projects consistent with project plans as well as safety, schedule, budget
and operational performance targets.
The Integrys strategic initiatives included the AMRP since at least 2010. Peoples Gas had
previously been implementing a more slowly-paced main replacement program since the 1970s.
Immediately following its acquisition of Peoples Gas in 2007, Integrys sought to accelerate the
main replacement program. It also sought to secure a cost-recovery rider to make acceleration
more financially appealing. Integrys first sought a recovery rider in its 2007 rate case.

Senior Executive and Board Oversight Responsibilities
i. Integrys Board of Directors

The Integrys board received a milestone presentation on the AMRP on February 10, 2011. The
presentation provided the project summary and background. It also addressed program approach,
2011 deliverables, communication and customer experience plans, and current status. The same
meeting brought before the board an “approval requested” document addressing an accelerated gas
main replacement program and the major contracts requiring approval. A short background and
description noted that, based on system conditions and Illinois Commerce Commission
recommendations, Peoples Gas had developed an accelerated strategy to replace leak-prone pipe

over a 20-year period. The presentation set forth the expectation that the program would result in
significantly increased capital expenditures for the next 20 years. The presentation offered an
estimated total cost in 2010 dollars.
The approval request also specified planned 2011 capital expenditures, and provided a summary
of capital requirements through 2030. The approval request also covered the award of major
material, installation labor and other vendor contracts for 2011 work.
ii. Executive Steering Committee
An Executive Steering Committee provides the senior management forum for monitoring AMRP.
The committee’s establishment came early in AMRP program history. The committee has recently
increased to almost 20 members, including six or seven senior executives. Some of the key
committee leaders have been the Integrys COO, the Peoples Gas President, the Integrys CFO, the
Integrys Controller and the Integrys Executive VP – Gas. This last executive has been the one most
directly involved in the AMRP. The committee usually operated under a set agenda. Presentations
and slide packages support all committee meetings.
Management has prepared quarterly AMRP presentations. Senior management reports that
Peoples Gas board members, like other executives and managers, have open invitations to these
presentations. Liberty found the quarterly AMRP presentations detailed. Each contains about 120
slides. Executive Steering Committee meetings follow these quarterly presentations. The
Committee receives a shorter, executive-summary version of the presentations.
iii. Peoples Gas Board
The Peoples Gas board has also undertaken efforts to oversee the AMRP. Presentations came
before the Peoples Gas board prior to program commencement, with regular project updates
following in April, June, October and December in 2011, and in February 2012. Following this
last presentation, the Peoples Gas board did not receive additional presentations specifically
prepared for its consideration. Members of the Peoples Gas board have stated that, despite the
absence of continuing formal presentations, the utility board has received updates from senior
executives at quarterly meetings. The Peoples Gas board, unlike that of the parent, has no outsiders.
Many Integrys senior executives sit on the utility board.
c.

Capital Allocation, Constraints and Budgeting

High-level resource decisions, particularly those addressing funding and resource support, have
central importance to AMRP success. Financial funding constraints imposed by boards or senior
executive management would send a message that other things are more important, and that the
program may not be high on the priority list. Such actions could have major consequence for a
program with the AMRP’s risks.
Full financial commitment by top executives and the Peoples Gas and Integrys boards is necessary
for ensuring sufficient resource commitment. For instance, the allocation of capital resources
elsewhere may direct funding away from the AMRP. How capital resources get allocated at the
highest, parent board level is an important consideration affecting the AMRP.

i. Capital Allocation
Capital allocation for Peoples Gas and AMRP and for other Integrys subsidiaries occurs at the
highest levels of Integrys. Allocation occurs first under proposed strategic plans and later under
specific capital budget proposals presented to the Integrys board. The strategic plan typically
presented to the Integrys board at its June strategic retreat includes the Long Term Financial Plan.
This plan quantifies the projected outcome of strategies over the long-term, and includes specific
capital spending for each subsidiary, including Peoples Gas.
The Integrys financial executives note that they plan for capital expenditures “consistent” with
long-term earnings per share and credit metric targets. The planning process starts with requests
from engineering and field operations, prepared early in each calendar year. The Company receives
bottom-up input regarding the expectations for work and capital expenditures required to sustain
utility service, for at least a five-year planning period. The input becomes an input to the Long
Term Financial Plan model.
Integrys financial executives also note that the planning process generally does not constrain the
operating utilities. Management cites as an exception the extreme case of the 2008/2009 national
financial crisis. From an overall perspective, no substantial reason exists to restrain utility capital
expenditures. Higher capital expenditures drive rate base growth, which, over time, supports
earnings per share growth goals. However, Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge has an
average annual limit of 4 percent of base rates. This limit has the potential for influencing Peoples
Gas capital expenditure levels. Capital allocation from the Integrys level considers Peoples Gas
needs broadly, not focusing solely on the AMRP.
The results of the Long Term Financial Plan modeling influence the development of net income
and capital expenditure targets. The modeling undergoes Strategic Planning Committee review in
March. After refinements, the Integrys board considers the plan at its June retreat.
Following board acceptance of the strategic plan and Long Term Financial Plan, the contents of
the first two years set target levels for preparing budgets. The Integrys CEO sends a memo with
net income and capital expenditure levels as budget targets. The CEO may adjust Long Term
Financial Plan results upward or downward in setting budget targets. Capital expenditure budgets
for two years then get developed from the bottom-up. Senior management review occurs and the
Integrys board considers results at its December budget approval meeting.
AMRP capital spending fell significantly below budgeted levels in September through December
2012. A senior executive explained that Peoples Gas then managed capital expenditure spending
on an “overall company,” rather than a program by program basis. Total spending for the year
became too high relative to overall budget. Work other than the AMRP reportedly drove the
overage. The Company slowed AMRP spending to bring total utility to budgeted levels. AMRP
management reduced program spending by:
 Not awarding new projects
 Prohibiting contractors from starting new phases under existing awarded projects
 Directing contractors were to suspend work on existing phases
 Directing contractors to perform interim restoration where possible
 Suspending overtime for utility labor crews

Suspend overtime for field inspectors
Suspending non-essential work.

The cutbacks caused AMRP project delays that led to large carryovers of 2012 work into 2013.
Recognizing the implications of such an approach for the AMRP, the Project Management
Office of the AMRP was given responsibility for managing all Peoples Gas capital
expenditures in 2013.
In the 2013 cycle, Peoples Gas capital expenditures in the Long Term Financial Plan increased
significantly for future program years. Company executives explained that AMRP estimates were
adjusted significantly upward for all future years in 2013, because:
 AMRP costs per mile were proving higher compared with experience
 City restoration and paving requirements had increased in every year of the project
 City permitting costs had increased significantly
 Peoples Gas changed directional digging procedures from those used through 2012.
2014 planning work produced a significant forecasted increase in Peoples Gas capital
expenditures. Financial executives noted additions to capital forecasts starting in 2018, to pay for
the replacement of additional “high consequence gas mains.” Management did not distribute this
forecast immediately to executives and the boards. The proposed acquisition of Integrys by
Wisconsin Energy led to a decision not to complete strategic planning in 2014. However, financial
management reports that it alerted senior executive and the Integrys board that large expenditures
loomed on the horizon.
ii. ICR and Qualifying Infrastructure Plan Mechanisms
Peoples Gas first proposed a cost recovery rider to help fund a long-term accelerated main
replacement program in its 2007 rate case. The Commission’s rate case order included a
“roadmap” of the details required for the Commission to consider a rider in the future. The Peoples
Gas 2009 rate case filing used a forecasted test period. The Company provided more details and
data regarding an accelerated main replacement and potential cost recovery. The ICC approved
the “ICR Rider” for Peoples Gas in 2010. The ICR included a baseline amount of expenditures
above which the rider would become effective.
The ICR Rider was overturned in September 2011. Management considered changing the pace of
AMRP expenditures. The Company determined that traditional ratemaking processes would
mitigate the regulatory lag accompanying the overturning of the ICR rider. Management reports
that it decided to continue with AMRP work, for at least the next two years, pending approval of
a recovery mechanism it would find satisfactory.
Efforts to secure such a mechanism proved successful. The resulting Qualifying Infrastructure
Plant Surcharge covers the AMRP and pressure increase and meter relocation work. Accelerated
recovery commenced in 2014, with a term of 10 years. The surcharge provides for a return on
installed capital costs using the last authorized return on rate base. It includes a 4.0 percent cap,
applied to base rate revenues, on cumulative average billings under the rider since the last rate
case. A 5.5 percent annual maximum also applies.

The Director of Finance – Gas’ group works with the AMRP project managers annually to capture
future expenditures for budgeting and for long-term financial planning. The AMRP operates under
a five-year rolling plan. Annually, the Director of Finance - Gas communicates with the Treasury
department to establish a proposed first-year target total capital expenditure number for Peoples
Gas (it includes the AMRP budget) as part of the budgeting process.
iii. Financing
The ability to fund AMRP capital expenditures through external financing and equity could
constrain progress. Integrys financial executives do not believe Peoples Gas has faced or will face
risk due to limitations on outside financing, provided that the Company’s credit profile remains
strong. The public and private debt markets have a large appetite for high-quality utility bonds.
For instance, Peoples Gas recently priced and sold $200 million of long-term debt.
Capital expenditure levels require external financings by Peoples Gas nearly annually. Financial
management forecasts long-term debt issuances in three of the next four years. Over this period,
equity funding will come from internal cash flow and retained earnings. Peoples Gas has halted
dividends to the parent. Integrys forecasts that equity sufficient for the holding and operating
companies will remain sufficient at least through 2016. A currently inactive dividend reinvestment
plan could resume if needed to secure equity capital not now seen as needed.
Liberty questioned whether significantly increased capital expenditure requirements could cause
financing difficulties. Management observed that current capital expenditure levels of $300
million per year present no significant financing challenges. They anticipate that Peoples Gas
could accommodate a reasonably-substantial increase if credit ratings remain strong. Management
does, however, cite AMRP cost recovery problems as a potential financing limitation. Should
AMRP expenditures exceed the Qualifying Infrastructure Plan’s recovery limits, a small increase
in financing might result, but management does not believe it likely to impose a material constraint
on securing financing at desirable rates.
iv. Capital Expenditure Budgeting
The Long Term Financial Plan has comprised part of the strategic plan presented to the Integrys
board at its annual June retreat. That did not happen with suspension of planning activities in 2014,
however. With this exception, the capital budgeting model has opened in June for capital
expenditure inputs entered by the business units. Managers in the gas business provide capital
expenditures estimates using a bottom-up consideration of work plans. They provide a basis for
management’s preparation of early capital budget information. The capital budgeting process
otherwise has used the first two years of the Long Term Financial Plan to set targets for capital
budgeting work. The model is closed for inputs in September. The next step is for managers to
refine and summarize the capital budget for presentation to Integrys executives. Following
approval by the holding company executives in October, further capital budget refinements and
explanations continue, in anticipation of holding company board approval in December.
d.

Executive and Board Monitoring of AMRP Progress

Members of the Executive Steering Committee and of the two boards (Integrys and Peoples Gas)
need regular updates and progress reports that allow them to oversee and monitor the AMRP on a
May 5, 2015

real-time basis and at a sufficiently comprehensive and detailed level. The quality and accuracy of
all reports and updates at each level above program management should be commensurate with
their responsibilities. Such reports should clearly communicate achievement (or failure) on key
performance indicators and other project metrics. Such indicators and metrics need to measure
progress against approved work plans and budgets, and against the long-term goals and milestones
required to meet the 20-year commitment.
i. AMRP Monitoring by the Executive Steering Committee
The Executive Steering Committee has primary responsibility (above the program management
level) for executive monitoring of the AMRP. The Committee members in 2011 included the
Integrys Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), the People’s Gas President, the Vice President of Gas,
the Integrys CFO, the Integrys Controller, the AMRP project manager, and two others. Committee
members state that regular meetings occur on a quarterly (and sometimes a more frequent) basis.
However, Company records document meetings on a far less frequent basis (two to three times per
year), following the initial December 2010 meeting:
 2011: May and October
 2012: July and October
 2013: April, August and October
 2014: February and July (through October).
Documented presentations accompanied each of these Committee meetings. The May 2011
presentation, coming shortly after AMRP commencement, was relatively brief. It noted main and
service installations and retirements planned for 2011. Procurement of contractors was to be
accomplished through three rounds of “bid letting RFP” processes. The presentation identified
project locations for the work contracted through the bid processes, with the number of subprojects, miles installed and miles retired identified for each package.
The October 2011 presentation addressed Rider ICR status, 2011 project statistics, 2011 project
status, a financial forecast, safety performance, project challenges, and the 2012 plan and schedule.
The presentation noted that, as of early October, progress appeared well behind plan.
The 66-page July 2012 presentation, titled “Program Update Quarterly Meeting,” had content
identical to a contemporaneous presentation to the Peoples Gas board. The topics included safety
performance, quality performance, budgets for 2012 and 2013, 2013 engineering projects,
construction planning information, a construction contractor update, and a gas operations
construction update. The categories covered in the presentation remained consistent from this
presentation through the 2013 presentations, with special topics and focuses addressed in each.
The three Executive Steering Committee presentations in 2013 focused on safety performance,
construction progress, budgets and budget forecasts, and special items. These items included the
2013 scope of work, new initiatives, Chicago Department of Transportation issues, information
technology support needs, 2014 construction improvements, 2014 challenges, AMRP Project
Management Office resources and Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge compliance.
The 2014 presentations in February and July included an increased focus on progress in
construction and performance measures. The 2014 presentations also added descriptions of the

initiatives (such as those resulting from PwC efforts) designed to improve program performance,
and discussed filings seeking a rate recovery mechanism. In addition, the July presentation
discussed a resource and recovery plan.
Work by an outside firm (PwC) in January 2011 noted the establishment of the Executive Steering
Committee, but observed the lack of a charter and reporting, and concluded that its involvement
had not been optimized. The firm recommended development of a charter, notice of program risks
and issues associated with key performance metrics, and engagement in assessing AMRP
organizational readiness. The documents that would implement this recommendation have not
been developed. Neither did Liberty’s review of Committee activities demonstrate broad
engagement on performance and organizational matters.
ii. Peoples Gas Quarterly Board Presentations
Typical in utility holding company structures, the Peoples Gas board consists of internal executives
or managers. Outside membership dominates at the Integrys level. The Peoples Gas board received
five AMRP update presentations through February 2012. These very general project updates took
an operational focus, addressing the formal capital approvals required from the utility and parent
boards, and discussing high-level project goals, risks, and progress made in 2011. The utility board
has not received any AMRP presentations since February 2012, for the cited reason that they had
become too voluminous.
Around this time, a program of Quarterly AMRP meetings (supported by presentations) began.
The presentations typically involved more than 100 employees, many of them executives. These
presentations generally included more than 100 slides. They contained more detail than those
provided to the Executive Steering Committee. Those Executive Committee meetings that have
occurred began immediately after these larger sessions. Top management considers the quarterly
meetings and the occasional Executive Committee sessions sufficient to all executives, including
Peoples Gas directors, sufficiently informed.
The following table lists “AMRP update presentations made to the Peoples Gas board and the
much more broadly attended quarterly session July 2014.”

iii. Integrys Board Monitoring
The Executive Vice President – Gas made the first AMRP presentation to the Integrys board in
December 2010. Since that time, the Integrys board has received a steady stream of high-level
AMRP information and project updates. The information has regularly included:
 Integrys Key Initiatives, 2010 – 2014: The Integrys CEO lists 8 to 10 “Key Strategic
Initiatives” each December for the board, senior executives and employees, to provide
direction and focus for the upcoming year.
 Capital Approvals, 2010 – 2014: The Integrys board reviews and approves capital approval
requests annually. The AMRP requests include short project backgrounds and descriptions,
a cost and recovery summary, and the requested approval amount.
 Integrys Strategic Plans, 2010 – 2013: The Integrys board review of the strategic plan at
its annual summer retreat includes the AMRP as a strategic initiative.
 Strategic Initiatives Updates, 2011 – 2014: “Strategic Initiatives” scorecards summarize
AMRP performance on safety, budgets, and miles of main retired. These scorecards came
before the board monthly in 2011, quarterly in 2012, only at the end of the year in 2013. A
quarterly approach resumed in 2014. The next figure provides an example of these onepage summaries.
 Status Report on Major Projects (at each board meeting): The Integrys board receives at
each meeting a scorecard (shown in the next figure) on major projects.
No supporting information accompanies this summary level depiction that the figure provides.

Trend

Reporting at top levels has not provided consistent messages. For example, the AMRP monthly
report for June 2014 showed an AMRP management self-rating for the month of June as “green”
for safety and as “red” for both budget and retirements. The monthly report indicators for budget
and retirements indicate spending well below planned levels. Progress curves showed miles of
mains retired, services installed and blocks of restoration all well below plan. The Executive
Steering Committee report for July 30, 2014 reported on construction status as of the week of July
18, 2014. Listings of miles of main retired and numbers of services installed showed both to lie
well below planned, year-end amounts.
Utility board minutes did not mention AMRP performance for 2014 meetings through July. An
August 14, 2014 report on major projects to the Integrys board updated AMRP progress through
June 15, 2014. This report rated the AMRP as green on both “project budget status” and on an
“overall status.” The status report included short explanatory text for the performance ratings:
Budget status is Green, however, spending is tracking well below plan and is not supportive
of recovery under the QIP (recovery mechanism). Estimates on investment recovery are
still being developed, but projections indicate costs recoverable under QIP will be below
original estimates. Overall project status is Green, but retirement of old main is lagging

behind planned retirements… Main retirements are tracking behind plan, as are services
(58%) and meter (48%) installations.

3. Conclusions
N.1

The AMRP has been given appropriate and prominent corporate priority and
commitment in strategic plans and initiatives.

The AMRP properly aligns with the Integrys vision, missions, and strategies. The strategic plan
and the planning process place sufficient focus on the AMRP. Strategic plans undergo
reassessment annually, and represent the primary process for Company planning and commitments
on a long-term basis. Key components of strategic plans include strategic initiatives or major
projects, such as AMRP.
Liberty reviewed strategic plans presented at the Integrys board’s annual planning retreat since
2010. The AMRP project has comprised a major strategic initiative for Integrys since at least 2010.
Top management and the Integrys board have appropriately established the AMRP as a prominent
corporate priority and commitment in the Integrys strategic plans and initiatives.
N.2

Peoples Gas has not faced holding company constraints on financial resource
allocations to fund capital expenditures.

The AMRP depends upon holding company resource allocation decisions, including funding and
access to capital. Funding constraints from the Integrys board or executive levels regarding capital
resource allocation and prioritization could materially affect the program, but this has not been the
case. Executives and the boards have supported the application of adequate financial resources
based upon clear strategic plans that include the allocation of financial resources. The budgeting
process sufficiently links to strategic plans, and supports the implementation of AMRP and
progress toward meeting the project’s goals, objectives and schedules.
This conclusion does not address tactical decisions, such as rate recovery limitations, but rather
more strategic capital access and allocation issues among Integrys businesses. AMRP cost
planning appears driven by conformity to a budget that ensures expenditures that approach but do
not exceed limits on accelerated recovery under the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge.
Even under that driver, AMRP management has had difficulty in meeting planned expenditure
targets through the program’s early history. This report’s chapters G: Cost Planning and L: Cost
Management address accelerated rate recovery and AMRP spending further.
N.3

Integrys does not anticipate constrained funding or external financing for AMRP,
even should increased capital expenditure spending become required.

The ability of Peoples Gas and Integrys to fund AMRP capital expenditures through external
financing sources and equity capital has the potential for constraining AMRP progress. However,
Liberty observed no substantial risk that parent or utility financial circumstances will cause that
impact. Historically, Peoples Gas has not been constrained in raising debt or equity capital to
finance major capital expenditures, with the exception of a few weeks during the extreme case of
the 2008/2009 national financial crisis.

Phase One Final Report

Chapter N: Executive Oversight

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Ample sources of investment for debt capital exist for utilities, such as Peoples Gas, that have
strong credit ratings. Credit ratings determine financeability and debt pricing for Peoples Gas. The
current “A” rating for Peoples Gas bonds is sufficiently strong to effectively attract low-cost debt
financing at reasonable costs.
Liberty also sought to determine if any large increases in capital spending for AMRP might impose
significant financing constraints. Liberty found reasonable the opinions of Integrys financial
executives that continuation of a strong credit profile would sustain significantly increased
expenditures without creating material financing constraints or impacts.
N.4

The governance roles of the Executive Steering Committee and the Peoples Gas board
for AMRP oversight, monitoring and decision authority remain weakly defined.
(Recommendation N.1)

Senior Integrys leadership views the Executive Steering Committee as the primary vehicle for toplevel oversight of the AMRP. The lack of defined governance for the Committee has persisted
since project inception in 2011. Liberty found no Executive Steering Committee charter. Top
Integrys management acknowledges that management and controls have substantially lagged
dollars spent and work performed in the field. The Committee’s role and authority remain unclear.
Defining and structuring AMRP governance remains a substantial weakness. Executive ownership
(outside the very large Executive Steering Committee) has not been clearly assigned. The mission,
roles, and responsibilities of the senior oversight function have not been clearly defined or
articulated. Clear accountability for AMRP performance at senior executive levels has not been
clearly identified.
N.5

Oversight through the Executive Steering Committee has been intermittent and
lacking in clear follow-through and corrective actions to address performance
shortfalls. (Recommendation N.2)

Key attributes of effective oversight include: (a) frequent meetings and discussion, (b) regular
reporting schedules, (c) key performance metrics focusing on progress against plan, (d) project
reporting with “insightful analysis,” (e) executive summaries of analysis for upward board
reporting, and (f) documented meetings and decisions with agenda/minutes/reports.
Despite reports of quarterly meeting cycles, Liberty found that Executive Steering Committee
meetings occurred on a significantly less frequent basis. Even meetings as infrequently as quarterly
would be hard to square with the needs and magnitude of the AMRP. The frequency of meetings
does not support the focused oversight and monitoring required.
Moreover, a review of the Committee’s efforts does not demonstrate an aggressive level of
engagement in identifying and addressing AMRP performance issues. The Committee has not
documented meetings and decisions with agendas/minutes/reports. Liberty did observe attention
by the Executive Steering Committee and the Peoples Gas board to remain informed about the
program. Liberty could not, however, identify a structured and well-defined set of oversight,
monitoring and decision authority guidelines, information requirements, and points of control.

ICC14GAS0002

There has not been sufficiently active board of director oversight and monitoring of
the AMRP. (Recommendation N.3)

The utility board of directors nominally approves capital expenditure budgets, financings, and
major contracts. As is typical of holding company structures, however, it does so through a board
consisting of inside (employee) executive and management leadership, with no representation
from outsiders. AMRP update presentations came before the Peoples Gas board only rarely and
they ceased after February 2012. These presentations focused on the formal approvals required as
a matter of law, and not on program performance metrics. Thus, the utility board cannot be said to
have operated as a source of close performance oversight, even when it was receiving occasional
AMRP presentations. Liberty’s review of utility board minutes found mention of the AMRP on
only four occasions, with the last being in September 2012.
Independent oversight of management performance in the typical holding company structure, as
is the case for Integrys/Peoples Gas, comes from a parent board comprised predominantly of
outsiders. It is neither surprising nor troubling to find utility subsidiary boards operating through
internal executives and focusing on legal and pro forma governance requirements. That said,
however, it becomes important to examine the parent board’s AMRP oversight role and
performance, given that we did not find robust AMRP oversight at the utility board level.
Communication AMRP project performance to the Integrys board has produced an overly positive
view. Discussions with a director, for example, elicited the view of a program very well executed
and managed. This report found, the Company’s own consultant has observed, and executive
management (we believe) acknowledges many important gaps in program management, control,
and oversight. Management’s current acknowledgement is constructive, but demonstrates the
variance between director perception and performance under the AMRP. The gap between actual
program status and the picture presented to directors shows significant communications failure,
whether it arises from a lack of management awareness, a lack of clear board expression of the
need for better information, or some other cause.
Liberty examined reporting at various levels to determine the consistency of information received
at each. This review disclosed inconsistencies as program data moved “upward.” Liberty found
instances where reporting on the project to the Integrys board appeared different and more positive
than the monthly reports at the program and project management level.
N.7

Top-level AMRP performance metrics and reports have not emphasized or clearly
reflected performance against plans and budgets. (Recommendation N.4)

Liberty found a lack of sufficient scope and detail in the AMRP performance metrics and reports
to the Executive Steering Committee and to the boards. In particular, reports have lacked detailed
information about program planned versus actual progress, insights into the causes of variances,
and descriptions of responsive action plans.
Such reports should clearly communicate achievement (or failure) against key performance
indicators and other metrics that measure progress against approved work plans, budgets,
schedules, and other measures (such as work quality and safety). Measurements should track
progress against short-term (e.g., annual) targets, as well as progress against long-term goals and
milestones required to meet the 20-year commitment.

AMRP performance metrics and reports to the Executive Steering Committee and the boards
should emphasize and clearly reflect project progress and performance to plan/budget. However,
performance metrics at the Executive Steering Committee level or higher up have not robustly
considered progress versus budget or work plan. According to Company executives, they were
unsure as to “how solid the AMRP plan was,” and avoided hard comparisons of actuals versus the
plan, especially in the first year of the project.
Monthly reports provide program management with its principal regular documentation of AMRP
progress. By the time progress information reaches the Executive Steering Committee through
reports and updates that it receives, however, a more favorable view of program progress and status
emerges. The same is true of information that comes before the Integrys board of directors. Use of
a consistent set of measures for cost efficiency and effectiveness to keep people informed all the
way up the management hierarchy was not apparent.
N.8

Measurements of annual or cumulative progress versus the long-term plan goals and
metrics have not been performed for the Executive Steering Committee or the Peoples
Gas or Integrys boards. (Recommendation N.5)

Key attributes of effective AMRP oversight include identification and regular use of key
performance metrics to focus on progress versus plans. Liberty did not observe such measurements
in reporting to the Executive Steering Committee or the boards of directors. The AMRP original
20-year plan has not been updated recently. Without a clear, comprehensive, and regularly updated
20-year plan, senior executive and board of director oversight cannot exist at a sufficiently
meaningful level. The AMRP requires clearly established and communicated 20-year goals, capital
spending and key progress metrics. Measurements of annual and cumulative project progress
against the plan may then be regularly reported to the Executive Steering Committee and Peoples
Gas and Integrys boards.

4. Recommendations
N.1

Peoples Gas should clearly define and document the AMRP governance roles of the
Executive Steering Committee with mission statements, charters, and roles and
responsibilities for project oversight, monitoring and decision authority. (Conclusion
N.4)

Liberty found that lack of definition and corresponding lack of structure in providing AMRP
oversight at the corporate leadership level have persisted since program inception. Peoples Gas
has acknowledged the need for developing a formal structure for AMRP governance and oversight.
Following discussions with Liberty, beginning in September 2014, the Company identified plans
to address oversight issues.
Liberty found the Company’s stated commitment to greater structure of the oversight function and
its relationship to AMRP leadership appropriate as a first step. That commitment, however, needs
to distinguish itself from previous oversight methods, in order to prove more effective. The
proposed new group of oversight participants remains very broad and not fully independent of
AMRP management. Identifying “executive overseers” as the entire Executive Steering
Committee and the board of directors makes from 25 to 30 individuals responsible for oversight.

ICC14GAS0002

A number of these individuals are not senior executives. Including the Integrys Executive Vice
President – Gas and some other proposed Executive Steering Committee members also does not
meet the standard of “independence” as defined in the Peoples Gas criteria.
Liberty believes that concentrating the senior executive level oversight function to a group of
perhaps three executives is appropriate. Use of the Executive Steering Committee as an organ for
keeping a broad group of executives and senior managers aware of the current status of a program
as important as the AMRP continues to be appropriate. Inviting comment and suggestion from the
group as part of that process is also sound. The concern about making such a group responsible for
a clearly defined oversight function, however, is a tendency toward diffusion of accountability.
That diffusion will tend inevitably to reduce detailed information toward a lower common
denominator. Keeping the oversight group very small and at the highest levels will better support
clarity of role, detail of oversight provided, and accountability for using information to identify
improvement opportunities.
In any event, clarity of membership, responsibilities, regular reporting and meeting requirements,
and expectations for the group should be included in the mission statement, charter and oversight
roles and responsibilities documentation that the Company states it is committed to developing.
Peoples Gas has stated to Liberty that it plans to complete documentation addressing AMRP
mission, roles and responsibilities of top-level program oversight.
The initiatives as described are positive, but the definition of mission, charter, roles and
responsibilities, and decision authority for project executive oversight must be completed and
implemented with dispatch, and with the refinements expressed above.
N.2

Peoples Gas should promptly execute its current plans to provide for more regular
and effective oversight of AMRP and for follow-through and corrective actions to
address performance shortfalls. (Conclusion N.5)

The Executive Steering Committee has not met on a regular and frequent basis. The action plans
that Peoples Gas has shared with Liberty call for a redefinition of executive oversight of the
AMRP, specifically increasing scheduled review meetings and corrective actions to address
performance shortfalls and adverse trends.
The improvement initiatives proposed by Peoples Gas address AMRP executive oversight
frequency, engagement and corrective actions. However, turning these statements of intent and
general description of goals into an effective oversight function “on the ground” will take
significant change, not only in structure and documented practices and procedures, but also in
culture, attitude, and focus. Selling this new approach, particularly through engagement by and
instigation from the boards and top executive management, will be particularly important. Liberty
anticipates the need for a transition period that requires a fundamental shift in perception about
how top leadership can and should act to keep the AMRP on track as it progresses through what
remains a long duration. In particular, significant top-level impetus must apply to reinforcing the
message that senior leadership needs to remain engaged in holding program management
accountable for performance against much more than meeting expenditure targets. Specifically,
leadership should demand that management make performance levels, trends, and problems

transparent and meaningful at top levels, regularly engaging with management about those trends
and problems, and ensuring that corrective actions get identified and executed promptly.
N.3

Peoples Gas should substantially enhance the completeness and accuracy of AMRP
performance information provided to the boards of directors, and ensure its
consistency with information used by AMRP program management and provided to
the small executive group with designated responsibility for program oversight.
(Conclusion N.6)

Independent oversight of management performance for AMRP has come principally from the
Integrys board, where Liberty found reporting and views more positive than warranted. Reporting
on the project to the Integrys board was different from and more positive than the monthly reports
at the AMRP management level.
Executive management has acknowledged important gaps in program management and control,
and, as discussed in the preceding conclusions, created action plans for addressing them. Those
plans, however, do not explicitly address improvement in the accuracy and consistency of project
performance information at the board levels. The degree of disconnect in past reporting makes it
appropriate for Company plans to identify specifically how consistency will be maintained.
Reporting on a program like the AMRP must take place at many levels. It extends as far down as
supervision of direct work, and all the way up to the board of director level.
Such reporting obviously should “roll up” in level of detail as one moves upward in the
supervision/management/executive/director hierarchy. Supervisors in the field need to measure
performance often at the crew level or across durations as short as a day, or even a shift.
Information “depth” is thus paramount. Moreover, while their need for detail is extensive in their
areas of responsibility, they may have little or no concern even for summary level information in
other functional areas (information “breadth”). However, at higher levels in the hierarchy, the need
for depth decreases as the need for breadth increases.
The difference in needs, however, does not mean that different sources for information or
judgments about its significance should apply. To the contrary, the best run programs promote
consistency in information reporting as it rolls up or down the hierarchy. Use of consistent sources
of data and engagement by an experienced source of cost management resources form important
elements in ensuring that data underpinnings remain consistent and accurate as data information
flows through that hierarchy. Similarly, a suitably empowered and located cost management
organization has substantial importance in ensuring that analysis of and judgments about
performance data remain objective and transparent, particularly at higher levels. This report’s
Chapter L: Cost Management discusses the importance of the empowerment aspect of the cost
management function. For purposes of this chapter addressing oversight, the critical feature to
consider is the need to address explicitly how information accuracy, summarization level, and
objective, candid, and complete analysis will be maintained in order to support oversight needs.

ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should expand top-level AMRP performance metrics and reports to
include more actionable information, and to compare actual performance with plans
and budgets meaningfully. (Conclusion N.7)

Liberty found a lack of sufficient scope and detail in the AMRP performance metrics and reports
to the Executive Steering Committee and to the boards. Reporting lacked detailed information
about program planned versus actual progress, insights into the causes of variances, and
descriptions of responsive action plans. Reports should clearly communicate achievement (or
misses) of key performance indicators and metrics that measure progress against annual, approved
work plans, budgets and schedules. The degree to which project management and senior executives
are held accountable for project performance is crucial and important.
Regular reports should also compare a well-defined set of metrics to budget and plan on every
occasion. Such metrics should address progress against approved work plans, budgets, schedules,
and other measures (such as work quality and safety). Measurements should track progress against
short-term (e.g., annual) targets, as well as progress against long-term goals and milestones
required to meet the 20-year commitment. Liberty also recommends that measures be developed
for reporting cost efficiency in an informative manner (e.g., cost per mile installed or retired, cost
per service).
The initiatives that Peoples Gas has developed since discussions with Liberty began in September
2014 address needs that Liberty has observed. The Company’s outline of planned actions address
generally the need for changes in the nature and use of top-level metrics and reports, demonstrating
understanding of and acceptance by Peoples Gas of the gaps that need to be addressed. However,
it remains for the Company to turn this outline into a well-defined, complete set of measures, clear
responsibility for accumulating and using the information to report them, measures to ensure their
accuracy, plans to make them regularly available, and, most importantly, process for using them
to identify performance issues and respond to them.
N.5

Peoples Gas should upgrade AMRP performance metrics to include annual or
cumulative progress versus the long-term (20-year) plan goals and metrics for the
executive oversight group and the boards. (Conclusion N.8)

The preceding recommendation addressed immediate-term plans and budgets. Effective oversight
of the AMRP also requires focus on how progress conforms to longer-term expectations. Over a
long period, factors unique to a given year (early in the ramp up period, or extreme weather, for
example) may diminish the “predictive” nature of experience over the past 12 months or so. Liberty
did not find material longer-term reporting or analysis at the Executive Steering Committee or
board levels. Moreover, as addressed elsewhere in this report, the original 20-year plan had not
been recently updated. Peoples Gas needs to clearly establish and communicate 20-year goals,
capital spending and key progress metrics, and to measure annual and cumulative project progress
against the plan in regular reports to the executive oversight group and to the boards. Reporting
also needs to consider effectiveness in meeting the AMRP’s overriding safety goal. How fast leak
rates are falling and how much risk mitigation is occurring need to be addressed.
The discussions that began between Liberty and the Company in September 2014 have led to
Company proposed improvement plans that recognize the need for long-term, as well as shortterm key performance indicators, and for the need to analyze performance across durations longer

than the current budget year. As is the case with Company plans to address measurement and
reporting against annual targets, however, what are now fairly general statements of intent need to
be translated (as the preceding recommendations observe with respect to annual measurement and
reporting) into a well-defined, complete set of measures, clear responsibility for accumulating and
using the information to report them, measures to ensure their accuracy, plans to make them
regularly available, and, most importantly, process for using them to identify performance issues
and respond to them.
N.6

Peoples Gas should employ outside assistance in designing and implementing the
initiatives it committed to undertaking to improve AMRP management, control, and
oversight. (Supported generally by conclusions throughout this report)

The discussions that began in September 2014 between Liberty and senior leadership of Integrys
and Peoples Gas led to Company commitments to make a broad range of improvements in AMRP
management, control, and oversight. This chapter addresses a number of those initiatives; i.e.,
those associated with executive oversight. As this chapter makes clear, the initiatives associated
with improving such oversight concern a number of improvements that must take place at the
AMRP program and project management levels. Other chapters of this report detail those lower
level but still critical changes.
Moreover, a number of the initiatives concern areas identified by consultants to the Company as
warranting improvement. Some of those consultant recommendations remain to be implemented,
years following their appearance. The breadth and depth of the changes to which the Company has
committed are extremely large. They will also be planned and executed under a Peoples Gas
executive structure that has undergone fundamental reorganization. Perhaps even more
significantly, the future of a new utility team is uncertain, given the pendency of a change in control
request. Care must be taken to ensure that continuation of the change process does not get
unnecessarily disrupted by changes that may come under potentially new ownership.
These factors combine to indicate the need for substantial outside assistance in planning and
implementing the changes required. Such assistance will also provide senior leadership with an
important source of validating the pace and effectiveness of changes. The AMRP management,
control, and oversight changes in and of themselves comprise a major program. History and the
scope and depth of required changes make it sound to seek such outside support in organizing,
facilitating, and measuring the change processes and the schedule for executing them.

Chapter O: Reports and Analysis and Controls Skills
1. Background
This chapter:
 Examines the reporting used to monitor AMRP progress against defined standards and
targets
 Evaluates the sufficiency of analysis of reported information to support the optimization of
AMRP performance
 Assesses the organization and resources engaged to provide such reporting and perform
such analysis
 Addresses the capabilities of personnel in the program and project controls functions to
meet AMRP needs.
A program such as the AMRP requires controls personnel with a high level of analytical skill.
Management at all levels needs help in the analysis and facilitation of corrective action. A
professional controls staff best serves this need. A program of the size and duration of the AMRP
justifies investment in developing resources able to meet the need.
Discussions of management tools generally begin with “reports.” They represent the one tool that
large projects rarely lack. Unfortunately, the industry has a tendency toward project reports long
on data but short on analysis, and lacking the value that such analysis adds. Reports with a strong
analytical component differ, however. When they identify performance issues and their causes,
together with potential corrective measures, they offer substantial value in optimizing
performance, especially for long duration programs like the AMRP.
Liberty applies a number of standards by which it evaluates the effectiveness of project reports.
This chapter and Chapter V: Monitoring discuss them.

2. Findings
a. Reports and Analysis
i. Overview
Liberty has not found a sufficient level of reporting. More fundamentally, program management
and those responsible for program oversight have not made effective use of performance results to
drive improvement actions. This gap exists from the board of directors and executive management
down to day-to-day supervision. Reports exist, but preparing them only starts to fulfill the need;
using them as an instigator of corrective action gives them their principal usefulness.
Discussions that Liberty began with senior leadership of Integrys and Peoples Gas last September
identified the need for a review of current reporting. That review needs to follow the guiding
principle that the value of a report intended for management or oversight purposes is proportional
to the degree to which it facilitates action on the part of the reader. Reports tend most often to fail
because those involved too frequently explain away deviations with pat answers (e.g., spending
lags behind the plan because of delayed invoices; construction lags behind schedule because of the

bad winter, the project exceeded budget because of a bad estimate rather than weak performance).
Such over-used explanations frequently obscure, rather than explain the real reasons; i.e., the root
causes. Performance measures only have real merit when analysis transforms them into meaningful
performance insights. A chart (or the underlying data) does not communicate much until
researching and interpretation what exists behind the obvious allows for informed judgments about
root causes.
Effective monitoring has the following characteristics: importance-focus (zeroing in on critical or
significant areas), insightful analysis (what drives variances), action orientation (what can be done
better), and accountability (who must take corrective action, when, and how).
Chapter V: Monitoring provides a more detailed discussion of the foundation for Liberty’s general
reporting standards. Beginning from those more general standards, this portion of the report
focuses on reporting that serves owner program management and oversight.
ii. Standards of Performance
Effective analysis of performance requires clear benchmarks or metrics against which to measure.
Some kind of plan generally establishes the basis for the work and the expectations for its
performance. Such guidance finds expression in a high-level plan, a budget, a schedule, quality
targets, safety indices, or similar assumptions made at some point during program or project
planning. A very longstanding approach to project management compares actual performance
against these previously established standards, analyzes deviations from those standards, identifies
appropriate corrective action, reflects those actions in a revised plan as appropriate, and provides
for measurement of those actions in correcting the problems that led to their adoption.
This long-standing approach has a much greater likelihood of failure when applied to large,
complex projects and programs. Programs like the AMRP magnify the circumstances under which
this traditional reporting approach often breaks down. Effectively holding people accountable
requires a standard that is reasonable, credible, and given high priority. A common problem lies
in the failure of original plans, budgets, or schedules to have substantial credibility. Where
credibility is lacking, hard-hitting testing of performance shortfalls by management has difficulty
in getting past out-of-the-box assertions, like “the estimate was bad,” for example.
Thus, management must exercise vigilance in ensuring the credibility of plans, budgets, and
schedules. Second, management must instill and enforce a philosophy that an “estimate is bad”
type of conclusion will gain acceptance only after proper examination tests the contribution of all
possible causes.
The AMRP’s early history did not comport with a number of the standards that apply. The
necessary baselines (plans, budgets, estimates, and schedules, for example) frequently did not
exist. Where they did, they have tended to lack sufficient credibility to serve as meaningful
standards. Program quantities and expectations for performance are not clearly defined. There is
no schedule to lay out the 20 years of required main, service, and meter installations. The AMRP
uses an outdated cost estimate that understates program costs, but still forms the basis for project
forecasts. Management does not accompany annual budgets with meaningful schedules or resource
plans. The AMRP regularly underspends its budgets. Management has not reconciled project

ICC14GAS0002

estimates to actual costs after work completion. These factors exemplify the need for substantial
improvement in setting credible standards. The existing gaps have made effective management
reporting impossible in the AMRP’s first stages.
iii. Analysis of Performance
A typical utility project report contains volumes of data and the AMRP’s regular reporting offers
no exception. AMRP reporting suffers from a problem Liberty has commonly found. Specifically,
management and leadership, whether at the project, executive, or board level, frequently find
themselves left to their own devices to analyze extensive data. A common failing in reports arises
from the assumption that everyone, regardless of level in the organization, has the time and ability
to dig behind the numbers. Such digging is required, for example to: (a) ferret out actionable
problems, (b) analyze the root causes of those problems, (c) intuitively grasp appropriate actions
in response, and (d) understand the resources needed to act accordingly. Regular reports too often
confuse the role of the analysts who contribute to reports and those who must read and makes
sense of them. AMRP reporting fits this description.
AMRP reporting must change to meet the primary measure for judging a report. Directly stated,
that measure consists of the degree to which reports facilitate management action. To meet this
measure, AMRP reporting requires adjustments that will give management: (a) a clear description
of performance gaps, (b) evidence supporting that description, (c) analysis of the primary causes
of problems, and (d) clear measures and alternatives for responsive, corrective action. The
discussions that Liberty and senior leadership began in September 2014 led to a significant level
of consensus on the need for improvement and to the design by Peoples Gas of initiatives to secure
that improvement. It remains for management to complete those initiatives. The best test of success
will be to observe the changes in reports, the attitudes of management toward their use, and
evidence that information reporting has produced responsive actions.
iv. Reporting Organization and Resources
Well-designed program management functions employ analysts skilled in performance analysis of
major, complex engineering and construction programs and projects. The skills of those
individuals must also include the ability to understand the unique technical aspects of the work.
Combining technical with analytical skills produces the ability to provide credible analysis and to
advance workable solutions. Such capability proves invaluable to program and more senior
leadership. Enhancement of the AMRP resources in this area also represents part of the Peoples
Gas initiatives resulting from the discussions that began last September.
v. AMRP Reporting
The AMRP monthly progress report comprises the central element of program reporting. This 50plus page document covers all program aspects. It presents, in various formats, data illustrative of
what has been done and is being done. Its primary focus is on work that occurs in the field. Liberty
found the report fundamentally unresponsive to program needs. Its design to “cover all the bases”
appears to create a false sense that its contents provide full knowledge of all important project
events, that management is on top of all parts of the project, and that progress is on or near plan.

May 5, 2015

Chapter O: Reports and Analysis and Controls Skills
ICC14GAS0002

Reports similar to the AMRP monthly progress report tend to keep everyone happy. Such reports
allow executives to feel informed and program managers to present an image of control. Yet such
reports rarely speak of problems, corrective measures, or failures to perform. The notion of a
manager saying through a project report that “I have a problem” is not common in the industry,
and AMRP managers have certainly not done so. The December 2014 report illustrates this
finding:
 Many presentations of data exist, but without context; i.e., the report provides numbers,
but gives the reader no way of knowing whether they represent good or bad results
 The report contains material difficult even to read (see pages 33-39).
 The report fails to provide important data and some reported data contains errors (see page
28, which Chapter B.1 of this report discusses).
 The report does not relate resource data to staffing required and its characterization of
resource data as “jobs created” seems aimed at objectives other than management of the
project (see page 31).
 Most importantly, no analysis accompanies any of the data, even though many charts
appear to beg analysis questions.
The flaws in the report indicate lack of clarity in defining the intended audience. Moreover,
Liberty’s discussions with management found that the report serves no meaningful management
purpose. The many levels and sources of management responsible for oversight of the AMRP
within Integrys and Peoples Gas increase the significance of this problem. Assuring common
understanding of critical project status information becomes more important as authority and
accountability spread to a wider set of people.
AMRP regular reporting does not provide a number of important types of support to program
management, including:
 Insightful analysis by capable program management staff, including clear identification of
problems and their causes.
 Specific identification of any failing organizations and managers, so that it is clear where
the responsibility for improvement lies.
 A focus on what is important: On a large project, it is not possible for managers and
executives to follow everything. In reporting and analysis, there must be concentration on
the paraphrased adage that 20 percent of the project makes up 80 percent of the costs, risks,
and opportunities.
 An action orientation: Clear discussion of the actions that should be taken and by whom.
There must be clearly defined expectations for what must be done.
b. Controls Skills
i. Background of Controls Personnel
Liberty evaluated the background and experience of the Project Management Office’s personnel
involved in project controls. Liberty’s review covered persons filling cost, scheduling, and contract
management roles. Jacobs Engineering provides most of the people serving in these AMRP roles.
We found the background, education, and experience of the team to be above average. Virtually
all of the people are degreed professionals, with most possessing engineering degrees. Several
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation

ICC14GAS0002

have advanced degrees. We found considerable experience levels as well. Six of the team members
have more than two decades of related experience. Liberty considers the mix of experience on the
team, from junior to senior people, excellent. As the cost, planning, estimating, and management
chapters of this report (Chapters G, K, and L) explain, however, significant concerns exist with
respect to the application of such skills in a well-constructed, suitably empowered organization.
ii. Analytical Capability
This report concludes in other chapters that the Project Management Office does not apply
analytical skills broadly and deeply in examining project performance. The degree to which the
organization has this capability therefore remains unknown. One might conclude from the
backgrounds of the AMRP controls personnel that the organization likely has this capability if
called upon, but Liberty’s work found no evidence that management has made substantial demands
to date.

3. Conclusions
O.1

AMRP reporting is not sufficient in level and quality to ensure that management has
complete and timely information about AMRP performance and progress.
(Recommendation O.1)

Liberty focused principally on the monthly report, which program management offered as the
primary source of communication. Other reports, however, have a similar lack of focus on
communicating information that is well organized, comprehensive, and subjected to careful and
insightful analysis.
O.2

AMRP management has not made effective use of performance results analysis to
drive improvement actions, from the board and executive management levels down
to day-to-day supervision. (Recommendation O.2)

Management is not well positioned to use performance results effectively, because it does not
receive performance results in an actionable or credible way. Liberty found a lack of focus on
management follow-up to address performance gaps, as this report discusses repeatedly in many
chapters.
O.3

The AMRP lacks a credible and comprehensive set of standards, which leaves it
without a prerequisite to effective AMRP reporting and performance analysis.
(Recommendation O.3)

Project measurement bases should find definition in program plans and in documentation of the
underlying assumptions. Budgets and schedules, for example, provide standards of performance
and management’s expectations regarding performance requirements. Management should hold
project organizations and contributors accountable to those standards. Management cannot seek
accountability where standards do not exist, or where standards lack credibility.

ICC14GAS0002

O.4

AMRP management has not given strong emphasis to creating a culture and a set of
capabilities for aggressive analysis. (Recommendation O.3)

The mass of data presented to management does not lend itself to meaningful analysis or valuable
insights. The organization has not yet shown the capabilities for such analysis or evidence that it
recognizes the need for making analysis a central element of program management.
O.5

The AMRP monthly progress report, (the primary vehicle for communicating AMRP
progress status and results to the boards of directors and to executive management),
requires significant overhaul. (Recommendation O.1)

The monthly progress report has existed in the same form for many years. Liberty was unable to
discern clear and meaningful use by managers or staff of this document. Moreover, the
presentation of information in the monthly progress report does not support the identification of
problems or corrective action.
O.6

Project controls personnel, supplied almost entirely by Jacobs Engineering, have
above average background, education and experience.

Few companies recognize the urgent need to staff the project control organization with welleducated and technically capable individuals. The AMRP provides an exception. Largely through
Jacobs Engineering personnel, the AMRP has a better than average team of cost and schedule
professionals.
O.7

Peoples Gas has not called upon its project controls personnel to provide the analysis
and facilitation of corrective action that the AMRP requires. (Recommendation O.5)

Given the apparent higher than average skill level of the people, the AMRP appears to underutilize them. They likely have the capability to provide the analytical contributions that
management does not appear to have demanded. The need for augmentation of cost estimating and
management resources may or may not make these personnel a potential pool of resources from
which to draw.

4. Recommendations
O.1

The AMRP Project Management Office should overhaul its approach to reporting,
with emphasis on defining and meeting the needs of managers and staff. (Conclusion
O.1 and O.5)

The purpose of the AMRP reports is unclear, and there does not appear to be a sound objective
behind the monthly report. Rather than focusing the report structure on what information the
program chooses to share, the structure should emphasize what information is needed by readers
and what they should be expected to do with it. The program should work with managers to define
their needs and then design reports to meet those needs.
O.2

Management should establish a framework for performance improvement based on
analysis of project performance and corrective actions. (Conclusion O.2)

One specific management need is information on program performance and how to facilitate
improvements where appropriate. Management should put in place a specific process to provide a
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Illinois Commerce Commission
Phase One Final Report
Chapter O: Reports and Analysis and Controls Skills
ICC14GAS0002

continuing means to understand and improve performance based on strong analysis of actual
progress.
O.3

In the course of its current improvement initiatives, Peoples Gas should redefine and
reestablish its standards for program performance. (Conclusions O.3)

Given the current lack of standards, Peoples Gas will be unable to provide the insightful analysis
needed. The current improvement initiatives should remedy this shortcoming. As Peoples Gas
develops these new budgets, plans, and other relevant documents, the Company should define and
communicate their intended use for future performance analysis and reporting.
O.4

The Project Management Office should establish a culture and a regular, defined,
comprehensive program that provides insightful analysis of program performance,
and should acquire the capability to perform such analyses. (Conclusion O.4)

The Project Management Office must overcome its reluctance to provide objective and, if
necessary, self-critical analysis. The greatest beneficiary of such analysis will be the Organization
itself. To accomplish this, the Project Management Office must develop an enhanced capability
for analysis.
Each executive should take a more active role in demanding information and analysis from the
project to fully support their oversight responsibilities. Executives must work with the program to
explain their needs and insist upon necessary analysis and reports. The burden is on the project to
provide that material, but executives must take the lead and insist upon responsive actions by the
project on a continuing basis.
O.5

Peoples Gas should expand the role of its project controls professionals to allow for
more analysis of project progress and performance and, in turn, support of
management by facilitating corrective action. (Conclusion O.7)

This report addresses specific analysis improvement opportunities in a number of chapters.
Management should address use of existing people to implement Liberty’s recommendations in
this regard. If they prove unsuitable, then further staff development or supplementing with added
skills will prove necessary.

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs
1. Background
Other chapters of this report address internal auditing of AMRP program and project management.
Principal among such auditing has been extensive work by an outside firm over a number of years.
The chapter focuses on how the Company’s internal audit group (Internal Audit Services) plans
and conducts audits of AMRP costs, considering the industry’s use of traditional methods that
assess the controls risks created by the nature, scope, and extent of work of programs such as the
AMRP.

2. Findings
a. Internal Audits
Integrys applies a fairly standard overall approach in designing its internal audit plans for each
year. The plans developed by Internal Audit Services consider the risks imposed by the operations
of Peoples Gas. An enterprise-wide risk assessment process drives audit planning. The process, as
typified by current industry thinking, identifies risks in relation to company objectives, assesses
the likelihood and potential impact of the risks identified, identifies existing risk mitigation
measures, assesses and incorporates additional mitigation measures determined to be effective,
trends risk levels, and monitors risks and mitigation measures quarterly.
The risk identification and impact elements of the enterprise risk management program comprise
primary drivers of annual audit planning. Testing related to the Sarbanes Oxley Act also forms a
component of audit planning.
Internal Audit Services, sometimes using outside expertise, has conducted a number of controlrelated audits of AMRP since its inception. Among them are:
 2010 Audit Plan: PwC assessment in connection with AMRP start-up addressing the
program’s controls environment, considering industry-leading practices for major utility
capital projects (note that this audit, as well as much of PwC’s follow-on work over
subsequent years for Internal Audit Services, has a strong program and project management
and oversight focus as well)
 2011 Audit Plan: Review of the contractor procurement process
 2011 and 2012 Audit Plan: Separate Reviews of compliance of Infrastructure Cost
Recovery (ICR) Rider overhead cost calculations with rider requirements (one for 2010
and the second for 2011)
 2011 Audit Plan: Verification of Infrastructure Cost Recovery Rider information sheet to
verify proper calculation of and support for charges under the rider
 2011 Audit Plan: AMRP Risk Assessment by PwC, including, among a number of program
and project management and oversight matters, a review of the process for reconciling
materials used versus those delivered
 2012 Audit Plan: Verification that design of processes and controls ensured valid and
proper union labor time recording

2012 Audit Plan: Verification that a construction close-out process adopted in the Spring
of 2012 ensured payment to contractors only for work performed, after resolution of open
issues, and after completion of compliance and contract requirements
2013 Audit Plan: Follow-up examination of materials reconciliation process to determine
adequacy of measures taken to improve the process of ensuring accurate and timely
materials reconciliation (found needed in the 2011 plan PwC work addressed above).
2013 Audit Plan: PwC assessment of AMRP governance approach, organizational
structure, and processes and procedures related to the program control environment.

The 2011 audit plan’s review of contractor procurement reviewed the use of a request for proposals
to solicit contractor bids, the process for narrowing 12 initial proposals to eight for final evaluation,
the content of the proposals, membership of the company bid evaluation team, the scoring by team
members, the selection of four firms to bid on 2011 projects, and the existence of master
agreements prior to work performance.
The second of the PwC engagements identified above included reviews of a number of areas
material to ensuring proper charging for work performed:
 Contract administration procedures
 Effectiveness of contractor scope change control process and procedures
 Procedures to validate costs being recovered
 Validation of contractor applications for payment.
The third PwC engagement assessed design and effectiveness of program management elements,
including project controls, examining:
 Project cost estimating policy and procedures in relation to individual projects, annual
projects, and AMRP costs to date
 Change management policy and procedures
 Policy and procedures for procurement of materials to ensure timely acquisition and avoid
construction delays
 Policy and procedures used to evaluate contractors selected for AMRP work.
b. 2014 Material and Equipment Control Initiatives
Recent Company investigations have led to a three-year program, whose implementation began at
the beginning of 2014, and which consists of 42 initiatives. Integrys has completed 29 of them.
They cover a very broad spectrum of actions to promote integrity (including the use of materials
and equipment required for AMRP work), among other matters affecting proper use of resources,
materials, and equipment. The next table summarizes Liberty’s overall characterization of the
areas into which the initiatives fall.

c. November 2014 Audit of Material Reconciliation
For 2013 AMRP projects, management added to vendor contracts a requirement to: (a) maintain
records supporting the reconciliation of materials delivered, transferred, and returned, and (b)
explain materials variances exceeding 10 percent. A November 2014 audit by Internal Audit
Services reported on an examination of the adequacy of reconciliation processes performed
through 2012. The audit included visits to contractor inventory yards. The audit found the
processes used inadequate for purposes of ensuring the proper recording of AMRP materials costs.
The audit found gaps (for pipes and valves greater than 2.0” in diameter) between charges in the
systems used for accounting versus facilities management purposes. Extrapolating the differences
across the remaining costs (i.e., in addition to those not sampled in audit testing) produced a
potential mismatch of $2.6 million for materials of this diameter through 2012. The audit also
found that a lack of inventory modeling created a risk of inadvertent use of expired materials. Note
that, while such a risk is important, Liberty’s field investigations did not find the use of expired
materials to be a significant problem. Note also that, while the mismatch reflected a significant
percentage of the equipment examined, total AMRP material costs through 2013 were only about
$22 million of $510 million in total AMRP capital spending.
Interestingly, delays in closing out AMRP projects (discussed in other chapters of the report)
contributed to the material reconciliation difficulties. The delays meant that contractors had more
than the anticipated number of projects or phases open contemporaneously. This factor led to
contractor mixing of materials among projects and phases without sufficient documentation. This
mixing affected material reconciliation adversely. Agreements with contractors in 2011 and 2012
did not require contractors to keep records that would support accurate materials reconciliation by
year, by project, or by phase. The audit found program management unable to explain significant
variances (over 10 percent) for those early AMRP projects for which preliminary materials
reconciliations had been performed.
In addition to recommending process, controls, and training improvements for projects beginning
with 2015, Internal Audit Services recommended completing preliminary reconciliations for all
historical projects, and documenting all variances found. The AMRP Project Management Office
accepted the recommendations generally, but stated that it “did not have sufficient information to
perform material reconciliations.” Instead, it proposed to compare material release information
with final as-built drawings for completed work, in order to “recommend an acceptable variance
range” for material quantities.
d. Liberty’s Field Investigations
Liberty learned that, at or near AMRP commencement, a significant unexplained absence of
materials (not necessarily related to AMRP work) occurred at a Peoples Gas inventory site.

May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Liberty’s field investigation work included a visit to a materials inventory location housing AMRP
materials. At this fairly remote location, Liberty observed a lack of close control over site access.
Liberty also found a lack of control over access to materials by persons who succeeded in gaining
entry to the facility. Liberty found the floor lined with large bins filled with materials that one
could readily remove. The materials included racks of piping and regulators to which easy access
existed. A crew leader observed to Liberty that visits to the site to pick up material occasionally
would find missing some materials set aside for particular work sites.

3. Conclusions
P.1

Plans for the performance of examinations of controls associated with charges to
AMRP work has occurred under a typically structured approach.

Integrys uses a typical approach to risk identification and audit planning, and has applied it yearly
to identify audit work related to internal and external costs charged to AMRP projects.
P.2

Audit work addressing charges to the AMRP addressed areas of risk important to
setting the foundation for the program.

Integrys made substantial use of outside expertise to review important aspects of ensuring control
over the process of charging, particularly by contractors, to AMRP work. Internal Audit Services
has also examined internal labor charging controls, overhead costs charged to the AMRP, and the
process for selecting AMRP contractors. The internal group’s work has also addressed the
reporting of AMRP costs to the Illinois Commerce Commission. These efforts showed due
attention to establishing a sound foundation for ensuring accurate recording of AMRP costs and
accurate reporting of program costs to the Illinois Commerce Commission.
P.3

The nature and extent of ongoing AMRP work requires focused and regular attention
to the verification of proper charges. (Recommendation P.1)

The AMRP depends heavily upon contractors, whose costs comprise a major portion of the
substantial annual costs for AMRP work. Those costs levels will remain very high for more than
a decade to come.
The Company has in a number of respects placed strong reliance on the use of lump-sum and unitcost contracts as a “natural” cost controller. This report’s Chapter M: Procurement and Contracting
(among others) addresses the wisdom of that reliance in terms of managing the AMRP
substantively. Here the issue is verification of the match between work actually performed and
that for which outside resources are compensated. Lump sum contracts do not obviate the need for
careful control over change orders. Moreover, even without change orders, verification of work
performance (and to applicable contract standards) remains necessary. The first line for ensuring
proper charges falls, as it should, to the organizations responsible for managing contractor work.
Prudence requires consideration of the risk that typical industry line of defense does not always
serve. Thus, the second line of defense that internal auditing brings becomes important. The
Internal Audit Services group has done a substantial amount of work to address change orders
from an administrative process perspective.

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs

While commendable, those efforts need follow up to ensure appropriate testing of adherence to
them. Those efforts also need to include testing designed to provide independent verification of
work performance and resource (e.g., materials and equipment and hours spent on time and
material change orders) consumption data as the AMRP progresses. Such testing has not formed a
significant part of audit efforts. The review of contractor selection for one year is an exception,
but one that should continue to be undertaken in the future as well.
Such testing needs to include focused examinations of the relationships between work billed and
work performed, and in the context of what contracts require. Regular testing by a source outside
of the contractor (or vendor)/program management relationship is key in ensuring that work paid
for equals work performed. That testing needs to include verification by this outside source of
claims of work performed, materials and equipment used, hours spent where they, and any other
relevant items, drive costs under the contractual relationships involved. It is in this important area
of verification that internal audit planning and execution need to focus at this and following AMRP
stages.
P.4

The scope of the three-year materials and equipment control initiatives instigated in
2014, indicate a substantial need for improvements in those controls.
(Recommendation P.2)

The nature and extent of the initiatives evidence a general need for enhancing controls. Moreover,
Liberty’s field inspection team visited an AMRP materials storage site, where it encountered
concerns about controls over access to materials used for unauthorized purposes. The scope and
depth of the three-year program begun by Peoples Gas about a year ago is commendable. Its scope
and length, however, make it appropriate to emphasize the need for careful attention and
monitoring of progress in completing the materials and equipment initiatives promptly and in a
manner designed to produce lasting improvement. This concern gains added impetus from the
other initiatives being undertaken by the Company to improve AMRP management, oversight, and
controls.
P.5

Control over material quantities recorded to AMRP project accounts has not been
sufficient; there is no reliable way to verify that wholly accurate materials cost
information underlies AMRP costs. (Recommendation P.3)

The November 2014 examination of materials reconciliation by Internal Audit Services raises
concern from the perspective of program management effectiveness. It has equal and perhaps
greater concern for its potential impacts on the confidence that the Illinois Commerce Commission
and stakeholders can and should have on the accuracy of AMRP costs that Peoples Gas are
recovering through rates.
The amounts directly implicated by the audit’s specific test work represent only a small portion of
AMRP costs. That said, the casting of doubt about costs underlying even a small portion of rates
undermines the regulatory confidence that should always form a hallmark of utility management
and operation. Moreover, the Project Management Office belief that it does have a method for
determining the level of inaccuracy that exists:
 Underscores the AMRP management, control, and oversight weaknesses that other
chapters of this report address,

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Calls for development of more than the current, vague commitment to ensuring a
reasonably accurate measure of inaccuracy in the known area of concern
Begs the question of what review outside of the AMRP management organization is
required to provide confidence that similar concerns do not underlie other areas of AMRP
cost.

4. Recommendations
P.1

Peoples Gas should conduct a comprehensive assessment of AMRP risks associated
with potential mismatches between work performed and work charged, and develop
an ongoing program of annual testing designed to mitigate the risks identified.
(Conclusion P.1)

The AMRP has by now generated sufficient history to support a focused assessment of where risk
exists and in what magnitudes. The Company has already addressed key areas of risk (e.g., internal
labor hour charges, overheads, contractor selection, materials reconciliation, and change orders)
for purposes of identifying processes and procedures to control those risks. The study
recommended here should focus on what steps are appropriate to ensuring that those processes are
rigorously and honestly applied. In particular Peoples Gas needs to assure the Illinois Commerce
Commission and stakeholders that it will perform sufficient outside testing of the integrity of
reported information that drives costs and rates.
Test designers must recognize that reliance on the project management and administration
organizations should be backstopped sufficiently to give confidence that project personnel are
using verifiable data, and using it objectively.
The resulting program should provide for a meaningful level of annual testing. Recognizing the
long-term relationships with outsiders on which the AMRP depends, it should also operate in a
way that makes all outsiders in those relationships aware that their engagement in matters with
charging and billing consequence is subject to certain review at unpredictable intervals.
P.2

Peoples Gas should provide for dedicated, executive level sponsorship of the threeyear materials and equipment control initiatives program and provide a regular
method of reporting progress to the Illinois Commerce Commission. (Conclusion P.4)

The Illinois Commerce Commission did not engage Liberty to perform a forensic audit of controls
associated with matters of personal integrity or honesty that may affect the AMRP, and Liberty
did not do so. Thus, Liberty is not prepared to offer judgments about the sufficiency of the scope
of the three-year materials and equipment control initiatives to address all the matters observed by
Peoples Gas (or that may exist and not have yet been observed) that underlie the development of
those initiatives.
Nevertheless, Liberty understands that risks associated with such forms of behavior comprise an
area requiring comprehensive and well-executed controls. Having no independently derived
knowledge of the forces, factors, and events that specifically underlie the institution of the
initiatives, however, does not present a barrier to concluding that management has recognized a
broadly based agenda for change. In a specific way, it reflects the breadth of the more general

May 5, 2015

Page P-6
The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

AMRP management, control, and oversight initiatives that Peoples Gas has proposed since
discussions with Liberty about the need for major change that arose in September 2014.
It is reasonable to conclude that the Company considers risks in the areas addressed by the
initiatives to be relatively high and that those risks warrant a broad array of changes. With senior
leadership already facing such a large AMRP change agenda, it becomes imperative to making a
senior parent-level executive champion accountable for executing the initiatives. That executive
should have accountability for gauging how deeply they are accepted and are guiding the personal
conduct of executives, managers, and other employees. The executive should also be charged with
reinforcing them as central to the values and culture of the enterprise. Such a champion should
have the support of executive level parent (recognizing the material levels of AMRP support that
come from Integrys organizations) and utility management to track and measure progress and to
identify and resolve problems and progress lags quickly and effectively.
Change of the types initiated need a supportive corporate culture. They lie at the heart of ethical
performance as nearly universally described in statements of corporate vision and values by major
corporations today. Therefore, the boards of directors should also require routine, continual
tracking of status in implementing the initiatives. The boards should also demand from senior
executive leadership methods for gauging the effectiveness of measures that have been put into
place.
Integrity, or more particularly its importance in the performance of public service responsibilities,
also make important regular reporting to the Illinois Commerce Commission and stakeholders of
progress in implementing these initiatives. The underlying circumstances implied by the
magnitude of the initiatives being undertaken underscore this reporting need.
P.3

Peoples Gas should promptly: (a) correct the potential gap that exists with respect to
ensuring the accuracy of material and equipment costs charged to the AMRP, (b)
develop a method for reliably and accurately determining independently the
magnitude of any error in AMRP material and equipment costs being included in
rate recovery, and (c) devise and implement a similarly independent testing program
to verify that no material risk exists with respect to AMRP costs subject to rate
recovery. (Conclusion P.5)

The Internal Audit Services group issued its report about material and equipment reconciliation
only recently (November 2014). The Company must promptly verify completion of measures that
will address the inability to ensure that material and equipment costs charged to the AMRP match
those actually spent. The Company also needs to verify that they have been recorded and reported
under appropriate controls. Verification efforts should include the testing of specific transactions
and activities.
Second, the very general comments of AMRP management about reconciliations for completed
work are more notable for their observation that it cannot be done, than for giving comfort as to
the reliability of valuations performed. Extremely general statements about a “variance range”
need to be replaced immediately with a plan for providing a specific set of calculations (and Illinois
Commerce Commission reporting) whose reliability and accuracy is fully vetted. That plan must
instill confidence that it provides not only a sound method, but the most accurate one. It needs to
May 5, 2015

Page P-7
The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter P: Auditing of AMRP Costs

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

follow consideration of a robust range of alternatives and the best information available for
populating the calculations it will require. Leadership of this effort by Company resources outside
AMRP management is required.
Third, when questions arise about the accuracy of costs entered into accounts and systems that
drive rate recovery, focused and high-level attention are required. It becomes prudent to ensure
that one’s range of vision in examining potential risks to customers is not unduly restricted by
focusing only on the circumstances directly at issue. Good auditing practice, which the Integrys
approach (as described to Liberty) follows, calls for robust risk assessment in forming plans for
the examinations to be conducted.
What is required for the AMRP is a ground-up, fresh examination of rate risk. This examination
needs to consider, but not limit itself to the materials and equipment reconciliation issue.
Moreover, the examination needs to identify how the problem that has arisen may bear on what
risks exist in other areas. As with the preceding element of this recommendation, that examination
must fall under the direction of resources outside both AMRP and rate/regulatory leadership and
management. The examination should produce a clear and comprehensive assessment of improper
recovery risk, and develop plans for testing.
Reporting of the assessment and planning processes should be made promptly to the Illinois
Commerce Commission on completion. The same is true for reporting of specific tests,
examinations, and audits. At least internally to Integrys and Peoples Gas, if not to the Illinois
Commerce Commission as well, executives outside the AMRP and rate/regulatory leadership and
management chain should be prepared regularly to certify that, to the best of their knowledge,
information, and belief, all costs claimed for AMRP rate recovery contain no material error. That
certification should rely on explicitly stated confidence in the testing plan and the results of tests
conducted. Materiality should be defined with reference to size of the retail rate elements or
components under which AMRP costs are recovered.

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance
1. Background
This chapter addresses a number of issues associated with performance of AMRP work in the field:
 Quality of materials installed
 Conformity of field work to engineering and construction standards and requirements
 Consideration of field conditions
 Training and experience of field personnel
 Subsurface investigation
 Unexpected field conditions.
Extensive site inspections performed by an experienced Liberty team formed the primary basis of
the examination of these issues. Liberty conducted many site inspections of AMRP field work
across the 2014 construction season. Three Liberty team members conducted these field
inspections. Each has prior familiarity with the Peoples Gas system and practices. All worked on
the Liberty team that conducted a 2008 management and safety audit of Peoples Gas for the Illinois
Commerce Commission. Each has more than 30 years of natural gas industry experience. Two
have served state utility regulatory commissions as state safety regulators. All three have on a
number of occasions examined natural gas field work from safety and from efficiency and
effectiveness perspectives.
The inspections encompassed more than 12 person-weeks of on-site visits, generally at four to five
sites per day. The team also met with field supervision and management to discuss activities and
observations. Liberty’s inspection activities encompassed a wide variety of AMRP work and crew
types and locations throughout the City of Chicago. The inspections covered all three,
geographically aligned Shops into which Peoples Gas divided work performed in the field. The
following sections of this chapter summarize the results of those investigations, supplemented by
information learned through document reviews and interviews at central Company offices.

2. Findings
a. Materials
Liberty’s site inspection work included an examination of materials used. The major focus of the
inspection work addressing materials included pipe, fittings, and valves. The inspections also
included other material used at work sites. Liberty examined the conformity of materials with
installation requirements, Peoples Gas specifications, and regulatory requirements.
The significant materials-related observations from these inspections include:
 With a single exception, pipe met requirements related to age and Company specifications.
The one exception involved pipe more than one year old and stored in direct sunlight. This
instance did not raise a safety issue. It nevertheless required correction because plastic pipe
siting in direct sunlight can degrade over an extended time.
 Liberty observed an installation in which two ¼-turn ball valves had broken stops.
Installers broke off the stops by over-stressing them during initial operation. Liberty’s



inspector determined that the valves were of good quality. Operating them improperly
caused the damage.
In none of the cases did Liberty inspectors observe shortages of necessary materials for
standard installations of mains and services.

Liberty’s field inspections observed a recurring issue with specialized brackets that secure risers
for gas meters at locations with crumbling or bowed foundation walls. One of the three Shops
overcame this lack by using easily-installed, “pound-in” brackets. These brackets have common
application for mobile homes. The other two Shops did not have a solution for these instances. For
some time, the one Shop’s effective solution was not shared with the other two Shops. Thus, the
Shops failed to share best practices that can improve adherence to standards and efficiency at the
same time.
Interviews with field personnel indicated that some material availability issues arose in 2013.
Liberty’s 2014 field inspections, however, found no indication of a recurrence of shortages.
Moreover, interviews with contractor construction supervisors, construction inspectors, and
Peoples Gas construction managers disclosed only the riser bracket issue. Ultimately, the brackets
issue did not arise from material availability issues, but from failure to share a proper solution.
After one Shop’s personnel became aware of the existence of an option, the Company did
eventually respond by making them available to all three Shops. All crews whose work sites
Liberty examined had sufficient materials and equipment to perform the work.
b. Engineering Standards
Liberty’s review of engineering standards and operating procedures covering main, service, and
meter work in the field found them generally appropriate in providing a basis for quality
installations that meet all safety requirements. Field investigations, however, disclosed a number
of exceptions that warrant attention. The next paragraphs discuss them.
Steel Straps: Reinforcing straps should be welded onto the end caps on steel and ductile/cast iron
mains (both permanent and temporary). Peoples Gas should have a standard addressing the number
and size of steel straps (or “rabbit ears”) and the extent of required welding. Such standards would
help ensure adequate strength.
Jeeping: Peoples Gas should have a standard identifying when and how inspection and jeeping of
coating for steel pipe should occur. Where pipe is coated or wrapped with special materials to
prevent corrosion, coating integrity is confirmed through detection of bare spots using special
detectors (“jeeps”). The required standard should address pipe coating thickness and associated
voltages that avoid damaging coating, yet remain adequate to confirm coating integrity.
Thrust Blocks: Peoples Gas should have a standard addressing required sizing of thrust blocks for
blocking end caps of large diameter mains. Thrust blocks hold mains in place. The standard should
apply to temporary and permanent mechanical end caps.
Contractor Training: Peoples Gas needs to establish requirements that will ensure regular Peoples
Gas review of the methods contractors use to train their personnel. The Company should verify

May 5, 2015

Page Q-2
The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

the sufficiency of instructor skills and experience and the training materials used to meet Peoples
Gas operator qualification programs and standards. The requirements should specifically address:
 Responsibility for and documentation of monitoring and oversight of contractor operator
qualification programs
 Adequacy of training of contractor personnel
 Conformance of contractor operator qualifications with Peoples Gas requirements.
Inspector Training: Peoples Gas needs to address four issues involving personnel who inspect field
work:
 Ensuring adequate training and verifying the qualifications of AMRP inspectors
 Providing training in the installation, operation, and exercising of polyethylene valves
 Ensuring sufficient inspection of contractor work to verify compliant and satisfactory
material installation
 Training in riser locating: Liberty’s field work included a number of instances where meter
markers set potentially unsafe riser locations. Meter markers visit customer facilities to
identify locations for meters (and thus associated services and service riders) being
relocated from inside to outside customer buildings. Peoples Gas manages its program to
move meters to outside locations jointly with AMRP pipe replacement work.
Examples of locating problems that Liberty observed include riser locations placed within three
feet of building opening and service regulator vent terminus. Such locations violate Peoples Gas
procedures, and can require relocation and avoidable piping and labor costs.
Liberty also observed a number of instances where Peoples Gas does not provide sufficient
guidance, training, or documentation for those responsible for ensuring field work quality and
compliance.
Inspection Documentation: Peoples Gas needs to adopt requirements to document inspector
verifications that contractor work complies with requirements, including engineering standards
and specifications. The required documentation should include:
 Ensuring consistent inspections to verify quality contractor work
 Documenting daily completed contractor work at a level at least as detailed as the detailed
construction checklists used by the Compliance Monitoring Group.
Construction Verification Audits: The Peoples Gas Compliance Monitoring Group has not
consistently performed construction verification audits of contractor main and service installations
to verfiy compliance with Company engineering standards. The Company needs to establish clear
requirements to ensure consistent adherence to procedures for verification audits of contractors.
c. Construction Conformity to Requirements
Liberty’s inspectors used pertinent engineering standards and procedures to verify that contractor
work met the requirements of contracts and that installations met regulatory and Company
requirements. Liberty’s inspectors questioned construction inspectors on the standards and
procedures they deemed relevant. Liberty verified that copies were present on the job site. The
field work confirmed the use of main and service engineering and design work performed prior to

contract award. Construction contracts call for contractors to use that information, except where
not feasible. For example, contractors may find during a final walk down in the field conflicting
facilities not shown on existing maps.
Thus, conformity with standards and procedures did not generally produce concern. Liberty did,
however, identify five specific issues that warrant attention.
The first issue concerns depth of cover over installed pipe. Liberty found a significant level of
confusion about the depth of cover required for services located on customer property and those
in City rights-of-way. In many situations the depth of cover used for both customer and City
locations is 18”. Per the Field Manual Section 920 (Table 920.1), however, the minimum main
depth of cover in City rights-of-way is 30”. The minimum service depth of cover is 24”. Some
permits may specify another minimum depth of cover (such as 36”). Peoples Gas needs to address
this confusion, by correcting the table or issuing separate instructions for contractors working in
Chicago.
Liberty also observed instances of confusion about where customer property stopped and rightsof-way began. Moreover, some City permits specify a non-standard cover requirement. Liberty
did not find a routine practice for determining the requirements to apply in cases of differences
between permits, City regulations, and Peoples Gas standards.
Second, Liberty observed a number of cases where following pre-designed main locations reduced
efficiency. In some cases, following those layouts would cause greater conflict with existing
underground facilities than alternative layouts might produce. In such cases, these layouts would
require less efficient open trenching. More efficient, horizontal directional drilling could not be
used because of the conflicts found. A second example of problems occasionally arising from predesigned layouts, as observed by some contractor personnel, is that installation in the parkway
would preclude horizontal directional drilling, while placement under a sidewalk would allow it.
Third, Liberty observed that one of the three Shops employed a rule requiring direct burial of all
mains of 6” or greater in diameter. Rote application of this rule in cases where no interferences
exist reduces efficiency.
The fourth issue concerns the amount of interior piping required to serve premises with multiple
meters (e.g., multi-family or commercial). Moving interior meters to the outsides of premises
forms a significant part of the work performed in conjunction with AMRP pipe replacement. Doing
so at premises with a large number of meters can require very large amounts of interior piping.
Placing meters outside in one (or more) meter banks still leaves the need to run interior pipe
separately for each customer involved. One can often feed meters located inside a building through
a single line placed in the basement at a location that reduces interior pipe requirements. Having
several services to the building can permit locating banks of meters closer to customer locations.
This approach can avoid the need to run piping from one side of a basement to the other side.
The fifth issue concerns the design pressure for systems moving from low to higher pressure. As
with meter relocations, Peoples Gas manages its program for increasing system pressure with
AMRP work. The Company installs materials that support operation at 60 psi, but tests them only

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

for qualification to operate in a 20 to 30 psi system. Testing for 60 psi operation would better
support future growth, by allowing the same facilities to deliver greater amounts of gas at the
higher pressure. Certifying new mains and services at 60 psi would entail no added material or
testing costs. The Company simply needs to change its test basis for mains and services to 90 psi.
Testing requirements call for 1.5 times the maximum pressure. This change would qualify new
systems in Chicago similarly to most other city systems that use medium pressure.
Liberty’s inspection team found some Company procedures and standards cumbersome to use or
in conflict with other requirements (such as those addressing depth of cover).
d. People Skills and Experience
Liberty’s field investigations found that the contractors installing mains and services employ crew
members having sound skills and experience. Their work performance generally indicated
sufficient capability to perform the tasks associated with installation work. They operated under
supervision that also exhibited sufficient skills and experience.
The Peoples Gas field forces exhibit a characteristic typical of the industry. Its workforce, both
bargaining unit and management, is aging. The Company will lose the many seasoned and
experienced workers approaching retirement age. The absence of a long-term program to replace
them will threaten the ability to sustain current levels of skills and experience, let alone to expand
work performed internally. Liberty observed a number of factors affecting the ability to sustain
internal resources:
 Incenting union crew leaders to become first-level supervisors
 Retaining experienced personnel after they have reached retirement benefits plateaus
 Establishing a structured approach to optimizing contractor use long-term
 Addressing current shortages of skilled personnel in some positions
 Dealing with a lack of sufficient numbers to provide effective work supervision and
oversight
 Responding to frequent job changes and lack of prompt filling of positions due to rotations
of shop-level management positions
 Filling the need for more shop-level gas workers and of trained mechanics.
Staffing issues like these can produce efficiency loss and raise safety issues. Examples of losses
in efficiency include lack of supervision of Peoples Gas crew tasks. The work involved includes
tie-ins, meter transfers, and gas-in of new facilities. Liberty’s field inspectors observed instances
of failure to begin work promptly in the morning and slow completion of tasks when supervision
was not present. Other conditions observed during field inspections, often times with notable
frequency, include:
 Service risers too close to building openings
 Failure to provide supports for service risers
 Vent pipes too close (within 3’) to building openings
 Service lines (as noted earlier) at insufficient depth (minimum of 18” or 24” depending on
location)
 Lack of sufficient mark-outs for some utilities.

e. Subsurface Investigation
Peoples Gas uses standard methods for determining the location of subsurface facilities. These
methods include referencing to owner and operator maps, contracting locator service providers,
undertaking electrical location testing with toning equipment, and having owners and operators
perform locations, for example. An issue occurring before AMRP inception and involving a
directional drill (“HDD”), led Peoples Gas to institute video recording of all sewer mains and
laterals, prior to and following directional drilling, but before “gassing-in” the new main involved.
Training comprises another important component of effective subsurface damage prevention.
Training for Peoples Gas crews, contractors, and other subsurface utility facility owners and
operators seeks to reinforce the need to call for complete mark-outs of all utility facilities before
excavation begins. Where doubts exist about subsurface facility locations, greater care must be
taken. Hand digging, performing test holes until facilities are located, or changing the route to
avoid conflicting installations exemplify the methods used in such cases. Additional technological
methods of locating underground facilities exist, such as ground penetrating radar. They generally
do not prove necessary (and are expensive) when good maps, good procedures and good care exist.
Where subsurface facilities cannot be located via conventional methods, alternatives exist. The
operator can change from direct drilling to direct burial via trenching, perform more exhaustive
locating surveying with conductive toning equipment, or use historic records to determine possible
locations, followed by test holes to confirm the exact location. While sometimes an effective
option for limited use, ground penetrating radar is too expensive and time consuming to form a
regularly used tool.
f. Unexpected Field Conditions
Liberty’s field inspections undertaken during the 2014 construction season did not find unexpected
field conditions to present significant barriers to performing installation work.
Prior to contractor bids on AMRP work, Peoples Gas performs work that specifies the route,
considering anticipated conflicts with other subsurface utilities. This work also specifies a method
of construction. Those performing design work conduct one or more walk downs of each City
block involved just prior to contractor mobilization. Route planning considers large trees, whose
roots can affect directional drilling. Meter markers provide new meter locations on the outsides of
affected buildings. A coordinated City process supports acquisition and use of data from the other
subsurface utilities to design a route that minimizes interferences. This report’s Chapter T:
Government Coordination describes that City process.
Despite best efforts, unexpected conditions can arise. For example, maps of subsurface utilities
sometimes prove incorrect. Efforts like mark-outs and sewer system video recording can expose
some of those variances. When field personnel discover unexpected conditions, inspectors contact
design personnel to report the issue. Should the required change prove significant, Peoples Gas
may need a permit change, which can produce schedule delay. More typically, however, conditions
can be accommodated by changing a new main’s location from the parkway to the sidewalk (or
vice versa).

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Peoples Gas’ video recording of sewer mains and laterals before and after a direction drill
constitutes a best practice. It eliminates the risk of cross boring into a sewer or sewer lateral. Cross
boring creates a future hazard in circumstances where the operator cleans sewers and laterals with
a rotating heat/cutter type tool.
This report’s Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System addressed the unusually large
number of third party damages to the Company’s facilities. New installations require appropriate
mapping to help mitigate the risk of such incidents. After installation or gassing in of a new main,
an inspector from an engineering contractor measures its location. The contractors use tape
measures and a “‘walking wheel” measurer. This data is then submitted for entry into the Peoples
Gas mapping system. These manual (paper) handoffs can lead to errors and omissions. Using submeter GPS (a system that produces much greater accuracy) in areas with satellite access may offer
a more accurate method of updating mapping, geographic information system, and property
records. It would also produce an electronic record of the dates. Similarly, GPS technology could
provide for seamless leak data integration into models.
This enhanced capability could also extend to other information needed for leak management,
customer information systems, geographic information system, system mapping, system planning,
and risk-ranking algorithms. Making the transition to GPS use would require a shake-out period
involving use of old and new methods concurrently. It would also require expenditures to provide
field personnel with sub-meter GPS devices for recording locations of mains, services, and leaks.

3. Conclusions
Q.1

Material availability and quality have supported effective and efficient field
installation.

Liberty’s field investigations disclosed no substantial work hindrances caused by lack of materials
and equipment. Storage areas appear to have ample quantities of materials. The quality of materials
being installed appeared satisfactory.
Q.2

The standards to which AMRP resources perform field work generally support safe
and reliable installations, with a number of specific exceptions that Peoples Gas needs
to address. (Recommendation Q.1)

Liberty’s field investigations considered the standards under which contractors and Peoples Gas
crews perform main and service installation, meter relocation, and pressure-increase activities. The
standards used typify what one generally finds in the industry. Chapter C: The Peoples Gas
Distribution System addresses engineering and design in more detail. AMRP field work generally
conformed to those standards. Liberty’s work, however, did identify a number of areas that require
attention with respect to construction standards or to activities designed to ensure that work meets
those standards. These areas include: Steel Straps, Jeeping, Thrust Blocks, Contractor Training,
Inspector Training, Compliance Monitoring Group (“CMG”) Training, Inspection Documentation,
and Construction Verification Audits.

Q.3

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Construction inspectors have not routinely used the checklist process to record and
provide a basis for performance analysis and their power to halt unsafe work appears
to be in question. (Recommendation Q.2)

Liberty’s field work disclosed that some construction inspectors have not used checklists correctly.
Some also defer completing them until the end of the week. Discussions with AMRP and Shop
management also indicated lack of a structured or widespread effort to use checklist information.
This data provides a basis for discussing and identifying means for correcting recurring or systemic
performance issues. The use of the checklists has importance in ensuring consistent and thorough
review of individual contractor performance. The checklists can also provide significant insights
into issues that adversely affect work effectiveness, efficiency, and duration.
Liberty’s field work also identified uncertainties among inspectors about their power (absent realtime clearance from a higher authority) to halt work activities that raise safety concerns. Giving
that power to inspectors is critical to ensuring work performance that meets safety and performance
requirements and expectations. Inspector lack of confidence or respect from field supervision may
well contribute to this situation. Peoples Gas must recognize that denying inspectors the power to
take immediate action does not offer a solution. A better approach lies in proper inspector
empowerment and in training and communication about their role and authority.
Q.4

Contractor field resources demonstrate sufficient capabilities to perform the main
and service installation work that comprises their portion of AMRP work.

The contractors selected to perform AMRP work undergo pre-selection evaluation. Their crews
and supervision, as observed by Liberty in field investigations, demonstrated sufficient
competence and effectiveness in field work performance. Liberty’s discussions with Peoples Gas
field management personnel disclosed no significant performance issues. Note that this conclusion
does not address sufficiency of resources to support overall schedule requirements.
Q.5

Peoples Gas has had difficulty in filling internal positions responsible for AMRP
work, and, like the industry as a whole, faces graying workforce issues that can cause
skills gaps to widen over time. (Recommendation Q.3)

Maintaining an adequate number of skilled and experienced personnel forms a central element in
ensuring work quality, timeliness, and efficiency. Peoples Gas faces current shortages in a number
of positions. Liberty’s review also confirmed the risk that shortages will increase, given the
demographics of the internal workforce. Like others in the industry, Peoples Gas faces the loss of
growing numbers of skilled workers and supervisors as retirement ages approach. A combination
of disincentives to remain after reaching benefits plateaus and increased employment opportunities
in an improving economy further increase employee retention risk. The growth of accelerated main
replacement programs around the country adds further risk.
The discussions that began last September between Liberty and senior leadership produced
consensus on the need to address internal resource numbers and skills, both short- and long-term.
A comprehensive analysis of needs across the immediate and the longer terms should take place.
Peoples Gas also needs to identify methods to incent bargaining unit employees to enter
supervision and retirement-eligible workers to remain.

Q.6

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

A number of factors increase the difficulties that Peoples Gas has in providing
sufficient numbers of experienced personnel. (Recommendation Q.4)

Liberty’s field investigations and interviews with field management disclosed a number of specific
personnel-related concerns that contribute to performance, safety, and compliance issues.
Peoples Gas has experienced a significant level of vacancies in key field supervision and
inspection positions. The utility has not filled vacancies resulting from retirements, promotions,
and reassignments at a sufficient rate to sustain resource levels at effective numbers and levels of
experience. The growth in work occasioned by the AMRP and other work growth (such as the
increase to medium pressure and the relocation of meters to outside locations) has placed
significant strain on resources. Frequent switches in job assignments have produced many cases
where job holders have short tenures in current, key positions (e.g., shop construction supervisor
and manager positions). Moreover, incentives to retain people in key positions and to encourage
experienced workers to take supervisory positions are not strong.
Peoples Gas has consequently experienced a shortage of trained personnel to fill supervision and
inspection roles. The impacts show in what Liberty’s field inspection team found to be
comparatively weak levels of supervision and oversight, particularly with respect to work being
performed by Peoples Gas crews. Moreover, it is clear that there have been delays by Peoples Gas
crews in accomplishing their designated elements of AMRP work. As contractors continue to
perform substantial numbers of gas main and service replacements, the gap threatens to widen,
absent expansion in the number and capabilities of Peoples Gas resources.
Compounding the difficulty, AMRP work must compete for resources with other programs that
Peoples Gas must conduct contemporaneously (e.g., compliance and leak management). Senior
Peoples Gas executive management acknowledges the need for increased resources and for
addressing together the AMRP and other needs that will continue to require substantial resources
into the future.
Problems in maintaining sufficient numbers and experience levels also lead inevitably to losses in
productivity and accountability for work completion. These losses appear in a number of ways;
e.g., increased use of overtime, poor location of service riser mark-outs, errors in work
performance and resulting rework, and increased restoration costs when service transfers are
completed after initial restoration following new main installation.
Q.7

Peoples Gas’ designation of roles and responsibilities for oversight of work
effectiveness, quality, and safety is unclear, and fully effective means for supporting
the execution of those roles do not exist. (Recommendation Q.5)

Field Supervision
Liberty’s field investigations found a lack of supervision of some Peoples Gas crews. Liberty
observed in a number of cases the absence of on-site supervision and a lack of visits by responsible
supervisors. Each of the three Shop areas has vacancies for first level supervision. Liberty’s
understanding of the benefits of entering supervisory roles indicates lack of sufficient material
incentives for seasoned crew leaders (a natural source of expertise) to become non-union
supervisors.

May 5, 2015

Page Q-9

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Liberty also observed high turnover of supervisors. They appear to get re-assigned often to
programs or areas having immediate priority. The utility’s failure to find sufficient numbers of
experienced personnel contributes significantly to the observed lack of supervision. Liberty
observed a similar gap in its 2008 audit for the Illinois Commerce Commission. At that time,
however, the cause was the amount of paperwork first level supervisors had to complete in the
office, thus keeping them away from crews in the field.
Meter Markers
Liberty’s field inspections disclosed a number of cases where inaccurate marking of new meter
locations raised concerns about compliance with safety and with Company procedures and
standards. The work that Peoples Gas performs under common management with AMRP
replacements involves moving to outside locations meters currently located inside customer
structures. Marking the new locations thus comprises a significant effort. Completing the work
that new main and service installation by contract crews initiates has been a problem for Peoples
Gas. Adding to the problem, a lack of knowledge on the part of overly stressed and busy workers
performing meter markings has produced violations and cost impacts for corrective work.
Supervision of Contractor Crews
Peoples Gas assigns a construction inspector to each contractor crew installing mains and services.
However, Liberty’s field investigations identified a lack of sufficient skill and experience levels
of Peoples Gas construction inspectors. Many construction inspectors did not have gas or any other
pipeline inspection experience prior to their hiring. The training they received is more appropriate
for individuals with extensive gas construction experience such as former employees familiar with
the Peoples Gas system. A majority of inspectors have come from other types of construction (e.g.,
highway, water main, buildings). The mentoring provided comprises a good practice, but the
quality of mentoring is also a function of expertise in gas construction.
Technical Training and Compliance Monitoring
The Company also needs to identify and empower a single source for providing ultimate guidance
for field personnel questions involving operations and materials procedures and specifications. At
present, contractors who have questions regarding standards or procedures rely on the advice they
obtain from the construction inspectors, who may or may not have the needed experience or
knowledge.
Another Integrys-based group, Technical Training has responsibility for training Compliance
Monitoring Group inspectors. This group trains all Peoples Gas employees in safety, operating
procedures, compliance, and Operator Qualification matters. Technical Training personnel should
serve as the definitive source of guidance. Technical Training should be the most knowledgeable
about Company procedures and standards and how they relate to compliance with state and federal
safety regulations. The Technical Training staff, however, also has many members who lack
substantial experience. Liberty also observed a loss of knowledge and expertise in Technical
Training with regard to standard operating procedure requirements. Over the last several years,
Technical Training lost many experienced staff members through retirements. This loss, coupled
with changing standards and procedures (e.g., an Integrys standardization program) has left the
new management of Technical Training inexperienced in providing day to day answers to technical
issues.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Liberty found some construction inspectors and Compliance Monitoring Group auditors confused
about their roles and responsibilities when they observe non-compliant work or work methods.
Operator Qualification
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration requires that pipeline operators
performing covered tasks undergo evaluation intended to demonstrate the ability to “perform
assigned covered tasks and recognize and react to abnormal operating conditions.” Peoples Gas
has the responsibility for ensuring that the resources it employs are operator qualified.
Liberty found instances of contractor non-compliance with the standard operating procedures and
standards program of Peoples Gas, particularly with respect to: (a) required operator qualifications
(“OQ”), gas system mark-out (to avoid third-party damages when working in the vicinity of gas
facilities) accuracy issues, providing adequate ground cover (above replaced mains and services),
providing adequate service regulator vent terminus clearance (minimum distances from opening
in buildings through which gas can migrate), performing meter marking to promote efficient
interior piping, and thrust block sizing. In one instance an operator of a directional drilling machine
did not have an up-to-date certification.
In addition, Liberty’s field investigation team made inquiries of those with proper certification
about Abnormal Operating Condition (“AOC”) training. A person qualified to perform covered
tasks must have the ability to respond appropriately when faced with abnormal operating
conditions reasonably expected to be encountered when performing that task. In many cases, the
responses produced an apparent lack of knowledge about what would comprise an abnormal
condition for their operation. This observation applied to contractor personnel and the construction
inspectors trained by Peoples Gas. The construction contractors and subcontractors were trained
by an outside organization. The training provided appears to have gaps. Peoples Gas should be
reviewing and clearing training material.
Liberty found a lack of full control by Peoples Gas of the quality of contractor Operator
Qualifications programs or of similar programs for those inspecting contractor project work.
Inconsistencies exist in the nature and degree of oversight of contractors by People Gas inspectors
and in approaches that the three Shop areas take to resolving field needs and issues. How inspectors
carry out roles, document inspection activities, use inspection checklists, and prepare reports also
exhibited inconsistencies.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Quality Control
Concerns exist with respect to quality control as well. Designation of the source of authority for
quality control is not clear. The approaches applied to contractor quality control programs lack
consistency, as do those processes for training and uniform knowledge and skills requirements for
contractors and inspectors. In addition, Peoples Gas does not apply a consistent approach in
addressing field questions, complaints, and improvement suggestions.
Q.8

The high rates of turnover, the lack of experience among replacements, and the slow
pace in filling some positions make the need for training a particularly high AMRP
priority. (Recommendation Q.5)

Peoples Gas does not provide training in a reasonably uniform manner to those who require it, and
its training programs do not fully reflect the needs of a work force that has a large number of
people filling roles in which they do not have significant experience. Moreover, when making
organizational and process changes to address oversight of work safety and quality, the Company
will have to provide training intended to ensure that those responsible for key roles understand
their authority and how they need to execute it. Training regarding procedures and standards for
construction inspectors requires particular attention.
Q.9

Peoples Gas has applied appropriate subsurface investigation methods.

Peoples Gas has generally been able to install new mains and services required by the AMRP in a
safe and low risk manner by employing methods typically used in the industry. The Company has
succeeded in locating its own and other utility subsurface facilities accurately and in a timely
manner. When encountering difficulties in determining the location of subsurface facilities,
Peoples Gas has used conventional methods successfully.
Q.10 Unexpected field conditions have not presented an abnormally high number of
problems for AMRP installations, but the high incidence of third-party damages to
Peoples Gas facilities indicates the need for examination of better methods for
mapping new installations. (Recommendation Q.6)
Liberty’s field work did not observe an unusual level of “surprises” affecting the ability to make
installations as planned. Pre-construction work to investigate field conditions takes industrytypical forms. Peoples Gas has taken action to improve the locating of subsurface utility locations
by performing follow-up quality control checks on problematic service providers, performing test
holes to physically locate services, and using meter markers to locate entry points of legacy
services on plot plans.
The high number of third-party damages to Peoples Gas facilities (described in this report’s
Chapter C: The Peoples Gas Distribution System), however, does raise concern about the marking
of Company facilities. Peoples Gas currently uses manual processes to map new main and service
installations. These processes can introduce errors in fixing the locations of new installations.
Moreover, Peoples Gas currently uses building property lines measured from existing street
corners. These corners can change, further reducing the accuracy of maps identifying Peoples Gas
subsurface facilities. Considerable time can also pass between converting manually measured
locations to geographic information system coordinates for placement on maps supplied to locating
and mark out personnel and service providers.

Urban environments with a prevalence of very tall buildings can make it problematic to obtain a
sufficient number of GPS satellites to locate mains and services accurately. Many Chicago
neighborhoods undergoing AMRP work, however, consist primarily of low-rise residential
structures that do not present this difficulty.

4. Recommendations
Q.1

Peoples Gas should address a number of construction standards’ needs, and should
enhance training, documentation, and auditing in a number of areas related to
construction standards. (Conclusion Q.2)

Peoples Gas needs to address requirements related to the use of steel straps, jeeping, and thrust
blocks. Moreover, the Company needs to address contractor and inspector training, in order to
ensure compliance with Company and regulatory standards. The Company also needs to improve
consistency and documentation of field work inspection, and consistently perform construction
verification audits of contractor work.
Q.2

Peoples Gas should adopt measures to ensure consistent use of construction
inspection checklists, develop a structured program for analyzing the information
they produce to identify and respond to field performance issues disclosed, and clearly
empower inspectors to halt unsafe work. (Conclusion Q.3)

Company-proposed initiatives resulting from discussions between Liberty and senior leadership
include the initiation of an audit process intended to verify that all inspectors use the forms, use
them correctly, and complete them promptly. This initiative, if implemented effectively, should
address the need for ensuring that inspectors fill out the forms completely, do not allow them to
accumulate for several days before completing them, and complete them under approved
standards, with proper content, and on a timely basis.
Achieving these completion objectives, however, does not go far enough. The Company needs to
add to its initiatives the design and implementation of a structured program, under dedicated
oversight within the AMRP management organization, for analyzing the forms to determine where
the information they capture identify performance problems. This analytical program needs to
consider where such problems may exist in a variety of areas; e.g., a particular contractor,
employee performance in a geographic area, an engineering or construction standard, or an AMRPwide work activity.
Liberty’s field observations also indicate that Peoples Gas needs to provide additional training for
construction inspectors, in order to improve their ability to recognize work that fails to comply
with regulatory and procedural requirements. Similar training is in order to enable inspectors to
better recognize abnormal operating conditions (“AOC”), and to document deficiencies in
contractor training.
Most importantly, Peoples Gas needs to make clear to inspectors their power to halt improper work
or activities as and immediately when they observe them.

Q.3

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas needs promptly to conduct short-term and long-term analyses of its
requirements for skilled and experienced field resources, develop incentives for
moving personnel into new positions and incenting senior workers to remain, and
ensure that training and development efforts anticipate (and not merely react to)
vacancies. (Conclusion Q.5)

Performing a comprehensive field resource needs analysis represents a key first step. The Peoples
Gas initiatives resulting from discussions between Liberty and senior leadership include plans for
a needs analysis that will identify potential losses of first-level and general supervisors reaching
retirement age. Peoples Gas should supplement that “numbers” analysis, which is appropriate, with
an examination of the likely training and development needs for potential replacements.
The Company seems to understand that incentives to move into supervision and to remain with
the Company after reaching retirement benefits plateaus must form part of its plans for ensuring
adequate resources over the long AMRP duration that remains. The Company has acknowledged
the long-term need to promote first-level supervisors from within (e.g., moving well qualified and
motivated crew leaders into management from this current highest union position). Such
movement historically has provided an important source for acquiring first-level supervisors.
The needs analysis should look closely at the utility worker (formerly called gas mechanic)
position, given the time it takes to fully qualify such mechanics. That training time makes it too
late to begin the training process when a vacancy occurs, or becomes imminent.
Disincentives for crew leaders to leave the union and become first-level supervisors include loss
of job security, reductions in some benefits (e.g., pensions), and direct financial impact from loss
of overtime premiums. The industry generally faces this problem, but changes in the Peoples Gas
pension plan may exacerbate it. The Company must address the supervision shortage immediately.
Liberty’s field work indicated instances of very little supervision of some AMRP work performed
by Peoples Gas crews. Productivity impacts become inevitable when a lack of reasonably close
and present supervision persists. The Company must examine and develop rewards programs that
offer experienced crew leaders sufficient incentives to move into supervisor positions. The
Company must also recognize the “vacuum” effect of employee movement into other positions.
Movement into supervision will create a need for movement of gas mechanics into crew leader
positions, thus threatening a resource area already under stress. In turn, measures to develop
personnel to perform the work of gas mechanics must increase.
Short-term plans incorporate the use of contractors to fill vacant positions. Despite the importance
of filling key vacancies “through any means available,” Peoples Gas needs to focus on the long
term. With respect to the AMRP that long term still approaches two decades. Peoples Gas resource
acquisition, training, and development initiatives require clear and aggressive time frames. Such
time frames avoid the inevitable tendency for inertia to convert a short-term approach into the
long-term approach.
Using contractors on a long-term basis for positions like meter markers, construction inspectors,
and Compliance Management Group auditors will not likely prove most efficient over the long
term. Moreover, developing an internal resource capability to address threats to future contractor

Chapter Q: Field Work Performance

ICC14GAS0002

resource availability makes sense. The number of other companies pursuing and likely to initiate
accelerated main replacement programs make future contractor availability a risk.
Company improvement initiatives contemplate a study of the optimal use of contractors versus
internal employees. Peoples Gas must complete that study very promptly for it to have value in
influencing resource acquisition. The Company must consider all costs and benefits involved.
They include the value in developing resources that will outlast the AMRP, the costs of training
short-term contractors, and the broader impacts of creating incentives designed to meet specific,
targeted AMRP resource needs.
Peoples Gas must consider AMRP needs when conducting management position rotations. Those
rotations have produced openings that have taken significant time to fill, and have caused
disruption in some cases, as new position holders gain experience.
Q.4

Identify and pursue means to increase the stability in and the numbers of field
supervision and inspection personnel. (Conclusion Q.6)

Discussions with senior management make clear its recognition that Peoples Gas faces resource
restrictions that affect AMRP performance. A comprehensive understanding of the size of the
resource gaps in areas affecting safety and compliance, however, must depend upon progress in
improving overall planning, management, and control of the AMRP.
Nevertheless, on an immediate basis, Peoples Gas needs to begin addressing barriers that exist to
securing resources to enhance supervision of crews.
The Company should undertake a focused examination of the incentives necessary to induce union
crew leaders to become first level supervisors, as an alternative to filling vacancies through outside
hires with limited gas operations experience. Current disincentives to internal succession include
retirement programs, pay, and other benefits. The timeframe for filling first level supervision
positions is long, as is the learning curve for outside hires. Peoples Gas needs to begin to address
vacancies before they occur, even at the expense of temporarily having extra supervisors. Their
ability to be trained and mentored by senior general supervisors prior to being assigned to crews
will represent resources well spent in the interests of long-term AMRP optimization.
The Company also needs to promote a greater level of continuity in AMRP management and
supervisory ranks at the Shop level. Minimizing job shifts that deprive the local Shops of key
resources needs to become a priority. Doing so will permit faster resolution of issues by personnel
not in the process of learning on the job. Greater stability will also help to make lines of authority
and responsibility more clear. Lack of clarity about who (e.g., the Project Management Office
versus the Shop areas, Integrys versus Peoples Gas) has responsibility and accountability for what
decisions and actions will improve performance beyond what our field inspection teams observed.
Q.5

Clarify responsibilities for key field roles and institute training programs to support
them more fully. (Conclusions Q.7 and Q.8)

The Company needs to make clear that Technical Training is the recognized authority for guidance
involving safety, operating procedures, compliance, and Operator Qualification matters, for both
Integrys personnel conducting AMRP work through the Project Management Office and Peoples

Gas personnel working under management in the three Shop areas. It must also be made clear that
Compliance Monitoring Group personnel are not only monitoring or advisory resources, but have
the authority to address field safety and compliance issues directly and as they arise.
Technical Training needs to rework and expand the training for construction inspectors. It needs
to design training that will ensure that inspectors are completely knowledgeable about Company
procedures, standards, and regulatory requirements. It should undertake that effort based on a
focused effort to identify the principal and recurring gaps and other problems.
The training should include practical, hands-on treatment of issues (e.g., fusing and Operator
Qualification requirements). It should also focus on how to spot poor quality work and who to call
when questions or concerns arise. Technical Training should also make available and ensure that
field personnel know how to gain prompt access to a knowledgeable person who can respond in a
short time frame. Construction inspector training also needs to include City permit requirements
and clear information on what requirements take precedence when conflicting or differing
requirements apply (e.g., City versus Peoples Gas standards; depth of cover requirements for city
rights-of-way versus customer property).
Technical Training has lost expertise due to retirements and the use of contract instructors. It is
therefore necessary to conduct a review of resource numbers, skillsets, and experience needs,
followed immediately by preparation and prompt execution of a staffing plan to meet identified
needs.
Technical Training also needs to review and improve the Operator Qualification training that
contractors, subcontractors, and the construction inspectors receive. The goal of this review is to
identify gaps in meeting the requirements of the Company, agreements with contractors, and
applicable regulations. Particular attention needs to be paid to Abnormal Operating Condition
training, to ensure that individuals know how to identify abnormal conditions associated with their
positions, and what to do in case one occurs. This training is extremely important in preventing
minor incidents from becoming problems. The training program of the Midwest Energy
Association should be reviewed. If additional training is necessary, it should be required to be
given by the Company or by an outside, approved training group.
Technical Training needs to bring the training of the meter markers back under its jurisdiction.
Responsibility for such training moved to the three Shops (into which Peoples Gas divided its field
operations and which managed the employee crews who perform back-end AMRP work) in 2013.
Meter markers perform activities that determine the locations of meters to be moved outside of
customer buildings. Meter locations affect interior piping amounts, service locations, and riser
locations. Peoples Gas acquires meter markers from a contractor. The personnel provided by the
contractor do not necessarily have gas distribution system experience. Recently, the contractor
who supplies construction inspectors has promoted personnel from meter marker positions after
assuming wrongly that individuals promoted have had adequate training.
Peoples Gas needs to become more engaged in the quality control programs of the prime
contractors and some subcontractors. The utility retains ultimate responsibility for the installation
and quality of construction. The Company should: (a) make itself aware of the content, resources,
and methods contractors use to assure quality, (b) confirm their adequacy, and (c) see to the prompt

closing of any gaps. Peoples Gas must audit and provide guidance to the contractors and relevant
subcontractor quality control programs, and ensure that these programs are designed,
implemented, and audited in a matter designed to provide quality workmanship, and to meet all
procedures, construction standards, and requirements.
Q.6

Peoples Gas should examine the benefits of equipping technicians with sub-meter
accurate GPS devices in areas that have line of sight to satellites. (Conclusion Q.10)

The Company currently uses manual methods and paper handoffs from field personnel to map the
new facilities installed. These processes produce errors and omissions. Equipping technicians with
GPS capability can eliminate many such sources of error. Using sub-meter GPS in areas with
satellite access may offer a more accurate method of updating mapping, geographic information
system and property records. It would also produce an electronic record of the dates. Similarly,
GPS technology could provide for seamless leak data integration into models.

Chapter R: Work Management
1. Background
This chapter addresses the means by which AMRP management defines and manages the work
processes required to perform AMRP project work. The chapter:
 Describes the overall work management process
 Examines the tools used to manage work
 Evaluates construction work packages and management methods and activities
 Assesses management methods for improving work processes
 Reviews means to address the work of groups whose activities support construction
 Evaluates the effectiveness of work to secure permits needed to authorize construction
activities.
Workflow management refers to the creation of a repeatable business process documented and
subjected to a defined set of procedural rules. Process definitions identify the activities, procedural
rules, and control data used to manage a defined flow of work. Work (often termed “workflow”)
management systems use software to store and interpret process definitions and to create and
manage workflows. These systems typically support administrative and supervisory functions. For
example, they provide a basis for work reassignment or escalation, they provide auditability, and
they provide management information.
Modern work management systems support: collaboration on work processes, automation of
redundant tasks, ensuring that uncompleted tasks undergo follow-up, creation of performance
metrics for all elements of work flow, visibility to processes expected to be in place, knowledge
of activities that slow progress, and identification of processes that may benefit from analysis and
management attention. Examples of capabilities supported by modern work management systems
include:
 Expediting the viewing, tracking, and comparing of costs
 Reporting tools that support more detailed budget analysis
 Work order control and communications
 Comparisons between cost estimates and actual costs
 Inventory support
 Work order management
 Fleet management.
Sophisticated work management systems, despite high costs that can run to the tens of millions of
dollars, have become more common among utilities. Such systems support close management of
capital and O&M project and program work activities from initiation to completion. They
incorporate engineering release, procurement of materials, estimation of cost, work scheduling,
preparation of the work plan, crew assignment, and job closeout. The scope, complexity, and
duration of the AMRP clearly justify a substantial level of commitment to designing and
implementing work management processes and tools of a reasonably sophisticated nature.
Liberty examined how Peoples Gas conducts work management. This examination included a
review of how specific AMRP work orders flows through program processes.

2. Findings
a. The Work Management Process
i. Process Description
Discussing work management processes requires an understanding of the flow of AMRP work
activities, around which work management centers. The AMRP work management process focuses
on projects, which have three important levels of definition under the program. The AMRP makes
“neighborhoods” the first level of project definition. These neighborhoods correspond to 228 areas
of the City of Chicago. The second level of project definition separates many of these
neighborhood-level projects into phases. The phase designation seeks to support a logical division
of work large enough to justify subdivision and that may continue across multiple years. A third
level of project definition also exists. Within a phase, AMRP management may assign distinct
project status (numbers) to work activities segregated for accounting purposes.
AMRP project information enters the Company’s Work Management Information System
(“WMIS”) upon completion of design. Management usually arranges for design work to occur at
the neighborhood level. This approach can produce efficiencies. It does so by allowing contractors
to pass along the benefits that can arise from projects with larger scope. Such projects, for example,
can produce lower fixed, or overhead costs as a percentage of total costs. Contractors installing
mains and services or providing design drawing services can bid on the broadest AMRP project
scale practicable. They need reliable information to use as a bid basis. Management terms the
design as it exists at this point the “WMIS Design.” That design supports the preparation of a
preliminary cost estimate, which simply multiplies the design documents’ installation quantities
by unit rates established for the relevant “compatible units.”
These compatible units comprise defined, standardized assembly units for which management
identifies costs from historical and other data. Compatible units include factors such as labor tasks,
vehicle and equipment requirements, materials, and accounting information. The industry
commonly uses such units for estimating at this stage. AMRP management adjusts the units used
for these preliminary estimates to account for data that may be out of date.
Peoples Gas submits these designs to the City of Chicago’s Office of Underground Construction
(“OUC”) for review. This City Department of Transportation, Division of Infrastructure
Management entity reviews and approves construction work in or adjacent to the City’s public
ways. The City approval process considers clearances from underground facilities, such as sewer,
water, and wiring, for example. During City review, Peoples Gas releases the design package for
contractor bidding. Following final City approval, AMRP engineering finalizes the WMIS
Designs, incorporating any changes resulting from City review. Following contract award, the
final project cost estimate is generated. These estimates include contractor costs and the Peoples
Gas costs for materials, labor, and overheads. Management then must approve the project design
and estimate package prior to construction commencement.
For projects having multiple phases, the AMRP cost manager uses the scope definition for each
phase and the project-level cost estimate and schedule. These phase-level products apportion the

quantities from the project-level estimate and use the year set for construction of the phase
involved.
The AMRP does not operate under written guidelines or procedures addressing the work
management process. The Project Execution Plan (“PEP”), however, contains a diagram that
depicts the flow of major work activities. The next diagram illustrates that flow.
Illustration R.1: AMRP Work Activity Flow

Liberty found the interfaces and deliverables that need to exist among engineering, centralized
planning, supply chains, field operations, shops, contractors, and inspectors clearly laid out. The
delineated work activities include a close-out report that issues upon completion of a project.
Procedures call for these reports to undergo review for resolution of outstanding issues,
rectification of non-conforming items, return of unused materials, resolution of claims or disputes,
and contractor performance evaluation. A close-out checklist for each construction work package
remains open until sign-off by all responsible supervisors and managers.
The Project Execution Plan also included a number of work-flow maps charting component
activities, such the audit process, engineering, centralized planning, construction, start-up, and
close out. The AMRP uses a defined series of 25 work steps to chart the activities required to
complete AMRP projects successfully. The next table summarizes the description of the activities
comprising those steps and the deliverables that each produces.

b. Work Management Process Improvement
Peoples Gas has undertaken improvement initiatives to enhance the AMRP work management
process. These initiatives do not take full advantage of the potential benefits resulting from the
scale and duration of the AMRP. They nonetheless demonstrate positive steps to enhance the work
management process:
 Adoption of a zonal approach to scheduling internal workforce and contractor crews to
reduce travel time and increase productivity
 Development of detailed specifications to standardize all contractor requirements
 Implementation of document management and control
 Development of training requirements for new inspectors and annual refresher training
requirements for existing inspectors
 New labor training program established at the City College to expand the labor pool and
grow the apprentice program
 Metrics development to monitor performance on safety, cost, and retirement goals
 Quality management system software selected to manage field safety metrics
 Nonconformance reports and Quality Assurance/Quality Control documentation
 Reporting and tracking of construction performance
 Enhanced schedule logic and standard activity structure developed for use on individual
projects
 Program work breakdown structure developed and implemented for scheduling
 Quality Assurance Manual and associated quality control procedures developed.
c. Work Management Tools
The next diagram illustrates principal interfaces among AMRP work management tools that
address pre-construction and customer communications activities.

Illustration R.3: AMRP Work Management Tools

The following tools address construction related work:
 The Work Management Information System: used mainly to order materials and manage
internal resources
 A SharePoint site: posts construction work packages
 Primavera P6: an industry-accepted tool that AMRP management uses for construction
scheduling.
Liberty examined a specific AMRP project in more detail, in order to observe how management
actually conducts the work management process. Working at Project Management Office work
locations with the Centralized Planning Manager, Liberty walked through the computer screens
displaying work management tools and information, discussed key documents in the construction
work packages. The walk-through included, for example, valve tickets, approval letters, permits,
traffic control plans, engineering drawings, construction schedules, and material lists. Liberty also
May 5, 2015

visually examined the SharePoint site, which AMRP uses to post construction work packages.
Liberty examined how contractors extract construction work packages from the site. The Microsoft
SharePoint concept allows organizations to provide a secure place to store, organize, share, and
access information from electronic devices, using a web browser.
Liberty also examined work management tools and information for the same project in the field.
This examination took place at the Central Shop, working with the Supervisory Engineer at his
personal computer. Liberty reviewed the capability to extract construction work package
information. The system allows contractors access only to their own awarded projects. Liberty
verified the existence of the required release for construction, walked through the traffic plan, and
examined the city approval letter, the services plan, and the listing of addresses affected. The
information available for the project included the Office of Underground Construction Review
records, the various permits, valve tickets, and a summary of the bill of materials, construction
drawings, restoration drawings, and retirement drawings. The construction work package appeared
comprehensive, and transmission via SharePoint to the Shop appeared effective.
d. Construction Work Packages
The Document Control group assembles Construction Work Packages (“CWPs”), issues them
directly to contractors, and copies them for use by the entire construction team as a source of scope
definition. That team includes the Project Management Office, contractors, and the Peoples Gas
Shops. These packages get posted on a SharePoint site, accompanied by e-mail transmittal to a set
distribution list. Contractors gain access through a separate SharePoint site set up outside the
corporate firewall. The AMRP Construction Planning group manages all permitting activities.
These activities include requests for and tracking of all permit requests, expirations, and renewals.
All work requiring Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) permits must have traffic control
plans. Engineering consultants prepare them for review by People Gas. Requests for these include
Company-approved traffic control plans.
The construction work package contains drawings, valve tickets, corrosion tickets, approval letter
from the city, traffic control plan, material lists, and constructions schedules. Document Control
staff uploads the whole package to a SharePoint site that all authorized work groups, including the
contractor selected, can access.
Liberty examined a project Construction Work Package for content. This package included the
expected documentation:
 Engineering Summary
 City Office of Underground Construction - Approval letter with attachments
 Redflex Traffic Systems drawing – Traffic Control Plan for Cicero at Addison corner
 Summary Bill of Materials
 Permit by activity
 Service tie-over list at Portage Park Phase 4
 Valve tickets – Type D installation
 Restoration drawings
 Installation drawings
 Retirement drawings.

e. Construction Work Management
The Peoples Gas Shops managed their budgets at the project level by work hours. The Shops
determine the work hours on the basis of the level of effort associated with main and service
installation. Contractors provide detailed schedules for main and service installation. The Project
Management Office scheduling group works with the Shop construction managers to identify and
establish the interface requirements for Shop activities. The contractor and master project
schedules address those interfaces. Contractors cannot complete their work until they finish
restoration activities that follow the back-end work performed by Peoples Gas crews. The Project
Management Office scheduling group and the Peoples Gas shops currently work together to begin
resource loading the schedules. These loadings should assist in verifying that Peoples Gas can
meet total resource requirements (and allocate them effectively) for performing their portions of
AMRP work.
Peoples Gas distribution crews make the tie-ins to gassed mains after contractors have installed
and tested new main and service installations. Main gang crews may need to cut out an existing
main to install a tie-in piece or make a hot tap into the energized main. These crews use different
methods, depending upon the type of existing main (plastic, for example). Main gang crews also
have responsibility for the abandonment of old mains. Abandonment occurs after verifying the
transfer of all services to the new main.
Peoples Gas distribution and service crews also conduct the activities associated with relocating
meters. The relocation process involves internally plugging the existing low pressure service when
possible. Otherwise, the crews make a physical cut on the exterior of the premises via an
excavation. After plugging or cutting the existing low pressure service, Peoples Gas crews install
new meters and regulators, and then relight appliances.
Management of these Peoples Gas work processes takes a number of forms, supported by daily
communication among Shop supervisors, construction managers, and contractors. Daily updates
to Shop databases identify services installed and ready for transfer, main amounts being installed,
and the time horizon across which Peoples Gas can reliably predict requirements for energizing
new main segments.
f. Support from Other Work Groups
Many work groups support AMRP work. The next table summarizes the major functions of these
groups. Some of them operate through resources not dedicated full time to the AMRP.

The AMRP Engineering Supervisor believes that design engineers have provided adequate
technical support to the field during construction. Liberty observed, however, that a number of
unfilled positions exist in the engineering resources dedicated to AMRP. One cause of vacancies
comes from the Company’s engineer rotation program. This program creates periods of shortages
pending replacement of engineers departing for rotation purposes. The Engineering Supervisor did
not express confidence that the Company could fully staff AMRP engineering over the program’s
long term.
The Compliance Monitoring Group Lead, an employee of the Integrys Business Support
organization, oversees the AMRP Quality Assurance/Quality Control program. This Lead also has
responsibility for construction in other Integrys areas of operation. Auditor qualifications include
one to six years in gas operations and one to six years in field supervision. The current audit target
requirement is to audit one contractor per quarter. Tasks covered by these audits include gas main
replacement, service installation, anode installation on cathodic protection, and directional boring.
A computerized data base houses records associated with auditing. The database identifies audit
types and activity levels, and includes a 15-question checklist. Auditors generate deficiency reports
when they find unacceptable conditions or circumstances. Contractors then have five to seven days
to rectify problems found. The auditing program has not found any major, recurring issues.

The Lead Inspector, a position filled by a Jacobs Engineering person, has responsibility for
inspecting contractor AMRP work. The current inspector team has 19 members. The team,
however, currently lacks people in 16 approved, but open positions. Each inspector undergoes a
training plan that includes two weeks of field shadowing and two months of classroom work. The
class work addresses Peoples Gas procedures; e.g., as as-built drawing accuracy verification,
fusion, and work orders. These inspectors only examine contractor work on main and service
installations. The AMRP targets one inspector per crew. Crews generally consist of six to eight
workers. Jacobs Engineering has responsibility for advertising and recruiting of needed inspectors.
Retired Peoples Gas craftsmen (with 25 to 30 years of experience) make up most of the contractor
inspection force.
The Lead Inspector believes a large pool of potential resources obviates any concern about
resource availability. Liberty inquired about the large number of inspector vacancies, given this
view about the ample number of resources available to fill positions. The reason was not clear.
g. Permit Coordination
Generally speaking, the AMRP work management process has proven supportive of getting work
done in the field. Permit issues, discussed more fully in this report’s Chapter S: Safety and
Compliance, however, have caused significant schedule delays, and have produced work
inefficiency. The next diagram (from the Project Execution Plan) highlights the complexity of
permitting work activities.

Illustration R.5: AMRP Permitting Work Flows

3. Conclusions
R.1

The AMRP work management program appropriately supports construction work.

Peoples Gas employs a reasonably comprehensive work management process that employs sound
work management tools. The work packages provide adequate information for construction
contractors and internal Peoples Gas crews. This report’s Chapter E: Plan for Management
addresses the lack of assignment of project managers to many individual AMRP projects. The lack
of assignment of a project manager for each project leaves no dedicated responsibility and
accountability for managing performance from project inception to completion. Engineering has
charge of the project work flow until construction takes it over. Significant project issues are at
risk of going unaddressed as a result. Use of a project manager at the project level (as
recommended in Chapter E) would provide a clear source for recognizing and addressing risks
early. Permit coordination programs offer an example of such risks that have posed material

consequence for AMRP cost and schedule. Evaluation of contractor performance comprises
another example. Liberty learned that management has undertaken no such evaluation for a
number of years. The Supply Chain organization performed an older evaluation, but reports that
responsibility for doing so now resides with Construction Management.
R.2

Peoples Gas has implemented some improvements to work management practices,
which focus on construction, but has not captured all opportunities for gaining
efficiency in performing repetitive AMRP activities. (Recommendation R.1)

To take advantage of the long duration and repetitive nature of AMRP work, management needs
to focus on opportunities to increase productivity in the installation of mains, services, and meters,
which comprise the three largest components of overall costs. This report’s Chapter I: Resource
Planning addresses productivity monitoring. Moving past the construction ramp-up period and
informed by experience to date, Peoples Gas should be at the point of producing close to maximum
installation efficiency. For instance, Liberty expected the unit rate of work-hours per meter
installed by the internal workforce would show improvement (i.e., reduction). Likewise, the unit
cost of main installation and service installation should lower, or at least remain flat. Failure to
monitor such rates, however, precludes a clear understanding of the direction of such rates over
time. The Company needs to accompany improvements in monitoring such rates with efforts to
examine the potential for process improvements that will produce efficiency gains.
R.3

The AMRP lacks designated project controls engineers that the program needs to
support program managers. (Recommendation R.2)

Managers have the responsibility to manage work effectively and efficiently. They possess varying
degrees of skills, based on their education and experience. Some managers devise their own tools
and some do not. The AMRP needs a consistent set of tools routinely applied to support program
management effectively. The AMRP also needs capable engineers and analysts to examine costs
and to identify potential areas of improvement in effectiveness and efficiency. This report’s
Chapter L: Cost Management addresses this same need from the cost monitoring and analysis
perspective. Its relevance in this context comes from the need for the use of cost data to support
work management changes. Control engineers or cost analysts who examine cost data can assist
construction management in developing metrics and performing analysis designed to highlight
ways to better define and manage field work activities. This report’s Chapter O: Reports and
Analysis discusses the potential for using existing resources to assist in performing cost analytical
functions not currently performed.
R.4

Permit coordination adversely affected progress in the field and imposed cost
inefficiencies. (Recommendation R.3)

The AMRP Monthly Status Report contains a schedule section that summarizes schedule
variances. The 2014 year-end report listed almost 80 percent of project phases as behind schedule.
Many of these delays cited permit issues or still pending approvals from the City’s Office of
Underground Construction as the cause. Schedule delays generally produce cost increases.

4. Recommendations
R.1

Peoples Gas should establish a formal continuous improvement program under the
Impact Team to promote a culture of and an emphasis on seeking innovations to
improve efficiency in the installation of mains, services, and meters. (Conclusion R.2)

A Company-established Impact Team that has been examining AMRP performance for some time
generated a number of initiatives. Most have Integrys-wide application. This team, or a successor
identified by new AMRP leadership, should focus more specifically on improvement opportunities
created by the highly repetitive nature and the long duration of AMRP construction work
(specifically with respect to main, service, and meter installations). Employees working on the
AMRP likely form a primary, if not the most likely, source of identification of improvement
initiatives. A formal continuous improvement program, complete with emphasis on quantifying
costs and benefits will promote a cost awareness culture, and improve efficiency on an on-going
basis.
R.2

Peoples Gas should assign a project control engineer or cost analyst to each of the
three Shops to handle the analysis of all AMRP construction work performed by the
internal workforce and contractors. (Conclusion R.3)

Two other chapters of this report (Chapter L: Cost Management and Chapter O: Reports and
Analysis) discuss the importance of equipping managers with the analytical capability and
resources to support effective management. Some Peoples Gas engineers and cost professionals
have skills suitable for performing this role. Management should combine existing skilled
personnel and added resources to address the needs discussed in those other two chapters. These
resources should also focus specifically on work processes, seeking to identify improvements that
will enhance effectiveness and efficiency. Liberty recommends the assignment of one project
control engineer or cost analyst per Shop to handle the analysis of AMRP construction work
performed by internal workforce and contractors. The Company can matrix them to the cost
management organization recommended in this report’s Chapter L: Cost Management. A matrix
approach will allow them to develop skills and consistency of approach through the cost
management organization, while taking advantage of construction work knowledge in the Shops.
R.3

Peoples Gas should assign a single manager to coordinate AMRP-level permitting
improvement initiatives and to monitor and measure permitting for the duration of
the program. (Conclusion R.4)

Liberty made recommendations regarding permit coordination in this report’s Chapter S: Safety
and Compliance. That chapter addressed improving communications with the City, reorganizing
the External Affairs organization, creating a function dedicated to liaison with the City, improving
performance, enhancing project planning, developing a database for permit applications, and
integrating permitting into project scheduling. To ensure that these improvement needs get proper
and timely attention, the AMRP team should assign at a senior program management level the
responsibility to implement needed changes, and then to continue to resolve any permit
coordination problems.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter S: Safety and Compliance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chapter S: Safety and Compliance
1. Background
This chapter reviews safety violations of Illinois and Federal regulations from the beginning of
2012 through the middle of 2014. The chapter also describes the corrective actions taken. Liberty
conducted this review to determine baseline conditions associated generally with the performance
of work subject to minimum safety standards established by the State of Illinois and the U.S.
Government. The review also focused on compliance with requirements more directly associated
with the AMRP. The City of Chicago is the primary source of such requirements. Compliance with
requirements is essential for the effective performance of a program such as the AMRP. Liberty
sought to determine whether the recent violations history demonstrates any recurring or systemic
problems that have had or that may have a substantial impact on the efficiency, effectiveness, or
safety with of AMRP work.
The field investigation work that Liberty undertook as part of this investigation also has a close
connection with matters of public safety. This chapter discusses some of the safety and compliance
issues observed during those field investigations. Chapter Q: Field Work Performance addresses
those investigations and their findings in detail.
A particular safety focus here concerns notices of violations received by Peoples Gas from
responsible government authorities. Inquiries with respect to such violations included:
 Reviewing safety audits and violations of 49 CFR 192 over the last two years
 Reviewing corrective action reports and other documents relating to prior safety violations
 Reviewing incident reports for root causes that may involve safety violations
 Evaluation of compliance procedures and policies
 Interviewing and observing Company and contractor field personnel
 Integrating reported incidents and safety audits findings to identify any recurring or
systemic issues.

2. Findings
a. Safety
Ensuring public and worker safety at work sites must be a first priority for the AMRP. Liberty’s
field examinations (discussed in more detail in Chapter Q: Field Work Performance) considered
safety. Controlling traffic effectively keeps rights-of-way as clear as possible for the traveling
public. Traffic control also ensures motorist and pedestrian safety. Liberty’s field inspections
found traffic control effective. Chapter T: Government Coordination addresses City relationship
issues involving traffic control. Public and employee safety comprise first priorities in the
performance of AMRP work and in the operation of gas systems.
Worker accident rates among Peoples Gas employees performing AMRP field work have
exceeded those of contractors. This result reflects a reversal from what Liberty has seen elsewhere
for field work in the gas distribution business. A 2008 Liberty audit for the Illinois Commerce
Commission identified upper management focus on promoting and ensuring safety as an issue.
Work on this investigation confirms a continuing need for senior leadership and for AMRP

management to communicate a strong commitment to safety. Liberty’s field investigation work
disclosed instances and conditions that implicate safe work practices and conditions. The Company
has made progress in recent years to reduce the number and the severity of these accidents, but
their rates continue to raise concern.
The next tables list 2012 through mid-2014 safety notices occurring in the City of Chicago. It does
not include violations related to storage or to liquefied natural gas. The section references are to
49 CFR 192 (“Transportation of Natural Gas and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety
Standards”). The notices consist of three types:
 Notices of Amendment (Company procedures require amendment to meet minimum state
or federal requirements)
 Notices of Probable Violations (subject to agreement by the Company or administrative
resolution if contested)
 Inspection Issues (noted by Illinois Commerce Commission inspectors during inspections
of field work or records).

i. City of Chicago Permit Compliance
Liberty examined compliance with City of Chicago permitting requirements. The following tables
summarize issues arising under those requirements. The number of Chicago permit violations rose
from 658 in 2012 to 807 in 2013. The violations include both AMRP and other work. The 2013
violations include 250 resulting from AMRP work. Peoples Gas did not separately identify AMRP
violations prior to 2013. The largest violation causes in 2012 consisted of permitting issues (424
cases of no permitting or failure to report openings), with the second largest causes relating to

restoration (73 cases). Main and service installations require substantial surface restoration work.
City permits subject restoration work to substantive requirements and time limitations. For 2013,
the principal causes remained the same. Permitting issues (unreported openings, lack of permits,
failure to extend permits, incorrect locations) accounted for more than 300 of the 807 violations.
Restoration issues (untimely or failing to meet permit standards) accounted for a number
approaching 200.

c. Actions to Address the Causes of Violations
Violations cannot be completely eliminated on a gas distribution system of the size and nature of
the one that Peoples Gas operates in the City of Chicago. Effective management nevertheless
requires programs, actions, and performance measurement designed to minimize violations. Good
utility practice requires a program for identifying the root causes of recurring problems and for
addressing them promptly and effectively. Liberty’s review included an examination of how
AMRP management addresses such problems in planning, managing, and executing work.
Permit compliance problems and late or poor quality restoration have caused the bulk of City
permit violations. Chapter T: Government Coordination discusses coordination with the City to
address issues associated with securing proper permits and with managing overall relationships
with the City as they concern the AMRP.
Discussions with the City have led to some changes to address the matter of permit violations. One
such change involves the addition of specific restoration inspectors in each of the three,
geographically based Shop areas into which Peoples Gas divided its field organizations. The North
shop added contractor resources to perform restoration work on a 14-day schedule. Peoples Gas
also stopped using a restoration contractor whose poor work had caused numerous violations.
Peoples Gas encouraged contractors unable to handle main and service installations and restoration
to subcontract some restoration work. This approach added to resources available to handle
restoration within applicable time limits.
The changes have positioned Peoples Gas to make improvements in the speed and quality of its
restoration efforts following main and service installations. Decreasing the time for completing
restoration activities, however, causes indirect and adverse effects. Peoples Gas crews perform
back-end work that follows the gas main and installation performed by contractors. The Company
crews have had continuing problems in completing meter placement and tie-in work following
main and service installations. To the extent that restoration promptly follows main and service
installation, late meter placements and tie-ins cause added restoration work. More promptly
performing installation restoration thus increases the inefficiencies that late meter placement and
tie-in produce.
The number and variety of pipeline safety infractions (which include notices of amendments,
inspection issues, and violations) encountered led to the re-institution in 2013 of a self-reporting
letter from Peoples Gas to the Illinois Commerce Commission. This change reflects best practice.
This letter addresses: (a) the violations that the Company deems to have occurred in each quarter,
(b) the Company’s observed reasons for each violation, and (c) corrective actions to prevent
reoccurrence. Liberty observed that self-reported infractions and those found by the Illinois
Commerce Commission show a slight reduction in numbers. Nevertheless, many of the same types
of issues continue to appear.

Examples include missed valve inspections, incomplete or missed leaks or leak rechecks, among
others of concern under the pipeline safety regulations. Examinations by Liberty in a 2008 audit
for the Illinois Commerce Commission identified valve inspections as an issue. Valve
documentation problems continue today. Untimely reporting of new valve installations and
incorporation of as-built information into system maps provide examples.
Chapter Q: Field Work Performance describes the field inspections Liberty undertook as part of
this investigation. Liberty had field inspectors in the area when an incident caused injury to two
Peoples Gas employees. The incident occurred during a gas main re-pressurization. The end
cap/coupling blew out due to pressure. A somewhat similar incident in 2010 caused a Company
employee fatality.
Another recent incident led to increased requirements when the Company seeks to employ
directional drilling (“HDD”) for installing mains and services. It cross-bored (put a gas pipe
through) a sewer. Directional drilling makes use of a boring machine to make a hole through which
the main or gas service can be pulled. Bores can range in length from 20 feet to thousands of feet.
When other underground facilities are present, care must be taken to avoid their location, or to go
under them with sufficient clearance to avoid damage. Some companies using best practices not
only perform location and marking work, but also use test holes to locate physically the other
facilities. Until recently, Peoples Gas did not use test holes.
Peoples Gas agreed to a settlement (see ICC Case 12-0624) regarding a citation for failing to
address the possible presence of sewer laterals when performing directional drilling. The
settlement produced a fine. The Company also made significant procedural changes when using
directional drilling for AMRP work. Crews must now first locate all sewer mains and laterals, use
an inserted TV camera to confirm the location, make test holes to refine location, and document
the information learned. Following installation, but before activation of the main (i.e. gas-in), the
Company must video tape the sewer main and laterals to confirm that none have been affected by
the gas replacement work. The Company keeps these video tapes to verify no damage to the sewers
or laterals during main and service installation.
The federal OSHA violations mainly addressed shoring issues that Peoples Gas appears to have
addressed.
Other data Liberty reviewed confirms the existence of continuing safety issues. A comparison of
overall worker safety over the course of the AMRP shows acceptable results. However, it has taken
exceptionally strong performance by contractor resources to overcome substandard performance
by Company employees. Contractor numbers produce good overall results. Some improvement
has occurred, but employee safety still falls below targets. This report’s Chapter Q: Field Work
Performance addresses management issues underlying employee safety performance.
In addition, the number of leaks being reported and the number and wide variety of self-reported
safety violations since 2013 cause concern. The small decrease in the number of violations shows
some improvement. The fact that the violations reported each quarter show some of the same
causes raises concern, however. The concern surrounds the sufficiency of efforts to address

recurring root causes. The Company only recently instituted a program of formal root cause
analysis. Such programs have comprised an integral element of good utility practice for some time.
Safety programs exist at Peoples Gas, but effective control of safety performance requires strong
and direct upper management engagement.
d. Field Investigations
A number of the findings resulting from Liberty’s field inspections of AMRP work bear directly
on compliance with requirements. Liberty’s inspection work covered all three of the Peoples Gas
Shops into which the Company divided its field operations. Chapter Q describes these inspections
fully.
Their observations disclosed a number of contributors to safety and permit noncompliance and to
work performance problems. Many, but not all, focused on work performed by Company
employees, rather than contractors. These underlying causes have contributed to: incidents creating
public safety risks, observed code non-compliance instances, lost-time Peoples Gas employee
accidents, and installation efficiency loss.

3. Conclusions
S.1

The number and the severity of the past violations and continuing self-reporting
violations indicate a need for management to increase emphasis on compliance with
requirements as an integral element of work performance. (Recommendation S.1)

Liberty’s work for the Illinois Commerce Commission some five years ago raised concerns about
upper management’s focus on public safety. The emphasis that management places on instilling
an aggressive commitment to safety remains an issue. Certainly, the scope and magnitude of
AMRP work brings greater occasion for safety violations and incidents. That change, however,
serves only to increase the importance that the Company must place and continue to emphasize
regarding public and worker safety. The number and nature of Illinois Commerce Commission
safety inspection items and self-reported violations show a continuing need for improvement. The
reported violation data and the observation of Liberty’s field investigation team merit a reexamination of the approach and programs that assure pubic and worker safety.
Upper management cites safety as its highest priority. The challenge comes in making that
commitment an ingrained and central aspect of work planning, execution, and measurement.
Experience to date demonstrates a more reactive than proactive approach to meeting that
challenge. Liberty’s review of compliance with state and city regulatory requirements (pipeline
safety codes in 49 CFR Part 192, related state regulations, and Chicago permit requirements)
indicates that Company actions appear driven at least as much by outside forces, as by internal
direction. Liberty did not find imminent threats to public or employee safety. It nevertheless
remains the case that Peoples Gas needs a stronger source of internal direction to improve its safety
performance.
Over an extended number of years, Peoples Gas has paid fines and has undergone audits performed
both by Company-retained outside firms, and by others working on behalf of regulatory
authorities. There have been instances of incomplete response to the conclusions of examinations

Chapter S: Safety and Compliance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

of various sorts, until outside authorities have taken strong actions. For example, the City of
Chicago stopped construction permits Companywide, pending compliance with certain provisions,
such as prompt completion of required restoration work. There have been positive responses to
such outside forces, but it remains critical that Peoples Gas strengthen leadership, direction,
communication, design, execution, and performance measurement. These actions will confirm that
commitments to compliance drive principally from internal values and objectives.
S.2

The Peoples Gas employee accident rates on AMRP work exceed those of contractor
personnel, and require an increased focus on safety. (Recommendation S.2)

An outside reviewer (PwC) also observed a lack of definition of and approved processes for quality
management. PwC also observed that, while the safety program conformed to industry standards,
its results did not meet expectations. Historical worker safety performance by Peoples Gas
personnel has fallen significantly below that of AMRP contract resources, and significantly below
the goals established for the program. Only exceptional (by comparison) contractor performance
has served to keep overall safety performance at expected levels.

4. Recommendations
S.1

Peoples Gas should invigorate its commitment to safety and permit compliance
through designation of an executive level “champion,” and institute a comprehensive
communications program, set aggressive goals and performance targets, perform
regular measurement, perform root cause analysis, and develop responsive action
plans. (Conclusion S.1)

Integrys and Peoples Gas resources both must contribute to produce effective safety performance
and compliance with permit requirements. The parent has engaged in a number of efforts to
standardize operations across its entities. Liberty was unable to find a single, senior-level person
responsible for championing AMRP safety and compliance. Increasing the focus on such
performance through designating an executive lead with specific responsibility for the AMRP will
materially assist in bringing greater structure and attention to safety and compliance performance.
A strong executive-level communications program, including top leadership is necessary to
underscore the value that the Company places on such performance, its commitment to making
tangible, measureable improvements in that performance, and its intention to hold people
accountable for securing those improvements.
The Company has proposed the use of a senior-level safety committee. Review by a committee
can support safety enhancements, but Liberty believes that it remains essential to place primary
responsibility and accountability in a single executive. Primary reliance on a committee (as
opposed to using a committee for oversight) will tend to diffuse the sense of personal responsibility
that Liberty thinks the history here (going back to the 2008 Liberty audit) shows necessary for
preventing a disconnect in the perceived commitment to safety that appears to exist between upper
management and those in the three Shops who manage and supervise field work.
The Company should also undertake, and has committed to a reexamination of its approach to
safety and of the design and execution of specific programs for ensuring it. This initiative will take
time to plan and execute. Peoples Gas needs to give high priority to the reexamination, and commit
to prompt changes to address its findings.

Chapter S: Safety and Compliance

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The Company should establish quantitative stretch goals for compliance performance, seeking
measurable and material improvements year-over-year. This approach will permit a ratcheting up
of safety and compliance performance as safety culture changes, as root cause analysis matures,
and as measurement and incentives for reaching targets take hold.
The recently adopted use of root cause analysis should form a central part of this enhanced
approach to safety. It will take more comprehensive and consistent application of inspection
resources, regular use of a consistent set of performance metrics, checklists, and results reporting
to support such analysis. A dedicated group should exist, at least for so long as material
improvement in performance is possible. That group should perform root cause analyses, and to
work with executive leadership and field organizations to identify areas where mitigation will have
the greatest impact, and what forms of mitigation will work best.
The result should be focused program-improvement initiatives that dedicate resources, establish
milestones, target measurable improvements, and monitor progress. Another short term effort
should consist of a structured sharing of techniques, practices, and quantitative results among the
three Shop areas, to identify best practices that may have common application. The Company also
needs to examine means to make performance measurement more sensitive to safety and
compliance performance, and to ensure that individual incentives weight this area sufficiently.
S.2

Peoples Gas should more closely examine the root causes and develop a responsive
action plan to improve employee accident rates. (Conclusion S.2)

Discussions between Liberty and senior leadership, which began last September, produced
consensus on the need for specific organizational and programmatic change to address worker
safety. The recommended emphasis on commitment to safety and making a senior executive
responsible for championing a safety culture comprises an important first step.
Liberty recommends, and understands that the Company accepts, the need for immediate-term
changes while longer term efforts progress. Peoples Gas proposed provisionally to use American
Gas Association Best Practices as a method to improve safety performance. Those practices
undoubtedly have merit. Following them rigorously should make near term improvements in
safety. The Association, however, considers them confidential. Therefore, a broad commitment to
use them will not leave the two-year monitoring effort that follows this audit with a clear baseline
for measuring the effectiveness of implementation.
Therefore, the Company needs to use the guidelines as a basis for generating a clear set of
standards, supporting practices, and measurable milestones and activities. This set must have
enough transparency to support implementation monitoring. Moreover, other sources of best
practices exist. For example, the Midwest Gas Association provides safety training.
Communication with other gas associations, industry meetings, working with regulators, and
reaching out to peer companies provides other sources of information.
AMRP contractors have produced worker safety results superior to those of Company workers.
Examining the programs, methods, and activities the contractors use can, as Peoples Gas proposes
to do, provide information useful in promoting change. The Company has also proposed to record

and regularly analyze safety performance data for longer term use in identifying problem areas
and solutions. Liberty recommends the prompt initiation of focused efforts in each of these two
areas.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter T: Government Coordination

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chapter T: Governmental Coordination
1. Background
This chapter discusses Liberty’s examination of the relationship and coordination between the
AMRP and associated activities and the various governmental and other eternal entities with which
Peoples Gas has primary interactions, including:
 City of Chicago
 State of Illinois
 Railroads
 Chicago Parks District
 Chicago Forest Preserve
 Other utilities.
Effective AMRP performance requires strong coordination with government and other utility
infrastructure planners. Such coordination must consider existing and firm city and state planned
replacements and new installations. It must also consider less firm goals and objectives. The latter
require consideration due to their potential for turning into shovel-ready projects. In general, even
where government plans do not include certain older water and sewer facilities, gas infrastructure
planning needs to recognize older, poorer performing city and state infrastructure as more likely
for future replacement.
Performing an accelerated main replacement program involves a significant amount of traffic and
neighborhood disruption. Close compliance with municipal rules and regulations is necessary to
minimize disruptions and the costs associated with traffic management.

2. Findings
a. City of Chicago Department of Transportation
Primary interaction between Peoples Gas facilities and the City of Chicago arises from the
Company’s location of pipe and other gas infrastructure in the “Public Way” (roads, sidewalks,
bridges, and other City transportation infrastructure). The Chicago Department of Transportation
(“CDOT”) maintains that infrastructure, and manages and coordinates its use by public and private
utilities, contractors, developers and others seeking to locate facilities and equipment, either
temporarily or permanently, in the Public Way.
The Chicago Department of Transportation maintains Rules and Regulations for Construction in
the Public Way (“Rules and Regulations”) in hard copy and online. These rules and regulations set
forth the requirements for conducting private activity in the Public Way. Prior to commencement
of the AMRP, the Department last updated the Rules and Regulations in 2007. Further revisions
came in 2012 and again in 2014. These revisions created the City’s Project Coordination Office,
and made a number of substantive changes in requirements. Moreover, as AMRP activity
accelerated, the City began more actively to enforce some existing regulations.

i. Office of Underground Coordination
In the early 1990s, after the Chicago flood, the City’s Department of Transportation formed the
Office of Underground Coordination (“OUC”) to act as the distribution agency within the
Department’s Division of Infrastructure Management. The Office undertook responsibility to
coordinate underground construction work, schedules, and traffic flows. The Office of
Underground Coordination handles all requests related to existing utility infrastructure. The Office
also manages the review and approval of construction in or adjacent to the Public Way.
The Department’s Rules and Regulations state that:
The OUC is responsible for the protection of the City’s surface and subsurface
infrastructure from damage due to plan and programmed construction, installation, and
maintenance projects. The intent of OUC membership is to review proposed projects in or
adjacent to the right of way prior to construction so that there is minimal damage to
existing infrastructure.
The Office of Underground Coordination’s more than 25 stakeholders include City agencies and
private entities. Members of the Office of Underground Coordination include, among others,
Peoples Gas, Commonwealth Edison, Comcast, the Chicago Departments of Water and Sewer
Management, a number of agencies of the City of Chicago, and various other parties. These
stakeholders review all requests for work in the Public Way to determine the effects of proposed
activities on existing facilities. Each member reviews individual requests, comments on those
requests, and provides records of existing facilities, and notification of conflicts.
ii. The Project Coordination Office
Stimulated in part by the substantial increase in construction in the Public Way and the associated
steep ramp-up in associated permit requests, the Chicago Department of Transportation formed
the Project Coordination Office (“PCO”) in 2012. The goal was to ... improve on the coordination
of projects, which were previously performed in “silos,” with ... no common repository and no
traceable record of attempt to coordinate activities. The Project Coordination Office includes
approximately 13 contract engineers, transportation specialists, analysts, and field staff.
The Office identified major stakeholders involved in project coordination. Those entities include:
 Chicago Department of Transportation
 City Department of Water Management
 City Department of Sewer Management
 Peoples Gas
 Commonwealth Edison
 Chicago Transit Authority
 Chicago Park District
 Comcast
 AT&T
 Dept. of Cultural Affairs and Special Events.

iii. AMRP Interfaces with the City of Chicago
Many Peoples Gas activities and programs require substantial engagement with the City of
Chicago regarding physical activity on City property. The AMRP’s high public profile and large
scope impose particularly broad and important interface needs. The other Peoples Gas programs
and activities requiring interface typically involve isolated repairs or individualized construction
projects. By contrast, the AMRP’s citywide nature, spread over the City’s 50 wards over the
duration of the project, involves groups of entire City blocks at a time.
Peoples Gas interactions with City personnel include a variety of meetings with City officials and
representatives, the submission of various planning and design documents, the receipt of various
City planning and design documents for City-owned infrastructure, applications for permits, and
receipt of citations for violations of City rules and regulations.
iv. Chicago Department of Transportation Permits
Private activity in the Public Way (e.g., opening pavement, blocking or diverting traffic, moving
oversize vehicles) requires a permit from the Department of Transportation. Permits typically
cover a 30-day period, and provide for two 30-day extensions at no additional charge. Beyond 90
days, the holder must apply for a new permit, and pay attendant charges. For complex projects
such as the AMRP, application requires a multi-step process. The process includes certain
submissions well in advance of the actual permit request. In recent years, Peoples Gas has received
over 10,000 permits per year. Most Company applications cover work unrelated to the AMRP.
The City has granted some of the entities most active in the Public Way, including Peoples Gas,
electronic access to the Chicago Department of Transportation computer system. This access
enables electronic permit applications. Working with the City’s information technology group,
Peoples Gas has developed a software application (the “Portal”). This application allows the
Company to perform most permitting activities electronically. Peoples Gas has access to the City’s
maps and engineering drawings and associated paperwork.
A written, Peoples Gas Work Management Information System Arm Web Portal procedure
describes the steps necessary to prepare permit applications. Four Peoples Gas Construction
Planning Office employees have access to the Portal, as do employees in other offices, including
some new service coordinators and O&M staff.
b. State of Illinois
Some roadways in the City of Chicago fall under the authority of the Illinois State Department of
Transportation (“IDOT”). Since the AMRP began, the Company has applied for and received 167
Illinois Department of Transportation permits. From the perspective of Peoples Gas and the
AMRP, this jurisdiction places an overlay of more stringent traffic control requirements on streetaffecting work. The City’s maps designate state-jurisdictional streets. Peoples Gas has access to
these designations through the electronic portal. Peoples Gas cannot, however, make electronic
permit applications for state-jurisdictional streets. The Company hand delivers them, and receives
comments back from the State by hand or e-mail.

c. Other Entities
Peoples Gas also requires a small number of permits or similar accommodations for several other
uses. They include railroad rights-of-way, park property (from the Chicago Park District), and the
Forest Preserve District of Cook County.
Peoples Gas facilities cross railroad rights-of-way at numerous locations. In order to commence
AMRP work on these facilities, the Company must work under an existing agreement or acquire
a new permit. The latter may involve fees. Since AMRP project inception, Peoples Gas has filed
for access permits for approximately 30 railroad crossings. They concern property owned or
controlled by some 10 different railroads. Each railroad has its own, unique permitting process.
Railroad crossing permits require long lead times and special attention. The Company maintains a
spreadsheet database of current or planned railroad crossing applications.
Peoples Gas must acquire special permits for a project any part of which takes place with Chicago
Park District or Forest Preserve District property. Each of these two entities has its own permit
application form and specific application requirements, such as insurance coverage, submission of
project plan and drawings, and applications fees. Park and Forestry permits represent a small
number of permit applications annually. Peoples Gas handles them on an ad hoc basis.
d. Peoples Gas External Affairs Office
Prior to 2014, Peoples Gas assigned a single employee (with support from three representatives)
to handle external affairs with both the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois. This employee
focused primarily on State government activities in Springfield. This combination of
responsibilities left management of the relationship with the City not well coordinated. In February
2014, Peoples Gas hired a new Senior Director of Government and Community Relations. This
director brought experience in Illinois government, and focused on state government affairs. In
mid-2014, the Company also hired a new Manager of Local Government and Community Affairs.
This manager brought extensive experience with the City of Chicago. The Company also added
an additional analyst, bringing the total number of analysts to four. The Company has assigned the
analysts to act as liaisons assigned to address specific City wards.
The new organization, and in particular the focus on the City, came about to enhance
communication and collaboration with local government and community stakeholders.
Additionally, Peoples Gas External Affairs conducted meetings with Chicago Department of
Transportation officials and with Aldermen from time to time.
Recently, the Associate General Counsel, Legal Affairs, coordinated the initiation of a biweekly
meeting of senior personnel involved in the relationship with the City. This meeting includes,
among others, the Peoples Gas President, the general and the associate general counsel,
government and community relations personnel, AMRP project management, the head of Gas
Operations, and regulatory personnel. The group has met approximately half a dozen times so far,
with a focus on improving overall communication with the City. The group also seeks to develop
a coordinated effort to identify, at a high level in the Company, existing and potential problems
with the City. Eventually, Legal Affairs hopes to continue the meetings, to maintain coordinated
communication with the City and to expand the meeting focus to identify risks.

e. City of Chicago Communications Channels
Peoples Gas uses a number of communications channels with the Chicago Department of
Transportation. The channels include electronic exchange of information, meetings, applications
for permits, and issuance of citations by the City. Examples of plans, drawings, and other
information exchange include submission of capital design projects for review and approval,
submission of a five-year Capital Improvement Plan and the City’s sharing of sewer designs with
Peoples Gas, when 30 percent complete, to identify potential conflicts.
The Company participates in several different types of meetings with the Chicago Department of
Transportation and others parties. Most consist of regularly scheduled meetings, and most address
all Peoples Gas activities, not just the AMRP. The next table summarizes regular meetings.

Update on AMRP permitting & related
matters

f. Permits from CDOT
The AMRP requires a relatively small percentage of the permits Peoples Gas has acquired from
the City. For example, in 2011, Peoples Gas had approximately 5,000 openings for corrosion work
in the City Public Way. Comparable data is not available for that year, but for comparison
purposes, the Company had acquired approximately 13,450 permits from the City in 2012. Only
1,774 (13 percent) of the permits addressed AMRP work.
One cannot compare the numbers directly. AMRP permits typically cover multiple City blocks,
with multiple openings. Corrosion openings often address individual, small openings (for example,
to replace an anode). In many such cases, the Office of Underground Coordination does not get
involved, but from a “permit processing” perspective, each data point represents a discreet permit
application.
The next graph shows the total numbers of AMRP permits received from the City for the AMRP,
on a monthly basis. The data are approximations; precise data is not available. The graph shows
that activities other than the AMRP drive most permit needs, when measured by permit numbers.

AMRP Permits

The City charges a standard fee for each permit application. The next table provides an excerpt
from the Chicago Department of Transportation Permit Fee Schedule for 2015.

In addition to the base fee, various adders apply for operating equipment, parking vehicles,
obstructing lanes, and various other activities in the Public Way. Some permitting fees for planned
obstructions to the Public Way run higher in the Central Business District. The table below shows
the total cost (in millions of dollars) to Peoples Gas for all permits and for AMRP permits during
the years 2011 through September 2014. The AMRP permit cost column represents an
approximation, made under the assumption that all permits fees are equal.

Obtaining a permit requires two sets of filings through the Portal. During the engineering
evaluation phase, Peoples Gas identifies a “project polygon” (essentially the boundaries of the
project), and prepares preliminary drawings. After internal review, editing and revision, the

Company creates detailed drawings, and electronically creates a “permit pending” file in the
Chicago Department of Transportation database. That filing includes drawings. The Company
submits the project information to the Office of Underground Coordination and all its members
for identification of potential conflicts with other facilities. The resulting identification of conflicts
process (termed the Existing Facility Protection, or “ESP”) must be competed in 30 days. Pending
projects typically bring discussion at an Office of Underground Coordination weekly conflicts
meeting. After discussion and resolution of conflicts, the project receives Existing Facility
Protection approval from the Office of Underground Coordination. Peoples Gas can then finalize
the actual permit application.
g. Permits from Illinois Department of Transportation
Illinois Department of Transportation-designated Public Ways involve more stringent traffic
control requirements. Peoples Gas has requested and received a relatively small number of Illinois
Department of Transportation permits since the AMRP began. The next table summarizes them.
This small number compares to the 55,000 Chicago Department of Transportation permits, both
AMRP and non-AMRP, received for the same period.

Peoples Gas does not maintain its own database for Illinois Department of Transportation permits.
The Portal does not enable the identification of all Illinois Department of Transportation permitted
projects in a specific report. Each individual Illinois Department of Transportation project is
designated as such on the application and the permit.
Illinois Department of Transportation interests with respect to permitting concern only traffic
management. Its permit applications therefore require (by contrast with City requirements)
abbreviated information about pipe installation. The State, however, requires a traffic management
plan. These permit applications typically require a 3 to 6 month review, but a traffic review can
extend the period by a month. Prior to 2014, Peoples Gas used design consultants to prepare permit
requests to Illinois Department of Transportation. However, the Company, determining that it
needed better coordination of the submissions, began handling them in-house.
Illinois Department of Transportation permits are effective for 6 months. Up to a week before
expiration, they may be extended for another 6 months. If the project extends beyond 12 months,
Peoples Gas must reapply for a new permit.
h. City Non-Compliance Citations
Chapter S: Safety and Compliance discusses safety and permit violations in detail. That chapter
focuses on their impacts on public and work safety, and on work performance effectiveness and

efficiency. This chapter addresses interfaces with the City on matters of permit compliance.
Chicago Department of Transportation inspectors inspect work sites in the Public Way, to ensure
compliance with Rules and Regulations. City inspectors who observe a violation may request that
the crew involved remedy the problem on the spot, to the extent possible, or may issue a citation.
These paper citations, similar to traffic tickets issued to the violator, specify the particular
violation(s) observed. Examples include working without a permit, working with an expired
permit, improper restoration of pavement or sidewalk, and improper barricades.
Beginning January 1, 2014, Peoples Gas began keeping a “citations dashboard” to improve its
ability to identify the root causes of citations. For the month of September 2014, the Company
received approximately 585 citations. About 30 percent of them came at AMRP locations. The
Company observes that expired permits comprise the largest root cause of non-AMRP violations
(representing about 21 percent), followed by unreported openings (i.e., no permit) at 15 percent.
Incomplete and non-compliant (relative to City specifications) restoration accounted for over half
of AMRP violations.
In an attempt to reduce the numbers of violations and associated citations with respect to project
completion, Peoples Gas has been negotiating with Chicago Department of Transportation to
provide better definition around restoration requirements and to develop more specific guidelines
on acceptable timeframes for certain longer term activities.

3. Conclusions
T.1

In responding to the new work volumes imposed by the AMRP, the City experienced
some growing pains associated with infrastructure management.

The AMRP creates a primary programmatic interface between Peoples Gas and the City of
Chicago. The nature of AMRP projects causes construction activity to run the lengths of entire city
blocks, often on both sides of the street. By the end of the program, the AMRP will involve every
ward of the city. These features bring to the AMRP far more attention than do the multitude of
other repair or replacement projects and ongoing O&M work that neighborhoods typically
experience. Significant problems at the outset of the AMRP served to aggravate the disruptions
and public irritations that work on such a large scale inevitably produces.
Both the City and Peoples Gas acknowledge that when the Company began the AMRP in 2011,
the City was not equipped to handle the volume and complexity of the permitting work load.
Considering the poor management of the AMRP and the volume of permit requests, Department
of Transportation personnel have characterized the first AMRP year (2011) as extraordinarily
difficult. The City fairly promptly rewrote its Rules and Regulations, making changes in 2012, and
following them with a more comprehensive, 2014 revision. The creation of the City’s Project
Coordination Office came in 2014 as well.
T.2

The Chicago Department of Transportation’s perception of Peoples Gas performance
has been very negative, although it may be beginning to improve. (Recommendation
T.1)

From the Department’s perspective, the relationship with Peoples Gas is defined by much more
than the AMRP. The corrosion group made some 5,000 openings in the Public Way in 2011. Thus,
May 5, 2015

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter T: Government Coordination

ICC14GAS0002

while some of the observations below are AMRP-specific, many apply more generally to all
operations.
Chicago Department of Transportation personnel observed that:
 Peoples Gas is very “siloed,” with poor communications across Company operations
groups.
 The performance of the three Shops into which Peoples Gas divided its field operations
varies considerably.
 Information conveyed by the Department of Transportation to Company managers does
not make it to the field.
 Permit applications are not synchronized with construction.
 Permits stay open and active far too long.
 Peoples Gas is slow to update its databases. The Company often applies for permits to
repair or service pipe it has replaced (e.g., it applies for permits to replace anodes on legacy
steel pipe replaced under the AMRP).
 Peoples Gas does not have enough crews to meet its schedules.
 Some areas of normal O&M operations present problems much more significant than does
AMRP work.
 Restoration has continued as one of the most contentious and problematic issues. This issue
results in part from the City’s approach of considering AMRP projects “open” until
retirements of replaced facilities are made and final restoration is complete. The Company
by contrast considers them complete at an earlier stage. Thus, if a project takes many
months for final completion, a common occurrence, pavement, parkway, sidewalk, or lawn
restoration either languishes or is only partially addressed. (Note that the broader issue of
restoration is discussed elsewhere in this report, in this report’s Chapter Q: Field Work
Performance).
 Overall, the City expects a higher level of project management and control than the
Company has been able to deliver.
On a more positive note, Chicago Department of Transportation observed that:
 Communications improved substantially in 2014
 There have been some recent positive management changes
 The Department is now able to give Alderman complaints directly to Peoples Gas to
address, rather than having to be the intermediary.
 The Department is willing to give the Company credit for trying to address the problems
that work creates for the City.
Reorganizing External Affairs and hiring new, experienced staff in that office spawned
improvement in relationships with the City and Chicago Department of Transportation. The
separation of state and City liaison functions between two employees created a dedicated City
liaison for the first time. The new liaison and executive management have engaged more actively
with the City. This change has created the opportunity for continuing relationship improvement.
The newness of this approach and structure and the history of relationships with the City make it
essential for Peoples Gas to continue concerted efforts to promote a fully effective relationship
with authorities responsible for AMRP permitting and compliance.

Fundamentally, however, the relationship with the City and the Chicago Department of
Transportation has been and will continue to be a function of the management and execution of
the AMRP and all other Peoples Gas construction and maintenance activities in the Public Way.
Overall, communications with Chicago Department of Transportation and the City have improved,
and show promise of further improvement. However, there is a limit to what even the most
effective communications can accomplish. Beyond a certain point, which the Company appears to
be approaching rapidly, improving relationships with the City will depend upon improving
performance in the field. Ultimately, what is needed is good project planning, scheduling,
management and execution, not just of the AMRP but of all interactions with the City and Chicago
Department of Transportation.
T.3

The Peoples Gas methods for managing permit applications and compliance have not
been adequate to meet the needs of the AMRP. (Recommendations T.2 and T.3)

The City’s permitting function serves important public interests, and comprises a complex
operation. Nobody makes more permit applications to the City than Peoples Gas does. Many
parties request permits from the City for a variety of reasons. Applications range from
nonrecurring, single applications by small contractors, to the thousands that Peoples Gas seeks
annually. The next table summarizes the numbers of permits issued in total and to Peoples Gas
alone.

The City’s permitting operation requires it to undertake a significant level of effort to address an
average of over 2,000 permits per week. Moreover, the City roughly estimates that more than half
of all permits involve some form of excavation. The resulting level of disruption magnifies the
burden on the City to ensure that its processes protect public interests; e.g., traffic flow, motorist
and pedestrian safety, and the integrity of City facilities. Thus, it becomes incumbent on Peoples
Gas to ensure that it does all it can to support City efforts, and to understand and be responsive to
City needs.
Liberty found that Peoples Gas does not maintain a data base of permit applications. A proper
tracking system, which such a database would support, should form a basic tool for managing a
repetitive activity with thousands of individual elements.
Three analysts in the AMRP Construction Planning office spend full time handling AMRP permit
applications. They maintain various records to track permit applications, but no database of AMRP
or non-AMRP permit applications exists. Tellingly, the data on permit numbers that this chapter
reports comes not from the Company, but from the Chicago Department of Transportation, which
derives the information from City invoices to Peoples Gas for permit fees.

Part of the reason for the absence of a database comes from the Peoples Gas scheduling approach.
The Company prepared formal project schedules only for the construction portions of work.
Computerized schedules did not capture the planning and engineering phases of work. Doing so
would enable the Company to capture permitting information for management and analysis.
Chapter H: Schedule Planning addresses scheduling in detail.
The lack of a database presents a number of problems:
 Analysts must individually track the permits they follow, in order to ensure timely
processing, and to follow-up with the City if they are delayed for any reason.
 Chicago Department of Transportation permits are “date stamped” on the date of issuance,
with no record of the date of submission on the permit. Peoples Gas does not maintain a
database of permit applications. Therefore, the Company cannot provide basic
management control and analytic data, such as the average time from submission to
granting a permit, the range of response times, or even how many permits are outstanding
at a given time. The Company cites delays by the City in processing permit applications
on occasion. Because Peoples Gas does not maintain a database of applications, however,
it has no way to determine processing times by the City except on a case by case basis.
 Peoples Gas analysts manually track certain permits identified to them as critical, but
employ no formalized reporting or tracking system.
 The permitting process does not link to project schedules.
One manifestation of this absence of a management tool is that important items get overlooked. A
great many of the citations and associated fines issued by the City to Peoples Gas, discussed later
in this chapter, result from lack of or expired permits.
Moreover, it is clear that the limitations described above apply to a great, and perhaps greater
extent, to non-AMRP activities. The resulting problems necessarily have an impact on the overall
relationship with the City and, in turn, the needs of the AMRP.
T.4

Peoples Gas does not take advantage of the reporting capabilities of the Chicago
Department of Transportation system. (Recommendation T.4)

The City maintains an in-house database of permit applications from all entities. The City uses this
database to coordinate and track permit-related activities and status. That system cannot substitute
for the database that Peoples Gas needs, but it nevertheless generates a number of regular, periodic
internal reports. Some of them may prove useful to AMRP management. Chicago Department of
Transportation personnel expressed to Liberty a willingness to provide relevant reports to Peoples
Gas through the Portal, and to consider providing custom reports. The Company has not made
overtures to the City to take advantage of this potential tool for ensuring effective coordination
with the City.
The Department’s computer system, to which Peoples Gas gains access through the Portal system,
has limitations. The lack of application-date tracking provides an example of these limitations. The
Company has accepted this limitation, rather than developing its own database to track those dates,
as well as other relevant information.

For example, the City’s system contains a flaw that introduces errors into addresses involving the
crossing of intersections. Most AMRP applications include intersection crossings. Permits in these
cases thus issue with incorrect addresses. Peoples Gas must request and receive the needed
corrections. Both the Chicago Department of Transportation and the Company acknowledge this
problem. Peoples Gas has not developed a good work-around. The City expects this problem to be
remedied with an upgrade to its system, now anticipated in early 2015.
Peoples Gas also believes that limitations on administrative staffing at the Chicago Department of
Transportation impedes permitting processes. Without investigating the accuracy of this
perception, Liberty nevertheless believes that prior performance problems at Peoples Gas and
historically poor communications between the Company and the Chicago Department of
Transportation make discussion and resolution of that perceived roadblock difficult.
T.5

Peoples Gas has an appropriate process for managing the permitting of rail crossings,
but does not enter all relevant data into its tracking tool. (Recommendation T.5)

Since AMRP inception, Peoples Gas has processed approximately 30 rail crossings with some 10
different railroads. These crossings include AMRP and non-AMRP activities. Peoples Gas
determines the need and prepares applications for those permits on a case-by-case basis. Such
applications typically require long lead times and processes unique for each railroad, and
sometimes for each crossing. The Company tracks the status of the applications and related
activities with a spreadsheet.
The small number of railroad crossings and related permits and the individualized requirements of
each railroad would render a standard application procedure ineffective. For the same reasons, the
simple spreadsheet database appears appropriate. However, not all elements of the database
maintained by the Company are complete. In most cases the database does not indicate when the
status of each application was last reviewed, and does not provide for future review or due dates.
It also does not indicate the responsible person(s) in the organization.
T.6

Peoples Gas is cited extensively for non-compliance with Chicago Department of
Transportation Rules and Regulations for both AMRP and non-AMRP work.
(Recommendation T.6)

Peoples Gas provided a partial database of citations dating back to 2008. It demonstrates that the
Company has been cited for violations many hundreds of times, perhaps over a thousand times per
year by Chicago Department of Transportation inspectors. In 2013, total fines associated with
citations approached a half million dollars for the year.
The results indicated by the citations dashboard in 2014 and the citation database, although
incomplete, support the City’s statements, summarized earlier, that restoration represents a chronic
problem area. The largest numbers of violations appear to be related to restoration, followed by no
permit or working outside the limitations of the permit. Chapter S: Safety and Compliance
addresses the planning, scheduling, and work performance issues that contribute to such permit
violations.

The AMRP has not generated an abnormally high level of traffic management
concerns.

Discussions with the City did not identify the management of traffic to be a significant problem
area. Liberty’s field investigation team also did not observe notable traffic flow or management
issues during visits to construction sites. Note that Liberty did not audit for compliance with
specific Chicago Department of Transportation traffic regulations, compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), or other City ordinances. The team limited its field observations
about traffic to general conditions associated with minimizing traffic obstructions and promoting
public and worker safety.

4. Recommendations
T.1

Peoples Gas needs to continue to focus on improving communications and
relationships with the City and with its Department of Transportation, but must
recognize that it will take improved permitting and work performance to create and
sustain relationships at the level needed to optimize AMRP performance. (Conclusion
T.2)

Peoples Gas has made substantial strides in addressing the issues it has with the City, through
designation of a specific liaison and resultant activities. The internal meetings focusing on Cityrelated activities also show high level attention to the relationship. Permanent and meaningful
change will require a continuing priority on relationship improvement. However, as important as
communications and relationships with the City may be, Peoples Gas performance in the field
becomes the more important factor going forward. Improving performance in meeting permitting
requirements and expectations comprises a more significant driver of the relationship with the City
and of success in carrying out the AMRP, as other chapters of this report address.
T.2

Peoples Gas should expand the scope of AMRP project schedules to incorporate
permitting requirements. (Conclusion T.3)

Chapter H: Schedule Planning addresses the lack of integration in AMRP project schedules, which
have included only construction activities. Project scheduling needs to integrate permitting needs
and requirements. A complex long-term project with many thousands of individual activities
requires a sophisticated, integrated management control system that tracks individual component
projects end to end. From a management control perspective, there is no bright line between phases
such as planning, engineering and construction. Precursor activities in one phase often prove
critical to the following phase. Permitting should not be considered a parallel activity, but an
integral part of the end-to-end set of processes needed to effectively and efficiently manage AMRP
projects. Permitting should form a central part of the scheduling process.
T.3

Peoples Gas should develop a database of permit applications. (Conclusion T.3)

Peoples Gas cannot expect to rely on the Chicago Department of Transportation database as its
management tool. The City designed it to meet the needs of the Chicago Department of
Transportation’s permitting operation, not the business of constructing and maintaining a gas
system. The Chicago Department of Transportation database is not under Peoples Gas control,
does not include a number of parameters that Peoples Gas should be tracking, and cannot be
validated by the Company. A spreadsheet database can be developed and implemented very

quickly, on a going-forward basis, to improve the Company’s knowledge and control over its
permitting operations.
The permit database should include all permit applications to the Chicago Department of
Transportation. From the Department’s perspective, the distinction between AMRP and nonAMRP work is not material.
T.4

Peoples Gas should work with the Chicago Department of Transportation to
determine which existing and potential reports from the Department’s system are
available and which could be provided to Peoples Gas. (Conclusion T.4)

Department representatives indicated to Liberty the existence of regular internal reports of
permitting activity that it could provide to the Company. It may be able to create some custom
reports as well. The Company would be well served to meet with the Department to explore that
option, for the purposes of better managing its construction and operations and understanding the
City’s perspective on Company activities. Reports from the City are not a substitute for a Company
database, but will help until one is developed, and will enable Peoples Gas to see what the City
sees on a continuing basis.
T.5

Peoples Gas should improve the database of rail crossing permits. (Conclusion T.5)

The relatively simple spreadsheet database of railroad permits serves AMRP needs generally.
However, it is incomplete and not up-to-date. It operates as a “side record,” as opposed to a formal
project management tool. The “one-off” nature of rail crossing permits and their long lead times
create sources of potential gaps (e.g., in identifying critical activities and milestone dates). The
Company should clean up the database, and keep it current.
T.6

Peoples Gas should improve its database of citations. (Conclusion T.6)

Fundamentally, Peoples Gas needs to improve its management and construction practices to reduce
dramatically the number of citations. However, in the meantime and even with a much reduced
number of citations, a database is a fundamental management tool to provide feedback to
management and to the Shops and crews as to how the Company is performing in complying with
applicable rules and regulations. As with the permit database, the citations database operates as a
side record rather than a tool embedded in AMRP management processes.

Chapter U: Customer Coordination
This chapter addresses the methods used to gain access to customer premises to change meters and
to cut services over to new supply facilities. It also examines the sources of customer complaints
about impacts of the AMRP and Peoples Gas methods for responding to those complaints.

1. Background
New main and service installation can cause significant disruption to neighborhoods. The work
affects residents, municipalities, and those using the streets. Peoples Gas construction crews must
interrupt street and driveway parking, and dig up lawns and sidewalks. In many cases, Peoples Gas
crews can only restore property temporarily, until weather cooperates sufficiently to permit
concrete pours, sod laying, and replanting. Even when a main replacement project goes smoothly
and on schedule in a community, it still brings substantial public inconvenience. Programs to
accelerate main replacement magnify this impact, thus heightening the risk to program success
and Company image.
Effective and timely communications about planned work and progress in performing it form a
critical component of any large project in populated areas. A program like the AMRP magnifies
the challenges, because it: (a) has a broad impact on customers and communities, and (b) depends
on customer cooperation for prompt and effective work completion. The AMRP involves large
scale relocation of inside meters, regulators, and shut-off valves to the outside. It also requires
installation of new service piping to connect to new mains. The multi-step process for
accomplishing work requires considerable coordination with customers in gaining access to meters
for moving, cutting over, and relighting gas service.
The quality of customer experience during the project offers a principal measure of AMRP success,
and ultimately the Company’s image in the community and with public officials. Minimizing the
negative impacts that this experience brings requires well-planned and comprehensive efforts.
Such efforts must explain the work process, highlight the benefits that work completion will bring,
and keep customers and other stakeholders informed about progress. An effective process for
responding to questions, issues, and complaints must exist. In order to maintain good customer
rapport, Peoples Gas also needs to demonstrate flexibility in responding to varying customer needs.
Flexibility may require scheduling crews to work evenings and weekends, or by-appointment,
particularly for customers unavailable during normal business hours.
Managing customer communications effectively requires development of a communications plan
that identifies the range of customer expectations and needs and communications materials to
address each.
Liberty examined how Peoples Gas has identified the range of customer needs and expectations
and the sufficiency of efforts to meet them.

2. Findings
As expressed in Peoples Gas AMRP Communications Plan:
The AMRP program is the largest infrastructure improvement project ever undertaken
by Peoples Gas, and it will touch a significant portion of the Chicago community
whether directly through construction to replace lines that serve homes and businesses,

or through resulting ancillary traffic disruptions, or through cost of service. Given the
magnitude and visibility of the program, Peoples Gas recognizes the criticality of
effectively communicating the impacts and benefits to stakeholders across its service
area.
The AMRP Communications Team created a Communications Plan and templates to assist with
communication of the program prior to kickoff in 2011. The AMRP project charter designated a
Communications Team responsible for internal and external AMRP-related communications.
Specific deliverables defined in the charter included a project Communications Plan,
communications materials and a “revised and updated” process for communicating about AMRP
to all stakeholders.
The goal of the overall communications effort for the AMRP program is to maintain Peoples
Gas’ image with the community, and to look for opportunities to enhance the company’s image
where possible.
Peoples Gas published a draft AMRP Communications Plan in May 2011, prior to the launch of
the program. The draft Plan identified and discussed:
 Communications Objectives and Goals
 Key messaging
 Communications materials to be developed and material review protocols
 Media Relations and Governmental Affairs protocols
 Public Relations and Media events and potential sponsorship opportunities
 Communications protocols
 Goals, strategy, concerns, messaging for each key stakeholder
 Internal and external communications strategies and tactics
 The need to develop a program to handle escalated complaints
 Existing communications channels that can be leveraged
 The need to define measures to determine success in achieving goals and objectives of the
Plan
 Plan for AMRP kick-off/ribbon cutting to introduce program to employees and recognize
work-to-date.
However, Peoples Gas did not keep the plan up-to-date. Moreover, the three Peoples Gas district
field organizations (the “Shops”) did not adopt the plan fully. The Communications Team created
the Plan, and facilitated communications processes in the field. Management, however, allowed
the Shops to deviate from the plan, and continue with a business-as-usual approach for AMRP
meter-access communications.
a. Access to Customer Premises
Peoples Gas requires access to customer homes and buildings at least twice during the main
upgrade process: (a) first for service markings, and (b) second to move the meter and connect to
the new gas main. In some cases, the Company requires a third appointment to locate and check
the sewer line.

Chapter U: Customer Coordination

A month before contractor construction crews begin work in a neighborhood, the Company mails
introductory letters and an informational flyer to customers. These materials explain the program
and set expectations. This process begins when a block permit is ordered for a neighborhood.
Cfirst, Peoples Gas’ customer information system, identifies all affected accounts within a
neighborhood, and mails the introductory letters.
A week later, Peoples Gas sends a follow-up letter requesting an appointment to mark-out the
service. The letters instruct customers to call the Contact Center or visit the website to set an
appointment. Peoples Gas intends to move indoor meters to the outside of customer premises.
Service marking thus also identifies the most logical outside location for the meter. Construction
contractors generally follow within a month to lay the new main and services.
Peoples Gas Shops have responsibility for moving the meter and for hooking it up to the newly
built service. The shops set appointments for this process differently. The North and Central Shops
prefer to set appointments directly. For instance, a crew moving into a neighborhood, contacts
customers by going door-to-door. District supervisors will also make calls to customers after-hours
and on weekends. Posters, flyers, and other leave-behind materials refer customers to Shop phone
numbers or personal cell phone numbers to schedule appointments.
The South Shop prefers that Peoples Gas Contact Center schedule customer appointments, using
standard letters sent to customers listing the Contact Center’s toll-free number.
b. Customer Complaints
Peoples Gas received more than 4,000 complaints related to the program from 2012 through last
fall. The Company reports that the number now surpasses 5,000. Property damage and restoration
top the list of AMRP customer complaints, as seen in the table below.

As of October 31, 2014, more than 600 complaints remained “in progress” while another 400

since dropped to 200. Last October, the total number of active complaints was 1,036. The
Company reports that this number has dropped to 870.
For a variety of reasons, construction-related customer complaints have soared. Peoples Gas
created a group to respond initially to customer complaints. Company policy calls for contact with
customers within 24 to 48 hours of complaint receipt. Insufficient staffing and a growing volume
of complaints, however, have prevented this group from acknowledging or “opening” complaints
from customers for six to eight weeks.
Peoples Gas does not conduct root cause analysis to identify and resolve process-related
complaints. Lack of root cause analysis and follow-up results in many repeat issues and continuing
customer complaints. In addition, the AMRP Project Management Office does not use complaint
trending to rank or penalize contractors. Peoples Gas prepares no contractor performance
scorecards.
Peoples Gas does not ask for customer feedback or measure customer satisfaction in response to
work performed. As a result, much of the AMRP customer communications operate reactively, in
response to complaints from stakeholders or issues encountered in the field.

3. Conclusions
U.1

Peoples Gas failed to update its draft AMRP Customer Communications Plan until
recently and the Company has not monitored use of its Plan protocols and procedures
in the field. (Recommendation U.1)

Peoples Gas updated its 2011 draft AMRP Customer Communications Plan in December 2014.
However, the revised AMRP Communications Plan fails to address several items, including:
 Protocols and strategies for dealing with uncooperative customers
 Process to update customer needs and expectations as the project progresses
 Process to gather customer feedback and measure customer satisfaction.
The Company did not finalize the plan prior to program launch. It has also not updated it to reflect
changes to the communications process or materials in the intervening three years. Considering
the risks to Company image and customer satisfaction, Peoples Gas should review and update this
program-specific communications plan annually to address customer notification and public
communication in regards to meter access and cut over, including templates and prepared
communications addressing these needs. The Company has stated that an update is now underway.
U.2

AMRP communications techniques have been inconsistent. (Recommendation U.2)

Peoples Gas requests appointments for service mark-outs through a standard letter process, and
the Contact Center schedules them. However, each Shop individually handles requests to schedule
appointments to move meters. This approach may prove easier for the Shops to manage. It can,
however, cause confusion for customers, who set the first appointment through the Contact Center.
A month or so later Shop personnel go door-to-door to set appointments with customers. In some
cases, no letter or other communication informs customers about the process from end-to-end.
This approach causes problems in addition to inconsistency in the customer experience. Customers
may not be home, or unwilling to answer the door. Door-to-door delivery of brochures involves
May 5, 2015

Chapter U: Customer Coordination

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

significant costs. The Peoples Gas field employees going door-to-door also do not have the
customer-service “soft skills” training necessary for making such contacts effective.
The Shops record appointments on handwritten lists. The Shops do not document appointments
appropriately in the Peoples Gas customer information system (known as “Cfirst”). The Contact
Center therefore has no record of these appointments. Customer Service Representatives thus do
not have the information that enables them effectively to answer questions or reschedule
appointments.
U.3

Peoples Gas’ communications processes for setting service marking appointments
have become more appropriately coordinated as AMRP work has progressed.

Peoples Gas initially planned to make communications with customers 90 days prior to contractor
construction. However, the Company soon fell behind schedule marking services, in major part
due to lack of well-coordinated customer communications. Difficulties in scheduling customer
appointments left many services unmarked as contractor crews moved into an area. This
circumstance caused service installation delays. Peoples Gas realized that it needed another
approach to communicate with customers to arrange service markings.
During the second year of AMRP work, the Company decided to mark services in the fall and
winter, well prior to spring construction. This blanket approach proved successful in marking
services. However, markings got too far ahead of construction, and in some cases the markings
were lost or destroyed requiring re-marking and causing delays.
The following year brought a more coordinated approach to service marking. This approach
employed a series of four letters, sequenced to begin a month prior to construction. The first letter
introduced the program, asked for cooperation in accessing the meter, and attempted to set
expectations for project timing and ultimately, restoration. Subsequent letters asked customers to
set appointments, and, for unresponsive customers, warned of pending service disconnection.
The use of this approach continues, and appears to work better for customers and contractors.
U.4

The Customer Service organization adequately supports the AMRP meter access
appointment setting process, but the customer information system does not facilitate
the process from end-to-end. (Recommendation U.3)

An external vendor, iQOR, has provided call center services for Peoples Gas since 2011. The
Integrys Business Support Customer Service organization provides for training, handling escalated
issues, and monitoring Call Center quality and performance. Customer service representatives
receive AMRP-specific training to support inquiries, enable appointment setting, and handle
complaints. Customers can schedule appointments for service markings or meter moves by calling
a toll-free number that reaches the Contact Center. Representatives undergo training to ask for any
special access instructions, inform customers of the process, and update the customer record as
needed with owner information. After-hours, the Company’s telephone system (“IVR”) can assist
callers in setting appointments and can take messages regarding the program. The website assists
with AMRP communications, providing program brochures, frequently asked questions, and
scheduling appointments.

Peoples Gas uses its customer information system (linked to a geographic information system) to
identify accounts within a neighborhood scheduled for AMRP work. The system selects customers
for a series of letters explaining the program and asking for assistance in moving the meter. The
customer information system also records the sending of these letters to customers. However,
Peoples Gas has not integrated the customer information system with its field work management
system. Field management thus implemented a standalone database to track letters to customers,
manage appointment availability, confirm appointments, and track “in service” status after service
activation by a Peoples Gas crew. However, the Customer Service organization and the Contact
Center do not have access to this field database. The corporate information systems organization
does not manage or support the work management database.
Integrys plans to replace Cfirst (the customer information system) within the next two years, as
part of an initiative (called “the Integrys Customer Experience,” or “ICE”), to provide a common
billing system for all operating companies.
U.5

Peoples Gas has not consistently scheduled off-hour appointments for customers
unavailable during normal business hours. (Recommendation U.2)

The Company recently limited the availability of after-hours appointments to move meters. The
letter requesting a customer appointment offers hours from Monday through Friday, between 8 am
to 7:30 pm. It also offered Saturday appointments from 8 am to 3:30 pm. However, from August
through October 2014, Peoples Gas Shops were not permitting the scheduling of Saturday
appointments. This restriction frustrated many customers, and increased complaints and special
handling requests.
U.6

Peoples Gas’ AMRP complaint handling group is overwhelmed by the volume of
complaints. (Recommendation U.4)

Peoples Gas established the Construction Complaints group (reporting to the Division Street Radio
Room in Gas Operations) in 2012 to coordinate complaint resolution. Currently, this group has
insufficient staff to handle the volume of complaints received. Peoples Gas policy stipulates that
customers will be contacted within 24 to 48 hours of their complaints, in order to gather as much
information as possible about the situation. However, the Construction Complaints Team has not
met this goal.
As of October 31, 2014, 400 AMRP-related complaints remained pending. Peoples Gas received
some of them in June 2014. The Company reports that those numbers have fallen by about half
since then. The Construction Complaints group handles all construction complaints, including
those related to the AMRP. A large number experience significant delay in getting assigned for
handling. Some customers who voiced complaints in June 2014 have not yet heard from a Peoples
Gas complaint-handling representative.

A complaint may take weeks or months to resolve, depending upon its nature. As of last fall, it had
taken an average of 103 days to complete complaint processes. The Company reports that this
duration has since fallen to 81 days.
Clearly the pace of assignment and resolution is unacceptable.
U.7

Peoples Gas does not measure the AMRP customer experience. (Recommendation
U.5)

Peoples Gas routinely measures transactional customer service, both in the Contact Center and in
the field. The Company also participates in the JD Power and Associates Residential Customer
Satisfaction program. The Company does not, however, specifically track customer satisfaction
with AMRP-related work.
Peoples Gas attempted to measure satisfaction with AMRP very early in the program. It
discontinued measurement, citing difficulties due to the length of the AMRP customer experience.
Months can pass between construction and restoration. Peoples Gas is not measuring customer
satisfaction with the AMRP program.

4. Recommendations
U.1

Peoples Gas should alter the AMRP Communications Plan. (Conclusion U.1)

Peoples Gas revised its Communications Plan for AMRP in December 2014. This effort had been
underway since July 2014. While the updated Communications Plan reflects project revisions to
date, it fails to address the findings of this chapter. Specifically, the most recent Communications
Plan requires amendment to discuss:
 Protocols and strategies for dealing with uncooperative customers
 Process to update customer needs and expectations as the project progresses
 Process to gather customer feedback and measure customer satisfaction
Following Plan modification to address these concerns, Peoples Gas should communicate the Plan
throughout the organization and train contractors and employees on its use.

U.2

Chapter U: Customer Coordination

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Peoples Gas should standardize the process to set AMRP customer appointments.
(Conclusions U.2 and U.5)

Peoples Gas should standardize the appointment setting process and the Contact Center should set
all appointments to facilitate a one-stop experience for customers. The Company should use the
customer system to set and track appointments. These changes will provide a more consistent
experience for customers. Peoples Gas should also consistently offer options for after-hours and
weekend appointments to accommodate customers who need them.
U.3

Peoples Gas should ensure that the Customer Information System fully supports
AMRP communications processes. (Conclusion U.4)

Integrys plans to replace Cfirst within the next two years. Whether or not that replacement takes
place, Peoples Gas should make sure that its customer information system supports the AMRP
communications process. In addition, Peoples Gas should integrate its customer information
system with its field work management system. Sound integration will allow Peoples Gas to track
field progress and communicate that progress across the organization and to customers. This
integration will eliminate the need to maintain a standalone database in the field and improve
Customer Service responsiveness.
U.4

Peoples Gas should adequately resource the AMRP Complaints Handling Group, and
should monitor complaint resolution performance and the root causes of customer
complaints, for the purpose of identifying improvement opportunities. (Conclusion
U.6)

The Construction Complaints group has insufficient staffing, considering the current volume of
pending and active complaints. The group needs additional manpower to open and assign
complaints. The Company should contact customers within 24 to 48 hours to acknowledge receipt
of the complaint. Additionally, management should monitor complaint resolution to ensure proper
investigation of issues and effective resolution by the responsible organizations. Peoples Gas
should address this problem as soon as possible.
Peoples Gas should investigate the root cause of AMRP-related customer complaints, and
complaints from other stakeholders. These root cause analyses should drive improvement in
policy, procedure, protocol, and communication.
U.5

Peoples Gas should measure on a regular basis: (a) customer satisfaction with AMRP,
and (b) the effectiveness of AMRP Communications and Customer Service.
(Conclusion U.7)

Peoples Gas should begin measuring customer satisfaction with the AMRP process. An AMRP
project can extend over weeks and months. Peoples Gas should measure satisfaction for individual
components of the process, such as customer letters, program information, website, appointment
setting, service marking, service installation, meter installation, and restoration.
Peoples Gas should measure and track satisfaction with program components to identify
opportunities to improve the customer experience and internal policies and procedures.

In order to measure the effectiveness of AMRP Communications and Customer Service, Peoples
Gas needs to identify and routinely chart performance against specific metrics. These metrics
should include, but not be limited to, customer satisfaction, complaints per customer, missed or
late appointments (by Peoples Gas), average time to respond to inquiries and complaints, and time
to resolve complaints. Performance should be trended and reported along with other Project
Management Office metrics on a weekly or monthly basis throughout the life of the program.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter V: Monitoring

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

Chapter V: Monitoring
1. Background
Liberty’s work scope includes development of a method to allow the Illinois Commerce
Commission to monitor AMRP program costs and progress. Peoples Gas issues a monthly AMRP
Status Report of about 50 pages. The Company does not provide this report to the Illinois
Commerce Commission. The Company also produces weekly production curves. Peoples Gas also
submits monthly and annual filings reporting on the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Surcharge.
The first annual filing came in April 2014. These reports do not provide (nor does their intent
include) material suitable to meet Illinois Commerce Commission cost and schedule monitoring.
Two forms of regulatory monitoring involving the AMRP bear discussion, given the nature of
Liberty’s conclusions and recommendations about reporting performed for purposes of AMRP
management, control, and oversight.
 Implementation Monitoring: The Commission anticipates a two-year program of
monitoring of actions by the Company to implement the recommendations of this report.
 Program Performance Monitoring: The size, importance, and length of the AMRP makes
the transparency of central program measures important to the Commission and to public
stakeholders. The current status, forecasts, and threats facing program costs, schedule, and
degree of safety risk mitigation form the most important of these elements.
Implementation Monitoring will rely on outside consultant services. Program Performance
Monitoring does not fall within the scope of those outside services. The need for performing this
second form of monitoring merits attention to the question of the availability of Commission Staff
resources. This report addresses the significant cost, schedule, and risk mitigation uncertainties
that face the AMRP. This report also addresses the broad and deep set of changes that Peoples Gas
needs to make to provide sufficient management, control, and oversight of the program. Some of
the key changes will likely take most or all of the two-year recommendation monitoring period.
Following full implementation, the program will still face substantial risk. While the
recommendations of this report to be fully implemented, those risks will remain even higher, thus
underscoring the importance of Program Performance Monitoring and the need for identifying
methods to give Commission Staff the ability to perform it.
This report chapter focuses on the development of a process for Program Performance Monitoring.
The reasonably straightforward process for designing Implementation Monitoring will occur (and
monitoring will begin under it) following acceptance of this report. Designing the second form
faces unusual difficulty. A significant number of this report’s conclusions and recommendations
about AMRP management, control, and oversight address program and project performance data
collection and reporting. Moreover, changes in underlying program elements (e.g., cost estimating
and scheduling) must also occur to enable reporting scope and quality to reach the desired levels.
Were it not for the need for such improvements, the process of designing Program Performance
Monitoring for execution by the Illinois Commerce Commission would also prove more
straightforward. Current AMRP reporting by Peoples Gas, however, makes its reporting (and
therefore monitoring by the Commission) problematic. Only after such reporting improves

substantially will answers to cost, schedule, and risk mitigation questions provide meaningful
insights into AMRP status, progress, and what the prospects are for the longer term.
Reporting that serves regulatory monitoring needs should build from the same information and
systems that support AMRP program and project reporting. Such commonality is critical to making
Program Performance Monitoring meaningful and accurate. The nature, structure, and quality of
AMRP program and project reporting will remain “under development” for much and in some
respects probably all of the two-year Implementation Monitoring period. These aspects of
reporting will change as Peoples Gas completes implementation of this report’s relevant
recommendations, which means that the specifics of longer term Program Performance Monitoring
will likely change as well.
The combination of the AMRP’s long length, vital contribution to public safety, massive costs,
and integration with parallel programs (increasing delivery system pressure and relocating meters
to outside locations) appear likely to continue to make outside reporting and monitoring of cost,
schedule, and success in reducing safety risk important well after the end of the Implementation
Monitoring period. What form that longer term reporting will need to take should consider a
number of factors that may change in the next two years. They include stakeholder input, any
factors that a change in control of Peoples Gas may occasion, and future levels of Commission
Staff available for performing longer-term monitoring, for example. The Staff resources question
has particular importance in developing a long-term monitoring program that meets Commission
needs, but matches the resources available to execute it.

2. Program Performance Monitoring Objectives and Guidelines
Liberty considered the following objectives in the design of Program Performance Monitoring:
 Monitor deviations from the cost and schedule performance required for success of the
AMRP
 Understand the factors causing such deviations
 Assess the degree of safety risk mitigation actually achieved as a function of the resources
expended to produce that level of mitigation
 Measure the changes in operating costs (and benefits) achieved through execution of the
AMRP and the other programs managed in conjunction with it
 Obtain information from Peoples Gas management on the actions being taken to correct
deviations from expectations
 Establish mechanisms for monitoring management’s effectiveness in the overall execution
of the program.
Designing a performance monitoring program for the Illinois Commerce Commission must take
into account that at this time Peoples Gas’ AMRP reporting and management will not support the
Commission’s ability to accomplish even moderately detailed monitoring. However, if Peoples
Gas aggressively and successfully executes the initiatives it has stated to Liberty, these
circumstances will improve. The important needs that Peoples Gas must fill, for purposes relevant
to Program Performance Monitoring include:
 A credible AMRP plan from which to measure

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

A program management organization having the capability for insightful analysis of project
performance
Management processes for formally responding to project issues as or before they become
“problems.”

Judging or designing a report requires particular attention to its purpose. The effectiveness of
management and of AMRP oversight raise the matter of primary interest here. This focus suggests
two types of reports: those whose purpose seeks to facilitate management or oversight of the
program, and those that exist simply to keep people informed.
A report’s design intent should align with its users’ expectations and intended use. The first
challenge thus becomes what the Illinois Commerce Commission should logically expect from
Peoples Gas reporting and, more importantly, what it seeks to do with the information. The
temptation to start with a list of performance indicators may produce a wrong focus. Indicators
often have questionable value, for a variety of reasons. Take as an example the bulk performance
of AMRP in 2014. At mid-year, bulk performance on main and service installations fell well
behind schedule. A literal interpretation of the curves would suggest no way to make up the gap.
Peoples Gas reported that production would catch up, and reach planned levels by the end of the
year. However, if this observation had validity, it would also call into question the value the
performance indicator had in the first place. Such an indicator can only become accurate after the
365th day of the year. Liberty cautions against over-reliance on performance indicators,
emphasizing instead the role of performance insights. Insights go beyond the data to supporting
analysis of precisely what is happening and why.
One should not anticipate a fixed set of reporting requirements that remains for 20 years. The
AMRP will remain fluid and dynamic. The issues it raises will change. The information priorities
of the Illinois Commerce Commission and its stakeholders (in terms of needed insights into the
program) may change as well. Monitoring mechanisms should remain flexible. The change process
needs to be continuous. Readers of the reports should revisit reporting requirements after the
issuance of each report. The quarterly reporting recommended below supports this level of
frequency in ensuring that reporting stays abreast of changing issues, priorities, and work progress.
Liberty also finds value in reasonably frequent “special analyses.” These “white papers” may
contain only a few pages. Their importance lies in providing more in-depth analysis of issues that
arise from reviewing standard reports. Peoples Gas may volunteer such an analysis, to address a
particular area of emerging interest. The Commission may request one in response to a specific
concern, or simply to gain more background in understanding a critical area. Chosen and prepared
carefully, these special analyses can become a particularly valuable report feature.
Project reports are usually lengthy. They can aggregate a mass of data, charts and graphs, text,
colors, and dashboards. Too much detail dilutes the value of important material, which can become
difficult even to locate. Accordingly, content should reach a level and focus designed to allow
outside monitoring to accomplish its objectives. The length of the report should also respect the
fact that the objectives of regulators and stakeholders should stop short of the day-to-day workings
of the program.

One needs to contain reporting to what will keep reporting effective. Monthly reports would prove
too frequent, except perhaps during the period in which efforts remain underway to redefine them
as part of the implementation of this report’s recommendations. A quarterly report certainly
becomes more optimum after what will hopefully prove a reasonably short transition period for
making the program management, control, and oversight changes warranted. Analyses performed
and corrective actions identified by Peoples Gas would come quarterly.

3. Recommended Program Performance Monitoring Process Flow
Figure V.1: Proposed ICC Monitoring Process

The process charted above requires an initial definition of outside reporting standards for Peoples
Gas. The Company will begin delivery of regular reports in response. Meeting full requirements
immediately is not likely, thus suggesting a brief trial-and-error period. The “not sufficient” path
shown in the figure illustrates how such a conclusion by the Illinois Commerce Commission report
reviewers will lead to clarified or revised instructions for Peoples Gas, with the cycle continuing
as needed to complete an initial shakedown.
The Illinois Commerce Commission can test Company responsiveness to program trends and
issues if Peoples Gas produces credible and responsive analyses (quarterly, supplemented by
special analyses as required). Such information provides a baseline for evaluating Company
identification of issues and its effectiveness in constructing plans to deal with them. The process
recommended also permits feedback, as appropriate, to Peoples Gas. The Commission may at this
point seek added information to fill gaps in the quality of the Company’s analysis. Where Peoples
Gas commits to corrective actions, monthly updates to monitor such actions should occur. During
review of the regular report, Commission readers should also consider what, if any, changes should
apply for subsequent quarterly reports. For example, for a substantial problem raised in the first

ICC14GAS0002

quarter’s report, the requirements for that topic may expand for future reports. Also at this time,
the Commission might identify the need for one or more “special analyses.”

4. Report Content
a. Program Cost
Cost reporting should begin with the use of five categories, pending development of the capability
at Peoples Gas to provide meaningful data, and subject to continuing visitation:
 Long-term programmatic costs
 Annual expenditures
 Unit production rates
 Earned value indicators
 Contractor costs and change orders.
The single most important parameter over the long term is overall program cost. “Super-projects”
tend to have the common attribute of continuing and substantial cost overruns. Given that cost
growth seems inevitable on such projects, how one prepares a reasonable estimate and, more
importantly, how one controls cost growth become material questions. Liberty’s recommended
approach consists of:
 An estimate prepared using traditional methods. This base estimate, termed “known costs,”
should result from a working model (not yet in existence for the AMRP), in order to permit
tracking and reforecasting on a continuing and meaningful basis.
 A judgment process then drives a projection of potential growth in the estimate over
program life. A variety of methods (including probabilistic estimating, growth from similar
projects, the experience of those estimating the growth, or any other means deemed feasible
for a “ball park” estimate) can drive this projection. Its goal is not precision, which must
prove impossible under any circumstances. Rather, the intent is to gauge approximate
upside potential. Application of this growth potential establishes a more reasonable
baseline, and communicates a more meaningful perception to the Commission and other
stakeholders.
 The difference between the two estimates can be characterized as a “reserve” or a
“contingency.”
 The “known costs” form the control base for the day-to-day management of the project.
Near-term budgets and plans must all align with this estimate. This estimate forms the
baseline for managing costs and it serves as the measurement basis for reporting deviations.
 On a real-time basis, as new information becomes available, the model drives re-forecasts
of the various cost elements. Independently, the issuance of a cost-trend alert
communicates that the baseline estimate of known costs may be in motion. Such alerts
should issue as soon as possible, even in the absence of compelling data, in order to permit
prompt execution of any warranted management response. In any event, the real-time
model begins to reflect a changing perception of “known costs.” Periodically, once per
quarter for purposes of the monitoring at issue here, the Company would provide a snapshot
of the model. The resulting graphic might look like the next figure, which uses hypothetical
numbers.

Figure V.2: Cost Forecast “Snapshot”

The rate of reserve erosion becomes the chief focus. The next table shows a way to depict that
erosion. One should tend to exercise conservatism at the start, in order to preserve contingency for
as long as possible. This approach also recognizes the likelihood that growth becomes more likely
at the back end than the front (making the saving of reserves appropriate). Others prefer a straightline target. The key information lets the reader see the degree to which the control base has been
violated and the long-term forecast faces threat.
Figure V.3: Erosion of Reserve

Twenty years identifies a theoretically applicable dimension for the AMRP. Such a long time
frame, however, weakens the usefulness of the analysis. An alternate time frame in place of or in
addition to a 20-year outlook makes sense. For example, cutting off the 20-year charts at 5 years
would make the data more credible.
Actual expenditures offer a second and more popular cost indicator, but do not necessarily have
value in their own right. This indicator offers more benefit as: (a) a sanity check on the total cost
forecast, and (b) a near-term schedule indicator. In the former instance, focus should lie on the
degree to which funds expenditure conform to the cost plan. A mismatch can call the forecast into
question. The data tells whether resource “burn” occurs at rates demanded by schedule.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter V: Monitoring

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The current annual expenditure curve that Peoples Gas reports show should suffice, if
accompanied by analysis. Reports should contain planned expenditures, actual expenditures, and
forecasted year-end expenditures. To the extent that deviations emerge, they require analysis at an
appropriate level.
Unit rates, or productivity, comprise a third key family of cost data. The cost per unit for mains,
services, and meters, for example, deserves continuing attention. Such data will offer an early
warning signal of growth in the long-term forecast. Peoples Gas should provide summary data and
insightful analysis on planned and actual productivity for the current year and for the program to
date. Such analysis should include schedule considerations as well. For example, an observed lag
in productivity calls for an analysis of impact on schedule and steps to mitigate delays.
Earned value presents another productivity topic of interest. For example, completing 10 units of
production “earns” the number of hours corresponding to the budget for that work. Comparing
actual hours spent with hours earned provides a good indicator of productivity, or effectiveness.
Sophisticated management systems can collect this data at very detailed (low) levels, and
aggregate it at increasingly summarized levels to provide management with valuable measures of
performance. A project the size of the AMRP calls for the use of sophisticated management tools.
Peoples Gas does not employ them now.
Contractor costs comprise a fifth important cost area. Contracting much of the work on a fixed
price or unit price basis can lead to the erroneous belief that such costs have less variability, and
become the contractor’s problem to manage. Contractor costs can vary in a number of significant
ways; e.g., (a) bid prices out of line with assumptions in the project estimate, and (b) contract
changes in excess of those anticipated and allowed for in the estimate. Neither of these two
exposures has visibility at this time. Change orders and their near- and long-term impacts on total
program costs warrant attention. Peoples Gas should provide data and insightful analysis of the
following:
 Weighted average ratio of final contract price to initial award value for completed contracts
 Number and dollar amount of change orders requested this year
 Number and dollar amount of change orders approved this year.
b. Program Schedule
Liberty recommends starting with four schedule categories:
 Bulk production curves
 Long-term schedule projection (retirement curve or similar)
 Resource plans
 Simplified and clarified program quantity tables.
Bulk production curves form the staple for near-term schedule analysis. The reporting of such
curves should continue, but not in the detail now offered in AMRP reports. Three annual S-curves
(mains, services, and meters) should suffice. Each chart should include plan, actual, and a yearend forecast. Should significant deviations appear, as happened throughout 2014, reporting should
contain analysis of them. That analysis should, in a clear way, communicate at least:

The reasons for significant deviations at a root cause and responsible organization level
A plan for recovery, including responsible parties, specific commitments regarding
resources and dates, and how the Company will manage and enforce those recovery plans
Any longer-term impacts to the overall program cost forecast and schedule.

From a long-term schedule perspective, the Illinois Commerce Commission should have special
interest in the progress towards replacement of all leak-prone pipe, which comprises the
fundamental 20-year objective. There exists here a parallel with the treatment of costs described
earlier. Reserves or contingencies generally do not find their way into schedule analysis to the
same extent as costs. That lack presents problems for Commission oversight. If costs grow
materially, schedule impacts become more likely. The relationship between cost and schedule
growth should remain an important point of observation, and subject to periodic analysis.
Peoples Gas offered a version of the long-term schedule measure, but it does not bear scrutiny.
The Company offers a plot of “AMRP Program Retirement” in the monthly report. Contrary to
other schedule indicators, this metric shows the program on target. Management has not updated
the chart in two years. Yet its presentation continues in this frozen state. Continued use of a chart
showing this information makes sense, provided that it undergoes continuing update.
From a schedule management perspective, the size of the workforce, often reflected in a “force
report,” presents a key item of concern. Peoples Gas reports the workforce in terms of “number of
monthly full-time equivalent jobs created.” This metric does not bear on work performance.
Management does not relate the size of the workforce to the plan in any way. The lack of any
correlation precludes judgment about whether the reported figures support schedule, or show
consistency with the cost estimate.
Resources have special value as a leading indicator. Deviations can predict schedule breakdowns
well in advance. A credible resource plan needs to exist, along with transparency when actual
staffing does not support that plan. Ordinarily, a plot of manpower on a planned, actual, and
forecasted basis would suffice. Here, however, recent performance suggests problems with the
resource categories of contractors, Peoples Gas construction, and Peoples Gas engineering.
A number of the current monthly report’s charts have continuing usefulness. That determination,
however, requires greater clarity in their definitions, sourcing, and accuracy. At the present time,
the data is contradictory and confusing. Further, the widespread use of “program years” presents
a confusing distinction without apparent meaning. Peoples Gas should discontinue it.
c. Safety and Quality
Two other areas, safety and quality, also warrant discussion in the context of Commission
monitoring. Public and employee safety should form a part of the monitoring mechanism. Public
safety comprises the reason for the program in the first place. Safety also serves as a project
management indicator.
Safety usually (but not always) produces consensus more readily among utilities, labor, and
regulators. Accordingly, one would expect easier development of a mutually agreeable monitoring
program for this subject. The safety information reported in Peoples Gas monthly report, as all
May 5, 2015

The Liberty Consulting Group

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter V: Monitoring

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

other topics, lacks analysis. The charts and tables do not send apparent or actionable messages. A
simple paragraph of analysis could easily replace most of the data with considerable value added.
AMRP reporting does not address public safety. Determining meaningful measures of public
safety in the utility business is not easy and this topic is open to discussion with the Company. In
any event, this topic deserves monitoring to assure it remains high on the Company’s priority list.
Liberty recommended cooperative work with the Company (which Implementation Monitoring
will provide an avenue for performing) to identify methods for relating work and dollars spent to
reduction in public safety risk, and to ensure that leak reduction data gets reported accurately and
in ways that relate to meaningful safety metrics.
Meaningful high-level measures of quality are not plentiful. Peoples Gas focuses on the number
of non-conformance reports (“NCRs”). This is appropriate, but the data provided currently is
inadequate. For Illinois Commerce Commission monitoring purposes, and for analysis purposes,
Peoples Gas should modify the data as follows:
 Provide trend information that places the data in context. At present, one cannot judge
whether the numbers represent good or bad performance, or improving or deteriorating
performance.
 Normalize the data to a work measure (for example, pipe installed in the period, personhours expended, dollars expended), in order to account for work level variations.
 Discuss non-conformances having a significant safety, cost, or schedule impact.
 Include in the analyses, as applicable, examination of patterns or groupings of nonconformances.
Outside reporting should also address the degree to which gas main and service replacements
succeed in meeting risk reduction goals and metrics. Such information should play a central role
in verifying that work focuses on the facilities producing greatest risk. Reporting should also
consider operating cost changes, as part of ongoing review of the economic costs and benefits that
AMRP and related work are producing.

5. Recommendations
V.1

Peoples Gas should work promptly to identify the AMRP reporting changes that it
proposes to implement near term, and tailor them to meet the reporting cycles and
content this chapter describes as appropriate for supporting the monitoring needs of
the Illinois Commerce Commission.

The Company’s stated intent to revise AMRP reporting substantially makes it efficient to finalize
external reporting requirements concurrently with Peoples Gas changes to AMRP reporting.
Common timing can make effective use of the very early stages of the two-year monitoring
program to verify that reporting improvement has occurred, and to coordinate the data sources and
timing of AMRP reports with those that will serve external reporting needs.
The Illinois Commerce Commission has already established a two-year monitoring program
intended to examine implementation by Peoples Gas of the recommendations contained in this
report. This report makes many recommendations that seek important changes in AMRP (and
related program) data collection, reporting, and analysis of cost, schedule, and leak-risk mitigation.

Phase One Final Report

Chapter V: Monitoring

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The pendency of the changes recommended means that Peoples Gas will likely continue making
changes to report structure and content through much of that two-year period. The dilemma this
transition period imposes arises from the fact that the Illinois Commerce Commission and
stakeholders have current needs for assessing AMRP status. This report, for example highlights
the great uncertainty that now exists with respect to the AMRP’s three principal drivers: (a) the
total duration likely required for removing all high-risk pipe from the system, (b) how much that
elimination will end up costing customers, and (c) the degree to which replacements under current
prioritization and planning methods have succeeded and will succeed in reducing the leaks that
create substantial safety risks.
Therefore, even though reporting changes will likely continue for some time, working promptly to
create at least an interim structure, content, and cycle has substantial importance. Peoples Gas
needs immediately to address management reporting changes, to make reporting to the Illinois
Commerce Commission and stakeholders meaningful now, rather than far down the road. The
AMRP’s schedule, cost, and risk mitigation uncertainties require meaningful public reporting to
commence as soon as possible.
At the same time, one must recognize that the effectiveness of Program Performance Monitoring
will depend significantly on consistency of information used for both internal and external reports,
and on reasonably concurrent report timing and data vintage. Thus, the at least interim Illinois
Commerce Commission reporting system that needs to begin immediately, must incorporate the
ability to grow more robust as Peoples Gas continues to address the management reporting needs
that Liberty’s report recommends.
To that end, an appendix to this report chapter provides a set of guidelines and reporting templates
recommended for use in designing AMRP reports. Peoples Gas should immediately begin
development of a Commission reporting structure and content in accord with the guidelines and
reporting templates provided. First steps in the two-year monitoring program should include a
work session with the Company to ensure full understanding of reporting cycle, structure, and
content, and to expedite the creation of a report that the Company can begin providing as soon as
possible.
Other factors subject to present uncertainty also have consequence for the design of Program
Performance Monitoring. First, Peoples Gas may (or may not) soon have a new owner. Substantive
and reporting conditions often accompany regulatory approval of changes of control. Second,
stakeholders have expressed significant interest in the AMRP. To the extent that stakeholders raise
reporting, monitoring, or transparency issues about the program, it appears logical to consider their
views in designing a long-term outside monitoring and reporting program.
In any event, a Program Performance Monitoring program needs to match four key elements:

Chapter V Appendix: Program Performance Monitoring Guidelines
The Accelerated Main Replacement Program (“AMRP”) of Peoples Gas has very high public
safety priority. The Company must implement the program timely, cost effectively, and in a
manner that reduces the safety risks of leak-prone pipe with dispatch. Accordingly, the Illinois
Commerce Commission requires continuing information on a regular basis about the costs of the
program, the schedule under which the replacements occur, and the risk reduction results that the
program seeks designed to achieve. These guidelines and accompanying templates outline the
Illinois Commerce Commission’s requirements for periodic reporting by Peoples Gas on the
progress and performance of the AMRP.
The recommendations that Liberty has made to improve AMRP management, control, and
oversight call for a series of changes addressing AMRP reporting for use by program management
and by senior executive and board of director oversight. Making those changes will take time. This
document generally describes long-term Illinois Commerce Commission Program Performance
Monitoring needs. On an interim basis, Peoples Gas may not prove able to support each reporting
item or template provided below. The Company needs to find ways to the meet reporting needs
identified in this document as best it can on an interim basis. It must also act expeditiously to
establish a sound, accurate, long-term basis for meeting those needs.
General Direction
The requirements presented below represent today’s program priorities and challenges. They will
no doubt change as the project moves forward. Completing the AMRP involves massive effort to
address issues and challenges over a long time. Circumstances are likely to prove fluid over so
long a period. Surprises prove common on “super-projects” or pogroms like the AMRP. The
Illinois Commerce Commission needs flexibility in redefining its needs as time passes and as
performance trends emerge. Peoples Gas will need to remain responsive as the Commission’s)
needs evolve.
The Company manages replacement work in common with work to increase system pressure and
to relocate meters from inside to outside locations. The reporting addressed in this document needs
to cover the AMRP alone. Peoples Gas must disaggregate information to exclude information
addressing these other sources of work and expenditure, which the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant
Surcharge now addresses.
This document defines specific data requirements, but does not invite a simple presentation of that
data. Reporting must also include:
 Insightful analysis of the data with an eye to identifying issues of performance and
opportunities for improvement. Peoples Gas should have or obtain the skills necessary to
perform such analyses in support of its AMRP management needs. The required analysis
require a level of explanation sufficient to inform the Illinois Commerce Commission of
threats to the overall project costs and schedule, the risks and challenges that emerge, and
deviations from expected performance.

To the extent that regular reports identify problems, opportunities, and issues, Peoples Gas
must define their impacts, including magnitude of potential resulting cost increases or
schedule delays.
Most importantly, Peoples Gas must discuss options considered or implemented for
mitigation of such deviations. Reporting must include action plans identifying responsible
people, required deliverables, scheduled due dates, and post-implementation conditions
expected. Such plans require enough detail to enable objective assessment of their
implementation. Where plans require additional resources or commitments, Peoples Gas
must describe and quantify them.
Progress against corrective action plans shall be reported in subsequent monthly reports.

The Plan
Before constructing monthly reporting requirements, a program framework with performance
requirements must exist. This framework needs to address a plan for the year and for the total
AMRP. Peoples Gas must provide, by June 1, 2015 for the initial report and by January 1 for
subsequent years, the following information:

Category Level Support Data
1. Cost - Expenditures
The “AMRP Expenditures” line should be supported by similar data broken down by major cost
elements. The AMRP estimating process should identify and structure the applicable cost
elements. Liberty would anticipate perhaps 8-15 elements, each of which should have a plan for
management of the associated costs. Each plan should be consistent with the magnitude, risk, and
controllability of the subject costs. The same six columns from the summary level table should
apply, with the total of all cost elements equaling the entries on the summary level table.
2. Cost – AMRP Forecast
Considerable uncertainty surrounds final AMRP cost. With billions of dollars at stake, it becomes
essential to track that bottom line cost and to manage it as far as practicable. Liberty has proposed
a method, which absent a present alternative from the Company, should apply to regular reports.
The approach begins with a traditionally prepared estimate, except for treating amounts for
allowances for unforeseen events or contingencies as minimal. The resulting estimate becomes
“known costs” or “the base estimate.” Peoples Gas then needs to apply best efforts to estimate
likely growth in the known costs. The assignment of a projected final cost amount should follow
rational analysis by Peoples Gas managers, including consideration of growth so far, risk analysis
of exposure areas, experience on other large, long-term projects, and other factors and projections
by knowledgeable analysts. Such a final estimate will not necessarily produce a high confidence
level, but will prove suitable for its intended purpose here. That purpose is to establish of a target
against which to track and report future costs.

 Peoples Gas AMRP Investigation
Phase One Final Report

Chapter V: Appendix

Illinois Commerce Commission
ICC14GAS0002

The difference between known costs and the final projection bears the term “management
reserves.” As the program progresses and new costs become identified, known, are identified, the
known costs increase and the remaining reserves decrease, as the accompanying chart illustrates.
Peoples Gas should monitor the erosion of reserves with the intent of determining when and by
how much projected cost should change. Should new known costs become identified at too rapid
a pace (causing reserve erosion at too fast a pace), it will eventually become clear that holding to
the final forecast has become unwise. At that point, Peoples Gas would need to prepare a new
estimate of known costs and a new projection for final costs.
This type of cost reporting approach can tend to break down over long periods. Accordingly,
Peoples Gas may wish to present an erosion chart using a shorter timeframe, such as five years.
Such an alternative will work. The focus, however, must remain on total program cost, and the
Company must present any shorter term conclusions presented in terms of their ultimate effect on
total AMRP costs.
3. Production
Peoples Gas must support annual summary level production data with S-curves, similar to those
in use in its present monthly report. The S-curves should cover the same line items as the summary
level report. They should plot the plan for the year, actuals to date, and the forecast for the
remainder of the year.
All performance data (cost, production, and resources) requires integration and consistency. For
example, to the extent production lags schedule, Peoples Gas might present an accelerated forecast.

Chapter V: Appendix

In such a case, the Company should also present the corresponding impacts (such as more
resources and higher costs) in the other performance categories reported.
4. Resources
S-curves or bar charts will prove appropriate for displaying resource data. Peoples Gas has not
been collecting contractor resource data but Liberty understands that it will do so beginning in
2015.
5. Contracts
For all active, or recently completed, contracts, Peoples Gas should provide the following data:
