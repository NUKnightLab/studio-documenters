ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
An Ordinance providing for voter input with regards to any future Cook
County tax increases which exceed the rate of inflation or consumer price
index (CPI) adjustments.
WHEREAS, The County of Cook is a Home Rule unit and may, under the power granted by Section 6(a)
of Article VII of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, exercise any power and perform any
function pertaining to its government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax and to
incur debt; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board has recently voted to impose a $500 million tax increase upon the
residents of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the amount of this tax increase is equal to roughly twice the amount of the actual county
deficit; and
WHEREAS, this tax increase will result in Cook County having a sales tax of more than 10%, which will
result in many residents fleeing to other counties to make purchases; and
WHEREAS, the decision of whether to increase taxes by such a dramatic amount should be made by the
voters of Cook County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the President and Board of Commissioners of the
County of Cook, Illinois, as follows:
ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS
(a)

Ballot issue means a non-recall petition or referred measure in an election.

(b)

both, those for refunds made in the current or next fiscal year or those from gifts, federal funds,
collections for another government, pension contributions by employees and pension fund earnings,
reserve transfers or expenditures, damage awards, or property sales.
(d)
Inflation means the percentage change in the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics
Consumer Price Index for Cook County, all items, all urban consumers, or its successor index.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
ARTICLE II. SPENDING LIMITS
(a)

inflation in the prior calendar year plus annual local growth, adjusted for revenue changes approved by

(b)
The maximum annual percentage change in the county’s property tax revenue equals
inflation in the prior calendar year plus annual local growth, adjusted for property tax revenue changes
approved by voters.

If revenue from sources not excluded from fiscal year spending exceeds these limits in
dollars for that fiscal year, the excess shall be refunded in the next fiscal year unless voters approve a
revenue change as an offset. Initial bases are current fiscal year spending and property tax collected in
that year. Qualification or disqualification as an enterprise shall change bases and future year limits.
Future creation of bonded debt shall increase, and retiring or refinancing county bonded debt shall lower,
fiscal year spending and property tax revenue by the annual debt service so funded. Debt service changes,

not part of, any county base. Voter-approved revenue changes do not require a tax rate change.

of its fiscal year spending excluding bonded debt service. Unused reserves apply to the next year’s
reserve.
(b)

written comments filed with the Cook County Clerk by 45 days before the
election. No summary shall mention names of persons or private groups, nor any
endorsements of or resolutions against the proposal. Petition representatives
following these rules shall write this summary for their petition. The county clerk
officer shall maintain and accurately summarize all other relevant written
comments.

(d)
Except by later voter approval, if a tax increase or fiscal year spending exceeds any
estimate in (b) (iii) for the same fiscal year, the tax increase is thereafter reduced up to 100% in
proportion to the combined dollar excess, and the combined excess revenue refunded in the next fiscal
year. County bonded debt shall not issue on terms that could exceed its share of its maximum repayment
costs in (b) (iv). Ballot titles for tax or bonded debt increases shall begin, “SHALL COOK COUNTY
TAXES BE INCREASED (first, or if phased in, final, full fiscal year dollar increase)
ANNUALLY...?” or “SHALL COOK COUNTY DEBT BE INCREASED (principal amount),
WITH A REPAYMENT COST OF (maximum total county cost), ...?”

WHEREAS, Mena Boulanger and her family have resided in Cook County since 1973; and
WHEREAS, for many years, Mena and her husband John spent practically every weekend hiking,
picnicking and exploring the landscape in various Forest Preserve District sites in the western suburbs;
and
WHEREAS, when he was in high school in the early 1980s, Mena’s son John joined the Wolf Road
Prairie volunteers, and through his efforts, the group’s leaders were introduced to the Illinois Senate
President who then guided the successful efforts to secure additional government funding for land
acquisition; and
WHEREAS, for the last eighteen years, Mena has worked tirelessly with the leadership of the Chicago
Zoological Society to further the Society’s relationship with the Forest Preserve District and bring greater
public awareness to the importance of the District and the conservation work throughout its 76,000 acres;
and
WHEREAS, Mena’s most significant long-term accomplishment during this time was the decade-long
effort to secure additional bonding authority for the Forest Preserve District to address its capital
maintenance needs as well as the needs of the Chicago Zoological Society for Brookfield Zoo and the
Chicago Horticultural Society for the Chicago Botanic Garden; and

5387

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
WHEREAS, during this time, Mena worked closely with the leadership and staff of the Forest Preserve

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Supplementary Relief Order (“SRO”) in the Shakman case mandates that the
Compliance Administrator (“CA”) study existing employment practices, policies and procedures for nonpolitical hiring, promotion, transfer, discipline and discharge; and
WHEREAS, the CA is responsible for observing the hiring process, assisting with the development of a
new hiring plan, aiding with the formulation of a new training program to educate and train supervisors
and employees on non-political hiring practices, making recommendations to the Court as to how to
handle matters involving issues related to Shakman exempt positions, monitoring compliance,
adjudicating pre-SRO violations, and filing periodic reports; and

5388

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
WHEREAS, the data collected by Shakman compliance officer Julia Nowicki reveals evidence of
continued irregular hiring practices; and
WHEREAS, the working conditions in many departments are impacted by political considerations,
resulting in supervisors being unable or unwilling to discipline politically protected employees; and in
employees who do not have a political sponsor being forced to work outside their job title without fair
compensation; and
WHEREAS, it is crucial for Cook County to cut the waste from the budget in order to prevent future tax
increases, while enhancing the quality of services provided; and
WHEREAS, Compliance Administrator Julia Nowicki has recommended that the following thirteen
reforms be adopted in order to bring the County into compliance with the Shakman consent decree:
1) The CA recommends that the County utilize its own resources to determine the nature and extent
of current unlawful patronage practices occurring in the County at this time.
2) The CA recommends that the county designate one employee to be its liaison to the Office of the
CA. This person should be dedicated solely to the work required under the SRO. This individual
should have access to the President and his staff.
3) The CA recommends that the County select a new Human Resources Bureau Chief (“HR Bureau
Chief”) who has the experience, education and political autonomy to professionalize the Bureau
of Human Resources (“Bureau of HR”) and ensure the County’s compliance with all laws
including those prohibiting political discrimination.
4) The CA recommends that she be allowed to monitor the selection process of the HR Bureau
Chief.
5) The CA recommends that the County cooperate with the joint search committee pursuant to
ordinance formed by the Chicago Bar Association and Cook County Bar Association to select the
Independent Inspector General. The CA also recommends that the County commit to fund fully
the Office of the Independent Inspector General on an annual basis.
6) The CA recommends that the County cooperate with the CA to create and implement a new plan
incorporating the recommendations set forth in the body of this report as follows:
a. Include the CA on a committee designated to recruit and select a new HR Bureau Chief; and
b. Restructure and standardize Bureau of HR personnel processes and procedures; and
c. Conduct training of Bureau of HR staff and hiring department management on specific and
critical human resources skills; and
d. Establish a separate, independent human resources function for the Bureau of Public Health;
and
e. Apply hiring plan recommendations to transfers, promotions and reclassifications.
7) The CA recommends that the County create a document that sets out Shakman rights and
responsibilities to be publicly posted in all departments.
5389

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
8) The CA recommends that the County create a system for reporting and logging all political
contacts regarding all employees.
9) The CA recommends that Shakman-exempt individuals be identified on the County website and
the CA website by name, department and job title.
10) The CA recommends that the County should institute a targeted desk audit. This recommendation
is in light of the fact that the previously intended desk audits (as set forth in the “Resolution
Requiring and Independent Management Audit of all positions as Grades 17 through 24 including
positions exempt under the Federal Court Shakman Consent Decree”) are no longer being
undertaken by the County due to lack of funds.
11) The CA recommends that the County should hire an HR consultant with a specialty in healthcare
to assist in the creation of a new Bureau of Health HR plan.
12) The CA recommends that the County create job descriptions for all Shakman-exempt employees.
13) The CA recommends that the job descriptions of Shakman-exempt employees should be publicly
posted.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners do hereby
adopt the recommendations from the Cook County Compliance Administrator and direct the Bureau of
Human Resources to immediately begin the process of implementing the proposed changes in order to
bring the County into compliance with the Shakman Consent Decree at the soonest possible date.

RESOLUTION MAINTAINING THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP OF THE
COOK COUNTY BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES UNTIL THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
BOARD OF HEALTH DIRECTORS IS FINALIZED AND THE NATIONAL SEARCH
FOR A BUREAU CHIEF IS COMPLETE
WHEREAS, the Cook County Bureau of Health Services has been under considerable pressure both
financially and organizationally due to a myriad of factors including, but not limited to the Cook County
budget crisis and subsequent cuts, the increase in demand for county healthcare services, and cuts in
federal Medicaid/Medicare spending; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the need for reform at the Bureau and to assess the financial and organizational
restructuring necessary, President Todd H. Stroger saw fit to put together a Blue Ribbon Health
Committee to study and suggest remedies to the adversities confronting the Bureau of Health Services;
and
WHEREAS, under arduous circumstances, Dr. Robert R. Simon has dedicated his time, energy and talent
and performed admirably as the Interim Bureau Chief, overseeing the challenging task of reorganizing the
Bureau of Health Services and implementing many organizational and financial improvements; and
WHEREAS, under the leadership of the President and the Board of Commissioners, the establishment of
an Independent Board of Health Directors was approved to govern the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services; and

5391

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
WHEREAS, in order to continue the positive momentum achieved and to maintain continuity, the
current administration of the Bureau of Health Services, including the Bureau Chief, should remain in
place until such time as the new Board of Health Directors is functional and all Directors appointed and a
permanent Bureau Chief is identified and employed; and
WHEREAS, per ordinance, the newly established Board of Health Directors must conduct an
independent national search to identify a permanent Bureau Chief with the vision and capacity to develop
strategies both short and long term to continue on the path of reform of the Bureau of Health Services;
and
WHEREAS, this much needed reform was started and successfully developed under the current
leadership, returning it to the respected position the taxpayers and residents of Cook County expect and
deserve, and which must not be jeopardized; and
WHEREAS, the future success or failure of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services and the
healthcare safety-net it anchors has such far reaching ramifications, this government cannot afford to have

BUREAU OF ADMINISTRATION
PERMISSION TO ADVERTISE
Transmitting a Communication from
MARK KILGALLON, Chief Administrative Officer, Bureau of Administration
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to advertise for bids for photocopier leasing on a cost
per copy basis for 590 multi-functional photocopiers located in 25 departments throughout the County
including the entire Bureau of Health Services, various offices under the President and elected officials,
and the Forest Preserve District of Cook County. Equipment will also have network printing, faxing, and
scanning capabilities. Cost per copy pricing includes the use of the equipment, maintenance services, and

Reason:

one of three leasing contracts. The entire photocopier leasing program saves the County over
$1.1 million annually compared to purchasing new equipment and entering into maintenance
and supply contracts. The leasing contract has an estimate annual savings of $419,000.00.
The lease program also allows departments to keep up with technology to make their
operation more efficient and cost effective.

Contract period: November 3, 2008 through November 2, 2013. (490-440 Account). Requisition No.
84900005.
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 and future year funds.

an assessment and analysis of the Bureau’s revenue cycle process for inpatient and outpatient services

Transmitting a Communication, dated February 11, 2008 from
DAVID R. SMALL, F.A.C.H.E., Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the Respiratory Health
Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC), Chicago, Illinois (previously named the American Lung
Association of Metropolitan Chicago) for the Bureau of Health Services’ Smoke Free Lung Health
Programs. This is a 5-year initiative utilizing Cook County tobacco tax dollars to reduce the harmful
impacts of tobacco and asthma on the health of Cook County residents.

5475

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
Reason:

As Chicago’s lung health leader since 1906, RHAMC is a natural partner for this project.
RHAMC has been a leader in delivering tobacco cessation services to the Chicago community
and in training individuals to deliver tobacco cessation. RHAMC participates in or leads
numerous local asthma initiatives in Cook County, including: Addressing Asthma in
Englewood; Controlling Pediatric Asthma through Collaboration and Education; and the
Stakeholders Collaboration to Improve Student Health.
In Cook County, 690,000 adults smoke cigarettes, with increased smoking rates in the lowest
socio-economic neighborhoods. Research shows that cessation programs in hospitals, health
centers, and other community settings effectively reduce morbidity and mortality from
smoking. These programs are cost-effective because they reduce the burden of tobaccorelated illness upon the community and the County.
The rates of asthma and hospitalizations due to asthma in Cook County and Illinois are nearly
double national rates, especially among African-American and Puerto Rican communities.
National and local studies have shown improved childhood asthma outcomes can be achieved
through education delivered by health care organizations and trained community health
educators.
Cook County Bureau of Health Services Smoke Free Lung Health Program Outcomes Over 5
Years
•
•
•
•
•
•

10,500 tobacco cessation-counseling interventions in Cook County hospitals and 78,000
tobacco cessation counseling interventions in Cook County clinics or other community
sites.
15,000 new contacts by Cook County residents to the Illinois Quitline and subsidized
nicotine replacement therapy for 11,400 people, through the tobacco cessation media
campaign.
13,000 smoking quits reported among program participants.
Asthma self-management education to 3,260 individuals with 80% program completion
rate.
Improved self-management skills, environmental changes or avoidance of asthma triggers
and demonstrated decrease in asthma severity among program participants.
Decreased hospitalizations and emergency department visits for asthma by 50% among
program participants.

Program Implementation
The Smoke Free Lung Health Steering Committee will oversee the program. The physician
leadership team from Stroger Hospital of Cook County will direct the Steering Committee and
provide organization, supervision, technical expertise and evaluation support to the program.
The Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago (RHAMC) will employ all
program staff and assist with their training and supervision. RHAMC will conduct the media
campaign. Thirteen (13) Tobacco and Asthma Health Educator staff will be hired and trained
in phases over the first 18 months of the program. The media campaign will be conducted in
Year 1 and Year 2.

Transmitting a Communication from
DAVID R. SMALL, F.A.C.H.E., Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into contracts with the following vendors for
physical, occupational and speech therapy services. After evaluating their Request for Proposal (RFP), it
was determined, that each vendor met all of the requirements set forth in the RFP and the Minority and
Women Owned Business Enterprises. Due to continuing shortages in rehabilitative services, it is
necessary to contract with multiple commercial agencies in order to meet the volume and diversity of
therapy needs within the Bureau of Health Services.
Reason:

Physical Therapy, Occupational and Speech Therapy positions are very difficult to fill due to
an overall market shortage of these professionals. In addition to the rising shortage of
therapists in these professions, there has been a dramatic increase in salaries over the past
several years, with which the County has not kept pace. In a very competitive market, our
salaries are not competitive for new graduates and much less so for experienced positions. As
a result we have had to decreased outpatient services or increase use of contracted therapy
staff. To maintain a high level of patient services, we are recommending the award to the
following vendors.

Transmitting a Communication from
DAVID R. SMALL, F.A.C.H.E., Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $50,000.00 and extend for two (2)
months, Contact No. 06-54-423 Rebid with Language Line Services, Inc., Monterey, California, for
telephonic interpreting services for Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and Stroger Hospital of Cook
County.
Board approved amount 03-01-07:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$107,100.00
50,000.00
$157,100.00

The extension is necessary because there was only one (1) bid response to the original bid
opening date of February 7, 2008. The increase for Stroger Hospital of Cook County is
necessary due to unanticipated vacated positions and family medical leave. This request will
allow sufficient time for the rebid, award and implementation of the new consolidated bureauwide contract for which bids are scheduled to be opened on March 20, 2008. Approximately
$10,000.00 remains on this contract for Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County. The expiration
date of the current contract is March 19, 2008.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $50,000.00. Contract extension: March 20, 2008 through May 19, 2008. (897268 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.

Transmitting a Communication, dated February 7, 2008 from
DAVID R. SMALL, F.A.C.H.E., Chief Operating Officer, Bureau of Health Services
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to amend, increase by $350,000.00 and extend for
twelve (12) months, Contract No. 07-45-307 with Health Management Associates (HMA), Chicago,
Illinois, for consulting services and strategic counsel to the Bureau of Health Services (BHS).
Board approved amount 03-20-07:
Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:

$275,000.00
350,000.00
$625,000.00

5480

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
Reason:

The amendment and justification for the increase is to expand the scope of services with
Health Management Associates (HMA), a highly skilled firm to provide, under the direction
of the BHS, expert analytical and research services to develop long-term government
financing models for patient care rendered by the Bureau, as well as necessary resource
support in the preparation of required Medicare and Medicaid cost reporting.
While this current contract is due to expire on April 8, 2008, the Bureau of Health, with
HMA’s necessary and vital assistance, has continued the work of developing financial models
for State and Federal funding. These models are critical with the expiration of the State
Medicaid Plan on June 30, 2008. The Bureau has asked HMA (and they have responded) that
they work with us in doing the necessary and complex cost and revenue analysis that would
allow the Bureau to successfully negotiate with the State and Federal government on funding
valued at several hundred million dollars per year. This work continues at this time and is
subject to timing matters that are outside control of the County and the Bureau, i.e.
completion of initial negotiations with the State, the development by the State, and Illinois
Hospital Association of a new State Medicaid Plan, and the successful negotiations between
the State and Federal government of the submitted plan. The County’s interests are being
kept in front of the State, with HMA’s help.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $350,000.00. Contract extension: April 3 9, 2008 through April 2 8, 2009.
(899-260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2008 funds.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

Adjustment of quantities
and new item

AMOUNT
$24,311.83
(Deduction)

In general, the quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only.
This change represents the difference between the estimated quantities and actual field quantities of work
performed with savings due to a minimal amount of curb and gutter, concrete median, bituminous
shoulders, topsoil and sod and no 5 inch sidewalk, 4 foot catch basins and storm sewer work required per
field conditions.
A new item was required to be added for installation of inlets by hand due to presence of steel piling and
because existing catch basins were not aligned with the proposed edge of pavement.
I respectfully recommend approval by your Honorable Body.

The quantities as shown on the contract documents were estimated for bidding purposes only. This

performed with substantial savings due to less Bituminous Superpave mixes, Sidewalk Removal and
Replacement, Combination Concrete Curb and Gutter Type M-6.24 being required and elimination of
pressure connection work which was not required because the Village of Palos Hills allowed shutdown of
watermain.
New items, which were required but not included in the original contract, were added for seeding,
stairway access to/from residential area, sidewalk, driveway and curb and gutter removal and replacement
to minimize slope, and pavement patching on 103rd Street at 88th Avenue to complete the project.

LETTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 17, 2008 from
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
Re: Cook County Board Agenda Item #3 on the New Items Agenda for March
18, 2008
Dear Mr. Hylton and Mr. Coughlin:
Pursuant to our conversation today, March 17, 2008, the following questions
pertain to Agenda Item #3 on the New Items Agenda for March 18, 2008:
1)

Prior to 2008, the County Board approved over $66 million in
Urban Area Security Initiative Grants (UASI). Please provide a
5528

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
detailed schedule of how these funds were used and identify the
phases of the project.
2)

What is the reason for many funding extensions in Project
Shield?
UASI 2003 to expire in 4/05 extended to 6/06
UASI 2004 to expire in 11/05 extended to 5/07
UASI 2005 to expire in 12/06 extended to 3/08
UASI 2006 to expire in 3/08 extended to 3/09

3)

What is the status of the Phase 2 vehicles since the equipment
specifications are the same for Phase 3?

4)

Why have certain municipalities removed their Phase 2
equipment?

5)

Is it correct that Phase 2 vehicles are not able to practically
offload video?

6)

Is it true that it takes a couple of days for a technician to
manually offload video in Phase 2?

7)

Is it true that since they can’t offload video the cameras are not
able to connect to the network consistently?

8)

Is it true that the Phase 2 vehicles aren’t able to connect to the
network consistently?

9)

Is it true that the approximately 24 County sheriffs’ vehicles are
nonfunctional?

10)

What is the status of the Phase 1 vehicles and what would it cost
to retrofit them as suggested in Phase 3 RFP?

11)

What is the technical difference between the Phase 1 and Phase 2
vehicles?

12)

Are the Phase 1 vehicles functional?

13)

Was Phase 2 awarded without an RFP? If there is a document,
please provide it. Who was responsible for the selection of
Phase 2 vendors and the Phase 2 platform?

14)

What was your involvement in the development of the Phase 3
RFP and how familiar are you with the other phases of the
project?

15)

Identify all County personnel involved in Project Shield and their
responsibilities?

5529

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2008
16)
17)

Why would the Phase 3 RFP require vendors to buy
hardware/equipment from a company (Western DataCom) that
didn’t work in Phase 2?
Why hasn’t the County told IBM to return the Phase 2 equipment
under the warranty provision since it is nonfunctional?

18)

Of the proposed 80 vehicles in Phase 3, who will be responsible
for providing the mobility platform?

19)

Is it true that the Phase 3 RFP could and will most likely be
awarded to a vendor that does not have a working software
platform and according to the RFP the “software design should
be completed within 30 days of contract execution unless
otherwise agreed to by County and considerable progress is
shown”.

20)

What criteria do you use to determine who is qualified vendor?

21)

Are the vendors/subcontractors selected by the Project Manager
(IBM Phase 1 and 2) or are they told and/or mandated by County
employees on who to hire and what to pay them?

22)

The grant provided for 2 vehicles per 128 municipalities for a
total of 256 vehicles? Why in Phase 2 are there approximately
24 County sheriff’s cars and 6 or 7 County health vehicles when
that was outside the specifications of the grant?

23)

Is it safe to assume this happened because County employees
were tempting to hide the fact that the Phase 2 system was
nonfunctional?

24)

How specifically will the funds for Phase 3 be allocated
WITHIN the 3 parts of the RFP:
(1)
(2)
(3)

Mobile video and data network
CC command center software contract; and
Quality control.

Please identify by vendor or if a vendor has not been determined for a specific
work description within a category show that allocation by work description.
