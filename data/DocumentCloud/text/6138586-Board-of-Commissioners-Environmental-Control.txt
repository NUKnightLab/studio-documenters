PROPOSED ORDINANCE

THE COOK COUNTY ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ACT

WHEREAS, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) provides a means for
governments and ?rms to enter into a voluntary, legally binding agreement to

reduce their emissions of six greenhouse gasses by 1.2 percent each year
from 2006 to 2010; and

WHEREAS, the CCX operates under a standard ?cap-and?trade? system: each
emitter is allocated a certain number of credits and the number of credits is
lowered each successive year, allowing entities that reduce their emissions
below their requirements to sell credits and those that do not meet their
requirements to purchase them; and

WHEREAS, many governments?including the City of Chicago, King County,
Washington, and the State of Mexico?as well as many Fortune 500
companies?including Ford, IBM, and DuPont?have joined the CCX and
committed themselves to reductions; and

WHEREAS, Chicago reduced its direct greenhouse gas emissions by nearly
nine percent from its baseline (an average of between 1998 and 2001) and
2003, a reduction of over 30,000 tons of global warming pollution; and

WHEREAS, the City?s steps to improve energy efficiency in City buildings led

to the auditing and retrofitting of 15 million square feet of public buildings,
allowing the City and sister agencies to save $6 million annually.
