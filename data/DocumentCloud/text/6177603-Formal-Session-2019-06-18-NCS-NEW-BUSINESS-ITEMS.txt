Dear Midtown Neighbors,

Greetings! On Friday, July 26?? my team will host a very special outdoor screening of a national
documentary series known as: Family Pictures USA at the Detroit Historical Museum.

We?re very excited about this series and the 30 local residents that will be featured on the show, which
will air on PBS August 12th and 13th (check your local listings and for
more). We plan to invite all of them, their families, and our community partners to celebrate with us on
Legend?s Plaza, our outdoor space that sits at Woodward Ave and Kirby Street from 7:00 - 11:30 pm.

We would be very grateful if you considered joining us and appreciate your support as we host this
special community event. It is free of charge and all are welcome.

Here?s the General Run of Show:

0 7 pm 9 pm Activity on the plaza, storytelling, food vendors and impromptu interviews
inside/outside the museum.

- 9:15 pm 10:30 pm ?The Screening - projected on the side ofour Museum building adjacent to
Woodward Ave (includes sound)

The League of Michigan Bicyclists (LMB) is proud to award the 15th Street Block Club with one of
our 2019 Micro-Grants.

On May 22 in Lansing, the 15th Street Block Club will receive a brand-new bike repair
station from is headquartered in Canton, MI and is a leading innovator in
high-performance translucent walls and strategies, illuminated walls and ceilings, as well as
custom canopies, shelters and outdoor structures. We will also present leaders of the Club with a
check for $500 to help pay for designated bike parking/bike rack at the park.

In their grant application, organizers described their project for improving and restoring the
park at Marquette and 14th. Having "bicycling amenities, in this location will bring a livelier and
inviting Our neighborhood will be greatly improved when the park becomes a
location for wholesome and positive activities." -Winnie Kidd, President of the 15th Street Block

We couldn?t agree more. And we are excited to watch how this LMB micro-grant helps the 15th
Street Block Club revitalize their neighborhood.

As a contingency for accepting grant dollars and in-kind gifts, we have asked the 15th Street
Block Club to acknowledge LMB by placing one of our Micro-Grant stickers on the station
and the bike rack. We also have asked members of the 15th Street Block Club to share pictures,
stories, and updates about how the grant gift is having an impact on the community.

On behalf of the Viola Liuzzo Park Association, I am writing to offer our full assistance in

approximately 60,000.00 are being borne by the group mentioned above. The City of
Detroit, General Services Department will assist with the installation of the statue. These
improvements will take place on June 2019. We have worked with community
representatives to ensure these improvements are desired. The Department of Detroit
Parks and Recreation will maintain the statue, to maintain this site throughout the
summer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,



Mr. Artis Johnson
Board President

Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo
(April 11, 1925 - March 25, 1965)
Viola Liuzzo a working-class wife, mother, Wayne State University student, and member of
the NAACP had a long history of helping anyone who was suffering or treated unfairly. She
lived in Detroit, Michigan, with her children, Penny, Mary, Anthony, Tommy, and Sally; and

husband, Anthony Liuzzo.

In March 1965, Mrs. Liuzzo heeded Martin Luther King, Jr.?s plea for help after Bloody Sunday,
the infamous day when black citizens in Alabama were brutally beaten by police as they tried to
march from Selma to Montgomery to register to vote. After arranging with her closest friend,
Sarah Evans, to help care for her children during a brief absence, Mrs. Liuzzo drove to Selma
and participated in the successful "Selma to Montgomery Freedom March" and assisted with
coordination and logistics. However, she never made it home. On March 25, 1965, while
driving back to Selma with a young, fellow activist, Mrs. Liuzzo was assassinated in Lowndes
County, Alabama by members of the Ku Klux Klan. She was only 39 years old. Her murder
helped spur passage of the Voters Rights? Act in August 1965. Her decision and her
extraordinary act of human decency and kindness defined her as a wife, mother, friend, and
human being. Her courage has inspired songs, documentaries, books, action, and hope for

generations. Viola Fauver Gregg Liuzzo we thank you.

The Viola Liuzzo Playground was dedicated to her by the City of Detroit on July 1, 1982 out of
gratitude for her courage and bravery. In 2015, the Viola Liuzzo Park Association formed to
assist in the redesign of the playground and educate the community about Mrs. Liuzzo?s

courage and struggle for civil and human rights.
