Comerica Baitpark: Approval Reimbursement of 2015 Scheduled Repairs Improvements

Mr. Brown stated that Article 11.1 of the Amended and Restated Concession and Management
Agreement (the CMA), by and between the Detroit Downtown Deveiopment Authority (the 
and the Detroit Tigers, Inc. (the ?Tigers?) assigns to the Tigers responsibility to maintain the Ballpark
as a first class sports and entertainment complex and in good repair and operating condition. Article
11.5 of the CMA identifies the terms and conditions for making repairs and improvements to the
Bailpark, which include obtaining prior consent to the repairs from the DDA and Stadium Authority.

The CMA establishes under Section 11.6 a Maintenance Repair and Replacement Fund (MRRF)
to assure that a reasonable amount of funds is avaiiable to reimburse for the approved repairs and
replacements (improvements). Beginning April 1, 2001 the DDA contributed $250,000.00 and
beginning December 31, 2006 the Tigers contributed a fixed amount of $300,000.00 to the Fund.
Each year thereafter the DDA and Tigers are obligated under the CMA to deposit into the MRRF a
combined amount of $550,000.00 (the contribution increases each year based on the 
index; for 2016 the amount is 

The Board by its resolution DDA 15?06?83-150 on June 24, 2015 consented to a budget proposed
by the Tigers for 2015 scheduied repairs and improvements to the Ballpark in the amount not to
exceed $710,000.00.

The Tigers have submitted request with supporting documentation for the reimbursement
from the MRRF for eligible repairs and improvements during the 2015 in the amount of 
707,832.73.

in keeping with Article 11.2 of the CMA and the Tigers? Diverse Business Program, the Tigers
report that were contracted to disadvantage businesses; a total of $321,227.54 of the work was
contracted to Wayne County based businesses. (Refer to the attached information regarding the
disadvantaged businesses contracted by the Tigers.)

Based on a review of the detailed documentation against the budget and discussion with the Tiger?s
regarding the reallocated budget line item amounts, DDA staff finds the 2015 repairs and
improvements invoice for reimbursement are in keeping with the purposes of the MRRF and
recommends payment of the total requested amount of 707,832.73.

The current MRRF cash balance before this reimbursement is 1,490,378.36.

Mr. Lewand stated that he recails having a discussion last year about the repairs. The Board agreed
that the 4.1(0) Committee should review the repairs prior to the Board?s approval. Mr. Holioweli stated
that this was reviewed at two committee meetings, the first one of which they did not have a quorum.
Mr. Lewand questioned if Mr. Jenkins had reviewed the repairs. Mr. Biaszkiewicz responded that Mr.
Jenkins did review the information at the meeting at which they did not have a quorum. Subsequently,
the Committee met at a time when they did have a quorum and recommends approval by the Board.

adequately being maintained or if additional action is necessary, i.e. hiring an independent ?rm to

for effectively and efficiently distributing tickets based on the large volume of tickets invoived,
managing the qualification requirements and monitoring the proper use of the tickets.

The Tigers? "Ticket Donation Program", in order to the quantity obligations, was broaden to
solicit and pre~qualify non-profit organizations and deserving groups to assure and monitor the
proper supervision and chaperoning of the targeted children. Notwithstanding, a reserve is
maintained for smaller and individual requests during the season.

2106 baseball seasons include:

Tigers ticket donation guidelines require that charities appiy in writing on organizational

agreed that would be a good idea. The language from the CMA states 50,000 tickets be

serve on the committee.

NEW BUSINESS

Mr. Ogden stated that he just wanted to follow up on his request at the test meeting for a
presentation/update on Event Center Executive Order compliance by skilled trade classification.
Mr. Lewand requested that Doug Diggs and Portia Roberson put together the information and
present it to the Board at the next meeting.

PUBLIC COMMENT
Mr. Lewand calied for pubiic comment and stated that two minutes would be given.
Mr. John Lauve of l-ioliy, Michigan stated the following:

?First off, you are not a member of the Board and, according to the Act, you could be a
member of the Board, you could be Vice Chairman and you could even be Chairman, but
it is not to have you just come in here and not be a member of the Board. i
know you don't like to follow the law because it is kind of confusing, but the most recent
infraction is this with the Hitch/Wayne State project. This is an amendment and a change
to the plan. When an amendment or a change to the plan is made, there has to be a public
hearing, it has to be reviewed and approved by the City Council. That is in the Public Act
197, Section 17 and 18. So i went to the groundbreaking after the rushed meeting we had.
We had to approve this without any information about how much it cost, what the
arrangements were in the lease, and how we are turning it over to ilitich in some deai. it
should be above board and open. Here is the record. This is the llitich property at Grand
Circus Park where the DDA gave $1 That?s an eyesore and to have him come in
here and say we need money to fix up the stadium, he needs to clean up his act and you
need to stop sitting by and say liitch is a great man and he is doing us a favor because he
isn?t. You need to hold him to make this city what it should be instead of closing your eyes
and letting it pass. The other tickets?i?m glad you?re doing something about
it. i?ll read it-?Michigan State University students getting tickets. There is no credit to the
Detroit system that owns the stadium and pays for it. There should be credit, it should be
announced and there should be publicity for it. They have swept this thing under the carpet
for years. They owe this city of dollars for how they abused this system. Children
of low income families are exactly that?-?not students at the University, Elks Clubs and all
these others."

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Laws that his time was up and thanked him for his comments.
ADJOURNMENT

With there being no other business to be brought before the Board, Mr. Lewand adjourned the
meeting at 3:58 pm.
