DUTY DISABILITY CLAIM
Tietz, Robert C.
Sergeant Tietz, and his attorney, appeared before the Board on his claim for a duty disability
benefit. The Board requested to continue this matter to review the medical records and obtain
additional documentation.
Mr. Lance Weiss and Ms. Kristen Brundirks of the Fund’s actuarial firm, Gabriel, Roeder, Smith
& Company (GRS) appeared before the Board to review the results of the impact statements
prepared for House Bill 4659 and Senate Bill 2525. The impact study reports were previously
provided to the Trustees and served as the basis of the discussion.
Senate Bill 2525 provides that once a retired member attains age seventy-five, the 3.0 percent
Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) is compounded. It does not change the benefit for anyone
born after January 1, 1966, or for members in Tier 2. Mr. Weiss noted that the projected increase
in statutory contributions required for this legislation for the period of 2021 through 2056 would
be approximately $1.4 billion.
House Bill 4659 provides that the birth year restriction of January 1, 1966, for a 3.0 percent
COLA increase be removed for Tier 1 members. Mr. Weiss noted that the projected increase in
statutory contributions required for this legislation for the period of 2021 through 2056 would be
approximately $2.5 billion.
Further discussion on the impact study results was held, with various questions from the
Trustees to the GRS representatives.

It was moved by Trustee Wright, seconded by Trustee Beyna that the Board enter into executive
session per 2 (c)(11).
