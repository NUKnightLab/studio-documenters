Lee Road Baptist Church, owner, proposes to erect a 4 feet 10 inches by 7 feet 10 inches single faced
illuminated identification message center ground sign that will be 7 feet 10 inches tall in a G1 Local
Retail Business District. The owner appeals for relief from the strict application of Section
350.14(a)(h) of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances which states that automatic changeable copy signs
shall be permitted in a Local Retail District only if the Board of Zoning Appeals grants a variance in
accordance with the following standards:
(1) The Board of Zoning Appeals determines that the proposed sign will not adversely
impact the character of nearby properties and will not cause disturbances to users of those
properties.
(2) The design and placement of the sign has been approved by the City Planning
Commission or Landmarks Commission, as applicable, in accordance with the general design
guidelines established for use by each Commission.
(3) Each display of information shall remain static or fixed for a minimum of twenty (20)
seconds, thereby prohibiting flashing, scrolling, animated or other copy that gives the
appearance of motion, unless the City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission, as
applicable, determines that animated or more frequently changing displays can be
accommodated in a particular location without causing disturbances to nearby properties.
