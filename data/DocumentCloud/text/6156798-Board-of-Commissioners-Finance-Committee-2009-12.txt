STATE’S ATTORNEY, Anita Alvarez, submitting communication advising the
County of the Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator regarding
Jimmy Doe v. County of Cook, USDC No. 99-C-3945. This class action litigation
was originally brought in 1999 and has subsequently involved the entry of a
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the parties that was approved by the
District Court in December 2002 and the entry of an Agreed Supplemental Order
approved by the Court on May 18, 2006. This petition was resolved by the entry of
an Agreed Order Appointing a Transitional Administrator (TA) by the District Court
on August 14, 2007. The Board of Commissioners agreed to the entry of the
subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the
TA Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a
separate account to pay reasonable costs and expenses of the staff of the OTA.
The OTA account was first funded at $800,000.00 on July 22, 2008 and the District
Court entered an order for additional funds of $500,000.00 respectively on
December 18, 2008, April 14, 2009 and June 30, 2009.
The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records
evidencing payments and a balance in the account as of October 21, 2009 in the
amount of $186,688.95 which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook
County State’s Attorney’s Office. The TA has requested the District Court to enter
an order providing for an additional disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA
account which was approved by the Court on November 17, 2009.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the
Self-Insurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator
account in accordance with the terms of the aforementioned court order.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
ASSESSMENT CLASS 8B DESIGNATION

Taxation, Section 74-70 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-70.

Class 8a and 8b Designation / Assessment Class

(a)
Class 8a. Real estate that is used primarily for industrial or
commercial purposes, which real estate would qualify for a Class 8 designation
pursuant to Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for the fact that the qualifying
use of the property prior to application for the incentive does not comply with the
definition of abandoned property provided for in Section 74-62(b), can receive a
designation as a Class 8a property so long as the applicant can show that it has
complied with all of the requirements necessary to receive a Class 8 designation
per Sections 74-62 through 74-64, except for meeting the definition of
abandonment provided for in Section 74-62(b), but only when the Cook County
Board of Commissioners provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such
designation absent abandonment.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of Class 8a designation absent
abandonment when:

a.

An applicant who collects or transmits sales tax has
obtained from the municipality in which the real estate is
located or the Cook County Board of Commissioners, if the
real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an
agreement to abate a portion of the local government's sales
tax generated by the industrial or commercial enterprise
located on such real estate and such abatement of sales tax
must cover the period of time for which the applicant would
qualify for this Class 8a incentive; and

b.

Applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Board of Commissioners that due to national and
regional economic conditions beyond its control the
industrial or commercial enterprise has undergone a
significant reduction in net operating income of at least 40
percent in the year it makes application for this incentive as
compared to the average net operating income of the
industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three years;
and

c.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence
including, but not limited to, an economic impact study that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners that the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise is not economically viable and as such it will
cease operations within 60 days of the submission of an
eligibility application for Class 8a designation to the Cook
County Assessor, and thereafter the property will become
vacant and unused for an extended period of time of at least
24 months; and

d.

Applicant provides objective and credible evidence
including, but not limited to, an economic impact study that
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners that designation as a class 8a property
will allow the industrial or commercial enterprise to be
economically viable and thereby continue its operations so
that the industrial or commercial enterprise can continue to
occupy and fully utilize the real estate for an extended
period of time.

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that industrial or commercial enterprise has
undergone a significant reduction in net operating income of
at least 40 percent in the year it makes application for the
incentive as compared to the average net operating income
of the industrial or commercial enterprise in the prior three
years; and

b.

A finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that Class 8a designation of the property is
necessary for the ongoing industrial or commercial
enterprise to continue its operations and that without such
designation the industrial or commercial enterprise would
not be economically viable causing the property to become
vacant and unused; and

c.

A statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the designation of the
property as a Class 8a property absent an abandonment
requirement; and

that it supports and consents to the application made to the
Cook County Assessor requesting designation as a Class
8a property absent an abandonment requirement.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the
county, and designation as a class 8a property is sought using the
provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

A finding by the municipality that it has determined that class
8a designation of the property is necessary for the ongoing
industrial or commercial enterprise to continue its operations
and that without such designation the industrial or
commercial enterprise would not be economically viable
causing the property to become vacant and unused; and

b.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and
consents to the action by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners to support designation of the property as a
Class 8a property; and

c.

A statement by the municipality that it supports and
consents to the class 8a application to the Cook County
Assessor; and

Real estate receiving a Class 8a designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall be assessed at the lowest
percentage of market value provided for in Section 74-64(11),
however the term of the incentive will be limited to five years only
and such Class 8a designation shall not be renewed:
a.

After the initial application has been approved and granted,
if the subject real estate receiving the Class 8a designation
pursuant to the provisions of this section is sold or the
applicant transfers ownership of any portion of the property
at any time prior to the five-year term of the 8a classification,
then the property's Class 8a classification shall be subject to
an eligibility review by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, the municipality, and the Assessor under
the procedures set forth in this Ordinance for the remainder
of the five-year term.

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a Class 8a designation an
eligibility application must be made to the Cook County Assessor.

(6)

Class 8a designation can not be applied to real estate unless the
following has occurred: application is made to the Cook County
Assessor; all required municipal and county ordinances and
resolutions are provided to the Cook County Assessor; and the
Cook County Assessor determines that the real estate which is the
subject of the application for a Class 8a designation would qualify
for designation as a Class 8 property but for the inability to comply
with the definition of abandonment pursuant to Section 74-62(b).

(7)

The Cook County Assessor may adopt rules consistent with this
section to determine eligibility for the benefits provided under Class
8a.

(8)

Upon receipt of an eligibility application for a Class 8a designation,

designate any real estate as Class 8a property for assessment year
2018 or thereafter.

(12)

located on the property ceases operations and the subject real
estate becomes vacant and unused.

(13)

Real estate that receives a designation as a Class 8a incentive
property will lose such designation and the corresponding reduced
level of assessment upon termination of the required partial sales
tax abatement by local government.

avoiding Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board discontinuation

requirements of this section and the Cook County Board of Commissioners
provides a resolution or ordinance in support of such designation.
(1)

The Cook County Board of Commissioners may only provide such a
resolution or ordinance in support of class 8b designation when:
a.

the applicant is a hospital, as defined in the Hospital
Licensing Act, or an entity that owns the real property on
which a hospital is located, the hospital is licensed by the
state, and the abandonment of the hospital would require
the applicant, or the hospital on behalf of which the applicant
owns the real property on which the hospital is located, to
obtain a permit or exemption from the State of Illinois Health
Facilities and Services Review Board pursuant to the Illinois
Health Facilities Planning Act prior to discontinuing hospital
operations and to obtain a second permit or exemption prior
to re-opening or otherwise re-establishing the hospital after
abandonment;

b.

the applicant demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Cook
County Assessor that approval of the class 8b designation
will materially increase the likelihood that the property will be
retained for hospital use with the associated employment
benefits relative to industrial or commercial use of the
property;

(3)

c.

the subject hospital is located in a zip code which has a 10
percent or greater incidence of families and/or individuals
below the poverty level, as identified by the U.S. Census
Bureau's most recent census; and

d.

the subject hospital employs at least 750 full-time
equivalents (full-time equivalent jobs being defined as total
hours worked by all non full-time employees divided by
average annual hours worked by the full-time employees).

Such a resolution or ordinance must contain:
a.

a finding that the Cook County Board of Commissioners has
determined that the applicant demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Cook County Assessor that approval of
the class 8b designation will materially increase the
likelihood that the property will be retained for hospital use;
and

b.

a statement by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
that it supports and consents to the designation of the
property as a class 8b property.

When the real estate is located in an incorporated area of the
county, and designation as a class 8b property is sought using the
provisions of this section, the municipality in which the real estate is
located must provide to the Cook County Assessor a resolution or
ordinance that contains the following:
a.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that
the proposed redevelopment contemplated for the subject
hospital or the property on which the hospital sits is
necessary and appropriate and that, without a classification
having the impact of this section, the special circumstances
that exist on the property on which the subject hospital sits
including but not limited to the unique requirement that
mandates that the subject hospital's operations are
continually maintained without interruption in order for the
State of Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board
to issue a certificate of need and licensure approval for the
continued operation of the subject hospital and the
extraordinary need for the continued operation of the subject
hospital within the applicable region, will not be addressed
and the property on which the subject hospital sits will
become vacant and underutilized and cause the continued
exasperation of blighted factors within the municipality and
region;

b.

a finding by the corporate authorities of the municipality that
a classification having the impact of this section is
necessary for the redevelopment to occur on the property on
which the subject hospital sits; and

c.

a statement by the corporate authorities of the municipality
supporting and consenting to the filing of an application for a
classification having the impact of this section for the
property on which the subject hospital sits.

(4)

Real estate receiving a class 8b designation pursuant to the
provisions of this section shall be assessed at the lowest
percentage of market value and for the term provided for in Section
74-64 (11).

(5)

In order for real estate to qualify for a class 8b designation, a class
8 or class 8b application must be made or have been made to the
Cook County Assessor. Any application for class 8 submitted with
required municipal approval after July 1, 2008 for hospital property

where the property was acquired for hospital use by an unrelated
for-profit acquirer, avoiding the Health Facilities and Services
Review Board discontinuation approval, shall be reconsidered as an
application pursuant to this section upon supplement of such class
8 application with the additional information required in this section,
if any. Upon receipt of an application, the Cook County Assessor

Commissioners for consideration as to whether the Cook County
Board will provide a resolution or ordinance in support of a class 8b
