Report on Quality and Patient Safety Matters
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, provided an update on regulatory and accreditation
matters. The organization participated as a regional resource in a City-wide emergency preparedness drill
on May 15th. He added that the administration has a meeting next week with the federal judge overseeing
the Consent Decree on correctional health; he anticipates that this will be the final meeting with the judge.
Staff are in continued readiness for the visit from representatives from The Joint Commission (TJC) at
Stroger Hospital; that visit will include Stroger Hospital and the Stroger Hospital-affiliated clinics, and
will happen sometime between now and October. Staff are particularly focusing on areas involving
environment of care and staff safety issues, and infection prevention including high-level disinfection, due
to increased attention in these areas over the last handful of years by the regulatory bodies. Because the
organization is also being recertified for its primary care medical homes, he expects that the survey team
will consist of at least eight (8) surveyors, and the survey will last for a minimum of four (4) days.

Report on Quality and Patient Safety Matters (continued)
B. Metrics (Attachment #1)
Dr. Ronald Wyatt, Chief Quality Officer, provided an overview of the metrics. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the information.
Director Driscoll stated that she would like to see a couple of new indicators added to the metrics.
She suggested that a new category be added that measures how the organization performs on some of
the indicators that may affect finances down the road, such as thirty (30) day hospital readmissions.
She recommended that Dr. Wyatt work with Chairman Gugenheim to develop a revised set of metrics
for the Committee. Chairman Gugenheim noted that it is her intent to review this subject at the
earliest possible date.
Board Chairman Hammock noted that when the subject of metrics was initially discussed, what the
Board wanted was to have a person like Dr. Wyatt and hospital staff look at what metrics they need
on a day-to-day basis to most effectively provide safe, high-quality patient care. Then, after it is
determined which metrics are critical for staff needs, a synopsis or summary of those would be shared
with the Board. Additionally, the Board wants to see how the organization is measured or compared
against external hospitals.
Dr. Wyatt provided his thoughts on the subject, with regard to areas of focus for metrics.
Additionally, he provided information on the increased emphasis on the culture of safety and
referenced a section in TJC’s patient safety chapter regarding leadership; he noted that there is a tight
alignment between leadership and safety culture. He stated that it is his intent to build a strategic
dashboard; a data analytics plan that is actionable on the back end needs to be put together.
Dr. Shannon stated that, in the fall, three (3) surveys will be administered by Press Ganey across the
staff. The first survey is a repeat of the nurse satisfaction survey, which is an annual activity. The
second survey will be a culture of safety survey; the previous survey was done two (2) years ago.
The third survey will be an employee engagement survey that will go out to all staff; the last one was
done in 2011. Those surveys will provide a rich set of information of the organization’s current state
and opportunities to be considered. It is anticipated that it will take a handful of weeks to get those
surveys done; the administration is pushing to get as much participation from staff as possible. It will
take a little time to receive and digest the responses to those surveys; following that, the information
will be shared with the Board.

Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Quality and Patient Safety Committee Meeting Minutes
June 22, 2018

ATTACHMENT #2

Page 15 of 30

 Changes in the Bylaws:

1. No changes to the Preamble
2. In the Section on Definitions there are numerous changes, primarily title changes, to reflect the
current titles and organizational structure for staff and leadership in the current CCHHS system
3. No changes to Articles 1 or 2
4. Article 3 – Medical staff membership
a. Qualifications for membership now explicitly require that a candidate is Board Eligible (i.e.
an active candidate on a path to board certification) or that they are in fact Board Certified
in their given specialty. There was language inserted to allow for exceptions to this to be
made by the Medical Director in consultation with the Department Chair.
b. The requirement that someone be “of good reputation” was removed. It was felt to be too
vague and arbitrary.
c. There is now a requirement for membership that a provider must be an eligible provider for
Medicare/Medicaid and be willing to participate in those programs along with any other
commercial insurance that CCHHS participates in.
d. A non-discrimination clause was added that expands the definition to be more
comprehensive than the previous non-discrimination clause.
e. The appointment to the medical staff is by the CCHHS board upon the recommendation of
the EMS and the Quality and Patient Safety subcommittee of the Board (QPS). The Joint
Conference Committee no longer has a role in the appointment process. This change
reflects the current practice. The QPS has essentially replaced the Joint Conference
Committee in the appointment/reappointment process. The Joint Conference Committee
does retain a role in the event that there is a disagreement on an appointment /
reappointment between the EMS and the QPS. This change also is reflected in Article 5 in
the appointment/reappointment process.
f. The initial provisional appointment period was expanded from 6 mo. to 1 year. This was also
changed to start from the day that clinical duties begins rather than the day of the “hiring”.
It was felt that 6 months of clinical work was insufficient for a complete evaluation of a
provider’s abilities. This expanded period will include 2 Focused Professional Practice
Evaluations (FPPE), one every 6 months. After the first FPPE the Department Chair has the
option of asking the EMS to extend Active Status to the provider.
g. A member may apply for a leave of absence to his/her department chair for up to 1 year
duration, or a time specified in special circumstances by HR policy, whichever is longer. This
allows alignment of the Bylaws with HR policies/procedures.
5. Article 4 Categories of the Medical Staff.
a. The requirement that Affiliate members pay medical staff dues (previously 50%) was
removed to make this more equitable across the System as more providers work at multiple
System locations. Providers will only pay Medical Staff dues at their “home” institution.

Page 16 of 30

 b. The category of “Service” member was eliminated. It is no longer a relevant category.
c. Language was added to make it clear that Honorary Medical Staff members do not need to
be credentialed.
6. Article 5 Procedure for Appointment / Reappointment
a. Language was added to make it clear that the hospital representatives are allowed to
provide information on provider’s performance, etc. to Health Care Plans as well as the
other organizations previously included.
b. Language was added to state that an Active or Volunteer member of the medical staff
that has not treated or participated in the treatment of a hospital or SCHN clinic patient
within at least 2 years, is not entitled to apply for reappointment. This also applies to
Consulting Members who have not provided consulting services within at least the last 2
years. The president of the EMS with concurrence of the Medical Director, may permit a
reapplication to proceed in unusual circumstances.
c. The section on expedited initial appointment was removed. There are provisions for
temporary and/or urgent privileges in other sections. There is provision for
Administrative Appointment to the medical staff. This is found in Article 6
d. The role of the QPS in the appointment/reappointment process has been reflected in
this article.
e. A member may apply for a leave of absence to his/her department chair for up to 1 year
duration, or a time specified in special circumstances by HR policy, whichever is longer.
This allows alignment of the Bylaws with HR policies/procedures.
7. Article 6 – Clinical Privileges
a. The section on awarding temporary privileges was revised to provide clarity
b. Language was added to clarify the authority to grant administrative or disaster privileges
8. Article 7 – Corrective Action
a. Minor changes added to clarify the Joint Conference role in the corrective action process
b. Section 7 was removed – the suspension of County employment is a function of HR and not
the medical staff bylaws.
9. Article 8 - Hearing and Appeal Procedure
a. It has been clarified that a member shall not have the right to a hearing if they fail to meet
the requirements of an FPPE that was initiated for cause as approved through the
credentialing committee and the EMS
b. Language has been added to allow a member to request a hearing by electronic
transmission with a read receipt requested.
c. The time period to initiate a hearing for a member under summary suspension has been
defined as not later than 30 days. The previous 15 was felt to be too short a period of time
to convene an appropriate hearing panel.
10. Article 9 – Officers – no meaningful changes. Now allows for electronic transmission of ballots.

Page 17 of 30

 11. Article 10 – Composition and Duties of the EMS
a. Clarification of the composition of the EMS to reflect current practice (i.e. there are more
than 4 divisions in the dept. of medicine). Also added members from newer departments or
sections i.e. Oral Health and PMR
12. Article 11 – Other Medical Staff Committees
a. Language added to clarify that members of committees continue in their positions after a
new EMS president is elected until the president choses to remove them or the member
choses to vacate the position.
b. The list of committees has been revised. Committees that are essentially hospital functions
have been removed from the medical staff bylaws. It is anticipated that the EMS will still
play a role in helping to staff the hospital based committees. The following have been left as
Medical Staff committees:
Bylaws Committee
Credentialing Committee
Medical Education Committee
Peer Review Committee
IRB
Ad Hoc committees
The following have been removed as being committees that are hospital functions:
Medical Ethics Committee
Blood Bank and Transfusion Committee
Cancer Committee
Critical Care Committee
Drug and Formulary Committee
Medical Information Committee
Operating Room Committee
Hospital Quality Improvement and Patient Safety Committee
Surgical Function Review Committee
c. The reporting requirements for the committees was removed in section 18.
13. Article 12 – Joint Conference Committee
a. The composition has been changed to reflect the current administration organizational chart
and to provide some balance in representation of administration and the members of the
Medical Staff
b. This section has been amended to reflect the current role of the Joint Conference
Committee. This includes a change in its mandatory number of meetings to reflect current
practice.
14. Article 13 – Medical Staff Meetings
a. Attendance requirements have been changed to reflect the current practice

Page 18 of 30

 15. Article 14 – Organization of Departments, Divisions and Sections
a. A section/ division of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation has been added under the
department of Trauma and Burns.
b. Clarification was included as to the time prior to surgery that an H&P may be completed,
this is a Joint Commission requirement.
c. Language outlining specifics around quality assurance projects and reporting for
Departments and Divisions was removed. This should be included in Departmental rules and
regulations – these do not belong in the EMS bylaws.
d. Language was added to clarify that a candidate for a department chair must be board
certified in a specialty within the department they are applying to.
e. The process for appointing a Department Chair has been clarified to reflect current practice.
f. Language was added to clarify the Department Chair’s role in the appointment process, the
awarding of clinical privileges and their responsibility to continually survey the professional
performance of all individuals in the Department with clinical privileges. In addition,
language was added to clarify the Chair’s role in assessing and improving the quality of care
provided by the Department.
16. Article 15 – Committee and Department Meetings
a. No substantive changes
17. Article 16 – Authorizations, Releases, confidentiality and Immunity
a.
No substantive changes
18. Article 17 – Amendment of and Deviation from Bylaws
a. Time shorted from 60 days to 30 days for the Bylaws committee to report recommendations
on a proposed amendment to the EMS
b. Language added to clarify the process for the Medical staff to approve amendments. Now
allows for electronic format for voting
19. Article 18 – Rules and Regulations
a. No substantive changes. Separates the Rules and regulations from the bylaws although
retains and dictates the process by which changes to the Rules and Regs must be made.
20. Article 19 – Independence of Articles, Sections and Subsections
a. No changes
21. Article 20 – Non – Member Practitioners
a. No substantive changes.
