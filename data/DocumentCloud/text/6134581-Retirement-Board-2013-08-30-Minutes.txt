 MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES' ANNUITY AND BENEFIT FUND OF CHICAGO
Report of Monthly Meeting No. 2013-08 held on Friday, August 30, 2013
PUBLIC COMMENT
There were no requests to address the Board.
LEGISLATION
Legislative Update
Mr. Mohler updated the Board on the current status of negotiations regarding pension reform in the Illinois
Legislature.

HEARINGS
The Matter of Anna Hall (Disability Application)
This matter was taken out of order and the hearing was conducted after the completion of the Board’s
regular business.
In attendance on the matter were Ms. Anna Hall, inactive Fund member, Mr. Robert Seltzer, Ms. Hall’s
attorney and Mr. Mike Tierney, Business Agent for Plumbers’ Local 10.
Following the introduction of evidence and testimony from Ms. Hall and Fund staff, the Board decided to
take the matter under advisement and requested post hearing briefs be filed by both parties.

INVESTMENTS
Performance Reports
Mr. Wrubel and Mr. Walsh updated the Board on the Fund’s performance. No actions taken.
Marquette Second Quarter Report
Because the August Board meeting fell so late in the month, Mr. Wrubel, based on the recommendation of
Fund staff, skipped the detailed review of the Second Quarter Report and instead utilized more current
reporting to update the Board regarding manager performance.
