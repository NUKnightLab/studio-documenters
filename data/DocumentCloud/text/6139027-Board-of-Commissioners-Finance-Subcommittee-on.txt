DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE FOR SPECIAL
PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a

Proposed Resolution sponsored by Bridget Gainer, County Commissioner.

BOPOSED RESOLUTION

 

DISCUSSION ON THE PENSION MULTIPLIER CHANGE
FOR SPECIAL PURPOSE FUNDS AND GRANTS

WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management released a memo on August 18,
201 1 to address the indirect cost rates to be used for grants and special purpose funds.

WHEREAS, the department of Budget and Management would like to ensure that the
general fund does not subsidize any indirect costs attributable to Special purpose funds or
grants.

WHEREAS, it was determined by the department of Budget and Management that the
pension amount for special purpose funds should be calculated at the actuarial rate rather
than the required contribution rate.

WHEREAS, the change to an actuarial allocation model for pension contributions would
mean using a 4.95 multiplier instead of a 1.54 multiplier. The resulting impact will go from
13.09% to 42.07% for special purpose funds.
