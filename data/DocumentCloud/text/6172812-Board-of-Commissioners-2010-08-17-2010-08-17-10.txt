BACKGROUND INFORMATION
In 2010 the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) issued a solicitation for the provision of Cisco equipment supply
and installation services under RFP 10-00516 at various CHA sites and locations. The CHA currently uses T1
links to connect many of its remote sites to the CHA central network. These links provide integrated voice, video,
and data to the CHA’s remote sites. The existing T1 links are functional and suitable for servicing the CHA’s
current network capacity and application performance requirements. However, upgrading the networking
equipment at sites across the CHA network would augment the current performance of CHA networking systems,
and would better support enhancements to the CHA communications network and infrastructure that are
implemented in the future.

 Among the anticipated system improvements planned, the CHA has a video surveillance initiative that will require
large amounts of bandwidth to each remote CHA site. The T1 links have a limited capacity and can become easily
saturated with traffic where video is involved, potentially resulting in less than optimal network and application
performance. The CHA would experience enhanced bandwidth and application performance at each remote site
and across the network as a whole by upgrading the existing network equipment located at each CHA remote site
with new, higher performing Cisco networking equipment, which will support and improve both current network
performance and future network infrastructure enhancements.
PROCUREMENT INFORMATION
On April, 23 2010, the CHA advertised Request for Proposal (RFP) # 10-00516 in the Chicago Sun-Times,
Chicago Defender, and El Dia Newspapers, to solicit proposals for a Cisco Equipment and Installation Services
provider. The proposal was also sent out to Two-Hundred Sixty-Four (264) vendors and Sixty (60) Assist
Agencies. The CHA held a pre-proposal meeting on April 29, 2010; and issued an addendum on April 29, 2010,
deleting items from the equipment list; Addendum # 2 was issued on May 10, 2010 providing potential
Respondents with clarifications to questions regarding the RFP. The due date was also changed from 05/13/2010,
to 05/18/2010.
The CHA received a total of four (4) proposals in response to the RFP. The proposals were deemed responsive and
were given to the evaluation committee for their review. The written proposals were originally scored by the
evaluation team, and a competitive range was set, which included three of the Respondents. Meetings were held
with the Respondents in the competitive range (which included oral presentations by these Respondents, and
offered the opportunity for the CHA to provide additional direction on the project’s requirements) and updated
“best and finals” were presented by the Respondents in the competitive range. A second scoring was done based
on the updated best and final proposals.
Following the second scoring phase and evaluation, AT&T was determined to offer the best proposal that met the
technical requirements of the RFP and was found to provide the best overall value consistent with CHA’s
requirements for the Cisco Equipment and Installation Services. AT&T’s presentation was impressive. It was
very thorough and articulated an effective solution. AT&T has over 100 years of experience as a technology
service provider. AT&T has successfully designed, deployed and installed over 1000 large scale WAN and
Metropolitan Wide Area Network (MAN) projects throughout the city of Chicago and the United States. AT&T‘s
experience deploying Cisco systems and equipment in large scale WAN and MAN Cisco projects will provide
Chicago Housing Authority with a successful and reliable solution for CHA’s WAN and MAN needs.
AT&T has over 70 Cisco Certified Internetworking Experts (CCIE’s) employed for Cisco routing, switching and
voice services. AT&T is highly qualified to design, configure, and install a large scale, city-wide Metropolitan
Wide Area Networks. AT&T is an Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) servicing multiple states with Metropolitan
Wide Area Networks and has extensive experience providing telecommunications solutions. This was found to be
an advantage compared to the other presenters who have never implemented a large scale Cisco WAN and MAN
deployment of the magnitude required by the CHA.
AT&T has the resources with the proper skill sets and ample experience in successful large scale Cisco WAN and
MAN deployments. AT&T’s proposal, experience and resources will provide Chicago Housing Authority with a
successful and timely Cisco WAN and MAN installation services. AT&T’s proposal provides the best experience
and value to the Chicago Housing Authority. Based on the foregoing it is in the best interest of the CHA to enter
into a two-year contract with AT&T to supply and install Cisco networking equipment to the CHA in an amount
not to exceed $448,669.46.
