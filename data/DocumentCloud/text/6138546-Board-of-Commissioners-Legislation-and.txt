The correspondence from the Independent Inspector General Selection
Committee (the “Committee”) transmits the identity of its selection for the Office
of Independent Inspector General. The Committee has selected Mr. Patrick
Blanchard.
As stated in the Committee’s correspondence, the Committee interviewed the
three (3) candidates, set forth in the Cook County Bar Association/Chicago Bar
Association Joint Search Committee’s (the “Joint Search Committee”)
Candidate List, on Wednesday, July 30, 2008, and selected Mr. Patrick
Blanchard by a majority vote of the Committee.
The Committee’s
correspondence also notes State’s Attorney Devine’s abstention from the voting
process.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Independent Inspector General Ordinance
(the “Ordinance”), I hereby submit the Committee’s selection for the office of
Independent Inspector General for your consideration at the County Board
meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 3, 2008.
Pursuant to § 2-282(b)(1)(c) of the Ordinance, the Board of Commissioners
must call a vote for Mr. Patrick Blanchard’s appointment to the Office of
Independent Inspector General no later than Wednesday, September 17, 2008.
Please note that the office of Independent Inspector General is not a
Presidential Appointment; rather, the Committee has recommended Mr. Patrick
Blanchard to you, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, according to the
independent selection process set forth in the Ordinance.
As you will recall, in an effort to bring about transparency and accountability, I
voluntarily removed myself from the appointment process set forth in the
Ordinance which I sponsored. The appointment and selection process required
the Cook County Bar Association and the Chicago Bar Association to submit, to
me, a Candidate List naming three (3) duly qualified candidates. The bar
associations conducted a national search with the assistance of Hudson
Recruitment and Talent Management; Hudson reviewed greater than three
hundred twenty-eight (328) applications and résumés, from which Hudson
created a subgroup of one hundred sixteen (116) highly qualified candidates.
Hudson conducted additional screening and interviews of the highly qualified
subgroup and created a slate of eleven (11) extremely qualified candidates from
which the bar associations selected the members of the Candidate List.
Upon my receipt of the Candidate List from the bar associations, and in
accordance with § 2-282(b)(1)(b) of the Ordinance, I publicly submitted the
Candidate List to the Committee, at the July 22, 2008 Board Meeting, for the
Committee’s review, interview, and selection of a candidate to be submitted to
the full Board of Commissioners.
