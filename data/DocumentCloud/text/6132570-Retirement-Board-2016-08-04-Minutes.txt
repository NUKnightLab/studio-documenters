Northern District of Illinois. Ms. Taylor had been employed by the Cook County Recorder of
Deeds and was charged with preparing a fraudulent quit-claim deed and agreeing to file it
with the Recorder of Deeds. The trustees discussed that based upon the plea agreement
entered by Ms. Taylor, it appeared her felony conviction was related to her service as a
County employee, but that the Board would need to make a final determination before her
annuity benefits would be terminated. The Board further discussed that the annuity benefits
could be suspended and that it could make a final determination about whether her annuity
benefits would be revoked at their meeting on September 1, 2016.
It was moved by Trustee White and seconded by Trustee McFadden that Regina Taylor be
notified that the Board will determine at their meeting on September 1, 2016, whether her
conviction in USA v. Taylor, 15 CR 568, is related to her service as a County employee and

Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decisions, which if entered by the Board, would conclude the
administrative hearing process for the three members.

6. Old Business/New Business
The Executive Director stated that there was an online article in Breitbart in which the author
suggested that the Fund had misreported its funded liability. She added that the author was relying
about the reporting required by new GASB Rules 67 and 68 which modified the funding calculation
for accounting purposes. Commissioner Suffredin read the article and had requested an explanation
from the Fund. President Herrera suggested that the Fund staff prepare a letter in response to
Commissioner Suffredin explaining the impact of GASB Rules 67 and 68 and that a draft of the
letter be posted for the trustees to review before it was delivered. Trustees Nevius and White asked
that the letter include the need for additional funding for the Forest Fund. The Board also discussed
whether an separate letter regarding funding should be prepared for the Board of Commissioners for
the Forest Preserve Distrcit.
The Board then congratulated Paul Rzeszutko, Director of Benefits, on his imminent retirement and
thanked him for his service to the Fund.
7. Adjournment
There being no further business before the Board, it was moved by Trustee White and seconded by
Trustee McFadden that the trustees adjourn the meeting.
