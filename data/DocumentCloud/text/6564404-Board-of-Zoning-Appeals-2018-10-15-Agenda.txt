Christina Green, owner, proposes to erect a two story frame accessory garage in a B1 Two Family
Residential District. The owner appeals for relief from the strict application of the following sections
of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances:
1. Section 353.05 which states that an accessory building shall not exceed (15) fifteen feet or the
distance to a main building on an adjoining lot in a Residence District whichever is less; the

JUDICATA: The Board must first determine if the Appellant is requesting an identical or
substantially similar variance for the same premises as in prior appeals to the Cleveland Board of
Zoning Appeals, being Calendar Number 17-29, and 18-74 which were both refused. The board must
determine if this is a “refiling” under Rule XIII of the Rules and Regulations of the Cleveland Board of
Zoning Appeals. The appellant must demonstrate a basis which would prevent the application of res
judicata including: substantially changed circumstances, substantial new relevant evidence which was
not available at the hearing on the prior appeal or that the application of res judicata would create a
manifest injustice.
