Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, presented her report, which included information on the following
subjects: Comparison of Vacancies Filled - FY2013-FY2014; FY2014 Posting Activity; FY2014 Vacancies and
Separations; 2014 Vacancies; and CCHHS Labor Relations. The Committee reviewed and discussed the
information.
With regard to the information on separations, Director Velasquez asked whether Ms. Lopez had a sense of the
reasons for separations. Ms. Lopez responded in the negative. She stated that it is a manual process; however, an
online survey is being developed that will help to get this information and will allow for reports to be generated.
That survey should be ready to be implemented within the next few weeks. Board Chairman Hammock requested
that perhaps three or four major categories relating to reasons for separation could be added to the information
provided in Ms. Lopez’ report1. Ms. Lopez indicated that the data from surveys for the full month of September
should be available to be included in her October report to the Committee.
Ms. Lopez stated that they have received comments from Plaintiff’s counsel for the System’s Employment Plan;
staff are finalizing their review of those comments and will be getting back to the Compliance Administrator’s
Office with a couple of questions. She noted that, as she has said in the past, implementation of that Plan is going
to require more people to be hired to maintain compliance, because there are so many more nuances that the
System will now be held accountable to, and the administration needs to make sure that it is prepared to do so.
