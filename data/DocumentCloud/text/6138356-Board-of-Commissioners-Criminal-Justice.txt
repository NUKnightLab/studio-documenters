WHEREAS, the guests were provided with information on the changes and
improvements that have occurred at the CCJTDC since the arrival of Transitional
Administrator Earl Dunlap in additional to future plans and continuing
development of the facility; and
WHEREAS, this information is valuable in evaluating our compliance with the

of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, we are also under a Federal Consent Decree regarding the Cook
County Jail and are in need of a progress report in determining our compliance

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Board conduct quarterly

County Jail.
*REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE 05/05/09.
Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, stated that Doe v.s.The
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center is pending in United States District Court before Chief
Judge Holderman now who has the case on reassignment from Judge Nordberg. This case
was started in 1999 and was filed by the ACLU as a class action covering all detainees at the
Juvenile Temporary Center. In 2002 there was an original agreement entered into by Cook
County and the plaintiffs that was modified again in November 2005. The 2006 Agreed
Supplemental Order modified Implementation Plan was filed in May 2007. The plaintiffs were
not satisfied with the progress that was being made and moved to ask for the court to take
further action to insure compliance in order to avoid a very protracted trail and to continue to go
forward. The County and the plaintiffs entered into an agreement resulting in a court order
being entered in August 14, 2007 appointing Mr. Earl Dunlap as transitional administrator to
come in and take over the operation of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, in order to put
it in substantial compliance with the prior agreements that had been entered into by the County
– not just partial compliance – to insure all agreements are being honored.
The Illinois State legislature passed a statute that transferred the control of the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center from the Office of the President to the Chief Judge of the Circuit
Court of Cook County. Chief Judge Evans by statute is the employer at the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center. Mr. Dunlap is the agent of the court.
Mr. Driscoll stated 9,000 inmates was the daily population at the jail. There are 9,751 available
beds and the inmates are no longer bunking on the floors. The Cook County Board of
Commissioners has approved the capital improvements, including construction for a new
residential treatment unit and reception diagnostic center. There are custodial and noncustodial release programs being implemented by the Sheriff’s Department, Women’s Justice,
Mom program, boot camp for custodial programs, electronic monitoring, day reporting, female
furlough programs takes inmates out of daily confinement which reduces the number of inmates
at the jail.
Chairman Collins asked are the employees getting training for the technical equipment at the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center.
