Detroit. Please note that Milliken State Park is a State of Michigan Park and we work directly with the park to
obtain special event permits required by the State of Michigan.

Due to it being a State of Michigan Park, in 2017 it was determined by the City of Detroit that we did not have to
obtain permits with the City of Detroit Building and Safety and the Fire Marshall Inspection was waived.

RESOLUTION
BY COUNCIL 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that City of Detroit ("City") through the General
Service Department wishes to acquire twelve, (12) vacant parcels within the City of Detroit,
Michigan; more particularly described in the attached Exhibit A ("Acquisition Parcels") from the
Detroit Land Bank Authority 

WHEREAS, the Building, Safety. Engineering and Environmental Department has reviewed the
environmental conditions of the Acquisition Parcels attached herein as Exhibit and

WHEREAS. in accordance with Chapter 2, Article I, Division 2 of the Detroit City Code: (I) the City
Council ?nds that the Acquisition Parcels have received appropriate environmental inquiry in
accordance with the review referred to in the preceding paragraph; (2) the environmental inquiry has
shown that past use of the Acquisition Parcels for the period investigated has been solely for residential
purposes and that the Acquisition Parcels do not pose an adverse environmental impact, therefore none
of the Acquisition Parcels are considered a facility; and (3) the City Council ?nds and declares that
the preservation of the promotion of the public health, safety; welfare or good outweighs the cost of
the environmental inquiry and therefore waives the requirements that the seller bear the cost of the
environmental inquiry; now therefore be it

RESOLVED, that Detroit City Council hereby approves acquisition of the Acquisition Parcels from
the DLBA for no consideration; and be it further

RESOLVED, that the Director of GSD, or her authorized designee, is authorized to accept and record
a deed to the Acquisition Parcels to the City of Detroit. as well as execute any such documents as may

be necessary or convenient to effect the transfer of the Acquisition Parcels from the DLBA to the City
of Detroit; and be it further

RESOLVED, that the Director of GSD, or his authorized designee is authorized to execute any
required instruments to make and incorporate technical amendments or changes to the quit claim deed
(including but not limited to correction of or con?rmations of legal descriptions, or timing of tender
of possession of particular parcels) in the event that changes are required to correct minor inaccuracies
or are required due to unforeseen circumstances or technical matters that may arise prior to the
conveyance of the Acquisition Parcels to the City. provided that the changes do not materially alter
the substance or terms of the transfer; and be it ?nally

RESOLVED, that the quit claim deed will be considered con?rmed when executed by the Director
of GSD, or his authorized designee, and approved by the Corporation Counsel as to form.

Engineering Division, in conjunction with The General Services Department

requests the permanent closure of Woodward Avenue, from Jefferson Avenue to

Larned Street, for the purpose of continuing the activation of the Spirit Plaza
programming.

   

On June 12, 2017, the City Of Detroit closed the referenced segment of Woodward to
activate the Spirit Plaza for an initial pilot period of 90 days.

On November 21, 2017, City Council originally approved Petition No. 1773, which
provided for extending the temporary closure of the above referenced segment of
Woodward through the spring of 2018, so that the evaluation period could continue
through the fall and winter seasons.

In October of 2018, DPW requested City Council approval to extend the temporary
closure for a period to culminate on November 15, 2019, upon which time a
recommendation was to be brought back to City Council for the Plaza?s optional
additional year extension.

DPW is now requesting, on behalf of the General Services Department, City Council to
vacate as a public right-of?way and convert into a private easement for public utilities of
the full width of the above referenced segment of Woodward to facilitate the established,
ongoing and future pro gramming.

This vacation to easement, if authorized by Your Honorable Body, establishes GSD as
the agency, who is responsible for ensuring that the Plaza is appropriately maintained. In
addition, this vacation will allow for coordinating all outreach efforts to impacted
stakeholders, as well as providing the mechanism for continued planning for events and
space programming. of Detroit?s Recreation Department and Special Events
team to will continue to Operate with the established agreement outlining specific
responsibilities for each agency, thereby ensuring that the Plaza is being programmed in a
manner that maximizes its usage and is consistent with the Vision of it being the
?People?s Plaza?. We will continue to provide the opportunity to employ a more
expansive outreach effort to individuals that encounter the space on a daily basis,
including all employees and regular visitors to the CAYMC. The vacation to easement
will also provide the Opportunity to install semi-permanent structures tO enhance the
quality of pro gramming and the overall experience in the public space.

Honorable City Council:

RE: Spirit Plaza; Petition No. 1773 The Department of Public Works City Engineering
Division, in conjunction with the General Services Department and the Downtown Detroit
Partnership, requests the extension of the temporary closure of Woodward Avenue, from
Jefferson Avenue to Larned Street from May 1, 2018 through November 16, 2018 for the
purpose of continuing the activation and evaluation of the Spirit Plaza.

On June 12, 2017, the City of Detroit closed the referenced Segment of Woodward to activate the
Spirit Plaza for an initial pilot period of 90 days.

On November 21, 2017, City Council originally approved Petition No. 1773, which provided for
extending the temporary closure of the above referenced segment of Woodward through the
spring of 2018, so that the evaluation period could continue through the fall and winter seasons.

DPW is now requesting uncil approval to extend the temporary closure for a period to
culminate on November 16: 2019 upbn which time a recommendation with be brought back to

City Council for the PlazaE?p?otential permanency. I
This extension, if authorized by Your Honorable Body, establishes GSD and DDP as the agencies
who will take responsibility for ensuring that the Plaza is appropriately maintained throughout the
extended evaluation period. In addition, the extension will allow for coordinating all outreach
efforts to impacted stakeholders, as well as providing the mechanism for continued planning for
events and space programming this year, which will include celebrating the 60 year anniversary
of the Spirit of Detroit. DDP will enter into a separate 3-party agreement with the City of
Detroit?s Recreation Department and Special Events team to establish specific responsibilities for
each agency, thereby ensuring that the Plaza is being programmed in a manner that maximizes its
usage and is consistent with the vision Of it being the ?People?s Plaza?. In addition, it will provide
the opportunity to employ a more expansive outreach effort to individuals that encounter the
space on a daily basis, including all employees and regular visitors to the CAYMC. The extension
will also provide the opportunity to continue analyzing the impact to traffic on surrounding streets
as DDP will employ an independent traf?c consulting firm to study impact on traf?c in the
adjacent as well as surrounding streets. Prior to the end of the extended evaluation period, city
agencies (DPW, Planning, GSD, Special Events), along with DDP will summarize to City
Council our findings, which will be utilized in making a determination for the future use of the
public space.

Provisions protecting all utility installations in the right-of-way have been made a part of the
attached resolution.

I am recommending the adoption of the attached resolution.

RE: SPIRIT PLAZA
Dear Honorable City Council:

With regard to the closure of Woodward for the temporary activation of Spirit Plaza, the Police and Fire
Departments have recently been engaged in interdepartmental meetings to go over safety and risk
management for the proposed summer activation. These meetings have occurred on a weekly basis.

On April 2018, Fire and Police Departments were present at the Spirit Plaza interdepartmental
coordination meeting held at the Planning and Development Department. The Fire Department expressed
concern with the fire lane location initially proposed on the southbound portion of Woodward. Similarly,
the Police Department identi?ed areas of concerns regarding barriers on the Larned side of the proposed
plaza. Both concerns were taken into consideration and we were able to find a mutually agreeable solution
that met both the Fire Department?s and the Police Department's concerns. This included a fire lane/public
safety access lane on the northbound side of Woodward closest to the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center.

These interdepartmental meetings have been helpful in identifying the safety concerns and mitigating risks.
We look forward to continuing coordination regarding Spirit Plaza.

The following individuals have been present during the coordination meetings:

Fire Department Shawn F. Battle, Chief of Fire Prevention
Fire Department Mathew Fauls, EMS Assistant Supervisor
Fire Department Eugene V. Biondo, Deputy Fire Chief
Fire Department Sean Larkins, Superintendent of EMS

Police Department Assistant Chief Arnold Williams
Police Department - Captain Octaveious Miles Downtown Captain

Honorable City Council

The Department of Public Works City Engineering Division submits this petition to request the
temporary closure of Woodward Avenue, from efferson Avenue to Larned Street for a period of ?ve

years.

The new ?Spirit of Detroit Plan,? is a vibrant new public space located in front of the Spirit of Detroit
statue. The 20,000 square-foot civic square on W'oodward, between .Iiarned and jefferson, exists to
celebrate Detroit?s diversity and complement recent enhancements to Woodward Avenue, such as the
new esplanade between Earned and Campus Martins.

During the initial trial period, the civic space, as well as adjacent streets in the immediate area, have
been closely monitored to evaluate the overall impact. Similar public spaces have been created in many
cities around the world to improve walkability, increase access to public space, and create new business
development without negatively impacting area traf?c flow.

The project improves both safety and mobility for all users, creating a more direct pedestrian link
between Downtown and the Detroit Riverfront, while reducing delayr times for motorists travelling
on Jefferson Ave, one of the cities? busiest thoroughfares. The project also marks the latest step
towards the City?s goal of establishing smarter, safer mobility for all and improving the city?s economy
by reimagining Detroit?s streets to serve everyone.

This petition is being requested so that ?Spirit of Detroit Plaza? may continue as a public space on
Woodward Avenue between jefferson Avenue and Larned Street.

major impact on the city of Detroit; and

The City of Detroit is developing a new Greenhouse Gas Ordinance designed to

more than ever, the decisions made by the Michigan Public Service Commission
need to more closely align with the technological advancement and cutting edge
environmental policy initiatives found in the local levels of government that will
have a major impact of our environment and that can reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases; and

In addition, the city of Detroit with its high poverty rate has a population Which is
particularly vulnerable to being adversely impacted by the slightest increase in
utilities cost; and

Given these factors, it is paramount that the Governor consider a person for the
position that can advocate for the interest of the residential consumers of energy,
one who understands how the Michigan Public Service Commission?s decisions
may impact the average person. While it is important that this person has an
understanding of the resource needs of the utility companies as well, it is essential
that the person n_ot have ties to utility companies or the organizations that support
them. These ?rms have suf?cient support with their own lobbyists; and
