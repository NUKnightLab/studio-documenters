The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Attorney have approved this item.
District(s): 4, 9, 10 and 16
Summary: In order to have our Aquatic Centers become more profitable and better managed, the
District requested proposals through its online bidding process. The announcement for Aquatic
Management services was posted and advertised on the District’s website in early January and February.
Five proposals were accepted and Swim Chicago Southland is the proposed Management Company.
Swim Chicago Southland, a local company with community ties, has been in business for the last ten (10)
years. They have experience and history with Aquatic Center and pool management as stated in their
proposal with a track record of hiring and training staff. Their management fee was the 2nd lowest but
they had significantly more pool management experience then the lowest bidder; in addition their fee
includes marketing support of District Aquatic Centers and they are offering a unique and exciting array
of new programming at all of the Aquatic Centers.
By having an outside contractor manage the three aquatic centers the District anticipates expanding the
use of the facilities, reducing the District’s subsidy of the Aquatic Center operations with the potential
for increasing revenue for the District. The District will pay the management fee plus expense and all
revenue from admissions, programming and concessions will come back directly to the District. The final
agreement will be subject to review and approval by the District’s Legal Department.
