the amount prescribed under each Article if applicable. Any
survivor's or widow's annuity shall be increased (1) on each
January 1 occurring on or after the commencement of the
annuity if the deceased member died while receiving a
retirement annuity or (2) in other cases, on each January 1
occurring after the first anniversary of the commencement of
the annuity. Each annual increase shall be calculated at 3% or

whichever is less, of the originally granted survivor's
annuity. If the annual unadjusted percentage change in the

employment, the person's retirement annuity or retirement
pension payments shall resume and be recalculated if
recalculation is provided for under the applicable Article of
