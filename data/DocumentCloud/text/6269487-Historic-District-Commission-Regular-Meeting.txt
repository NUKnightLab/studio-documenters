STAFF REPORT 8/14/2019
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6356
ADDRESS: 19563 CANTERBURY
HISTORIC DISTRICT: SHERWOOD FOREST
APPLICANT: BRYANT HARRIS

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
The dwelling located at 19563 Canterbury is two stories in height and was erected ca. 1935. The
resource features buff brick exterior cladding with stone detailing. A wrought iron balcony serves to
shelter the building’s primary entrance. Copper gutters and downspouts are located at the building’s
hipped roof. A two-story, 2 car garage/carriage house is connected to the rear of the house. The
windows on the front elevation are original to the home and include steel casement units with fixed transoms.
These windows are covered by metal exterior storm windows. Fiberglass casement and double-hung
windows (approved by the Commission in 2017) are located at the side and rear elevations of the home.

With the current application the homeowner is seeking the Commission’s approval to install three
new “scalloped” cloth awnings at the home. Specifically, the new awnings shall be located at the
front elevation, over the second story windows. The awning at the central window/doorway will
measure 11’-6”x2’-6”x2’-6”, while the awnings at the two flanking windows will each measure 6’6”x2’-6”x2’-6”. The awnings will be black or brown. Note that the mounting details are currently
not known.

19563 Canterbury, location of proposed new awnings
STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Please see the attached narrative and photos. In these documents, the applicant outlines the location
of perforations in the brick/wall above the middle window at the second story and states that they
indicate that awnings had previously existed at the home. He has also provided photos of two homes

 in his neighborhood that have awnings at the front elevation.
As noted previously, the only remaining historic-age windows are located at the home’s front
elevation. In 2017, the Commission allowed the applicant to replace the then historic-age casement
windows at the side and rear elevations with the condition that those historic-age steel casement units
at the front elevation remain. It is staff’s opinion that the remaining original sash at the front
elevation, the proportion of their openings in the façade, and the stone trim are character defining
features of the home. The proposed new awnings would cover/obscure the upper portion of the trim,
window opening, and window sash. Though removable in nature, it is staff’s opinion that the
proposed awnings would visually alter features and spaces (the windows, window openings, and
trim) that characterize the property. Also, the submitted renderings do not provide a true
representation of the location of the awnings and the manner in which the awning hardware will be
mounted to the facade. Staff did request that the applicant submit mounting details, but they have yet
to receive this information. It was also unclear to staff’ that the proposed awnings conform to the
district’s Elements of Design.
Finally, please see the Technical Brief # 44, entitled “The Use of Awnings on Historic Buildings,
Repair, Replacement and New Design”, https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/44awnings.htm#summary. These publications/technical briefs are authored by the National Park
Service and provide guidance/recommendations for “…methods and approaches for rehabilitating
historic buildings that are consistent with their historic character.” It is noted that this awning
application was discussed amongst HDC staff. While it is this author’s opinion that the proposed
awnings will visually alter features and spaces (the windows, window openings, and trim) that
characterize the property and are therefore not compatible with the building, HDC design staff was
of the opinion that the work does meet the Standards.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1)
Height. The height of the majority of the residential structures full stories to two and one half
(2½) stories tall, and have at least eighteen (18) feet of studding. These standards shall be met
by new single-family residences and by two-family residences which are permitted only on
Seven Mile Road. A few houses of one (1) and one and one-half (12) stories exist. Additions
to existing buildings shall be related to the existing structure. Garages range from one (1) to
two (2) stories.
(2)
Proportion of buildings front facades. The typical front facades of residential buildings in
the Sherwood Forest Historic District are predominantly wider than tall to their eaves.
(3)
Proportion of openings within the facades. Proportion of openings varies greatly according
to the style of the building. Typical openings are taller than wide, but individual windows
are often grouped together to fill a single opening which is wider than tall. Windows are
usually subdivided; buildings designed in English Revival styles frequently display leaded
glass in casement windows and transoms. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
double-hung sash windows are further subdivided by muntins. A variety of arched openings
and bay windows exist throughout the district Modernistic style residential buildings have
openings with a variety of proportional relationships, sometimes extending around the
corners. In general, openings amount to between twenty percent (20%) and thirty-five percent
(35%) of the front facades.
(4)
Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facades. In
examples of other styles, particularly those of English Revival sub-styles, voids are arranged
with more freedom, but usually result in balanced compositions. Windows are arranged by
floor in asymmetrical arrangements in modernistic style houses.
(5)
Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally

 (6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

determined by the lot sizes and setbacks from side lot lines. There is a general regularity in
the widths of subdivision lots from one block to another, with the exception of those in the
Sherwood Forest manor subdivision where some lot sizes are larger and single houses
sometimes occupy more than one lot. Generally, all residences or part thereof, including
cornices, balconies, pergolas or porches, are not permitted nearer than five (5) feet to the side
lot line.
Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. Entrance and porch types relate to the style of
the building. Entrances and porches on the English revival buildings exhibit freedom of
placement and orientation, while on buildings of classical inspiration they are centered on the
front facade. Some houses have entrances that recede while others have porches, steps and/or
entrances that project. A common entry arrangement on vernacular English Revival houses
is that of a slightly projecting, steeply gabled vestibule or gabled wall punctured with an
arched opening. Side and rear secondary entrances and porches and enclosed sunrooms are
common. A rhythm of entrances and porches is not discerned due to the variety of house
designs and the winding street plan.
Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with pressed, wire cut or glazed
brick, often combined with wood, stone and/or stucco. Stone trim is common, and wood is
almost universally used for window frames, half-timbering and other functional trim.
Windows are commonly either of the metal casement or wooden sash variety. Glass block
exists as an original material in some window openings of modern buildings. Original metal
balconets, balustrades and light fixtures exist on some properties. Roofs on the majority of
the buildings in the Sherwood Forest historic district are either slate or slate-like asphalt
shingles.
Relationship of textures. The major textural relationship is that of brick laid in mortar, often
juxtaposed with wood or smooth or rough-faced stucco and/or stone elements and trim.
Textured brick and brick laid in patterns creates considerable interest, as does half-timbering,
leaded and subdivided windows, and wood shingled or horizontal sided elements. Slate roofs
have particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles generally have little textural
interest, even in those types which purport to imitate natural materials. Garages correspond
in materials to the main residential dwelling.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors -- such as red, yellow, brown, or buff -predominate in wall surfaces. When brick is painted, it is in white or shades of cream. Natural
stone colors also predominate; where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its natural
state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural slate colors, and asphalt shingles
are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint colors often relate to style. The
buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of classical styles, generally
have woodwork painted the white or cream range. English Revival style buildings generally
have painted wood trim and window frames of dark brown, gray, buff or shades of cream,
depending on the main body color. Half timbering is most frequently stained or painted dark
brown. Stained glass, where it exists as decoration visible on the front facade, contributes to
the artistic interest of the building. The original colors of any building, as determined by
professional analysis, are always acceptable for a house, and may provide guidance for similar
houses. Colors used on garages should relate to the colors of the main dwelling.
Relationship of architectural details. The architectural elements and details of each structure
generally relate to its style. Residential buildings derived from characteristic elements and
details displayed on vernacular English revival-influenced buildings include arched windows
and door openings, steeply pitched gables, towers, and sometimes half-timbering. Tall,
clustered chimney stacks and decorative chimney pots are features of the district. Classical
styles display modest detail, mostly in wood. Porches, shutters, window frames, cornices,
and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Modern style buildings
are generally characterized by smooth, unadorned wall surfaces, horizontal bands of

 (11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

windows, and curved corners. A few cape cod style buildings and ranches are located in the
northeastern section of the Sherwood Forest Manor subdivision. In general, the district is
rich in early to mid-twentieth century architectural styles. Garages correspond in architecture
to the main residential dwelling.
Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist, relating to the style of the
buildings. Common on English Revival buildings are steeply sloped pitched or hipped roofs
with complex arrangements of secondary roof shapes, including steeply sloped gables,
clipped gables, and shed roofs. These roofs are commonly interrupted by gabled, shed and
multi-sided dormers and substantial chimneys which are sometimes clustered. Classically
inspired buildings display pitched or hipped roofs with less slope, with or without dormers.
Roofs of houses built later in the period of development of the district, such as those of
modern inspiration, tend to have significantly lower slopes, with the exception of cape cod
style houses in the northeastern section of the district which display steeply pitched roofs with
dormers. Flat roofs are not typical except on porches, sunrooms, and other small extensions
of a primary building with a pitched roof; flat roofs as the main roof of a primary building
shall not be permitted.
Walls of continuity. Where common setbacks of houses on relatively straight stretches of
residential streets exist, strong walls of continuity are created. This is augmented by tall,
fluted light standards and mature trees on the tree lawns. Where streets curve and the
procession of houses is less visible, landscape features in the public right-of-way create a
sense of continuity.
Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatments. The typical treatment
of individual properties is a that of a dwelling erected on a grade of approximately fifteen
(15) to twenty (20) inches above the inner grade line of the public sidewalk. The front lawn
area is generally covered with grass turf, subdivided by a straight or curving concrete, stone
or brick walk leading to the front entrance and a single width side driveway leading to a
garage, which is most often located at the rear of the lot but sometimes attached to the rear,
side or, less frequently, the front of the main dwelling. On corner lots, garages are located
on the side streets and the width of the driveway corresponds to the width of the garage. A
single storage building, including garden and tool sheds, shall be permitted provided that it is
placed at the rear of the property, is harmonious in color and design to the contiguous
property, does not exceed six (6) feet by ten (10) feet in length and width, and six (6) feet in
height. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous nature and characteristic of the period
between 1920 and 1960, are present virtually without exception. Large trees of many
varieties shield some houses from view. There is variety in the landscape treatment of
individual properties. Generally, boundary lines between lots forward of the building line are
not marked with fences of any kind, but may have hedges no greater than two (2) feet in
height. Hedges and fences of up to four (4) feet in height generally extend along boundary
lines beyond the building line. On lots abutting the alley behind Warrington Drive and
Livernois Avenue, a tight board fence or masonry wall of a uniform height of five (5) feet
must be constructed on rear lot lines. The placement of trees on the tree lawn between the
concrete public sidewalk and masonry curb varies from block to block or street to street.
Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area and period. If American elm is planted,
it should be disease resistant. Original street lighting throughout the district is of the tall
fluted standard with crane neck pendant variety.
Relationship of open space to structures. The Sherwood Forest historic district has, as its
main open space, the triangularly shaped Sherwood Forest Park, bounded by Warrington
Drive, Saint Martins Road and Canterbury Road. That park, as well as other triangular lots
created between the intersection of winding streets, are planted with grass and trees. All
houses have ample rear yards as well as front yards. Where vacant lots exist between
residences, their landscaping tends to be continuous with the adjacent lots or forested with

 (15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

mature trees.
Scale of facades and facade elements. The Sherwood Forest Historic District comprises a
residential neighborhood of moderate to large scaled dwellings. Elements and details within
are appropriately scaled, having been determined by the style, size and complexity of the
individual buildings. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins and casement windows
are leaded, affecting the apparent scale of the windows within the facades.
Directional expression of front elevations. The houses in the Sherwood Forest Historic
District are horizontal in directional expression. Large architectural elements within facades
are frequently vertical in directional
Expression, such as multi-storied projecting gabled sections.
Rhythm of building setbacks. Front yard setbacks are generally consistent on each residential
street in the Sherwood Forest Historic District, although porch, entrance and window
projections and irregular massing result in the appearance of variety. Where lots are
combined or irregularly shaped at corners, the rhythm is sometimes irregular.
Relationship of lot coverages. The lot coverage for the single- and two-family residences
ranges generally from twenty-five percent (25%) to thirty-five percent (35%), including the
either the freestanding or attached garage. Where lots are combined, the percentage of lot
coverage may be less.
Degree of complexity within the facades. The degree of complexity has been determined by
what is typical and appropriate for a given style. Overall, there is a higher degree of
complexity in the English Revival style buildings, where their facades are frequently
complicated by gables, bays, irregularly placed openings and entrances, and irregular
massing, than those of other styles. The facades of classically inspired buildings and
modernistic buildings are straightforward in their arrangement of elements and details.
Orientation, vistas, overviews. The orientation of buildings is largely determined by the
winding streets created by the subdivision plans. All but a few buildings in the district are
oriented towards the street; buildings situated on corner lots sometimes face the side street or,
when the corner lot is curved, the intersection of the streets. The primary vistas are created
by the winding streets. Sherwood Forest Manor subdivision has a different character because
of its later development and the elliptical shape of its plan. While the streets through
Sherwood Forest extend into the green acres subdivision on the north, they do not extend into
the palmer woods subdivision on the east.
Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Front facades of buildings range from completely
symmetrical to asymmetrical but balanced compositions. English revival style buildings are
irregular in layout and asymmetrical in appearance. The classically inspired buildings are
generally symmetrical; the modernistic buildings are not symmetrical but result in highly
ordered compositions.
General environmental character. The Sherwood Forest historic district is a fully-developed
residential area of well-maintained, substantial single-family residences of the second quarter
of the twentieth century complemented with fine examples of compatible houses from the
1950s and 1960s. On seven mile road, its southern boundary, are several duplexes; the east
side of Livernois Avenue, outside the district=s boundaries to the west, is an intact
commercial thoroughfare of 1940's vintage. With the residential subdivisions of palmer
woods to the east and green acres to north, Sherwood Forest is a part of a solid, wellmaintained and handsome urban residential community.

RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it the true location and mounting details of the awnings are unclear to staff. Staff
therefore cannot proffer a recommendation for the project at this time. Staff will request that the
applicant provide the missing information to the Commission for review at the 8/14/2019 meeting.

Dear Historic District

I am requesting permission to install Awnings on the upper part of my property to prevent ice
built up in the winter while preserving the historic: character of the neighborhood. have
included a picture of the front, side and rear of property showing that awnings where on the
property. before

The previous owners removed the awning and never replaced them. I have also included two
photo's of properties in Sherwood Forest with awnings. Attached is the brand of material
and a photo of the cloth along with a estimate that I received from a Awning company.

i am asking the board to please approve the re-instaliation of my awning so that I can
complete this project this summer. Also, I did see where you can remove cloth awnings on
existing frames without approval, but I don't have the frames up just the attachments.

Thanking you in advance for your consideration in this matter.

Brya Harris
