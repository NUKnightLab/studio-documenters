INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT
to the
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
Most of you know that I usually start my remarks by recognizing people. Today is no exception. I always
make a point to tell young people the importance of gratitude. In life, there is very little that can be
accomplished without collaboration and cooperation. Remember all the people in your life who helped
push you, helped shape your thinking, or are just in your corner. I’m grateful to have so many of those
people here today. I have people that I have known for decades who still offer much needed advice,
counsel, opinions. Some of them are here today. And, while I may not always agree with all of them – I
always appreciate their support.
I also see many of those I’m lucky enough to count as part of our County team and those who have
stepped up to lend their time and expertise in advisory roles. And I want thank you all. It’s only because
of you that I’m up here today. I often joke that I get all the credit but others do all the work. You have
worked long and hard for me to able to stand up here today.
Four years ago, with a substantial budget deficit, a lack of accountability, an unstable health system, an
overcrowded jail; with this multitude of unmet challenges and with our residents’ trust waning, I told you
about my long, tough fight to get here and the potential I saw for Cook County.

December 1, 2014

I laid out a vision based on four key principles: fiscal responsibility, innovative leadership, transparency
and accountability and improved services. It was on this foundation that we set ambitious goals, measured
our successes and built an infrastructure for the future.
And look what we have accomplished.
We have demanded a responsible, transparent budgeting process. And, as a result, we have
overwhelmingly passed five budgets, solving for over $1.4 billion and cutting over $465 million in
expenditures.
We implemented the first County-wide performance management initiative, working with our senior
leadership to set tough, County-wide goals by which we would hold ourselves accountable. As a result,
we have created a culture of data-driven decision-making that has allowed us to:
Reduce wait times in the emergency room
Crack down on tax scofflaws
Achieve provisional accreditation for the medical examiner’s office
Streamline the County’s fleet of vehicles
And, reduce employee absenteeism
These are just a few the initiatives that have derived from or been supported by performance
management. But the foundation we have laid for a culture of data-driven decision-making is more
significant than any one particular initiative. We have pushed past the idea that fiscal responsibility must
be confined to a budget document; instead, it’s a way to establish strategies for transforming the way
government works.
And it is because of these efforts, that, even in tough economic times, we make continued investments in
our core mission.
We are laying the foundation for a public health system that is responsible to both patients and
taxpayers. It’s no secret how we did this. Since securing a federal waiver under the Affordable Care Act
to early enroll eligible Medicaid patients in October 2012, we have enrolled more than 92,000 members
and reduced the allocation from County taxpayers to less than half in four years, saving taxpayers over
$200 million.
We are shaping a criminal justice system that is more efficient and more responsive to individual
circumstances. For years, the daily jail population hovered at roughly 10,000; today it is 8,500. For the
last 8 months, it was been down 10% year over year.

And if that wasn’t enough, we expanded the County’s agenda and sought out the expertise, vision and
strategy to focus on Cook County’s role in economic development, both locally and regionally.
We have made incredible progress rebuilding faith in Cook County government. The foundation of our
government is strong.
I know some of you thought this day would never come – but we have moved beyond our four tenets.
They are not gone; in fact, they are woven into the accomplishments we have achieved and the culture we
have shaped. They are why we push ourselves to set new metrics for success. As my Chief Performance
Officer, Andrew Schwarm, would tell you, a metric is only good if it is challenging but achievable.
So now, on the first day of my second term, I lay out our new guiding principles.
Innovate. Collaborate. Elevate.
The goal here isn’t about coming up with a catchy slogan or an eye-catching visual. This is about
recognizing how Cook County can and should conduct itself. It acknowledges what we’ve done and what
we aim to do.
I had a vision for Cook County. I knew I that I would work hard for our employees and for our residents.
But I also knew that I couldn’t do this alone. Innovation and collaboration have to go hand in hand. I
started my 5 remarks by saying that little in life can be accomplished without collaboration and
cooperation. It’s even more true in government.
It takes a lot of people to make a vision a reality. The policy and transition teams that helped prepare me
for office. The staff oversee and carry out our daily responsibilities; the advisory councils lend guidance
and expertise and the Civic Consulting Alliance continues to help us shape and realize our long-term
goals.
And, now, we are in a position to broaden our goals, expand our agenda and raise our expectations.
Over the last four years, I’ve spent a lot of time talking about the challenges we faced coming into office.
This was not to lower the bar but to explain our efforts. Without a doubt, much of work has been aimed at
rebuilding and repairing.
But with strong ideas and a talented team, we have laid a foundation for a strong, effective government
that is responsible and responsive to its residents. And now the comparisons being made are not to
previous administrations but to best practices regionally, nationally and internationally.
Our finance team has received national recognition for their budget process and presentation, tax
enforcement and compliance and financial reporting. It is not limited to finance. From environmental
control to homeland security, our senior team is doing work that is not only being recognized; it’s being
used as a model by other units of government. In four short years, we are meeting, exceeding and even
establishing best practices because of the strength of our ideas and our commitment to working
collaboratively in order to realize them.

Nowhere is this more evident than in our approach to economic development.
Historically, Cook County hasn’t been at the table during the discussions and decisions concerning our
economy. In fact, we weren’t even in the room.
We had tools at our disposal, but no strategy to guide the use of those tools.
During the last four years we have worked to insure that our operations were efficient, our decisions
coordinated and our actions targeted. We implemented new financial tools and incentives to facilitate new
construction, rehabilitation and the expansion of businesses. We coordinated, targeted and proactively
applied for new federal resources and leveraged these funds, alongside private funds, to make significant
impacts in the communities we serve.
We also knew that while Cook County had a role to play locally, it had a bigger role to play regionally.
It’s no secret that Cook County is vital to the economic prosperity of our region. We are located at the
heart of that region, comprising more than half of its population, jobs, and businesses.
But in order to make any meaningful impact, we have to be as informed as possible as to the state of our
regional economy and, more specifically, what the County’s role can and should be.
We have sought the necessary expertise, appointing a Council of Economic Advisors, to help shape our
regional strategy. Partnering for Prosperity, it’s 2013 report, outlined not only key strategies Cook
County, but the strengths of our region as well.
Effective economic growth plans have to be built on existing strengths; areas where regions have a
competitive advantage. So, we went to work identifying our key clusters. The first major cluster we
identified was metal manufacturing. Earlier this year, we formed the Chicago Metro Metal Consortium,
composed of seven counties, the City of Chicago, and more than 20 organizations. Collectively, we
applied for and were awarded an Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP)
designation by the federal government. Now, we are eligible for $1.3 billion in future federal funding as
well as critical support from federal agencies, to build a sustainable metal manufacturing hub in the
Midwest.
We will continue to search for those clusters we can support and grow into nationally competitive centers
of expertise.
And yet the strength of our ideas means little without meaningful collaboration.
In my conversations with my advisors, with business leaders, elected officials and residents, I continue to
hear about the same frustration over competition rather than cooperation among the different governments
within the region.
I knew that to compete on a global scale, we had to look at the region as a whole. I also knew that regions
that work together, perform better. This would mean finding new ways to partner with other governments
and civic institutions to align our efforts.

December 1, 2014

So, I convened a meeting of with the chief executives and economic development leadership of the seven
counties of northeastern Illinois and the City of Chicago to explore opportunities for regional
collaboration to further the economic growth of the region.
As a group we are working on two new initiatives: streamlining truck permitting and increasing exports in
the region. Both efforts are underway.
We launched the Metro Chicago Export pilot program this fall. Already, JPMorganChase, the MacArthur
Foundation, and Chicago have joined us as partners in this effort and have provided substantial funding.
In the next few months, an Executive Director will be appointed to begin working directly with local
businesses looking to expand their international sales.
This region’s future is brighter because we have begun to approach economic development from a
regional perspective.
It is through these efforts that we have not only elevated the profile of our region but the role of Cook
County within it.
Moving forward, we are committed to building partnerships to drive our region’s growth. I firmly believe
we can play a role in ending the competitive, zero-sum game that occurs between municipalities and
between counties. And, in turn, we can begin to unify our region, drive job growth, mobilize support for
key industry sectors, and create a brighter, more sustainable future for our children and grandchildren.
And while our efforts around economic development will continue to grow, we will never lose sight of
our core mission. The same determination to innovate, collaborate and elevate, will drive our core mission
as well.
The Cook County Health and Hospital System will always provide quality health care for the uninsured
and underinsured. We are not abandoning that mission. We are expanding it. We believe, thanks to the
Affordable Care Act, that we have secured long-term financial sustainability for our system. Much of the
last four years was focused on enrolling patients into CountyCare. Now, for the first time in its history,
the Cook County Health and Hospital System has more insured patients than uninsured ones. The next
four years will be about retaining and expanding our patient population.
We will no longer be primarily a health care system of last resort for those most vulnerable, but a provider
of choice for all residents. We will make history by reforming our health care system and we will do it by
building on what already characterizes our system: top notch health care professionals, community-based
care, internationally-recognized research and unmatched compassion.
In the public safety arena, we know that many of people going into the jail or in contact with the criminal
justice system would be better served with community-based solutions, including mental health services,
substance abuse treatment, and job training. Our efforts have shown that we can release the majority of
people accused of non-violent crimes who appear in bond court, and we can release them without
impacting public safety.

December 1, 2014

For the last four years, I’ve talked about the need to reduce the reliance on pre-trial detention. I have tried
to raise awareness internally and externally. It has brought much needed attention; brought new partners
to the table and new initiatives into place.
What we need now is real, long-term, systemic changes that reduce the reliance on pre-trial detention.
The challenge is to ensure that these efforts aren’t the result of the actions of a few; and instead, are the
product of a system that ensures consistent, high-quality judicial decision-making supported by the proper
risk assessment. That is why we are undertaking the implementation of a model bond court, which
deploys a data-driven risk tool that identifies appropriate defendants to release, who are then given clearly
defined conditions and assigned appropriate levels of supervision.
We need to collect all the relevant information about anyone who is at risk of being detained. We need to
use a good risk assessment instrument and we need to track results so we can continuously improve our
performance. We have to make sure that community based options are always available and that at every
stage, starting a the street level, we consider diverting an individual from the criminal justice system, if
they are not a risk to public safety.
While this is better for the countless individuals, families and communities impacted by our jail, it is not
how we will actually free up resources. The majority of our resources are not addressing violent crimes or
identifying community-level interventions. Instead, we spent over $325 million annually just to support a
jail that detains thousands of largely poor, black men waiting for trial; the majority of whom are charged
with non-violent offenses. The only way to free up resources, is to reduce staffing levels, overtime and
building costs as we reduce the population of our jail. If we can bring down the jail population, we can in
turn, bring down the costs of the jail. I want every community in this county to be safe, and we can only
do that by freeing up resources that are otherwise tied up in detaining so many accused of non-violent
offenses. Just last week, the Board of Commissioners approved a measure to require quarterly reports
from all the public safety stakeholders to track progress on the initiatives underway to reduce the jail
population and monitor costs associated with the current jail population.
The last four years have been characterized by long hours, tough decisions and hard work. With our
shared belief in Cook County, we are moving towards a stronger government; one rooted in responsibility
and committed to serving our communities.
Today, is not only about recognizing how far we’ve come but where we are going. I hope everyone
enjoys their holiday – because there is a lot of work ahead. We are going into a new year and a new term,
with new expectations for what Cook County can and should do. So I will end, as I began – with thanks.
Thanks to all who have come together to help us face the challenges, encourage innovative ideas, and
push our county forward.
Thank you.
