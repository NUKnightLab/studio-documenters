regarding Wayne County vehicles should be clarified.
Mr. Anthony Guerriero stated that he believes that

vehicle’s use that should be recorded.

request would be to say that the state statute and the
ordinance prohibiting political use of a vehicle are
unconstitutional as applied to the office of Sheriff; that
the legislature has the constitutional right to prescribe
the duties of the Sheriff; that there is no conflict
between the statute and ordinance and the duties of
a sheriff, and that neither the statute nor ordinance
should be construed as inapplicable to the Wayne
County Sheriff.
