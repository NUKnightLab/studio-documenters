PROPOSED GRANT AWARD
Department: Justice Advisory Council
Grantee: Justice Advisory Council
Grantor: Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Request: Requesting approval to accept grant award
Purpose: This grant award will fund the Access to Community-based Treatment (ACT) program. The Access to
Community-Based Treatment (ACT) Court is a problem-solving court that seeks to divert individuals with
behavioral health needs from prison and jail into community- based services.
Grant Amount: $786,819.00
Grant Period: 10/1/13 to 6/30/14
Fiscal Impact: None
Accounts: N/A
Concurrences:
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook County,

Summary: The ACT Court will divert certain eligible high-risk offenders with behavioral health needs from
prison and jail into community-based services. Eligible participants must be nonviolent offenders who would
otherwise be facing a prison sentence as a result of new arrests for certain felony possession of controlled
substance offenses or retail theft offenses. Offenders who volunteer for the program will be required to complete
18 months of intensive court-supervised, community-based treatment and community services. It is anticipated
that more than 200 offenders will participate in the program in its first year of operation. Program funds will be
used for staff and fringe benefits, professional recovery support services, travel, training, and reimbursement of
Cook County’s indirect program costs. No cash match is required.
The ACT Court would join the court’s current highly successful Adult Redeploy Illinois court now operating in
Municipal District One (Chicago). That court is also funded by ICJIA grants and provides services to adult
probationers with new noncompliant behaviors.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONCEAL CARRY ACT IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, the Illinois General Assembly was required by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to enact a conceal
carry law and did so passing the Firearm Concealed Carry Act, giving the Illinois State Police 180 days to
implement a license system, and
WHEREAS, under the Act, local law enforcement agencies may object to an application if their objection is
based upon a reasonable suspicion that the applicant is a danger to him/herself or others, or a threat to public
safety, and
WHEREAS, the license process is based on an already overburdened Firearm Owner Identification Card
system; and
WHEREAS, there are already 300,000 FOID card holders in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, in Cook County alone, nearly 4000 revoked FOID card holders still maintain their FOID card and
firearms compelling the Cook County Sheriff’s Office to dedicate a gun team to recovering FOID cards from
revoked possessors to protect the safety and welfare of the citizens of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the conceal carry license process as currently developed is likely to overburden local law
enforcement agencies and exacerbate an already devastating gun violence problem in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office seeks to educate the Cook County Board of Commissioners on
the financial and operational burden of the Act and establish a uniform procedure for identifying and objecting
to unsuitable concealed carry license applicants; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County
hereby convene a meeting of the Cook County Board’s Law Enforcement Committee to consider the impact of
the Act on law enforcement agencies throughout Cook County.

Summary: It is the intention of the City of Chicago Heights to convey all parcels to the Third Party Requestor,
Wilkins & Son, LLC. Wilkins & Son, LLC is currently leasing the land from the current owners and minimal
work is being conducted within the actual structure. Building upon recent growth and expansion, Wilkins &
Son has had a successful and longstanding presence in Chicago Heights resulting in growth and job expansion
for the community. As background, Wilkins & Son, including Wilkins Rebuilders/Brookfield Iron & Metal, is a
metal scrapping company that dismantles all types of machinery and farms out parts to be reused or
remanufactured. Also, Wilkins has had two property expansions in the last two years, adding nearly 50 jobs.
This new land opportunity would allow operations to continue to expand with the creation of a trailer dismantling
center in addition to the opening of a rail facility that would utilize the onsite rail spur to transport scrap. With this
added mode of transportation Wilkins also could trans-load scrap for two publicly traded companies.
A direct
result of this new expansion will be an increase of job opportunities in Chicago Heights. The redevelopment of
the parcels will return the property to a viable use beneficial to the municipality. The redevelopment will also
return the properties to a tax producing status, thereby generating economic development for the municipality and
other taxing bodies.
The City of Chicago Heights will accept an assignment of all Tax Certificate of Purchase from Cook County and
will undertake such legal proceedings and tax search services as necessary to obtain a tax deed and will bear all
legal and other costs associated with the acquisition of the parcels. Also, the City of Chicago Heights agrees to
submit, to the Cook County Bureau of Economic Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of each
parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever occurs last, as required by the Cook County
No Cash Bid Ordinance. Finally, the City of Chicago Heights, if needed, will file for tax exempt status on all
parcels obtained and will retain such status until such time as the parcel is conveyed.

order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was the

but this project has been delayed and will likely be implemented in 2014 with the 2014 budget appropriation.
If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
