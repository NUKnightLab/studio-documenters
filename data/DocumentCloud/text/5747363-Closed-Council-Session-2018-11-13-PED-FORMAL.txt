HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Request of Intersection Consulting Group on behalf of 262 Mack, Mack Investments I,
LLC to review site plans and elevations for a Flamed Development (PD) zoning
classi?cation within Article XVII, District Map No. 4, of the 1984 Detroit City Code,
Chapter 61, Zoning, to erect two residential carriage-home apartment units above an
existing garage at property commonly referred to as 262 Mack Avenue.
(RECOMMEND APPROVAL)

NATURE OF REQUEST

In 2016 Your Honorable Body voted to approve the request of Intersection Consulting Group on
behalf of Mack Investments 1, LLC. The original request was for site plan review (SPR) for site
plans and elevations for a proposed development on land that is currently zoned PD and is
located within the Brush Park Historic District. The subject site is located on the south side of
Mack Avenue between Brush St. and John R. The original plan called for the construction of a
nine (9) unit multi-family dwelling with a single-story garage to support the new units. 
revised proposed multi-family dwelling is planned to be three (3) stories in height. The ?oor plan
proposes three (3) units to be approximately 1,058 square feet in area each and the remaining (6)
six units are to be 1,279 sq. ft. each. (see attached original plans).

PROPOSAL

Since the original proposal was approved by City Council via resolution in March of 2017, the
petitioner has since come back with a supplementary request. The proposal that is before you for
consideration at this time include the addition of two (2) carriage-home style apartments to be
erected above an existing garage. According to discussions with the petitioner and review of past
Buildings Safety Engineering and Environmental Department records, the existing garage began
construction somewhere around the period of the 2007-2009 housing crash which, was the result
of the housing bubble that affected many developers in Detroit. Seemingly, due to the economic
conditions of that period, the original developer never completed the full plans for the garage.
Since then the property has been transferred to 262 Mack, Mack Investments I, LLC. The current
developer would like to complete the construction of the structure by adding these units to what
was previously approved.

The revised proposal calls for two new units, each 822 sq. ft. I area, to go above the two (2) car
garage. The two units would be inclusive of a bedroom with closet space, bathroom, living room,
kitchen, nook, and laundry room. The plans also call for balconies on the northern (front)

elevation, totaling four (4) in all; one (1) accessible from the bedroom and one (1) from the
living room spaces.

ANALYSIS

Zoning and Development Plan Provisions

The 3rd Modi?ed Brush Park Development Plan provides the underlying zoning for the PD
district. The Plan designates the subject land for institutional and commercial uses. Table B-2 of
the development plan lists multi-family dwellings as a permitted secondary use on the subject
property making it consistent with current provisions.

Parking

According to 61-14-24 of the Zoning Ordinance, parking requirements for a multiple-family
dwelling are 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit and 0.75 per dwelling unit if located within 0.25 miles
of a bus rapid transit, street car/trolley or light rail line. This development would qualify for the
reduction in parking requirements because of its proximity to the coming rail line located on
Woodward.

As the apartment unit count raises by the additional two (2) carriage home units that are being
proposed, it brings the total number of units on the site (inclusive of the original nine (9)
approved units) to a total of 1 1 units. According to the current zoning provisions, the totality of
the development including the previously approved nine (9) units, requires a total of 8.25 parking
spaces. The parking plan provides the appropriate amount of spaces required.

Design
The design of the development must be in accordance with the PD district design criteria listed in
Section 61-11-15 of the Zoning Ordinance.

When criterion 1) speaks to the compatibility of the development with existing development, it
can be said that this project is in alignment with the trend of Brush Park to be inclusive of
carriage homes. Another development known as Brush Park Village North, which came before
this Honorable Body for approval in 2017 also proposed and was approved for carriage homes.

As development has picked up in the City, developers have continuously inquired about the
possibility of new construction carriage homes, as many that exist today are the remnant of
historic neighborhoods and were in most cases, likely grandfathered in, post zoning regulations
or are subject of variance or special approval. Carriage-homes are being revisited by the City as a
typology merits being allowed on a broader basis. Carriage homes allow for developments to be
more ?nancially feasible for developers as well as tenants. They usually help to create
opportunities for lower income individuals to participate in more af?uent areas while also
increasing the density of a neighborhood, also increasing vibrancy and diversity.

Criterion points to parking and loading, questioning whether it is adequate for what is being
proposed. In this case, the parking will be accessed from the rear of the building as vehicles are
planned to use the public alley to reach the garage parking for the units. This off?street parking
and loading is appropriate and typical for a Brush Park development.

In response to criterion which addresses accessibility, the Commission points to the fact that
the development will incorporate a semi-circular driveway creating a more convenient
ingress/egress for residents of the building. Using the alley access is typical for the land uses

located on the in Brush Park. The City?s Fire Marshall conducted an initial review of the
con?guration of the plans and was satis?ed.

Master Plan Consistency

The Planning and Development Department originally submitted a determination letter
con?rming the compatibility of the proposal with the City?s Master Plan of Policies. CPC has
received no negative comments by PDD to differ ?'om the original Master Plan determination.

COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
The developer is in consultation with the Brush Park CDC in regards to a revised letter of
support for the project. CPC has been waiting for this last

RECOMMENDATION
At its regular meeting of February 2018, the City Flaming Commission voted to approve this
proposal with the following conditions:

1. That the developer work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize disruption to
the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise; and

2. That ?nal site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the
developer to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to
submitting applications for applicable permits.

Re: Amended and Restated Joe Louis Arena Brownfield Redevelopment Plan
Dear Honorable Council Members:

The enclosed Amended and Restated Brown?eld Plan for the Joe Louis Arena Redevelopment Project
(the ?Plan?) (Exhibit A), was submitted by the Detroit Brown?eld Redevelopment Authority Board (the
to the Community Advisory Committee (the The Plan was considered and reviewed
by the CAC at its October 24, 2018 meeting and a public hearing was held by the DBRA on November
5, 2018 to solicit public comments. The Committee's communication to the City Council and the
DBRA, dated October 24, 2018 (Exhibit B), recommending approval of the Plan, including the minutes
of the public hearing held by the DBRA, are enclosed for the City Council's consideration.

On November 7, 2018, the DBRA adopted a resolution (Exhibit C) approving the Plan and authorizing
the submission of a copy of its resolution and the Plan to the City Clerk, together with a request that
the Detroit City Council call a public hearing concerning the Plan and to take all other actions to
approve the Plan in accordance with Act 381.

The Plan is now presented to the City Council for approval. The Detroit City Council will, after
publication of the notices, hold a public hearing on the Plan. After the public hearing, the City Council
shall determine whether the Plan constitutes a public purpose and, if so, may approve or reject the
Plan or approve it with modi?cations.

A Plan Amendment is being requested due to increased Eligible Activities that have recently been
discovered by environmental consultants working on behalf of the City of Detroit. Abatement and
Demolition activities have increased from $3.6 million the original Plan to approximately $8.8
million in the Plan Amendment. Engineering Services: Demo Design has increased from
$790,286 to $840,286. New Eligible Costs of Due Care Activities, Response Activities and
interest totaling approximately $2.7 million are new Eligible Cost. In total, the Eligible Costs have
increased from $5,561,009 to $14,363,147.

Proiect Introduction

In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the ?Little Caesars
Arena", an agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish the JLA once the Little
Caesars Arena was completed and ready for use. As of the date of this Plan, the Little Caesars

Honorable City Council
November 8, 2018
2

Arena has been completed and the Detroit Red Wings have vacated the JLA and relocated to the
Little Caesars Arena.

The primary purpose of this Plan Amendment is to increase the amount of tax increment revenues
that can be captured for reimbursement of eligible activities. This increase is a result of additional
information that was subsequently discovered following the original Brownfield Plan approval. The
capture of tax increment revenues pursuant to the Plan Amendment is to reimburse for eligible
activities in connection with the demolition of the JLA and to prepare the Property for a future
mixed-use development, which may include residential, commercial, and/or retail space. For the
purposes of this Plan, the use of the term ?Developer" shall refer to the City of Detroit. The City of
Detroit is the owner of Joe Louis Arena and the Detroit Building Authority will oversee demolition.

Total reimbursement amount for the demolition and related eligible activities under this Plan
is $14,363,147.

Property Subject to the Plan

The eligible property (the ?Property") consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington
Boulevard. The common address of the JLA is also known as ?800 Civic Center Drive." 25

I. INTRODUCTION

 

In order to promote the revitalization of environmentally distressed and blighted
areas within the boundaries of the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City?), the City
has established the City of Detroit Brownfield RedeveIOpment Authority (the
pursuant to Michigan Public Act 381 of 1996, as amended (?Act 381?).

The primary purpose of this Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan (?Plan") is to
promote the redevelopment of and private investment in certain ?brownfield"
properties within the City. Inclusion of property within this Plan will facilitate
financing of environmental response and other eligible activities at eligible
properties, and will also provide tax incentives to eligible taxpayers willing to invest
in revitalization of eligible sites, commonly referred to as ?brownfields.? By
facilitating redevelopment of brownfield properties, this Plan is intended to promote
economic growth for the benefit of the residents of the City and all taxing units
located within and benefited by the DBRA.

This Plan is intended to apply to the eligible property identified in this Plan and, if
tax increment revenues are proposed to be captured from that eligible property, to
identify and authorize the eligible activities to be funded by such tax increment
revenues.

This Plan is intended to be a living document, which may be modified or amended
in accordance with the requirements of Act 381, as necessary to achieve the
purposes of Act 381. The identification or designation of a developer or proposed
use for the eligible property shall not necessitate an amendment to this Plan, affect
the application of this Plan to the eligible property, or impair the rights available to
the DBRA under this Plan. The applicable sections of Act 381 are noted throughout
the Plan for reference purposes.

This Plan describes the project to be completed (see Attachment C) and contains
all the information required by Section 13(2) of Act 381.

For the purposes ofthis Plan, the use of the term ?Developer? shall refer to the City
of Detroit. The City of Detroit is the owner of the Property and will oversee
demolition of the JLA. It is anticipated that the City of Detroit will utilize financing
from the Michigan Strategic Fund (MSF Resolution 2014-038) to complete the
Project (as defined below).

In connection with the development of the property commonly known as the ?Little
Caesars Arena?, an agreement was reached by the applicable parties to demolish
the JLA once the Little Caesars Arena was completed and ready for use. As of the
date of this Plan, the Little Caesars Arena has been completed and the Detroit Red
Wings have vacated the JLA and relocated to the Little Caesars Arena.

The primary purpose of this Plan is to facilitate the demolition of the JLA and to
prepare the Property for a future mixed?use development, which may include
residential, commercial, and/or retail space.

At this time, the exact nature of the future development for the Property is
uncertain. The completed project may vary from the project description provided
herein, without necessitating an amendment to this Plan, so long as such
variations are not material and arise as a result of changes in market and/or
financing conditions affecting the project and/or are related to the addition or
immaterial removal of amenities to the project. All material changes, as
determined by DBRA in its sole discretion, to the project description are subject to
the approval of the DBRA and shall be consistent with the overall nature of the
proposed development, its proposed public purpose, and the purposes of Act 381.

Attachment provides a description of the eligible activities to be completed at the

Property (the ?Project?) and Attachment includes letters of support for the
Project.

Page 4

B. Basis of Eligibility (Section 13 and Section 219)]

The Property is considered ?eligible property? as defined by Act 381, Section 2
because the Property was previously utilized for a public purpose; it is
located within the City of Detroit, a qualified local governmental unit under Act 381 
and the Property is determined to be a functionally obsolete, as defined by Act
381, or is adjacent and contiguous to eligible property (ex. functionally obsolete)
and the development of the adjacent and contiguous parcels is estimated to
increase the taxable value of that eligible property.

The Assessment Division of the City of Detroit?s Finance Department has found
the Property to be ?functionally obsolete? within the definition of the Assessors
Manual and the Michigan Strategic Fund Act, as evidenced by the letter attached
hereto as Attachment G.

0 Section 90a(e)(iv) of the Michigan Strategic Fund Act defines ?functionally
obsolete? property as property that is ?unable to be used to adequately
perform the function for which it was intended due to a substantial loss in
value resulting from factors such as overcapacity, changes in technology,
deficiencies or superadequacies in design, or other similar factors that affect
the property itself or the property?s relationship with other surrounding
property as determined by a Michigan advanced assessing of?ce or a
Michigan master assessing of?cer.? (MCL (emphasis
added).

The JLA was previously used by a National Hockey League franchise, the
Detroit Red Wings, and other professional ice related activities. As mentioned
earlier, the Detroit Red Wings have permanently relocated to Little Caesars
Arena and, without substantial updates and renovations, the JLA no longer
meets market demand for its intended purpose for several reasons, including,
but not limited to: existing electrical and mechanical system are severely
antiquated and the cost to replace/update these systems is extremely cost
prohibitive; utilities for the Property are not energy efficient and the cost to
update would be cost prohibitive; any expansion of the existing building is cost
prohibitive because of the substantial asbestos throughout the JLA exterior
walls); the restroom facilities at the JLA are severely outdated and would
require expensive refurbishment/overhaul; there is no on-site chilling or cooling
equipment at the JLA and the cost to install such equipment would be cost
prohibitive; the Property is land locked and efficient traffic flow and control is
problematic; and the parking garages that support the Property are
deteriorating and require extensive cost prohibitive repairs.

Page 5

Moreover, the current configurations do not meet market demand for the original
public purpose of the building, nor does it meet market demand for a future mixed-
used vision which may include residential, commercial, and retail space.

C. Summaryr ci?liqible Activities and Description of Costs (Section 13



The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the Property are
considered ?eligible activities? as defined by Section 2(0) of Act 381, because they
include Environmental Assessment activities, response activities, due care
activities, demolition (interior, building, and utilities), asbestos abatement, and
brownfield plan and work plan preparation and implementation.

A summary of the eligible activities and the estimated cost of each eligible activity
intended to be paid for with Tax Increment Revenues from the Property are shown
and attached hereto as Attachment E. The eligible activities described in
Attachment are not exhaustive. Subject to the approval of DBRA staff in writing,
additional eligible activities may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an
amendment to this Plan, so long as such eligible activities are permitted by Act
381 and the costs of such eligible activities does not exceed the total costs stated
in Attachment E.

Unless othenrvise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall
commence within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body
approves this Plan and be completed within three (3) years after approval of the
Michigan Strategic Fund work plan, if applicable, or three (3) years after execution
of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that term is defined below). Any long-term
monitoring or operation and maintenance activities or obligations that may be
required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this Plan and any
documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities. Tax
increment revenue generated by the Property will be captured by the DBRA and
used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed on the Property
pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by the DBRA
and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement Agreement?),
to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan contemplates the capture
of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school operating purposes?
(as defined by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School
Taxes?), the Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to
reimburse the Developer for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment
revenue derived from Local Taxes, or Specific Taxes that are considered Local
Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are defined by Act 381) is contingent upon: 
the Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work plan approvals by the
Michigan Strategic Fund and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality,
as may be required pursuant to Act 381, or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA

Page 6

with evidence, satisfactory to DBRA, that the Developer has the financial means
to complete the project without the capture of, and subsequent reimbursement
with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or
decrease depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and
other unknown conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those
eligible activities encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from
tax increment revenues of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the
terms of the Reimbursement Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be
qualified for reimbursement except to the extent permitted in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Reimbursement Agreement and Act 381. The
Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the total cost of eligible
activities subject to payment or reimbursement provided that the total cost of
eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment E. As long
as the total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be
adjusted after the date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent
the adjustments do not violate the terms of the approved MDEQ or MSF work plan.

D. Estimate of Captured Taxable Value and Tax Increment Revenues
{Section Beginning Date of Capture of Tax Increment Revenues
[Section (13Hgilf); Impact of Tax Increment Financing on Taxing
Jurisdictions (Section 13l21jgjj

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to reimburse the
Developer for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with the
Reimbursement Agreement. Subject to Section 13(b)16 of Act 381, a table of
estimated tax increment revenues to be captured is attached to this Plan as
Attachment F.

Tax increments are projected to be captured and applied to reimbursement of
eligible activity costs and payment of DBRA administrative and operating
expenses, (ii) make deposits into the State Brownfield Redevelopment Fund, and
make deposits into the Local Brownfield Revolving Fund, as follows:

E. Plan of Financinq (Section 13(2)(dll: Maximum Amount of Indebtedness
{Section 13I2Hen

The eligible activities are to be paid for solely by funds secured by the Developer.
The DBRA will reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities,
but only from tax increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances
have been or shall be made by the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under
this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the
Reimbursement Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of
costs to be reimbursed in this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund
such reimbursements and does not obligate the DBRA to fund any reimbursement
or to enter into the Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of
any costs for which tax increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or
which are permitted to be reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of
any tax increment revenues that will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan,
and the terms and conditions for such use and upon any reimbursement of the
expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided solely under the Reimbursement
Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of
Michigan, the DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to finance
the purposes of this Plan.

Interest shall be paid under this Plan as provided in the Reimbursement
Agreement, provided that to the extent that the Michigan Strategic Fund or
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality does not approve the payment of
interest on an eligible activity with school taxes, interest shall not accrue or be paid
under this Plan with respect to the cost of such eligible activity. Unless othenivise
agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the DBRA
may approve interest on the local portion of the reimbursement to the extent that
the projected internal rate of return to the Developer does not exceed twenty
as more specifically stated in the Reimbursement Agreement.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost
of Eligible Activities permitted under this Plan.

F. Duration of Plan (Section 

Subject to Section 13b(16) of Act 381, the beginning date of capture of tax
increment revenues for each eligible property shall occur in accordance with the
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) table described in Exhibit F. In no event, however,
shall this Plan extend beyond the maximum term allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act
381 for the duration of this Plan.

Page 9

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished
or terminated in accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 381 in the event of any of
the following:

a. The governing body may abolish this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) when it finds that the purposes for which this Plan was
established have been accomplished.

b. The governing body may terminate this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) if the project for which eligible activities were identified in this
Plan (or any subsequent amendment thereto) fails to occur with respect to the
eligible property for at least two (2) years following the date of the governing body
resolution approving this Plan (or any subsequent amendment thereto), provided
that the governing body first does both of the following: gives 30 days? written

RE: 600 Civic Center Drive, Detroit, Michigan - Joe Louis Arena
Dear Ms. Kanalos:

The Of?ce of the Assessor has reviewed the proposed project for the property located at 600 Civic Center
Drive, Detroit, Michigan and more commonly known as the ?Joe Louis Arena? (the ?Property?) in
anticipation of the Property being included in a brown?eld plan.

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act (?Act 381?) requires that a level or IV assessor make a
?nding that the Property is ?functionally obsolete?, as de?ned by Act 381, and provide the underlying
basis for that opinion.

Section 2(s) of Act 381 de?nes ?functionally obsolete? as property that is ?unable to be used to adequately
perform the function for which it was intended due to a substantial loss in value resulting from factors such
as overcapacity, changes in technology, de?ciencies or superadequacies in design, or other similar factors
that affect the property itself or the property?s relationship with other surrounding property.? MCL


The Assessors Manual de?nes functional obsolescence as ?a loss in value occurring in a structure caused
by changes in design, overcapacity, or inadequacy.? Michigan Assessors Manual, Vol. I Glossary, p. 239.

The Joe Louis Arena was originally intended for use by a National Hockey League franchise, the Detroit
Red Wings, and other professional ice related activities. Without substantial updates and renovations, the
PrOperty was no longer able to meet market demand for such activities for several reasons, including, but
not limited to: existing electrical and mechanical systems are severely antiquated and the cost to
replace/update these systems is extremely cost prohibitive; utilities for the Property are not energy ef?cient
and the cost to update would be cost prohibitive; any expansion of the building is cost prohibitive because
of the substantial asbestos throughout the building exterior walls); restroom facilities are severely
outdated and would require expensive refurbishment/overhaul; there is no on-site chilling or cooling
equipment and the cost to install such equipment would be cost prohibitive; the Property is land locked and
ef?cient traf?c ?ow and control is problematic; the parking garages that support the PrOperty are
deteriorating and require extensive cost prohibitive repairs; etc. In fact, the Detroit Red Wings franchise
has relocated to another location known as Little Caesars Arena because the Property was no longer
suitable for its intended use.

The Of?ce of the Assessor ?nds the Property to be functionally obsolete within the de?nition of the
Assessors Manual and the Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act.

Sincerely,

SMf/m?m?

RE: Petition for the Establishment of a Commercial Rehabilitation District at 81, 95, 107
and 119 Gar?eld Street

Honorable City Council:

On behalf of the City of Detroit Planning and Development Department please accept
this letter requesting the establishment of a Commercial Rehabilitation Development District for
the property located at 81, 95, 107 and 119 Gar?eld Street as described on Attachment A.

PDD is submitting this request for a Commercial Rehabilitation District for the purpose of
stimulating development in the area. The Developer, POAH DD Sugar Hill, LLC, was awarded
the opportunity to redevelop the vacant former parking lot property by the City of Detroit through
a Request for Proposal process. The vision for the property includes the construction of a multi-
story, mixed-use development with ground ?oor commercial/retail space, and estimated 85
residential apartments, and residential amenities in order to accommodate both rental residential
and commercial/retail uses. The redevelopment will also include an approximately 254-space
parking structure to support both the commercial and residential tenants, as well as the general

public.

The Developer, POAH DD Sugar Hill, LLC, is a partnership of Develop Detroit and Preservation
of Affordable Housing, an arm of the Housing Partnership Network. The Housing Partnership
Network is a collaboration of 100+ housing and community development nonprofits. POAH DD
Sugar Hill, LLC, anticipates investing approximately $34,243,000 to redevelop the property. Both
the commercial/retail space and the residential space will be included within the PA 210 District.
Construction is expected to begin in spring of 2019 and with an anticipated completion date of fall

of 2020.

This development project meets the statutory requirements for a Commercial Rehabilitation
District because it is located in a business area as described in MCL 207.842 Sec. 2. 

"Commercial rehabilitation district" or "district" means an area not less than 3 acres in size
of a quali?ed local governmental unit established as provided in section 3. However, if
the commercial rehabilitation district is located in a downtown or business area or contains

 

Detroit City Council

RE: Petition for the Establishment of a Commercial Rehab. District at 81, 95, 107 119 Gar?eld
October 3, 2018

Page 2

a quali?ed retail food establishment, as determined by the legislative body of the quali?ed
local governmental unit, the district may be less than 3 acres in size.

This project is on a block that is mostly zoned General Business, plus the parcels themselves are
zoned as a Planned Development District. Additionally the parcels located within the proposed
District are eligible because of commercial use (parking) which occurred within the previous 15
years, as stated in MCL 207.842 Sec. 2. 

Creation of the district and approval of an exemption certi?cate is necessary for the viability of
the project. The prOperty has lain vacant since the mid-19905 and previous attempts to redevelop
the site never came to fruition. The project is estimated to create 15 full-time equivalent employees
and 132 construction jobs.

The number of years requested for the CRA exemption is ten (10).

The redevelopment will greatly increase urban density in the City of Detroit and provide residential
low income and market value housing options, in addition to much-needed commercial and retail
space. The new development will further be supported by the 254-space parking deck, which will
support both residential and commercial uses and the neighborhood generally. The project will
create jobs for local residents, increase commercial activity, spur redevelopment of adjacent
underutilized and vacant properties, and will provide additional tax revenue for the City of Detroit.
The applicant is not delinquent in the payment of any taxes related to the subject property. The
applicant is also applying for Tax Increment Financing.

Res ectl?ully submitted,

FROM: Esther Yang, Planning and Development
RE: Master Plan Interpretation for Commercial Rehabilitation District for 81, 95, 107

and 119 Gar?eld.
DATE: October 15, 2018
CC: Maurice Cox, Director

In order to ensure that the issuance of a certi?cate for a Commercial Rehabilitation District is
consistent with the City?s Master Plan of Policies and will have the reasonable likelihood to
increase commercial activity; create, retain or prevent a loss of employment; revitalize an urban
area; or increase the number of residents in a community, pursuant to State of Michigan, Public
Act 210 of 2005 (section 207.841), the Planning and Development Department?s Planning
Division submits the following interpretation.

Petitioner:
City of Detroit, Planning and Development Department

Project Description:
The development proposes an 85 unit apartment building and 254 space parking structure with
12,350 square feet of retail at the ground level.

Proiect Location
81, 95, 107 and 119 Gar?eld.

Interpretation:
The Master Plan Future General Land Use designation of the central portion of the site is Mixed

Residential-Commercial. Mixed Residential Commercial areas consist predominantly of
medium-to-high density housing developed compatibly with commercial and/or institutional
uses. This classi?cation is well suited to areas proximal to existing centers of major commercial
activity, major thoroughfares, transportation nodes, or gateways into the city. Policy 2.1 of the
Lower Woodward neighborhood recommends the development of . .Woodward. . .as high-
density mixed?use corridor with housing and ground-?oor commercial.?

The development conforms to the Future General Land Use designation and Master Plan
Policies for the area.

Parcels Number: 01001163., 01001164., 01001165. And 01001166.

Dear Mr. Cox:

The Office of the Chief Financial Of?cer, Of?ce of the Assessor, has reviewed the proposed Commercial Rehabilitation District located
in the Midtown area in the City of Detroit.

The rationale for creating Commercial Rehabilitation Districts under PA 210 of 2005, as amended, is based on the anticipation of
increased market value upon completion of new construction and/or signi?cant rehabilitation of commercial and former industrial
property where the primary purpose and use is the operation of a commercial business enterprise or multifamily residential use.
Commercial property also includes facilities related to a commercial business enterprise under the same ownership at that location,
including, but not limited to, of?ce, engineering, research and development, warehousing, parts distribution, retail sales, and other
commercial activities. Commercial property also includes a building or group of contiguous buildings previously used for industrial
purposes that will be converted to the operation of a commercial business enterprise.

The district, as proposed by the City of Detroit Planning and Development Department consists of graveled parking lots on .787 acres
of land. The proposed project by the developer POAH DD Sugar Hill LLC consists of the construction of a multi-story mixed use
development with ground floor commercial/retail space, an estimated 85 residential apartments with residential amenities and a 254-
space parking structure.



This area meets the criteria set forth under PA 210 of 2005, as amended. It applies to blighted, functionally obsolete and contaminated
properties. "Commercial rehabilitation district" or "district" means an area not less than 3 acres in size of a qualified local governmental
unit established as provided in section 3. However, if the commercial rehabilitation district is located in a downtown or business area
or contains a qualified retail food establishment as determined by the legislative body of the quali?ed local governmental unit, the
district may be less than 3 acres in size. The local government unit may establish by resolution a district that contains 1 or more parcels
or tracts of land if at the time the resolution is adopted the parcel or tract of land or portion of a parcel or tract of land within the
district is a qualified facility.

A field investigation and application review indicated that the proposed Commercial Rehabilitation District located at 81, 95, 107 and
119 Garfield in the Midtown area in the City of Detroit is eligible as it pertains to the Commercial Rehabilitation Act under PA 210

of 2005, as amended.

RE: Approval of Additions to 2018 HOME, CDBG, NSP Awards
Honorable City Council:

The City of Detroit, through the Housing and Revitalization Department has continued
to work closely with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in
making required commitments and disbursements of City HOME funds to meet project
commitment and disbursement deadlines. HRD issued a NOFA on December 18, 2017, to assist
in making allocations for ?ready-to-proceed projects? from available HOME, NSF and CDBG
funding. The Department is requesting City Council approval additions and/or new allocation to
six HOME, NSP, or CDBG projects.

The HOME Program is authorized under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable
Housing Act, and is designed exclusively to create affordable housing for low-income households.
Eligible activities under the HOME program include:

- Providing home purchase or rehabilitation ?nancing assistance to eligible homebuyers;

0 Building or rehabilitating housing for rent or homeownership; and

Other reasonable and necessary expenses related to the development of non-luxury
housing.

HOME funds are awarded on a formula basis, are included in the annual entitlement award from
HUD and are part of the Consolidated Plan.

HRD is requesting approval of increases to the following projects according to the list in
attachment A: Sugar Hill Mixed Use Development, Clay Apartments, Brightmoor Homes 1, St.
Rita Apartments, and LifeBuilders, and Kercheval Van Dyke Apartments. HRD has
reprogrammed CDBG development funding for increases to Clay Apartments 
Brightmoor Homes I and Life Builders The department is also requesting
approval of a Challenge grant of $1,500,000 for the Van Dyke Apartments project and an increase
of HOME in the amount of $170,000 for the St. Rita Apartments project. Finally, the department
is also requesting approval of an assumption Of a Section 108 loan for the Sugar Hill project for a
new borrower. (See Exhibit 1).

RE: Joe Louis Arena Amended and Restated Brown?eld Plan PA 3810f 1996

PUBLIC HEARING

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act 381 of 1996

The Brown?eld Redevelopment Financing Act 381 of 1996 provides tax incentives tax
increment ?nancing) to develop brown?elds properties in an area at or on which there has been
a release (or threat of release) or disposal of a hazardous substance.

Joe Louis Arena Amended and Restated Brownfield Plan

For the purposes of this Plan, the ?Developer? is the City of Detroit. The primary purpose of
this Plan is to facilitate the demolition of the Joe Louis Arena (J LA) and to prepare the property
for a future mixed-use development, which may include residential, commercial, and/or retail
space. This brown?eld request is unique, in that the City of Detroit is the owner of the eligible
property, the Joe Louis Arena and the Detroit Building Authority will oversee the demolition.

A Plan Amendment is being requested due to increased Eligible Activities that have recently

been discovered by environmental consultants working on behalf of the City of Detroit.1 The

total in the amount of $14,363,1472 is estimated under the Plan for the demolition and related
eligible activities involved.

The aniendment to the original plan is due to the following projected increases, abatement and
demolition activities have increased from $3.6 million to approximately $8.8 million in the Plan
Amendinent. Engineering Services: Demo Design has increased from $790,286 to $840,286.

 

1 Phase 11 Environmental Site Assessment of The Joe Louis Arena, dated October 23, 2108
2 To prov'de funding for the JLA demolition, in accordance with the bankruptcy settlement with the Financial

Guaranty nsurance Company (FGIC).

New Eligible Costs of Due Care Activities, Response Activities and Interest totaling
approximately $2.7 million are new Eligible Cost. In total, the Eligible Costs for the TIF3
reimbursement to the ?Developer? have increased from $5,561,0094 to $14,363,147 

The eligible property5 (the ?property?), consists of six (6) parcels located at 27 Washington
Blvd. The common address of the JLA is also known as ?600 Civic Center Drive.? 25
Washington Blvd, 29 Washington Blvd, 31 Washington Blvd, and 33 Washington are
properties that are adjacent and continuous to 27 Washington Blvd. 501 Third is also adjacent to
27 Washington and is the location of the Detroit PeOple Mover Joe Louis Arena Station
Stop. The property is located adjacent to the Central Business District and is generally bounded
by Jefferson Street to the north, Atwater Street to the east, Detroit River to the south and Cobo
Convention Center to the west.

The ?eligible activities? that are intended to be carried out at the property are considered
?eligible activities? as de?ned by Sec 2 ofAct 381, because they include environmental
assessment activities, demolition and abatement and brown?eld plan and work plan preparation
and brown?eld plan implementation. The eligible activities and budgeted costs are intended as
part of the development of the property and will be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The
Authority is not responsible for any costs of eligible activities and will incur no debt. The
eligible activities are estimated to begin within eighteen months and be completed within three
(3) years.

?9 Phase II ESA is an "intrusive" investigation which collects original samples of soil, groundwater or building
materials to analyze for quantitative values of various contaminants.

Phase II Environmental Site Assessment22

FINDINGS:

- Subsurface soil conditions encountered at the Subject property generally consisted of
approximately 4 feet of sand and ?ll material over approximately 3 feet of sand and silty sand
over clay to a maximum depth explored of approximately 24 feet bgs.23

- Water was encountered in seven of the nine borings performed at the Subject property.

0 Obvious ?eld indications (PID24 readings and/or chemical odor) of soil impacts were not
identi?ed in each of the nine soil borings performed at the Subject property.

- were detected at concentrations above the method detection limit (MDL) in four of the
sixteen soil samples submitted for analysis, however, none of the detected concentrations are
above criteria.

0 compounds were detected at concentrations above the MDL in twelve of the sixteen soil
samples submitted for analysis. One (phenanthrene) was detected at a concentration
above criteria in one of the soil samples submitted for analysis. Phenanthrene was detected at a
concentration exceeding the GSIP28 criteria associated with residential and nonresidential land
use in one of the soil samples submitted for analysis (SB-A 

- Multiple metals were detected at concentrations above the MDLs in each of the sixteen soil
samples submitted for analysis. Arsenic, lead, selenium, and mercury were variously detected at
a concentration above various criteria in each of the sixteen soil samples submitted for analysis.
0 Sixteen VOCs were variously detected at a concentration above the MDLs in each of the seven
groundwater samples submitted for analysis. Seven VOCs were variously detected at
concentrations above various criteria in two of the seven groundwater samples submitted for
analysis.

0 Five SVOCs were variously detected at a concentration above the MDLs in ?ve of the seven
groundwater samples submitted for analysis. One SVOCS was
detected at a concentration above DW Criteria in one of the groundwater samples submitted for
analysis.

Based on the results and the evaluation of the laboratory data collected during the Phase II
ESA, the Subject property would be considered a ?facility? as de?ned in Part 201 of Public Act
451 of 1994, as amended.

TEC also recommends the following:

- Future non-liable owners or operators should consider conducting a Baseline Environmental
Assessment (BEA) to obtain available environmental liability exemptions for the existing
contamination.

Joe Louis Arena People Mover Station and Adjoining Tracks

In addition to the demolition of the Joe Louis Arena, the preservation of the Joe Louis Arena
People Mover Station and its adjoining tracks in the vicinity of the LA, is a factor to be
considered. Given this fact, we contacted the Detroit Building Authority to address this speci?c
issue:

- Q: Is there is a speci?c demolition plan in place that addresses the preservation
of both the JLA people mover station and the tracks in the vicinity of the JLA.
Please let me know how your demolition plan address these issues and also discuss
the speci?cs of your overall demolition plan?

- 213$: The DBA is currently developing a demolition plan with the contractor and
engineering team Barton Malow/Sidock Group, which has not been ?nalized The entire
project team has been working in conjunction with Barbara Hansen of the People Mover
to ensure the interests of the People Mover are taken into account during the planning
and design phases. There may be an opportunity to demolish the pedestrian bridge this
fall that is located between Joe Louis Arena and the People Mover station.

In addition, representatives from the City of Detroit Department of Environmental A?airs
attend our weekly progress meetings, as we recognize the importance of that
department's involvement from an environmental perspective.

Contact with some of the stakeholders located within close proximity attend our project
meetings including representatives ?om Cobo Hall who provide valuable input. We will
continue to reach out to other stakeholders by having a public meeting to present our
demolition plan once finalized.

Conclusion

As we indicated in our initial report on the ?rst LA Brown?eld plan, City council should be
advised that to-date, no developer has been identi?ed to develop the proposed multi-million
mixed use project to follow the demolition of the JLA, which is necessary to generate the tax
increment ?nancing to repay the $10 million MSF loan. If the costs of the demolition exceeds
$10 million and reaches $12 million as it is now estimated, the OCFO will need to identify
funds to address the$2 million gap. If approved by Council and implemented as planned,
ideally this project will ultimately result in a commercially viable project. So, if this works out
as planned, the newly constructed project will generate the tax increment ?nancing to repay the
CRP loan.

Alternatively, if a developer is not identi?ed and seemed by the City, the City?s general fund
would not be reimbursed for the costs associated with the CRP loan for the demolition of LA
and the OCFO would be charged with the task of identifying funds. The City does face the
burden of maintaining the Joe Louis arena at an estimated cost in excess of $1 million as long as

10

the arena stands.29 However, the parties involved (DBRA, DEGC) are optimistic that it will not
be dif?cult to locate a developer for the site.

Please contact us if we can be of any ?irther assistance.
