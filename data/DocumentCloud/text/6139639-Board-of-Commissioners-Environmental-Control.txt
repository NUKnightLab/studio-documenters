PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CLEAN AND GREEN
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board seeks to protect its employees and preserve the
natural environment; and
WHEREAS, President Barack Obama has made the environment and energy a priority by
introducing a $150 billion plan to create green jobs and energy independence; and
WHEREAS, Green Seal (GS-37) is the most recognized certifier of green cleaning products
in the United States. GS-37 certified products go through a stringent, science-based
evaluation process to show that they have less impact on the environment and human
health; and
WHEREAS, there is substantial evidence showing that GS-37 approved cleaning supplies
are not harmful to oneâ€™s health and do not release toxic fumes as do conventional chemical
products; and
WHEREAS, conventional cleaning products and GS-37 certified cleaning products are
comparably priced; and
WHEREAS, GS-37 certified products are readily available to Cook County suppliers,
vendors and anyone who wishes to purchase them; and
WHEREAS, pre-measured and concentrated cleaning products offer substantial help to the
environment, reduce shipping costs, increase available storage space, prevent waste and
increase accountability among Cook County Board employees.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
seeks to implement a Green Cleaning Supply Ordinance that requires that all cleaning
products used in Cook County facilities, purchased by Cook County and contracted vendors
be Green Seal (GS-37) certified in order to help the environment and preserve the health of
Cook County employees and residents. Pre-measured and concentrated cleaning products
will be included in all bids for Cook County Board cleaning products.

* Referred to the Committee on Environmental Control on 4/2/09.
** Deferred on 7/21/09.
