Present also but not counted for the quorum were Chairman John Hooker, and Commissioners Matthew

session and discussed, voted and recommended for approval the following two items.
On behalf of the Finance & Audit Committee, Committee Chairman Chico presented an Omnibus
Motion for the approval of Items 1 and 2.
(Item 1)
The resolution for Item 1 ratifies the acceptance of two grant awards from HUD. The Resident
Opportunity Self Sufficiency (ROSS) grant in the amount of $717,750.00 will fund three ROSS Service
Coordinators for the existing CHA Victim Assistance Program (VAP) for a period of three years and the
Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) grant award in the amount of $819,137.00 will fund fifteen FSS
Coordinators for a period of one (1) year. The FAA program supports the employment of fifteen FSS
Coordinators, who will provide Public Housing and Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) families with
economic, financial and education-based programming. The Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA)
for the ROSS and FSS grants were released in May and October 2018, respectively and were submitted
to HUD. In February 2019, the CHA received official written notice of the grant award from HUD.
HUD’s award letters to the CHA required that the CHA execute and return the Grant Agreements within
72 hours of receipt. The CHA executed and returned the Grant Agreements to HUD on February 12,
2019 (ROSS) and February 14, 2019 (FSS) in accordance with HUD’s requirements. This is part of
CHA’s 2019 Budget. Treasury will perform draws in compliance with HUD requirements.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-22
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated May 21, 2019 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO RATIFY
1

 THE ACCEPTANCE OF GRANT AWARDS FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratifies the Chief Executive Officer’s acceptance of two
grant awards from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) in the amount of $717,750.00, under HUD’s ROSS Service Coordinators
Program and $819,137.00, under HUD’s Family Self-Sufficiency (“FSS”) Program.

(Item 2)
The resolution for Item 2 approves an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Chicago
Department of Fleet and Facility Management (Fleet) for fuel supply and vehicle maintenance, car
wash, road and towing services to the CHA for a five base term effective July 1, 2019, through July 31,
2024, and for compensation in an amount not-to-exceed $250,000.00. In association with the requested
approval for a new contract renewing the fuel and fleet service amenities under the same general terms
and conditions, the CHA additionally seeks the Board’s formal approval and ratification of the shortterm extension of the prior IGA (Contract #11386). The short-term extension of the prior IGA was for
time only, and covered the term from January 1, 2019, through June 30, 2019, as no additional funding
was deemed necessary to continue the provision of supplies and services without interruption through
the date of the anticipated commencement of a new IGA. While the CHA has closely monitored the
prevailing fuel prices in the private market as they compare with those of Fleet, it is determined that the
prices extended to the CHA by Fleet remain considerably lower than those available to the CHA in the
private market. The cost of unleaded and diesel fuel per gallon is lower than that if the CHA procured
such fuel supplies and services outside of the IGA relationship with Fleet. The price of car washes
through the Fleet vendor has remained constant; the need for maintenance and towing services, while all
inclusive, is minimal to none, and is utilized on an as needed or emergency basis.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-23
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated May 21, 2019,
entitled “Recommendation to Approve an IGA with the City of Chicago for Fuel,
Vehicle Maintenance, Car Wash, Road and Towing Services” for a five-year base
term with compensation in the not-to-exceed amount of $250,000.00.,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Chicago Department of
Fleet and Facility Management for fuel supplies and vehicle maintenance, car wash,
road and towing services for CHA vehicles for a five-year base period in an amount
not-to-exceed $250,000.00. The Board of Commissioners further approves and
ratifies the six (6) month extension of the prior Fuel and Fleet IGA (Contract #11386)
to effect and ensure continuity from the prior contract through the commencement of
the new IGA.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements, if applicable.

 There being no questions or discussion, Chairman Hooker thereupon declared said Motion carried and
said resolutions adopted.
Commissioner Meghan Harte, Chairwoman of the Tenant Services Committee, then presented her
report. Per Commissioner Harte, the Tenant Services Committee held its monthly meeting earlier today.
Commissioner Harte chaired the meeting and the following committee members were present as well:
Commissioners Brewer, Harris, Parker and Washington. Although Chairman Hooker and
Commissioners Craig Chico and Cristina Matos were also present, they were not counted toward the
quorum. Committee members then discussed, voted and recommended for approval the items appearing
on the agenda.
On behalf of the Tenant Services Committee, Commissioner Harte presented an Omnibus Motion for
approval of Items 3 and 4.
(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves the acceptance of a grant award and execution of an
Intergovernmental Agreement for a one-year base term with the Chicago Department of Family and
Support Services (DFSS) in the amount of $1,160,000 for the Summer Youth Employment Program
(SYEP). SYEP is a part of the Mayor’s One Summer Chicago initiative, which brings together
government institutions, community-based organizations and companies to offer employment and
internship opportunities to youth and young adults. SYEP provides safe summer experiences while
helping youth, ages 16-24, build valuable employment skills. Participants receive on-going job readiness
instruction while working up to 180 hours over the course of six weeks; 100% of the grant funds will be
used to pay training wages to CHA youth. CHA will be awarded funding by DFSS to build on the
success of the 2018 SYEP, which served 1,829 CHA youth (52% were public housing residents and
48% were Housing Choice Voucher participants). Last year, CHA youth participated at 367 unique
worksites across the city and worked more than 245,000 hours. CHA’s SYEP is delivered in
collaboration with CHA’s contracted FamilyWorks providers, who are responsible for being the
connection between SYEP youth, the worksite and CHA.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-24
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated May 21, 2019 entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO ACCEPT
SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT GRANT AWARD”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Chicago Department of Family
and Support Services (“DFSS”) and accept a DFSS grant in the amount of $1,160,000
for Summer Youth Employment Program wages.

(Item 4)
The resolution for Item 4 approves the execution of a contract with the Chicago Cook Workforce
Partnership (CCWP) in a not-to-exceed amount of $430,000 for a one-year base term.
The Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership was created in 2012 to provide workforce development
services for the City of Chicago and Cook County, with targeted efforts in line with local jobs that are in
demand and/or projected to be in demand. The CCWP mission is to create, promote, and effectively
manage a network of workforce development organizations that designs innovative solutions to address
business needs and prepares individuals for and connects them to career opportunities. CCWP is the
local workforce authority designated by the U.S. Department of Labor and is the conduit for employers
and job seekers. The contract with CCWP has allowed CHA to receive customized services and allows
for flexibility to meet the needs of CHA residents. This includes allowing CHA residents to receive
workforce services regardless of meeting eligibility requirements for public workforce services.
Through this partnership, CCWP will enroll 600 CHA residents at five American Job Centers
throughout Chicago. CHA residents can access services including, but not limited to, training and
education through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), career coaching, digital
literacy, job search and job placement. CHA has approved a non-competitive procurement (sole source)
for CCWP services in advance of this Board request, based on CCWP’s unique role as the fiscal agent,
sub-recipient and administrative entity for the local workforce innovation area that provides public
workforce services to Chicago and Cook County.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-27
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated May 21, 2019 entitled “Recommendation to Renew Housing
Assistance Payments contract for G&A Spaulding Apartments.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to: 1) approve the renewal of a Housing Assistance Payments contract for a 20-year
term for G&A Spaulding Apartments; and 2) execute all other documents as may be
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.

(Item 7)
CHA issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in January 2019 to solicit qualified General Construction
Contractors to provide authority-wide capital maintenance and redevelopment activities at CHA
properties. The intent of this RFP was to obtain multiple qualified General Construction Contractors to
participate in CHA’S Task Order Competitive Contracting (TOCC) IDIQ Program. CHA received
thirty-nine total proposals in response to this RFP, however, twenty-six proposals were determined to be
either non-responsive or non-responsible or did not meet the competitive range. The Proposals were
evaluated and scored. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 7 approves the award of thirteen Indefinite
Delivery and Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to the listed contractors in the resolution for a total
not-to-exceed base term amount of $39,000,000.00 to provide authority-wide professional general
construction services for various CHA properties. Each Contract will be for an amount not-to-exceed of
$3,000,000.00 for a base term of two years with two one-year renewal options. An additional
$61,000,000.00 will be set-aside as reserve capacity from which funds can be allocated. The total
aggregate amount of the thirteen (13) contracts and the reserve capacity fund is not-to-exceed
5

 $100,000,000.00. The contractors will provide complete construction services in connection with
modernization, rehabilitation, and capital maintenance at selected CHA properties. Since 2007, the
Capital Construction Department has successfully utilized IDIQ programs for projects valued up to
$3,000,000 throughout the Rehabilitation, Scattered Sites and Capital Maintenance programs. The
current action increases the cap from $3,000,000 to $5,000,000 per awarded task order and will allow
CHA to maintain efficient execution of desired capital projects through this program. Also, the TOCC
Program allows the ability to work with a pre-approved group of general contractors which significantly
reduces the time needed to move from project design to construction, while still retaining the cost
control advantages of competitive bidding. The CHA will assign General Contractors to one or more of
the groups based on their proposal selection and requisite qualifications. The CHA will offer task order
bidding opportunities to each group in a manner to provide fair opportunities for GCs to bid on
construction projects. The breakdown/summary as follows: Group A: will be for contractors who have
the ability to bid on, perform the work and secure bonding for projects valued from $100,000.00 to
$500,000.00; and Group B: will be for contractors who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and
secure bonding for projects valued over $500,000.00 to $3,000,000.00; Group C: will be for contractors
who have the ability to bid on, perform the work and secure bonding for projects valued over
$3,000,00.00 to $5,000,000.00.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-28
the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the
Board Letter dated May 21, 2019 entitled “Recommendation to Award Contracts for
the Task Order Competitive Contracting (TOCC) IDIQ Program”.

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

Count

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into thirteen (13) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts to
provide professional general construction services at various CHA properties with the

individually and within the aggregate amount of approved funding.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 and
insurance requirements for each assigned task order.
(Item 8)
It is the intent of the CHA to implement a sustainable, community-sensitive revitalization program with
the goal of creating a vibrant community on the remaining vacant CHA land that was formerly part of
the Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells Extension, and Madden Park Homes (Madden/Wells/Darrow)
public housing developments. These public housing developments originally contained approximately
3,267 units located on approximately 94 acres of land. Over the last twelve years, CHA has worked in
collaboration with its development partners, Oakwood Boulevard Associates (OBA) and Granite
Partners for Oakwood Boulevard (GPOB), to create 863 mixed-income housing units in the new
Oakwood Shores development on a portion of the site. In 2018, a master plan was completed for the site
with a recommendation for the completion of what the planning group designated the “core of the Site.”
CHA has been working with OBA and agrees that they are the right team to finish this core area.
Accordingly, the resolution for Item 8 approves Oakwood Boulevard Associates, LLC as Developer for
the Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells Extension and Madden Park Homes Phase III Site. Oakwood
Boulevard Associates is a partnership between The Community Builders, Inc., Granite Development
Corp., and Ujima, Inc., and serves as the Developer of the Oakwood Shores mixed income development.
The partners of Oakwood Boulevard Associates have demonstrated capacity by developing over 800
mixed-income rental and homeownership units at the former Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells
Extension and Madden Park Homes public housing sites. The Community Builders (TCB) is a
nonprofit real estate developer and owner. Founded in 1964, today TCB owns or manages 11,000
apartments in 14 states. In Chicago, TCB has developed nearly 2,000 units to date including the first
800+ units at Oakwood Shores. Granite Companies (Granite) is a full-service real estate development
and asset management business. Through a partnership with TCB, Granite has developed a mixed-use
residential property that includes 28,000 square feet of commercial space with a major medical tenant, a
community center and over 800 units of mixed income rental housing along with 74 units of for- sale
housing. Ujima, Inc. was started by former residents of the Ida B. Wells, Madden Park Homes public
housing development. Ujima, Inc. designs and implements an array of services to engage former CHA
residents who have the right to return to CHA mixed finance communities and are in the process of
successful relocation. Ujima provides a continuum of services necessary, not only for successful rehousing, but housing stability and community reintegration including jobs and self-sufficiency.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-29
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated May 21, 2019
entitled “Authorization to enter into a Development Agreement for the Mixed-Income
Development of the Former Madden Wells Darrow Site.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
7

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to: 1) Approve Oakwood Boulevard Associates, LLC as Developer for the
Ida B. Wells, Darrow Homes, Wells Extension and Maddens Park Homes Phase III
Site; 2) Enter into a Development Agreement for Mixed-Income Development; and 3)
Execute and deliver such other documents and perform such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to implement the foregoing.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/
Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 approves a Pre-Qualified Development Team, the Pennrose-Bickerdike Team,
to co-develop the Wicker Park site with the CHA. The Wicker Park site is approximately 3.42 acres and
located in a key transit-oriented area. The site is bounded by N. Damen Avenue, W. Le Moyne Street,
the alley west of Damen Avenue and W. Schiller Street. The site is across from Wicker Park and a short
walk to the CTA Damen Blue line stop. CHA plans to enter in a joint venture partnership with the
selected developer to redevelop the entire site, including the rehabilitation of the existing CHA Wicker
Park Apartments and Annex Senior Buildings. On October 4, 2018, CHA released an Opportunity
Notice for Proposal (Notice) for a mixed-use/mixed-income development at the Northwest corner of N.
Damen and W. Schiller. The Notice invited approved Pre-Qualified Development Teams to submit
development proposals for the Wicker Park site by the submission deadline date. Seven proposals were
received. The Pennrose-Bickerdike Team scored the highest for their technical proposal and second
highest for their oral presentation. The Pennrose-Bickerdike Team provides the highest value as a
development partner for the CHA because of their national experience with RAD project-based voucher
conversions, partners with extensive experience with mixed-income development, experience jointventuring with housing authorities, and clear financial underwriting.
WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2019-CHA-30
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated May 21, 2019
entitled “Recommendation to Approve a Pre-Qualified Development Team to
Rehabilitate and Co-Develop the Wicker Park Site.”

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Pennrose-Bickerdike team is approved as the co-developer for the Wicker Park
site (inclusive of the existing CHA Wicker Park Apartments and Annex Senior
buildings);

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, is authorized to negotiate and execute a
development agreement and joint venture agreement for the Wicker Park site; and

THAT,

the Chief Executive Officer, or his designee, is authorized to execute and deliver such
other documents and perform such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
implement the foregoing.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE/ Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.

(Item 10)
The resolution for Item 10 approves LeClaire Partners, LLC as the Developer for the redevelopment of
the former LeClaire Court site located in Chicago’s Garfield Ridge community area. In 2011, residents
of LeClaire were relocated off-site and the 616 units at LeClaire units were demolished. The site is
currently vacant. The LeClaire Courts Working Group is comprised of the CHA, the City of Chicago
Department of Planning and Development, former LeClaire Courts residents, community residents and
stakeholders, and City Park District staff members. The Working Group helps to guide the planning and
implementation of the LeClaire revitalization program. The Working Group will have on-going
communication with the Selected Respondent regarding revitalization activities with a focus on the
residential redevelopment efforts. Members of the LeClaire Working Group were included in the
procurement process for the developer(s). In April 2018, CHA issued a request for proposal (RFP) for
development team to redevelop the LeClaire Courts site. The LeClaire Courts site was split into three
zones for the purpose of the RFP. Respondents could submit on one, two or all three zones. Proposals
were evaluated. All four respondents were invited back for oral presentations. In light of LeClaire
8
