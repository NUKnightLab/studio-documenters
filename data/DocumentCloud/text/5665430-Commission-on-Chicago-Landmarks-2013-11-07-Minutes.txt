The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

2210 N. Cleveland
(Mid-North District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed enlargement of an existing 1-story glass enclosure on the front
of the building to 2 stories and construction of a new roof deck with stair
and elevator enclosures and a glass safety rail.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. Historic Preservation staff shall review and approve a sample of the
zinc cladding for the rooftop enclosure prior to order and installation;
2. The proposed switchable glass (from transparent to translucent) may
be used for both the first and second floor glass enclosure on the front
of the home; and,
3. The proposal requires a zoning variation and/or adjustment, and the
Commission takes no position regarding any requested
variance/adjustment relative to the zoning requirements.

2.

1365 N. Milwaukee
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 2-story masonry building with the 2nd-floor set back from
Milwaukee Avenue for restaurant use on vacant lot.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The Milwaukee Avenue façade design shall be modified to have
folding windows instead of sliding windows at a minimum of 3’wide

 each, the parapet shall have a more detailed recessed brick panel, and
the vertical piers shall incorporate a raised base to be more compatible
with the architectural character of the historic properties of the district;
2. The second-floor level, set back from the front façade by a minimum
of 46’ and measuring 27’ from grade to the top of the roof will not be
visible from Milwaukee Avenue and is approved as proposed. Any
rooftop elements such as landscaping in built-in planters, trellises, or
code-required railings shall be set back and low enough so as not to be
visible from Milwaukee Avenue; and,
3. The brick proposed for the front façade shall be standard modularsized face brick and the storefront mullions shall be a dark color/finish.
Exterior wall material samples shall be reviewed and approved by
Historic Preservation staff as part of the permit application.

3.

2952 W. Armitage
(Logan Square Boulevards District – 35th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 1-story L-shaped masonry addition to an existing 1-story
non-contributing restaurant building.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The brick proposed for the addition’s south, west, and north façades
should not be painted white because painted white brick is not
compatible with the district in general character, color, and texture.
These facades shall be clad with a standard modular-sized face brick
of an earth-tone color compatible with the historic brick colors in the
district. The existing non-contributing structure’s painted brick
facades may be repainted to match the color of the new addition’s
brick so that the restaurant can have a unified appearance. Exterior
wall material samples shall be reviewed and approved by Historic
Preservation staff as part of the permit application; and,
2. The addition’s Humboldt façade shall be enhanced, such as by
providing more windows or other articulation.

4.

2310-38 S. Indiana
(Motor Row District – 3rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed two, 173 sq. ft. and 208 sq. ft., non-illuminated wall signs for “J
& J Motor Service, Inc.” on the east façades of two 1-story buildings and
proposed 5 new perforated metal awnings on the east façades of two
historic masonry buildings.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:

 1. The two non-illuminated flat wall signs, sized at 173 sq. ft. and 208 sq.
ft. and proposed to be mounted at the center of the flat parapets of the
non-contributing 1-story garage structures, are approved as proposed;
and,
2. The five perforated metal awnings of the east elevations of the historic
structures at 2326 and 2338 S. Indiana were seen by the Committee
not as awnings but rather as ‘tilted signs’ due to their materials,
location, and shallow depth. The five tilted signs shall be installed
within the masonry openings.
