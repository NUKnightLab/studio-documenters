RE: RAHF IV Cambridge Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Liability Company-
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

Jonathan Rose Companies has formed RAHF IV Cambridge Limited Dividend Housing Association
(LDHA) Limited Liability Company (LLC) in order to re-certify an existing low income housing Section
8 senior facility known as Cambridge Towers to a PILOT facility. The 12-story high rise building with
a shared first floor community room is located in an area bounded by Vassar on the north,
Evergreen on the east, West 7 Mile on the south and Fielding on the west.

Originally certified as Cambridge Tower Associates LDHA Limited Partnership, Cambridge Tower
consists of two hundred twenty-six (226) 1 bedroom/1 bath and twenty-four (24) 2 bedroom/1 bath
apartments. The exemption was extinguished in 2011 after the property gave up its tax exempt
status when the mortgage encumbering the property during its PILOT term was paid in full. The
property was purchased in 2017 by RAHF IV Cambridge Tower, LLC which then was converted to
RAHF IV Cambridge Tower LDHA, LLC.

The existing Project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract provided by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Development (HUD) has been renewed. The Renewal Contract
began on December 31, 2011, and runs for a period of twenty (20) years. A FHA-insured mortgage
note in the principal amount of $5,680,000 was assumed by RAHF IV Cambridge, LLC on March 21,
2017.

The income of individuals and area median income shall be determined by HUD in a manner
consistent with determinations of lower-income families and area median gross income under
Section 8 of the U5. Housing Act of 1937 and Promulgated at 24 CFR 812. All two hundred fifty
(250) units will be subject to the PILOT based on Section 15a of the State Housing Development
Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive the
benefits of tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of
1966 (P.A. 346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A).

Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body will therefore satisfy the requirements of Public
Act 346 and City Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by establishing a service charge of ten percent 
of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this housing project.

RE: RAHF IV Plymouth Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Liability Company?
Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

Jonathan Rose Companies has formed RAHF IV Plymouth Limited Dividend Housing Association
Limited Liability Company in order to develop the Project known as Plymouth Square
Village. The Project is an existing site with a 14-story high-rise building containing two hundred two
(202) senior units and seventy-eight (78) family units located in nine (9) townhome apartment
buildings in an area bounded by Plymouth on the north, Vaughan on the east, Orangelawn on the
south and Fielding on the west.

Originally certified as Plymouth Square Associates LDHA Limited Partnership, the Project consists
of a high-rise with one hundred eighty-five (185) 1 bed/1 bath and seventeen (17) 2 bed/1 bath
units. The seventy-eight (78) townhomes contain seventy (70) 2 bed/2 bath and eight (8) 3 bed/1.5
bath units. The exemption was extinguished in 2011 after the property gave up its tax exempt
status when the mortgage encumbering the property during its PILOT term was paid in full. The
property was purchased on April 5, 2017, by RAHF IV Plymouth, LLC, which then was converted to
RAHF IV Plymouth LDHA, LLC.

RE: Cathedral Venture Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited Partnership - Payment
in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT)

MRK Partners, Inc. has formed Cathedral Venture Limited Dividend Housing Association Limited
Partnership in order to develop the Project known as Cathedral Tower Apartments. The Project is an
existing two hundred thirty-six (236) family units located in an 18-story high rise apartment building
in an area bounded by East Hancock on the north, John on the east, East Forest on the south and
Woodward on the west.

The in-place rehabilitation Project will include one hundred seventy-one (171) studio and sixty-five
(65) 1 bedroom/1 bath apartments and a community room. Residents will not be present during
asbestos control processes and will be able to return home each evening. The renovation will not
result in a rent increase for three (3) years for tenants who pay more than thirty percent of
income toward rent and no rent increases greater than four percent for any of the existing
residents for the duration of the Regulatory Agreement.

A permanent mortgage loan in the amount of $10,000,000 will be provided by JLL Capital Markets. A
loan in the amount of $2,150,000 will be provided by Bedrock Management Services, LLC. Cinnaire
will make Capital Contributions of $13,950,000 which includes the purchase of Low Income Housing
Tax Credits. Additionally, the Sponsor has agreed to defer $110,776 of the developer fee.

On average, rents for all units have been set at or below sixty percent of the area median
income, adjusted for family size. All two hundred thirty-six (236) units will be subject to the PILOT
based on Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966, as amended.

In order to make this development economically feasible, it is necessary for it to receive the benefits
of tax exemption under Section 15a of the State Housing Development Authority Act of 1966 (PA.
346 as amended, MCL 125.1415A). Adoption of the resolution by your Honorable Body will
therefore satisfy the requirements of Public Act 346 and City Ordinance 9-90, as amended, by
establishing a service charge of seven percent of the annual net shelter rent obtained from this

RE: Neighborhood Enterprise Zone Certi?cate Application for the rehabilitation of a 91-
unit multi?family residential mixed-use development located at 4417 Second Avenue
in the Sheridan Propco Neighborhood Enterprise Zone area. (RECOMMEND
APPROVAL)

The of?ce of the City Flaming Commission (CPC) has received an application requesting a
Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) certi?cate forwarded from the of?ce of the City Clerk for
the rehabilitation of a 91-unit multi-family residential mixed-use development located at 4417
Second Avenue. This application corresponds to a quali?ed facility which will be newly
renovated. The project consists of limestone repair, facade/lentil work, new windows, flooring,
kitchen and bathroom renovation, lobby renovations inclusive of millwork, elevator work,
security/intercom system, lighting and doors. CPC staff has reviewed the applications and
recommends approval.

The subject property has been con?rmed as being within the boundaries of the Sheridan Propco
NEZ which was established by a vote of Council on September 10, 2019, and should be eligible
for NEZ certi?cates under State Act 147 of 1992 as currently written. The anticipated cost of
rehabilitation for 4417 Second Avenue is $1,753,600.00, at a cost of 1 9,270.00 per unit. The
applicant is seeking a 15 year tax abatement. The NEZ certi?cate application appears to have
been submitted after the issuance of applicable building permits. HoWever, given the historic
nature of the property the issuance of the requested certi?cate is permissible per Sec. of
PA. 147 of 1992 which states:

(2) An application may be filed after a building permit is issued only if 1 or more of the following apply:
For a rehabilitated facility if all or a portion ofthe rehabilitated facility is a qualified historic
building.

MEMORANDUM

TO: David Massaron, Chief Financial Officer
City of Detroit

Arthur Jemison, Group Executive
Planning, Housing and Development

CC: Honorable Colleagues
Louise Jones, Senior City Clerk
Stephanie Washington, Legislative Liaison

FROM: Council President Brenda Jones 59,
DATE: October 1, 2019
RE: Additional Questions and Concerns in Response to ??Responses to

September 17 Memos on Blight Removal Bond.?

 

Please see the additional questions and concerns in response to your September 27, 2019 memo
entitled ?Responses to September 17 Memos on Blight Removal Bond.?

During the deal discussions, stressed the importance of proactive workforce
development rather than reactive. We cannot continue to allow contractors to say that there are
not enough qualified Detroiters for hire. Although the US. Census Bureau reports a decrease in
unemployment within the City of Detroit, there are still over 200,000 unemployed Detroiters in
desperate need of work. The blight elimination strategy provides another unique opportunity for
the City of Detroit to provide employment opportunities for Detroit residents. Although there
are reports supporting the impact of blight elimination on public safety, the true solution to the
elimination of crime is fighting hard to ensure that residents have access to quality, good paying
jobs. As elected officials, it is our responsibility to ensure that decisions such as this bond issue
not only benefit the City of Detroit as a whole financially, but also increase economic stability
within our neighborhoods in totality. It is crucial that the blight elimination strategy is
utilized as a reinvestment into our community through the hiring of Detroiters.

Furthermore, unless provided in a follow up memo, there have been no guarantees provided that
contractors benefiting from the in blight elimination strategy contracts will be required
to hire Detroiters nor have there been any guarantees provided that Detroiters are trained and

ready to be hired by demolition contractors. There also is no current hiring outreach plan by the
Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation.

1. When does the administration plan to meet individually with contractor companies
individually to understand their staffing needs and timelines, and construct individual or
shared recruitment (as appropriate), training and placement strategies to meet the needs
of the Demo provider community?

2. With the S420M investment in blight, what is the plan for marketing and outreach
of contract opportunities to Detroiters?

3. Please provide timelines.

3. How many jobs are expected to be created annually as a result of the blight elimination
strategy?

4. How many Detroiters today are currently trained and prepared to be hired by demolition
contractors?

5. With the influx of new skilled trades jobs that will be created as a result of the blight
elimination strategy and the massive database of ready to work Detroiters created as a
result of the FCA employment initiative, what is the administration?s plan to ensure that
mass database of ready to work Detroiters are trained, prepared, qualified and hired by
demolition contractors?

6. What guarantees are in place to ensure that if 100% qualified Detroiters apply for
positions on Detroit demolition contracts, 100% of qualified Detroiters are hired?

Based upon the dollar amount spent bi-annually, the proposed procurement process does allow
the legislative body to review and receive reports on the process every six-months, however
there are no guarantees in place that the proposed procurement process will be utilized. In fact,
the Office of Contracting and Procurement is only planning to pilot this program in the winter
which further provides no guarantee prior to the ballot initiative vote and possible approval that
adequate oversight will be achieved.

Please provide additional details on the pilot procurement program for demolition including, but
not limited to, the following:

1. Projected number of demolition contracts per each two (2) year demolition submission
cycle.

2. Projected number of properties included in each contract.

3. Length of time for each contractor to complete the demolition of their assigned package
of properties.

4. Goals and metrics used to measure the success of demolition contractors.

5. Contractor reporting requirements to the Office of Contracting and Procurement.

6. Interdepartmental collaboration strategy between the Detroit Building Authority and the
Office of Contracting and Procurement for the demolition of properties annually.



11.

12.

The number of demolition field liaisons employed by the Detroit Building Authority.
The number of properties assigned to each demolition field liaison weekly.
The length of time spent at each demolition site by each demolition field liaison.

. Proof of the demolition field liaisons? ability to efficiently monitor each of their assigned

properties.

How many contractors have received equalization credits that have resulted in
successfully winning demolition contract bids?

What is the total dollar amount of those contracts?

Additional Concerns:

1.

It has been stated that bond funds are ineligible to be utilized for foreclosure prevention.
Please provide a report detailing any federal or state law provisions that prohibit the use
of the bond funds for foreclosure prevention.

Please submit a 5-year foreclosure prevention and assistance plan complete with a
detailed budget and source of funds for the assistance.

Please submit a community engagement strategy to ensure residents are informed of the
impacts of mass demolition in their neighborhoods and have an input on the use of vacant
land following the completion of the demolition strategy.

I am requesting that the administration submit a blight elimination strategy agreement including
the following:

Bi?annual demolition contract approval with the following set asides for years one
through three ofthe blight elimination strategy:
a. 30% of the contracts set aside for businesses that have 51% Detroit-based
residents only
b. 30% of the contracts set aside for Detroit-based/headquartered businesses only
c. 40% of the contracts set aside forjoint-ventu re contracts with Detroit-based small
business only
Bi-annual demolition contract approval with the following set asides after year three:
a. 70% of the contracts set aside for businesses that have 51% Detroit-based
residents only
b. 30% of the contracts set aside for Detroit-based/headquartered businesses only
3-month reporting requirement on demolition operations including, but not limited to,
the following:
a. Number of homes demolished
b. Proof of Detroit Building Authority demolition field liaisons? visits to each property

Detroiters are trained for demolition employment and informed of hiring opportunities.

5. Requirement that the Office of Contracting and Procurement host an employment fair
quarterly in collaboration with the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation for
contractors that fall below the 51% Detroit-based employees threshold

6. Mandatory attendance at employment fair for contractors that fall below the 51%
Detroit-based employees threshold

7. Mandatory hiring reporting bi-annually for all contractors fall below the 51% Detroit?
based employees threshold including, but not limited to, the following:

a. Number of employees

Number of Detroit-resident employees

Number of applicants

Number of Detroit?resident applicants

Number of hires
