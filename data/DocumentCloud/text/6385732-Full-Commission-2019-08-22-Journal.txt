INVOCATION
Chair Bell introduced of Pastor Risarg “Reggie” Huff of Shekinah Tabernacle Gospel
Church, who gave the following invocation:
“Our Gracious God in heaven - It is our privilege to invite you here as the guest of
honor to open this Commission Meeting. It is our request that you would bless this meeting,
but more than that and of first importance, we desire that you would be here with us this
morning.
Among other things, Oh God, you are the Creator of the human mind, which you
modeled in some fashion after your own great mind. Though we acknowledge that your
thoughts are infinitely higher and more profound than ours, we glory in the notion that we may,
on our own level, think some of your thoughts after you in this place. Thank you for the
precious gifts of knowledge and discovery, as well as compassion, fairness, patience and love.
I ask on behalf of those gathered here that you would indeed bless each of these
Commissioners and our honored guests who are here today. Give them the grace to make a
difference for the good as they tackle the legislative and business affairs of our great County of
Wayne.
•
For those who find themselves at odds with their colleagues, grant not
only the knowledge they will need to make a decision, but also wisdom to listen, to understand
to respect the right of each to disagree.
•
For those who will be bringing up new legislation give them a sense of
what is right and good and appropriate in the often-confusing issues we all face.
•
For those who stand in opposition, may they draw courage and strength
from you. May they serve our county with integrity and honor.
•
For all of these who represent a constituency of which they are a part, we
ask that they may make a significant contribution to the general welfare of our society. May
they especially be a blessing to those whose lives they will personally touch, and thus make
decisions with compassion, fairness, and honor.
And now, may you be pleased with what will be done here this morning
(afternoon, evening). Thank you for your presence.
It is in the name above all others that I pray, Amen.”
