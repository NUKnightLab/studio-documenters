CORPORATE GOAL
Plan Forward Goal #3: Expand services to more residents, targeted to their needs, and at critical
milestones in their lives. This grant program will provide the monetary assistance Section 3 Residents
and Businesses need to start and expand their businesses and will allow them to move toward selfsufficiency.
FUNDING:

Section 3 Fund

GENERAL BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION
On March 8, 2013 the CHA agreed to enter into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (VCA) with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in order to fully comply with the requirements
of Section 3 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1968.
As per the VCA, the CHA may collect monetary payments from contractors to be deposited to the CHA
Section 3 Fund. Any funds collected by the CHA for the Section 3 Fund must be expended for purposes
related to Section 3. Financial assistance from the Section 3 fund may be used for the payment of tuition,
union initiation fees, dues, tools, equipment and work clothing. The VCA also stipulates that the CHA
create a competitive process to determine eligibility for assistance from the fund.
The CHA has developed both a pilot competitive grant program and a pilot need-based program to assist
low-income residents and businesses in Chicago. Priority will be given to Section 3 Residents and
Businesses that are CHA public housing residents and Housing Choice Voucher participants. The
competitive grant program will be open for a period of 60 days in which Section 3 Businesses can submit
an application for an amount up to $20,000. Applications will be scored and awarded based on the

 highest scores. The need-based grants will be smaller monetary amounts (up to $5,000) and available
to Section 3 Residents and Businesses as hardships arise (for example, a Section 3 Business Concern is
awarded a contract and needs assistance in paying insurance or bonding fees). The need-based grants
will be available until the funds are exhausted.
Conclusion
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Chief Legal Officer concurs with the recommendation to enter into a Pilot Section 3 Grant Program,
in the amount of $750,000.00 for the first year with the option to extend the program subject to funding
availability. The Section 3 Grant program will utilize $500,000 for the competitive grants ($5,000$20,000) and $250,000 for rolling, need-based grants (up to $5,000).
The CEO recommends the authorization to enter into a Pilot Section 3 Grant Program, in the amount of
$750,000.00 for the first year with the option to extend the program subject to funding availability. The
Section 3 Grant program will utilize $500,000 for the competitive grants ($5,000-$20,000) and $250,000
for rolling, need-based grants (up to $5,000).
