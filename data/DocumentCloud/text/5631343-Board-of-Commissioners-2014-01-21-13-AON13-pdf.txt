 GENERAL BACKGROUND
CHA procured the services of Aon, which has also been CHA's insurance broker and consultant of
record since 2006, to provide risk control assessments pursuant to RFP No. 11-08842 released in
November 2011. The original contract term was for the period of May 31, 2012 through May 30,
2013. The CHA amended the contract to extend the original contract term by 7 months to allow
Aon to complete the risk control assessments it had promised to perform.
The scope of work was to inspect 100 CHA developments in accordance with the inspection
criteria utilized in CHA's Risk Control Program, which CHA's private management companies are
expected to follow. Inspections were conducted in all senior and family development sites, as well
as various scattered site locations. Inspections were conducted by Aon’s risk control consultants,
with assistance from MBE partner Lambent Risk Management, performing 20% of the site visits.
Aon conducted a general tour of each facility, accompanied by management and maintenance
staff. A review of records, loss prevention efforts, and a fire protection equipment assessment was
performed for each of the developments. If any adverse, unsafe conditions or practices were found,
immediate feedback was given so that corrective actions could be taken immediately. Of the 343
recommendations made, 15 were considered critical in nature and corrective actions were
immediately taken in order to prevent future loss of physical assets or bodily injury to residents.
In addition to identifying unsafe conditions within the portfolio, the information and reports
generated are shared with potential insurers, which reinforce the positive strides made by the
Authority, which help change previously held opinions by the underwriting community. By
changing perceptions with hard data, we are able to garner more interest from insurers, which
creates competition and more favorable pricing for the insurance coverage necessary to protect
Authority assets.
The inspection process is critical to the risk management process, functioning as a control measure
to help the Authority protect its physical assets and resident population by identifying adverse
issues. The Authority’s per claim retention (deductible) for both general liability and property
claims is $250,000. Therefore, it is critical to have this element of control built into the risk
management process so that adverse issues are corrected, eliminating potential incidents and
resulting claims are avoided.
Aon has met all performance measures during the first year of the current contract.
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable
Chicago Housing Authority board policies and all applicable federal ("HUD") procurement laws.
The EVP concurs with the recommendation to exercise the option year with of Contract No. 11123
Aon Risk Services, Inc. of Illinois for Risk Control Inspections.
The CEO/President recommends the approval to exercise the option year of Contract No. 11123
with Aon in an amount not-to exceed $80,000.00 to provide risk control inspections.
