SCOPE: REHAB BUILDING AND ERECT A NEW SIDE ADDITION
EXISTING CONDITIONS
Erected ca. 1950, the building at 4120-4128 Second is a one-story commercial structure that most recently
housed the Will Leather Goods retail store. The building features steel beam and concrete block
construction and is topped with a flat roof. Exterior walls are concrete block on the side and rear facades
and a buff-colored Roman brick on the primary elevation. Windows at the side façades are glassblock with
the exception of the south-facing windows at the entry vestibule. The primary façade features wood
storefront windows and an entry door, which were added to the building in 2015. A concrete parking area
is located to the south of the building.

- PROPOSAL
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking this body’s approval to rehabilitate the building in order
to accommodate the establishment of a new restaurant within its interior space. Specific work items
associated with the project include the following:
South Elevation Addition
 At south/side of building, erect a new 1-story, steel-frame enclosed seating area. The addition will
feature a flat roof with skylights and integrated planters. The addition’s footprint will measure 20’5”x 99’-5”. The addition will measure in height 16’-6”.
 White metal panels will be located at the cornice and base
 The rear/easternmost bay will be erected of CMU. Painted brick will clad this bay
 Windows are white operable (tri-fold) aluminum storefront units.
 Doors include an aluminum bi-fold unit at the west elevation and a single aluminum hinged door
with aluminum sidelites and transom at the south elevation
 Remove the existing acrylic “TOMBOY” signage, which was installed between 2009 and 2011
Outdoor Patio Area
 To the west on the new addition, establish a new 20’-4”x20’-6” patio area
 The patio will be enclosed with a new 3’-0”-high brick wall enclosure with integrated planter cap
Landscape/Hardscape
 Install new plantings at the parking lot (species not identified)
 Install potted plants at the sidewalk (species and style of pot not identified)
 Install plantings at new 3’-0”-high brick wall patio enclosure and addition rooftop (species not

 Erect a new 3’-0”-high CMU, brick clad (painted white) wall to the south of the addition. Install
plantings at this location (species not identified)
 At the eastern edge of the new addition and property line, replace the existing 6’-0”-high brick wall
with a new 70’-0” long, 16’-5”-high brick fence (painted white). Note, the applicant states that a
mural will be added to this wall at a future date
 At southeastern edge of parcel/parking lot, install a 2’-6”-tall brick wall with stone cap (painted
white)
South Elevation
 Create three new 11’-0”-high openings and infill existing opening with masonry (will be obscured
by new addition)
 Paint existing/visible painted masonry wall white
West Elevation
 At the eight window bays, remove four existing mullions to create four window bays. Retain
remaining existing wood mullions and window framing and paint white
 At each of the three remaining window southernmost bays, install aluminum trifold windows
(finish color white)
 At the northernmost bay, install end aluminum sliding takeout windows and fixed light window
 Install a new aluminum-frame canvas awning above the storefront windows (pink and white)
 Replace the existing, non-historic wood front door and sidelites with a set of paired metal doors
(color pink, final design not specified)
 Paint existing unpainted, buff colored brick white

 

Tuckpoint masonry where necessary

sections, have not been submitted)
Rooftop
 Install new rooftop mechanical units (dimensions/specs not provided)
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
 The existing glassblock windows, wood storefront windows at the front and side elevation, and the
wood door at the front elevation were added in 2015. See the below image, which depicts the
building’s appearance before the most recent rehab
 The building side elevation masonry walls are currently painted white, while the front elevation
brick is unpainted
 The pink color proposed for the awning and door is not on the property’s prescribed color chart.
The applicant has stated that this color reflects their branding
 The three new signs will be internally illuminated
ISSUES
 The applicant proposes to paint unpainted brick at the building’s front elevation
 See https://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/rehabilitation/rehab/masonry01.htm, in which the National
Park Service does not recommend “applying paint or other coatings such as stucco to masonry that
has been historically unpainted or uncoated…”
 The applicant proposes to install three new internally-illuminated signs.
 The new addition will be highly visible. However, it is staff’s opinion that it will be compatible
with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features of the existing historic building while
remaining distinct as a new addition

RECOMMENDATION

 As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that the new side addition will not destroy historic materials that
characterize the property and that it will be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural
features of the existing historic building and/or its historic surrounds. In addition, it is staff’s opinion that
the proposed new work will not result in the removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property. Staff therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness (COA) for the work because it meets the Secretary of the Interior Standards for
Rehabilitation, standards # 2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be
avoided and 9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be
compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment. However, staff does recommend that the Commission issue this COA with
the following conditions:




The unpainted masonry at the front elevation shall not be painted
The applicant shall submit a final full signage application to HDC staff for review and approval.
Should staff determine that the work does not meet the Standards, staff shall forward the proposal
to the Commission for review at a future meeting
The applicant shall submit a final mural proposal (for the new rear wall) to HDC staff for review
and approval prior to the work. Should staff determine that the work does not meet the Standards,
staff shall forward the proposal to the Commission for review at a future meeting

 SAUCE
WILLIS-SELDEN LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT

THE WILLIS-SELDEN LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY 110 BUILDINGS (EIGHTY-NINE OF WHICH
CONTRIBUTE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED DISTRICT) GENERALLY LOCATED IN THE VICINITY OF WEST WILLIS AND
SELDEN AVENUES BETWEEN WOODWARD AVENUE AND THIRD AVENUE, ABOUT ONE AND ONE-HALF MILES NORTH OF DOWNTOWN
DETROIT. THE CONTRIBUTING BUILDINGS WERE ERECTED BETWEEN 1875 AND 1959 AND INCLUDE THIRTY-THREE APARTMENT
BUILDINGS, TWENTY-FIVE HOUSES, FOURTEEN SMALL COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, TEN BUILDINGS WHICH ORIGINALLY HOUSED
LIGHT INDUSTRIAL, MANUFACTURING, REPAIR, OR WAREHOUSE BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS SEVEN BUILDINGS OF OTHER USES.
THE WILLIS-SELDEN LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT IS BASED ON THE WILLIS-SELDEN HISTORIC DISTRICT AS LISTED ON THE
NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES; HOWEVER, THE LOCAL DISTRICT INCLUDES A SOMEWHAT GREATER NUMBER OF
CONTRIBUTING BUILDINGS THAN THE NATIONAL REGISTER DISTRICT.

HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF 4120 SECOND AVE.

4120 SECOND AVENUE IS LISTED AS A CONTRIBUTING RESOURCE TO THE WILLIS-SELDEN LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICT. ALTHOUGH
VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN OF IT’S PREVIOUS USAGE, WE HAVE LEARNED THAT 4120 SECOND AVE. WAS BUILT IN 1950 AND WAS
MOST LIKELY RELATED TO THE DISTRICT’S NUMEROUS AUTO RELATED OR SERVICE BUSINESSES.

PROPOSED PROJECT

A LOCAL RESTAURATEUR PLANS TO REDEVELOP THE FORMER WILL LEATHER GOODS SPACE INTO AN PALM-SPRINGS INSPIRED
ITALIAN MARKET AND PIZZERIA. IN AN EFFORT TO MAXIMIZE DINING SPACE, A NEW ADDITION WITH OPERABLE WINDOWS IS
PROPOSED ON THE SOUTH ELEVATION WITH OUTDOOR SEATING AND LANDSCAPING. ITEMS BEING PROPOSED ON THE WEST
ELEVATION INCLUDE NEW OPERABLE WINDOWS INSTALLED IN THE EXISTING STOREFRONT, A NEW TAKE-OUT WINDOW, A NEW
CANVAS AWNING ABOVE THE STOREFRONT, AND A NEW ALUMINUM STOREFRONT SYSTEM INSTALLED IN THE CORNER VESTIBULE.
EXISTING STOREFRONT TRIM AND MASONRY ARE TO BE PAINTED WHITE THROUGHOUT. CONTEMPORARY GAS LANTERNS WILL
BE ADDED TO THE WEST AND SOUTH FACADES. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE NEIGHBORING R-5 PROPERTY, THE EXISTING PRIVACY
WALL ON THE EAST SIDE WILL BE DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT TO ALIGN WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE ADDITION FOR A NEW PUBLIC
MURAL. ALSO IN CONJUCTION WITH THE NEIGHBORING PROPERTY, A NEW MASONRY TRASH ENCLOSURE WILL BE BUILT OFF OF
THE ALLEY THAT WILL BE SHARED BY BOTH PROPERTIES. THE PARKING LOT WILL REMAIN AS EXISTING, WITH NEW PLANTINGS
AND A HEDGE BEING ADDED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ADDITION.

Meet the Artist

Tristan Eaton
Born in L.A. in 1978, Tristan Eaton started pursuing
street art as a teenager, painting everything from
billboards to dumpsters in the urban landscapes of the
cities where he lived, be it London, Detroit, or New
York. He designed his first toy for Fisher-Price at 18
years old and soon became a driving force in the world of
designer toys. Eaton's work for Kidrobot, including the
famous Dunny and Munny art toys, helped him achieve
international renown and an ever-growing fan base.
After forming his Creative Agency Thunderdog Studios
in New York City in 2004, Eaton became a leader in the
advertising and commercial-art spheres, and is regularly
commissioned by a roster of clients that includes Nike,
Versace, and even Barack Obama.
These days, Eaton is one of the most prominent street
artists working today. Eaton’s large scale mural work
features a meticulous, visual collage of pop imagery
mixed with his unique personal style, all executed with
freehand spray paint on a colossal scale. Eaton now
focuses on his Fine Art and large-scale mural work fulltime, which can be found in dozens of cities across the
globe from Paris to Shanghai. Eaton’s work can also be
seen in the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA)
permanent collection.

 Effective 10/11/2011
SUMMARY
This ordinance amends Chapter 25, Article II, of the 1984 Detroit City Code by adding
Section 25-2-181 to establish the Willis-Selden Local Historic District, and to define the elements
of design for the district.
IT IS HEREBY ORDAINED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF DETROIT THAT:
Section 1. Chapter 25, Article II, of the 1984 Detroit City Code is amended by adding
Section 25-2-181 to read as follows:
Sec. 25-2-181. Willis-Selden Local Historic District.
(A) A historic district to be known as the Willis-Selden Local Historic District is
established in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(B) This historic district designation is certified as being consistent with the Detroit Master
Plan.
(D) The defined elements of design, as provided for in Section 25-2-2 of this code, are as
follows:
(1) Height. Single-family or small multi-unit residential structures range in height from one and
one-half (1½) to two and one-half (2½) stories in height. Apartment buildings typically range
in height from two (2) stories to four (4) stories, often on high basements; a majority of these
buildings are three (3) stories in height with high basements. The apartment building at 70
West Alexandrine Avenue is eight stories in height. Commercial and other building types
typically range from one (1) to two (2) stories in height. The building at 444 West Willis
Avenue, commonly known as the Willys-Overland Building, is historically four (4) stories in
height and features a modern, set back, fifth (5th) story addition. The building at 3933
Woodward Avenue, commonly known as the Garden Theater, is three (3) stories in height.
The building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church,
features a sanctuary that is a tall, single story in height, a tower that is approximately one and
one-half (1½) times as tall as the sanctuary, and a two (2) story addition.
(2) Proportion of Buildings’ Front Façades. Front façades of single-family or small multi-unit
residential structures are typically as tall as wide or slightly taller than wide. Front façades of
apartment buildings are commonly as tall as wide or slightly taller than wide, with the
exception of broader buildings at 3761 Second Avenue, commonly known as the Coronado
Apartments, 711 West Alexandrine Avenue, 495-497 West Willis Avenue, and 477 West
Alexandrine Avenue, which are significantly wider than tall. Front façades of single-story
commercial buildings are significantly wider than tall, while multi-story commercial

 (3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

buildings and other non-residential buildings tend to be slightly wider than tall. Buildings
often occupy most or all of deep lots, resulting in side elevations of buildings that are often
substantially wider than tall.
Proportion of Openings Within the Façades. Openings typically amount to between twenty
percent (20%) and thirty-five percent (35%) of the front façade. Commercial buildings often
feature expansive storefront windows on their first (1st) floors, though in many cases these
windows have been covered with boards or closed in with brick or concrete block. Sash
windows, taller than wide, predominate on all building types. On apartment buildings, sash
windows are sometimes arranged in groupings which, together, are square or wider than tall.
A significant minority of buildings feature arched, mullioned, semicircular, casement, or
dormer windows appropriate to their respective architectural styles. Upper sashes and
transoms are occasionally subdivided into smaller panes. Casement windows are usually
subdivided into smaller panes. Door openings are typically slightly larger in scale than
window openings. Primary entrance openings are usually centered on the façades of
commercial and apartment buildings, but usually off-center on the façades of smaller
residential buildings.
Rhythm of Solids to Voids in Front Façades. Despite a variety of building types, the overall
impression is one of regular, repetitive openings arranged horizontally within façades. A
repetitive flow of storefront openings, where they exist, creates a rhythm along commercial
frontage. Smaller residential buildings as well as the building at 3901 Cass Avenue,
commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, display more varied, often
asymmetrical, arrangements of openings, but the overall impression is still one of regular,
repetitive openings.
Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings on Streets. Rhythm of spacing on streets is generally
determined by setbacks from side lot lines. The overall character of the district is one of
densely clustered, yet visually distinct, structures separated by narrow setbacks. Commercial
buildings frequently abut adjacent buildings, typically featuring no setbacks from side lot
lines, especially on Woodward Avenue where evenly spaced storefronts create a regular
spacing of buildings. There is a general regularity in the widths of subdivision lots from one
block to another, contributing to a regular rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets.
Rhythm of Entrances and/or Porch Projections. Porches on smaller residential buildings
typically project while those on other types of buildings usually do not. On residential
buildings only, entrances are often located several steps above grade to accommodate high
basements. Doorways on smaller residential buildings are often set beneath gable-roofed or
arched openings, while doorways on other buildings are typically centered on their façades.
A regular rhythm of entrances is created by a row of similar commercial buildings along
Woodward Avenue.
Relationship of Materials. A majority of buildings are faced with brick and feature stone or
cast stone trim. Single-family residential buildings are generally faced with brick and feature
wooden brackets, bay windows, vergeboards, timbering, porch supports, dentils, entablature,
or other classically inspired elements, and other details depending on style. A small number
of single-family residential buildings feature wood clapboard siding. Stone or stone facing
defines the foundations of buildings at 643-647 and 748 West Alexandrine Avenue, 481
Brainard Avenue, 3957 and 4107 Cass Avenue, and 500 West Willis Avenue, the lower
levels of buildings at 4120 Cass Avenue, 3761 Second Avenue, 495-497 West Willis
Avenue, and the entire primary façade of buildings at 624 and 627 West Alexandrine

 Avenue and 3977 Cass Avenue. The buildings at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as
Cass Avenue Methodist Church, 3900 and 3977 Second Avenue, and 4100 Third Avenue are
composed primarily of stone. Sash windows are historically wood but have, in many cases,
been replaced with windows of more modern materials. Stone is used for window sills on a
majority of buildings within the district. While roofs within the district are generally flat and
not visible, pitched roofs typically feature visible slate or asphalt shingles. Buildings at 686
Selden and 711 West Alexandrine Avenue feature clay tile roofs. The building at 3901 Cass
Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, features a copper roof on its
tower.
(8) Relationship of Textures. On a majority of buildings within the district, the major textural
effect is that of brick with mortar joints juxtaposed with cast stone or limestone trim.
Patterned brickwork is used to create subtle detail on commercial and apartment buildings,
such as spandrels and rectangular panels, and more pronounced textural interest where it
exists on the upper stories of buildings, such as at 461 West Alexandrine Avenue, and in an
arcaded cornice on the building at 711 West Alexandrine Avenue. Where they exist, detailed
wooden vergeboards, gables, brackets, and dormers create considerable textural interest on
all single-family residential buildings in the district. Rough-cut stone with thick mortar joints
creates considerable textural interest on buildings where it exists, while other buildings
feature smooth stone with thin mortar joints. In general, asphalt shingle roofs do not
contribute to textural interest.
(9) Relationship of Colors. Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate
on wall surfaces, while natural stone colors in shades of gray, red, and brown also exist.
Although most roofs are flat and therefore not visible, sloped roofs typically feature gray
asphalt, while some feature red or green clay tile or slate in contrasting colors of gray, red, or
green. Wooden architectural details are frequently painted in bold colors, appropriate to the
architectural style of the buildings, which contract markedly with brick facing. Brick
apartment buildings are generally unpainted, with gray stone trim contrasting with brown or
buff brickwork. Brick on commercial buildings is frequently painted in shades of yellow or
orange. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are
always acceptable for that building and may provide guidance for similar buildings.
(10) Relationship of Architectural Details. Buildings in the district exemplify a broad range of
architectural styles, and their architectural details relate to their style. Pre-1880 residential
buildings, as well as commercial buildings on Woodward Avenue, are Italianate in style.
Single-family residential buildings are often Queen Anne or Stick/Eastlake in style.
Romanesque Revival structures include the building at 3977 Second Avenue, commonly
known as the Campbell-Symington House, and the building at 3901 Cass Avenue,
commonly known as the Cass Avenue Methodist Church. Larger apartment buildings
include the Spanish Medieval building at 624 West Alexandrine Avenue, commonly known
as the El Moore Flats, and several buildings in Beaux Arts and Colonial Revival styles. Also
represented are the Jacobethan Revival, Craftsman, Spanish Colonial, Late Gothic, and NeoGeorgian styles. Buildings range from vernacular to high style in appearance, with the level
of architectural detail varying greatly from one building to the next.
(11) Relationship of Roof Shapes. Most apartment buildings and all nonresidential buildings have
flat roofs that cannot be seen from the ground, with the exception of the building at 3901
Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, with prominent cross
gables defining its nave and transept and a hip roof defining a two-story addition. Single-

 family residential buildings feature multiple roof shapes, with steep, intersecting gables,
dormers, towers, and tall chimneys creating dramatic silhouettes. Flat-roofed apartment
buildings often feature stepped or triangular parapet walls, occasionally with crenellation or
balustrades, which add interest to the building’s roofline.
(12) Walls of Continuity. Setbacks of residential buildings tend to vary slightly from one building
to the next, but generally create a wall of continuity on all streets in the district, except where
building demolition has created vacant lots. The continuous façades of commercial
buildings, where they exist in rows, create significant walls of continuity in the district.
Fencing, often modern steel units that resemble historic cast or wrought iron fencing, exists
at the front lot line of many properties and suggests an additional wall of continuity. Mature
trees and public lighting fixtures generally do not contribute to a wall of continuity due to
their irregular placement throughout the district.
(13) Relationship of Significant Landscape Features and Surface Treatments. The overall
impression is that east-west streetscapes are abundantly planted whereas north-south
streetscapes are not. Typical treatment of individual residential properties is a shallow, flat
front lawn in grass turf, subdivided by a straight concrete walk leading to the front entrance.
Alleys provide access to the rear of a majority of lots in the district; a small number of these
lots contain garages in the rear accessed via the alley. Trees, hedges, and other landscaping
features are irregularly spaced. Trees in the front yards of buildings vary in size, age, and
species. Most commercial buildings, and a smaller number of apartment buildings, are built
up to the front lot line. Public sidewalks run alongside all streets in the district. Curbs, while
historically stone, have been replaced with concrete in a majority of the district. Public
lighting is generally of the modern, steel, pole-mounted variety, though wrought iron-style
light fixtures exist on Woodward Avenue.
(14) Relationship of Open Space to Structures. Front and side yards range from shallow to
nonexistent, while most smaller residential buildings feature rear yards. Other than public
rights-of-way, large areas of open space exist only where they have been created by building
demolition; sometimes these spaces serve as parking lots or are maintained as open lawns.
(15) Scale of Façades and Façade Elements. Single-family residential buildings are moderate to
large in scale relative to typical buildings from the period in which they were constructed.
Apartment buildings range from small to large in scale, with a small number of buildings,
such as the building at 70 West Alexandrine and the building at 3751-73 Second Avenue,
commonly known as the Coronado Apartments, being significantly larger in scale than the
others. The building at 444 West Willis Avenue, commonly known as the Willys-Overland
building, is also large in scale. Elements within the façades are generally small to medium in
scale.
(16) Directional Expression of Front Elevations. Façades of single-family residential structures
are generally vertical in directional expression due to tall window and door openings and
peaked rooflines. Apartment buildings generally range from neutral to slightly vertical in
directional expression, though a smaller number are horizontal in directional expression.
Commercial buildings, especially single-story ones, are generally horizontal in directional
expression due to broad storefront windows and, where they exist, horizontal cornices.
(17) Rhythm of Building Setbacks. A degree of irregularity is introduced by varying setbacks of
front façades; smaller residential buildings tend to be set several feet back from the public
sidewalk, while larger apartment buildings and other buildings often occupy their entire
lots. While setbacks may vary slightly from one building to the next the overall impression

 is one of a consistent rhythm of building setbacks. Where building demolition has occurred,
the original rhythmic progression of buildings has been disrupted.
(18) Relationship of Lot Coverages. Lot coverages within the district are generally high, but vary
based on building type. Single-family residential buildings and smaller apartment buildings
often occupy between twenty percent (20%) and forty percent (40%) of their lots, with
much of the remaining space being devoted to rear yards. Other building types range from
fifty percent (50%) to one hundred percent (100%) lot coverage. Large buildings may have
light courts or central courtyard spaces. Commercial buildings, in particular, often occupy a
large percentage of their lots.
(19) Degree of Complexity Within the Façades. The façades within the district range from simple
to complex, depending on style. Overall, front façades tend to be simple in their massing
and mostly regular in their fenestration, though a variety of window and door shapes,
materials, architectural elements, and details of individual buildings increase the overall
level of complexity of the district.
(20) Orientation, Vistas, Overviews. Buildings generally face the streets and are entered from the
front façade by a single or double doorway. The tallest buildings within the district, such as
the building at 70 West Alexandrine Avenue, the building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly
known as Cass Avenue Methodist Church, the building at 3761 Second Avenue, commonly
known as the Coronado Apartments, and the building at 444 West Willis Avenue,
commonly known as the Willys-Overland Building, constitute landmarks that are clearly
visible from several blocks away. The buildings on Woodward Avenue, visible from a
considerable distance up and down the street, are a significant component of a broader
streetscape.
(21) Symmetric or Asymmetric Appearance. The appearance of front façades in the district is, for
the most part, symmetrical. Single-family residential buildings tend to display a modest
degree of asymmetry in massing and architectural detail.
(22) General Environmental Character. The general character of the district is that of a mediumdensity, mixed-use, urban neighborhood of small to large apartment buildings interspersed
with other building types. The district maintains a sense of vitality as a result of its mixture
of uses and the correspondingly diverse physical appearance of its buildings.
