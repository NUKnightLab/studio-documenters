honor, glory and praise. Lord, we thank you because you are the master and the ruler of the
Heavens and Earth, the God that dwells in us and above us. Our God, I ask that you would
open our hearts and our minds that we hear your word, your voice. Lead us and guide us,
make us masters of ourselves that we may yet be servants and facilitators to others. Lord, as
we go forth this morning, I ask that your spirit would come and be upon and be a presence with
us. Bless us, guide us, open our hearts and minds to your way and your will. Now God, help
us to straighten out all the wrinkles, press them out, that we work in unification with one
another doing what is best for this city and the leaders. Bless this country. Now Father God,
