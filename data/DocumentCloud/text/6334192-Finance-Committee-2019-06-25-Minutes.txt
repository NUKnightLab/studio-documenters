PROPOSED BID RECOMMENDATION
Department: Department of Planning and Development
Request: Authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to enter into

a construction contract for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) improvements at the Forest
Preserves’ Central Garage, with Ideal Heating Company of Brookfield, Illinois
Reason: Contract #74000006072 issued under project #19-80-40 Central Garage HVAC Renovations

and Alterations includes, but is not limited to, demolition of an existing sixty-five (65) year old steam boiler
that has reached the end of its useful life as well as demolition of existing inefficient HVAC equipment
and installation of more energy efficient systems.
Improvements to this critical vehicle maintenance building are projected to save approximately 62.4 metric
tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year (equal to the amount of emissions produced by thirteen (13)
cars each driving about 11,750 miles) and to save approximately $9,500.00 per year in utility costs
equating to 28 percent of current utility costs. This building is the Forest Preserves’ third largest natural
gas consumer and this work will help achieve the Forest Preserves’ goal to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Approximately $11,000.00 in utility company rebates will contribute roughly 1.1 percent of the project
costs.
