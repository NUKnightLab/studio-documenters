Re: Home Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)
requesting approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program grant to be used for the
rehabilitation of approximately 20 single-family homes for low- and very-low income
households in the following municipalities: Bellwood, Berkeley, Broadview, Brookfield,
Bridgeview, Chicago Ridge, Forest Park, Franklin Park, Hillside, LaGrange, LaGrange Park,
Maywood, Melrose Park, Northlake, Schiller Park, Stone Park and Summit. The project
complies with the HOME Program regulations and furthers the goals of the Five-Year
Consolidated Community Development Plan (approved by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development on October 17, 2000).

197

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 6, 2004

The HOME Program grant of $ 1,000,000.00 will be made between West Suburban
Neighborhood Preservation Agency (WSNPA) and the County of Cook. WSNPA has
previously been a successful participant with HOME Program and Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funds . Approval of this grant will enable WSNPA to continue their
Owner-occupied Single-family Rehabilitation Program. Pennanent liens are placed on the
properties for the amount of the rehabilitation by the West Suburban Neighborhood
Preservation Agency. After rehabilitation is completed, WSNPA then assigns the Note,
Owner's Participation Agreement, and Junior Mortgage to Cook County. The Cook County
HOME Program will recapture funds expended on the projects when these homes are sold,
transferred, or otherwise alienated and title is transferred.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including, but not
limited to the Subgrantee Agreement and any modifications thereto.

DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT, by Gwendolyn D.

Re: HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)
respectfully requests approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program Loan in the
amount of $2,000,000.00. The Joan will be a limited partnership to be formed by Affordable
Housing Continuum, a non-profit Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO),
or its wholly owned subsidiary, and PSL Holdings, LLC (parent company of Associated
Ventures, LLC/Pathway Senior Living, LLC) a for-profi t development company, together with
the low income housing tax credit syndicator. The loan will be for the construction of a 110
(99 HOME assisted units) affordable, rental, senior assisted care housing faci lity to be located
at l 67th Street and Crawford Avenue in Country Club Hills, Illinois. In addition to the
HOME funds, other anticipated financing will include a first mortgage insured through the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 232 Insured
Mortgage Loan Program, equity raised through the sale of Low Income Housing Tax Credits
and deferred developer fees. The development budget is estimated at $17,621,521.00 of which
$2,000,000.00 accounts for approximately 11.3% of the total project costs.
The tenns of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year amortized loan at 1%
interest. It is anticipated that the County will receive annual principal and interest payments of
$60,685 .45 , to be used for other HOME eligible activities. Due to HUD Section 232
requirements, the County will on ly be receiving an annual payment rather than monthly
payments.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
County of Cook, or his designee, be authorized to execute on behalf of the County of Cook,
any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including but not

WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called famed singer and actress, Etta Moten

WHEREAS, a native of Weimer, Texas, Etta Moten Barnett was born Etta Geraldine, the only child of

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 6, 2004

WHEREAS, Etta was steeped in religion and was very active in programs provided by the six churches
her father pastored in Texas and California. One of her primary recreational outlets was the church choir,
in which she sang with her mother; and
WHEREAS, when the family moved to Kansas, Etta would eventually enroll at the University of Kansas,
opting to major in voice and drama. She also hosted a radio show while in school; and
WHEREAS, Etta's vocal gifts led to a touring opportunity with the Jubilee Sisters and her introduction to
a prominent musician, Dr. Eva .lessye, who encouraged Etta to move to New York and make an attempt at
a career as a professional entertainer; and
WHEREAS, upon arriving in New York, Etta quickly found work in show business in a variety of lead
and supporting roles; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Jessye's steady encouragement and nurturing soon led to a series of life changing events
for Etta. Dr. .lessye just so happened to prepare the choral arrangements for one our nation's most famous
songwriters, George Gershwin. She introduced Etta to Mr. Gershwin, who immediately pegged her for
the role of Bess, in the opera "Porgy and Bess"; and
WHEREAS, due to the fact that Etta was already signed to appear in the film "Flying Down to Rio" with
legendary actors Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, she was unable to immediately accept the role; and
WHEREAS, it wasn't until 1942 when Etta would actually play the role of Bess, a role with which she
will forever be associated; and
WHEREAS, Etta's vocal talents would ultimately take her around the globe, but her sense of values and
social conscience kept her grounded; and
WHEREAS, with the passing of Etta Moten Barnett, we have lost a brilliant vocalist, actress and
educator who toured the world, walked among royalty, yet never lost the common touch . Etta Moten
Barnett brought dignity and grace to every endeavor she undertook and, up until her last moments on this
earth, set a fine example for all to follow.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and
most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as the many friends and loved ones of Etta Moten Barnett;
and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be tendered to the family of Etta
Moten Barnett so that her ground breaking, historic legacy of excellence in the arts may be so honored
and ever cherished.
