SECT ION 4.

BOOK-ENTRY PROVISIONS.

The Bonds shall be initia lly issued in the form of a separate single fully registered Bond for each
of the maturities of the Bonds. Upon initial issuance, the ownership of each such Bond shall be registered
in the Bond Register in such name as may be provided by the Depository (the "Book Entry Owner") and,
accordingly, in Book Entry Form as provided and defined herein. Any Designated Officer is authori zed
to execute a Representations Letter or to utili ze the provisions of an existing Representations Letter.
Without limiting the gene ra lity of the authority given with respect to entering into the Representations
Letter for the Bonds, it may contain provisions relating to (a) payment procedures, (b) transfers of the
Bonds or of beneficial interests therein, (c) redemption notices and procedures unique to the Depository,
(d) add itional notices or communications, and (e) amendment from time to time to conform with changing
customs and practices with respect to securities industry tra nsfer and payment practices. With respect to
Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of the Book Entry Owner, neither the County nor the
Trustee shall have any responsibi lity or obligation to any broker-dealer, bank, or other financial insti tution
for which the Depository holds Bonds from time to time as securities depository (each such broker-dealer,
bank, or other financial institution being referred to herein as a "Deposito1y Participant") or to any
person on behalf of whom such a Depository Participant holds an interest in the Bonds. Without limiting
the meaning of the immediately preceding sentence, neither the County nor the Trustee shall have any
responsibility or obligation with respect to (a) the accuracy of the records of the Depository, the Book
Entry Owner, or any Depository Participant w ith respect to any ownership interest in the Bonds; (b) the
delivery to any Depository Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as
shown in the Bond Register or as expressly provided in the Representations Letter, of any notice w ith
respect to the Bonds, includi ng any notice of redemption; or (c) the payment to any Depository
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of
any amount with respect to princ ipal of or interest on the Bonds. No person other than a regi stered owner
of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register sha ll receive a Bond certificate with respect to any Bond. In the
event that (a) the County determines that the Depository is incapable of discharging its responsibilities
described herein or in the Representations Letter, (b) the agreement among the County and the Depository
evidenced by the Representations Letter shall be termi nated for any reason, or (c) the County determines
that it is in the best interests of the County or of the beneficial owners of the Bonds that they be able to
obtain certificated Bonds; the County shall notify the Depository of the availab ility of Bond certificates,
and the Bonds sha ll no longer be restricted to being registered in the Bond Register to the Book Entry
Owner. The County may determine at s uch time that the Bonds shall be registered in the name of and

County, or s uch depository's agent or designee, but if the County does not select such successor
depository, then the Bonds shall be registered in whatever name or names registe red owners of Bonds
transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate, in accordance with the provisions hereof.
SECT ION 5.

REDEMPTION.

If so provided in the re levant Bond Order or Indenture, any Bonds may be redeemable prior to

prices (to be expressed as a percentage of the princ ipa l amount of C urrent Interest Bonds or Variable Rate
Bonds to be redeemed and as a percentage of the Compound Accreted Value of Capital Appreciation
Bonds to be redeemed) not to exceed one hundred three percent (103 .00%), plus, in the case of C urrent
Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds, accrued interest to the date of redemption, as determined by the
Chief Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof. If less than all of the outstanding Bonds of a series
are to be optionally redeemed, the Bonds to be cal led shall be called from such series, in such principal
amounts and from s uch maturities as may be determined by the County and within any maturity by lot
within a maturity in the manner hereinafter provided. Any Current Interest Bonds or Variable Rate Bonds
may be made s ubject to mandatory redemption, at par and accrued interest to the date fi xed for

69 1

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 7, 2002

redemption, as determined by the C hi ef Financial Officer at the time of the sale thereof and as set forth in
the relevant Bond Order or Indenture. The terms and provisions for any redemption of Variable Rate
Bonds shall be as determined by the Chief Financial Officer at the time of sale of the Bonds and as set
forth in a relevant Indenture, provided that such terms shall be within the limitations set forth in this
Section.
In connection with any mandatory redemption of Bonds as authorized above, the principal
amounts of such Bonds to be mandatorily redeemed in each year may be reduced through the earl ier
optional redemption thereof, with any partial optional redemptions of s uch Bonds credited against future
mandatory redemption requirements in s uch order of the mandatory redemption dates as the Chief
Financial Officer may determine. In the absence of such determination, partial optional redemptions of
such Bonds sha ll be credited against future mandatory redemption requirements in inverse chronological
order of s uch payments beginning with the amount scheduled to become due at Stated Maturity, then the
amount subject to mandatory redemption in the year preceding Stated Maturity, and so on. In addition, on
or prior to the 60th day preceding any mandatory redemption date, the Trustee may, and if directed by the
Chief Financial Officer shall, purchase Bonds of such maturities in an amount not exceeding the amount
of such Bonds required to be retired on such mandatory redemption date and at a price not exceeding par
plus accrued interest. Any such Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and the principal amount thereof
shall be credited agai nst the payment required on such next mandatory redemption date.
The County shall, at least 45 days prior to the redemption date (unless a shorter time shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such redemption date, the years of maturity and principal
amounts of Bonds to be redeemed and, if applicable, the mandatory redemption payment so affected.
Current Interest Bonds sha ll be redeemed only in the principal amount of $5,000 each and integral
multiples thereof, and Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be redeemed only in amounts representing $5,000
Maturity Amount and integral multiples thereof. In the event of the redemption of less than all the Bonds
of a series of like maturity, the aggregate principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) thereof to
be redeemed shall be $5,000 or an integral multiple thereof, and the Trustee shall assign to each such
Bond of such maturity a distinctive number fo r each $5,000 principal amount or Maturity Amount (as
appropriate) of such Bond and shall select by lot from the numbers so assigned as many numbers as, at
$5,000 fo r each number, sha ll equal the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of such
Bonds to be redeemed. The Bonds to be redeemed shall be those to which were assigned numbers so
selected ; provided that only so much of the principal amount or Maturity Amount (as appropriate) of each
Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so selected.
T he Trustee shall promptly notify the County in writing of the Bonds or portions of Bonds
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Bond selected for partial redemption, the principal
amount thereof to be redeemed.
Unless waived by the owner of Bonds to be redeemed or as otherwise provided in an Indenture
for Variable Rate Bonds, notice of any s uch redemption shall be given by the Trustee on behalf of the
County by mailing the redemption notice by first class mail not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days prior to the date fixed for redemption to each registered owner of the Bond or Bonds to be redeemed
at the address shown on the Bond Register or at such other address as is furn ished in writing by such
registered owners to the Trustee.

identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the res pective principal amounts) of the
Bonds to be redeemed;
a statement that on the redemption date the redemption price w ill become due
( 4)
and payable upon each such Bond or portion thereof called for redemption and that interest
thereon sha ll cease to accrue from and after said date; and
the place where such Bonds are to be s urrendered for payment of the redemption
(5)
price, which place of payment sha l I be the princ ipal corporate trust office of the T rustee.
Such additional notice as may be agreed upon with the Depository shall also be given so long as
the Bonds are held by the Depository.
On or prior to any redemption date, the County shall deposit with the Trustee an a mount of
money s uffic ient to pay the redemption price of all the Bonds or portions of Bonds which are to be
redeemed on that date.
Notice of redemption having been given as provided therefor, the Bonds or portions of Bonds so
to be redeemed shall, on the redemption date, become due and payable at the redemption price therein
s pecified, and from and after such date (unless the County s hall default in the payment of the redemption
pri ce) such Bonds or portions of Bonds shall cease to bear interest. Neither the failure to mail such
redemption notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular registered owner of a Bond
sha ll affect the s ufficiency of such notice with respect to other registered owners. Notice having been
properly given, fai lure of a registered owner of a Bond to receive such notice shall not be deemed to
invalidate, limit or delay the effect of the notice or the redemption action described in the notice. Such
notice may be waived in writing by a registered owner of a Bond, either before or after the event, and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reli ance upon s uch
waiver. Upon surrender of such Bonds fo r redemption in accordance with said notice, s uch Bonds shall
be paid by the Trustee at the redemption price. Interest due on or prior to the redemption date shall be
payable as herei n provided for payment of interest. Upon surrender for any partial redemption of any
Bond, there s hall be prepared fo r the registered owner a new Bond or Bonds of the same Stated Maturity
in the amount of the unpaid principal or Maturity Amount.
With respect to any redemption of Bonds, unless moneys s ufficient to pay the redemption price of
the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving of the notice of
redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that such redemption sha ll be conditional
upon the rece ipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. If such
moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force a nd effect, the Trustee s hall not redeem such
Bonds, and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice ofredemption shall have
been given, that such moneys were not so rece ived and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If any Bond or portion of Bond cal led for redemption shall not be so paid upon s urrender thereof
fo r redemption, in the case of C urrent Interest Bonds, the princ ipa l shall, until paid, bear interest from the
redemption date at the rate borne by the Bond or portion of Bond so call ed fo r redemption; in the case of
Variable Rate Bonds, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest as provided in a relevant Indenture; and,
in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, the Compound Accreted Value at s uch redemption date shall
continue to accrue interest from such redemption date at the Yield to Maturity borne by such Capital
Appreciation Bond, or portion thereof, so called fo r redemption. All Bonds which have been redeemed
s hall be cancelled and destroyed by the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

693

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 7, 2002

Upon the payment of the redemption price of Bonds being redeemed, each check or other transfer
of funds issued for such purpose shall bear the CUSIP number identify ing, by issue and maturity, the

Ordinance relating to Book Entry Form any Capital Appreciation Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at

Indenture.
The person in whose name any Bond shall be registered shall be deemed and regarded as the
absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and payment of the principal of, premium (if any) or interest on
or any Maturity Amount of any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner
thereof or his or her legal representative. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and

Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exc hange of Bonds exchanged in the case of the issuance of
a Bond or Bonds for the outstanding portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.
If any Bond, whether in temporary or definitive form, is lost (whether by reason of theft or
otherwise), destroyed (whether by mutilation, damage, in whole or in part, or otherwise) or improperly
cancelled, the Trustee or its proper agent may authenticate a new Bond of like date, maturity date, interest
rate (or, in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds, Yield to Maturity), denomination and Original
Principal Amount (in the case of Capital Appreciation Bonds) or princ ipal amount (in the case of other
Bonds) and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding; provided that (a) in the case of any

lost Bond or Bond destroyed in whole, there shall be first furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss
or destruction, together with indemnification of the County and the Trustee, sati sfactory to the Trustee. In
the event any lost, destroyed or improperly cancelled Bond shall have matured or is about to mature, or
has been called for redemption, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Trustee shall pay the same
without surrender thereof if there shall be first furni shed to the Trustee evidence of such loss, destruction
or cancellation, together with indemnity, satisfactory to it. Upon the issuance of any substitute Bond, the
Trustee may require the payment of a sum s ufficient to cover any tax or other governmenta l charge that

SECTION 12. CREATION OF FUNDS AND APPROPRIATIONS.
A.
There is hereby created the "General Obligation Bonds, Series 2002, Bond Fund" (the
"Bond Fund"), which shall be the fund for the payment of principal of and interest on and Maturity

Accrued interest, capitalized interest and premium, if any, received upon delivery of the Bonds shall be
deposited into the Bond Fund and be applied to pay first interest coming due on the Bonds.
The Pledged Taxes shall either be deposited into the Bond Fund and used solely and only for
paying the principal of and interest on or Maturity Amount of the Bonds or be used to reimburse a fund or
account from which advances to the Bond Fund may have been made to pay principal of or interest on or
Maturity Amount of the Bonds prior to receipt of Pledged Taxes. Interest income or investment profit
earned in the Bond Fund shall be retained in the Bond Fund for payment of the principal of and interest
on Current Interest Bonds and Variable Rate Bonds and Maturity Amount of Capital Appreciation Bonds
on the interest payment date next after such interest or profit is received or, to the extent lawful and as
determined by the Chief Financial Officer, transferred to such other fu nds as may be determined. On or
after April I, 2005, capitalized interest, if any, deposited to and remaining in the Bond Fund for any
Variable Rate Bonds shall be transferred to such other funds or accou nts as the Chief Financial Officer
shall determine.
B.
The remaining proceeds of the Bonds shall be set aside in one or more separate funds of
the County, hereby created, and designated as the "Public Safety Project Fund," the "Health Fund
Project Fund, " the "Corporate Project Fund, " the "Capital Equipment Project Fund, " the "Insurance

Trustee. Moneys in the Proj ect Funds may be withdrawn or may be transferred among the Project Funds
by the County to pay the costs of the Projects upon requisition by the Chief Financial Officer or any other
employee of the County designated by the Chief Financia l Officer.
Alternatively, the Chief Financial Officer may allocate the proceeds of the Bonds to one or more
re lated project funds or accounts of the County already in existence; provided, however, that this shall not
re lieve the County and such officer of the duty to account for the proceeds as if any Project Fund or
Account were created as herein provided. T he County by its Corporate Authorities reserves the right, as
it becomes necessary from time to time, to change the purposes of expenditure of any Project Fund or its
accounts, to change priorities, to revise cost allocations between expenditures and to s ubstitute projects, in
order to meet current needs of the County; subject, however, to the provisions of the Act and to the tax
covenants of the County relati ng to the Tax Exempt status of interest on Tax Exempt Bonds.

proceeds of the Bonds shall be deposited into a separate and segregated fund, hereby created. to be known

the Bonds in accordance with normal County disbursement procedures. Any funds remaining to the
credit of the Expense Fund on the date whic h is six months fo llowing the date of delivery of the Bonds

Chief Financial Officer may direct.
D.

created. T he moneys on deposi t in each Project Fund shall be invested in any lawfu l investment for
County fund s. In addition, the Chief Financial Officer shall direct the T rustee (which direction may be by

Reason :

The Salvation Army wi ll provide community-based therapeutic services for up to sixty (60)

As an alternative to costly residential treatment facilities, MST services enable e ligible
minors to remain in their homes during treatment, without compromising public safety and at
a substantial savings to taxpayers. As of December 31 , 200 I, 262 delinq uent minors were
placed in residential treatment facilities at an average cost of over $200.00 per minor per day.
