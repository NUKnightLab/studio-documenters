WHEREAS, The Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) was developed in 2012 to encourage public
institutions to procure food produced through values-driven purchasing standards and to support successful
implementation through technical assistance and verification; and
WHEREAS, Good Food is defined by GFPP as food that is healthy, local, fair, sustainable and humane,
with foods that meet the dietary guidelines for Americans, provide freedom from chronic ailment and are
delicious and safe, and where participating food suppliers are evaluated and held accountable for ensuring
fair compensation and fair treatment of their workers, and that those workers are free of exploitation, and
where Good Food is available to purchase for all income levels and high-quality food is equitable and
physically and culturally accessible to all, and where food is produced, processed, distributed, and recycled
locally using the principles of environmental stewardship (in terms of water, soil, and pesticide

WHEREAS, Good Food purchasing refers to the sourcing and purchasing of foods and beverages, and
food and beverage service contracts, procured by County Departments and Agencies; and
WHEREAS, In participating in the Good Food Purchasing Program, Cook County will help support a
regional food system that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially responsible, and will have
an impact on the availability of local, sustainable food; and
WHEREAS, There exists in the food and composting industries limited diversity in the ownership,
production and distribution channels; and
WHEREAS, People with arrest and conviction records face significant employment challenges; and
WHEREAS, There is a need to preserve urban and peri-urban farm land with equitable minority
community ownership and control; and
WHEREAS, There are significant barriers to entry into the food industry at the ownership level, including
access to capital and information, expertise and relationships, resulting in a need for capacity building for
disadvantaged and under-capitalized businesses; and
WHEREAS, There are a number of tax credits available at the federal, state, county and city level to
incentivize investment in distressed communities and to hire very low- income employees, employees with
past criminal records, etc.; and
WHEREAS, It is recognized that the significant buying power of public institutions across the country
can reform the food system, create opportunities for smaller farmers and low-income entrepreneurs of
color to thrive, provide just compensation and fair treatment for food chain workers, support sustainable
farming practices, reward good environmental stewardship including limiting food waste and increasing
composting, and increase access to fresh and healthy foods; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, That Cook County embrace the Good Food Purchasing
Program (GFPP) as a strategy to help improve our region’s food system through the adoption and
implementation of the Good Food Purchasing Standards, which emphasize the following values:

1.

Local Economies - support small and mid-sized agricultural and food processing operations within the
local area or region.

2.

Environmental Sustainability - support producers that employ sustainable production systems that
reduce or eliminate synthetic pesticides and fertilizers; avoid the use of hormones, antibiotics, and
genetic engineering; conserve soil and water; protect and enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity;
and reduce on-farm energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.

3.

Valued Workforce - provide safe and healthy working conditions and fair compensation for all food

chain workers and producers from production to consumption

4.

Animal Welfare - provide healthy and humane care for farm animals.

of Cook County’s participation in the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP).

Priority Communities- Incentivize investment in low-to-moderate income communities where at least
51% of households have incomes at or below 80% of the area median income (AMI), as defined by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Priority will be given to communities that
also have scores ranging between 30.1 and 82.7 on the University of Illinois at Chicago Great Cities
Institute’s Economic Hardship Index
Urban Farm Land Preservation-Preserve publicly-owned vacant land for urban agriculture.
Promote conveyance of publicly-owned vacant land to local minority owned and/or controlled social
enterprises; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That Cook County Departments and Agencies involved in the
procurement or service contracting of foods will adopt Good Food Purchasing Standards, which include
options and flexibility within each of these five value categories, as a framework for guiding values-driven
purchasing; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That all relevant Cook County Departments and Agencies, with
assistance from the Chicago Food Policy Action Council, Center for Good Food Purchasing, and other
relevant diverse stakeholders, will take the following steps in support of the purchasing of Good Food:

1.

Communicate Good Food Purchasing Standards to appropriate suppliers, including distributors and
foodservice companies, and ask them to share data that will help the County complete a baseline
Good Food Purchasing assessment of food procurement practices within 12 months of the adoption
of this resolution.

2.

Incentivize businesses to grow food organically and engage in bio-dynamic agriculture, developing
incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews and other potential supports during the contracting
period; and

3.

Incentivize prospective food vendors to invest in and hire from low-to-moderate income Communities
by: 1) developing incentives for Requests for Proposal reviews for prospective vendors that
demonstrate a track record of hiring and investing in such communities; and 2) assisting prospective
vendors in navigating tax incentives and other financial programs designed to increase investment in
disadvantaged communities; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
URGING THE STATE OF ILLINOIS TO ENACT OPIOID PRESCRIPTION LIMITS
WHEREAS, the opioid epidemic in our country has risen to extreme levels, causing the deaths of tens of
thousands of Americans, and billions of dollars in economic costs; and
WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016 116 people died
every day from opioid-related drug overdoses; and
WHEREAS, 42,249 people died from overdosing on opioids in that year alone; and
WHEREAS, of those deaths, 17,087 were the result of overdosing on commonly prescribed opioids; and
WHEREAS, the cost of these drugs totaled $504 billion in 2016; and
WHEREAS, most recently, the state of Florida passed a bill to combat this crisis by instituting
prescription limits on opioids and increasing funding for treatment; and
WHEREAS, Florida will be the 25th state since 2016 that has passed legislation that imposes some limits
or guidelines on opioid prescriptions, and only the 3rd to create statutory limits of three or four days for
Schedule II painkillers like OxyContin and Fentanyl; and
WHEREAS, Illinois is not one of the states with any of these imposed limits, and as a result the opioid
epidemic remains relatively unchecked; and
WHEREAS, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) now supports policies
limiting the supply of opioids for acute pain treatment; and
WHEREAS, PhRMA has concluded that too often, individuals receive a 30-day supply of opioid
medicines for minor treatments or short-term pain, and that overprescribing and dispensing can lead to
patients taking opioids longer than necessary or to excess pills falling into the wrong hands; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the members of this board, as public servants to the
residents of Cook County, urge the Illinois General assembly to pass comprehensive legislation to limit
prescriptions to these opioids to five days in order to combat the crisis currently affecting our communities
