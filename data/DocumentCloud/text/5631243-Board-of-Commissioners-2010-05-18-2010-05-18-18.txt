ITEM NO. B8

May 12, 2010

RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE FY2010
SENIOR DESIGNATED HOUSING PLAN
To the Honorable Board of Commissioners:
RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners approve the FY2010 Senior Designated
Housing Plan (SDHP). It is further recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the
Chief Executive Officer, or his designee to approve any final changes to such FY2010 Senior
Designated Housing Plan, including but not limited to, changes based on HUD requirements or
changes, if any, resulting from any applicable future notice and public comment period.
FUNDING
No CHA Funding is applicable to this request.
EXPLANATION
Changes to the FY2010 SDHP will ensure that CHA has the flexibility to lower the minimum
age of the head of household from age 62 years to age 55 years for admission into high vacancy
senior designated properties. CHA is proposing the change for the following reasons:
•

Some of CHA’s senior designated properties have vacant units available for lease;

•

The population of near elderly individuals is growing markedly, and CHA would like to
offer the opportunity for this population to live in senior designated properties. In order to
meet the demanding housing needs of an aging population, CHA plans to lease all its
available units, thus increasing the number of senior households CHA is able to assist.

The benchmark for determining whether CHA will lower the age at a senior designated property
is that the property must have an occupancy rate lower than 90% for, at least, six months.
Furthermore, upon implementation of the FY2010 Senior Designated Housing Plan, applicants
who are 55 years old and older who require units with accessible features will be added to each
senior site-based wait list. These individuals will be given a preference on the site-based wait list
for those available accessible units.
CHA presented key changes in the FY2010 SDHP to the Central Advisory Council (CAC)
Executive Board and the council at large and their legal representatives on April 13, 2010. The
proposed changes to the FY2010 SDHP were also presented to CHA executive staff, department
directors, and assistant directors for review. Notice to residents and the public about the public
comment period and public comment hearing appeared in news ads in the Chicago Sun-Times,
Chicago Defender, and El Dia on April 7 and 8, 2010. The public comment period for the draft

 FY2010 SDHP was held April 7, 2010 through May 6, 2010. A public comment hearing was
held on April 21, 2010, at the Charles Hayes Family Investment Center. In finalizing the
FY2010 Senior Designated Housing Plan, CHA gave consideration to comments received during
the public comment period and public comment hearing.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of CHA to approve the FY2010 Senior Designated Housing Plan.
