Item No. 4

RECOMMENDATION TO EXECUTE AN INTER-GOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT WITH THE
REGIONAL HOUSING INITIATIVE AND ADOPT THE SUPPLEMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE PLAN
Presenter:

Cheryl Burns, Chief Housing Choice Voucher Officer
Cary Steinbuck, Deputy Chief PRA and Acquisitions

RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners (Board) of the Chicago Housing Authority
(CHA) authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to 1) execute an Inter-Governmental
Agreement with the Regional Housing Initiative (RHI); 2) adopt the RHI Supplemental
Administrative Plan; and 3) execute all other documents as may be necessary or appropriate to
implement the foregoing.
The Regional Housing Initiative is a consortium of 10 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) working
to identify and create affordable housing opportunities for low-income families. CHA has been a
member of RHI since its inception in 2002 and has joined with the other PHAs to create a pool of
vouchers that are project-based to the benefit of households in the 10-county region.
In 2002, CHA approved an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) that established RHI to promote
a more equitable distribution of affordable housing opportunities and that encouraged
development, rehabilitation, and preservation of quality rental housing throughout the Chicago
Metropolitan region.
The parties to the original IGA intend to restate the original commitment to the regional initiative
by entering into an updated Inter-Governmental Agreement that establishes RHI protocols. An
RHI Supplemental Administrative Plan shall be added as an addendum to establish policies for
the administration of the project based vouchers under the Regional Housing Initiative program.
Background
The Regional Housing Initiative was started in 2002 and garnered the attention of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. RHI promotes attractive mixed-income, wellmanaged housing developments that meet community and regional needs with particular focus
on locations near jobs and public transit. HUD awarded RHI a $1 million pilot grant in 2012 to
evaluate strategies for mobility moves and to develop a regional housing waiting list from
participating PHA wait lists. CHA agreed to pool a total of 350 of its vouchers with other
participating PHAs to support the creation of 778 units of newly created project-based units.
1

 Today, 597 new RHI units have been delivered with RHI pooled vouchers, including 234 new units
created from CHA’s investment.
CHA partners with the following participating Public Housing Authorities:
o DuPage Housing Authority
o Housing Authority of Cook County
o Housing Authority of Park Forest
o Housing Authority of Joliet
o Kendall Housing Authority
o Lake County Housing Authority
o McHenry County Housing Authority
o Oak Park Housing Authority
o Waukegan Housing Authority
CHA’s participation in the Regional Housing Initiative supports HUD’s goal to expand housing
options for low-income families and increase the number of units available to families that
choose to relocate to areas of opportunity.

Respectfully Submitted:
