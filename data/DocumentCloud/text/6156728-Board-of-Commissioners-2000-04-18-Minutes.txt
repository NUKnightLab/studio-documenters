 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice on
Wednesday, April 5, 2000 at the hour of 10:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County Building,
118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois, to consider the following.
233485

REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATION ORDINANCE, (PROPOSED
ORDINANCE AMENDMENT).
Transmitting a Communication dated January 13, 2000 from James M. Houlihan, County
Assessor: I request permission to have attached ordinance relating to the Cook County Real
Property Assessment Classification Ordinance placed on the agenda for consideration by the
Cook County Board of Commissioners at the meeting scheduled for Thursday, January 20,
2000. I am also requesting that the proposal be referred to the Finance Committee for further
discussion. In December, the Board of Commissioners acted positively on my request to
extend and modify property tax incentives that were scheduled to sunset at the end of the
year. These proposals were essential to continue our efforts to promote economic
development and I appreciate the confidence shown by the Board in approving them. I am
now presenting further recommendations to you that are intended to increase economic
development and housing opportunities in Cook County. I believed that these actions must
be taken to eventually ease the increasing burden upon Cook County residential property
taxpayers and create a more receptive climate for business and industry. The ordinance
changes are in response to recommendations submitted a year ago by the Tax Policy Forum,
a group of nearly 300 people representing a broad spectrum of Cook County. It is my hope
that after public hearings and careful consideration of these proposals, the Board of
Commissioners approves these changes and take the initial necessary steps to provide a more
equitable classification and property tax structure in Cook County. I appreciate your
thorough review and positive consideration of these recommendations.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATION ORDINANCE,
AS AMENDED
BE IT ENACTED BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS:
The Real Property Assessment Classification Ordinance, as from time to time amended
(November 29, 1976; June 6, 1977; September 19, 1977; May 16, 1978; January 2, 1979;

2000) is hereby amended to read as follows:
The Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares:

(I)

that in certain areas of Cook County there is a lack of viable industrial and commercial
buildings, which is contributing to substantial unemployment in such areas;

1423

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
(2)

that if existing industrial and commercial structures were improved and utilized fully, and if
new industrial and commercial structures were developed, the County's economic well-being
would be improved by an increase in the level of economic activity, by increased employment
opportunities and by a growth in the real property tax base;

* Referred to the Finance Committee on January 20, 2000.
Commissioner Carr, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved to recess the meeting until the
Call of the Chair. The motion carried.
April 12, 2000
Pursuant to notice, your Committee on Finance of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County
reconvened the meeting of April 5, 2000 on Wednesday, April 12, 2000 at the hour of I :00 P.M. in the
Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois to consider the Real
Property Assessment Classification Ordinance Amendments (Comm. No. 233485).

Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to accept the substitute version
for the proposed ordinance in Item 233485, and to receive and file the original version as presented
to this Committee on January 20, 2000 with the original Communication Number being assigned to
the new version. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moran asked if public hearings will be held to discuss this item?
Chairman Daley responded that the controversial issues have been removed from the substitute ordinance
and the belief is that there is no need to have public hearings.
Commissioner Hansen stated that he submitted questions and asked that they be entered into the record.
(The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chainnan Daley stated Commissioner Hansen's questions and the responses from the Assessor, as well as
a letter of support from Commissioner Schumann will be entered into the record . (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Assessor James Houlihan stated that the reassessment of the City of Chicago is set to begin later this
month. He stated in order to meet tax cycle deadlines for Cook County, the County should implement
changes which will allow taxpayers immediate relief in the Year 2000 assessment.
Assessor Houlihan stated that the Real Property Assessment Classification Substitute Ordinance proposes
four measures: I) The reclassification of multi-use properties (residential and commercial use), more
commonly known as "Mom and Pop" properties, 20,000 square feet or less (storefronts with apartments
above), from Class 3 - Multi-Use (33%) to Class 2 - Residential (16%). 2) The creation of a South
Suburban Tax Reactivation Program, a pilot project funded through a $5 million grant from " Illinois
First" to revitalize a five township area in south suburban Cook County (Bloom, Bremen, Calumet, Rich
and Thornton). Begin a no-cash bid process to acquire tax-delinquent properties such as vacant and
abandoned industrial/commercial properties; reduce assessment levels on these properties (through
application of Class 8 certification); and cooperatively market these properties to potential commercial
and industrial businesses. 3) Easing the administrative process for Class L Landmark properties, by
expanding the timeline for filing the municipal resolution and making the designation renewable for
industrial properties. 4) Reducing the required number of units for Class 9-Affordable Housing
qualification from 50% to 35%. A move designed to stimulate the development of more affordable
housing units, balancing the needs of both property owners and low income tenants.

1424

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Assessor Houlihan stated that he will continue to work with the County Board and local elected officials
to broaden the base of understanding and countywide support for Class 3/Multi-Family and Class
Sb/Industrial assessment level reductions. He indicated the Assessor's Office will be holding public
meetings in districts throughout the County to discuss the rationale for Class 3 and Class Sb changes and
to consider the potential impact these changes will have on the tax base. The Assessor's Office and the
Tax Policy Forum will continue to meet with school districts, civic organizations and community groups
to discuss the short-tern costs and long-term benefits of assessment level reductions.
Assessor Houlihan stated his goal is to have Cook County achieve its economic potential and to be a more
dynamic force in the regional economy by creating new jobs, new industry and new units of affordable
housing for working families that sustain it. The Assessor' s Office will ask the Tax Policy Forum, school
districts and others for suggested changes that can be made to make certain Cook County is competitive
and can preserve a strong and healthy funding base.
Commissioner Hansen requested Class 2 figures from the Assessor.
Commissioner Hansen expressed his support for the substitute ordinance. The Commissioner highlighted
the changes in the Real Property Assessment Classification Substitute Ordinance Amendments.
Commissioner Hansen commented on the reclassification of multi-use properties (" Mom and Pop"storefronts with apartments above) to Class 2-Residential and its negligible impact on any other type of
property . With respect to Class 9-Affordable Housing and its goal to stimulate the development of more
housing units, Commissioner Hansen stated this remains to be seen.
Commissioner Hansen continued by stating that he was glad the Assessor received funding from the State
to fund the South Suburban tax Reactivation Program. However, he expressed concern as to whether this
program should be included in the ordinance as well as the programs' technicalities.
Commissioner Hansen concluded by stating that he was glad the proposal had been amended, and he
looked forward to reviewing further suggestions from the Assessor.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that the efforts of Assessor Houlihan and his staff in reaching out to
the s uburban communities is appreciated. He applauded the changes that have been made and stated that
elected officials have the responsibility to increase businesses and the changes proposed will affect every
part of Cook County. He stated that there are communities where storefront and multi-use properties are
over-taxed and cannot now compete. The Commissioner concluded by say ing he is pleased to see a solid
plan to redevelop the south suburban area of Cook County, and that school districts will not be unfairly
burdened.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if these proposed changes will have any financial impact on the
homeowner?
Assessor Houlihan answered there will be a negligible impact, and some shifting in categories from Class
3 to Class 2, some transfer and reduction in the motion from 33% to 16%. He stated that about half of the
items in Class 3 are within the City of Chicago reassessment and he expects the City reassessment will
more than make up for this impact. Assessor Houlihan stated that a slight increase will not be attributable
to this proposal but there may be an increase based on assessment and spending.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the use of reclassification drops from 38% to 16%, will it be only for
owner-occupied properties and will the reclassification take place in this year' s assessment?

142S

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRlL 18, 2000
Assessor Houlihan responded that if the ordinance is passed, the new assessment will begin at the end of
the month and will be applicable for the year 2000 assessment.
Commissioner Maldonado referenced Class 9 and asked ifthere will be unlimited renewable terms?
Assessor Houlihan said that as long as the property is maintained, up to code and verified, it will then be
eligible for the incentive. He also said the property should be in compliance with the City of Chicago
Building Codes and all applicable laws.
Commissioner Sutker initially questioned the multi-use property classification and its impact. The
Commissioner said that with further clarification and serious study, this classification can be a tool for
enhancing areas and upgrading and revitalizing them. In order for Cook County to be competitive,
Commissioner Sutker stated, it has to upgrade living conditions everywhere. In order for the educational
system to be competitive, the education level has to be raised to the highest level and not to an average
level. He said there should be a global approach with regard to the impact on residential housing because
it has had a severe adverse impact on school districts.
Commissioner Sutker commented that he fully endorses the landmark Class L Classification. He stated
the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Program is necessary, not just for the five townships, but is a
lesson for all townships.
Commissioner Steele thanked Assessor Houlihan for his vision of restructuring the tax system and for
assembling the Tax Review Committee to assist him in this effort. She congratulated Assessor Houlihan
for reviewing how this tax change would impact the schools; and commented that she hopes the State of
Illinois will take on its responsibility of helping fund education throughout the State.
Commissioner Goslin expressed his support of the proposed plan to build up the south suburbs. He stated
that Cook County ' s real estate classification system is confusing and complicated, which is a bigger issue
than what the Board can do, but must work to simplify it.
Chairman Daley congratulated Assessor Houlihan on an outstanding job. Assessor Houlihan and his staff
met with each Commissioner to discuss the substitute ordinance. He further stated that in the initial
proposal, Assessor Houlihan addressed issues no one else wanted to address. Chairman Daley also stated
that the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Program is a good pilot program and he believes it will be
looked at nationwide. He also expressed his gratitude for the Assessor's commitment to meet with
districts in the future on other controversial issues.
Commissioner Moreno commented on the impact of over reliance on real estate taxes on school districts.
He congratulated Assessor Houlihan for developing such projects to keep people working, to keep
properties on the tax rolls and keep business in Cook County. He stated the relief that will be given to the
owners of storefronts in Cicero is tremendous because people cannot afford to pay the taxes in those
neighborhoods, and the housing problem would be attributable to revitalizing the areas which will draw
industry back.
Commissioner Lechowicz stated the four points listed in the Assessor's proposal are worthwhile. He said
the issue of the South Suburban Tax Reactivation Program is a great idea and will work to provide the
same type of incentive using economic development zones that were created by the General Assembly
and adopted by the Chicago City Council. The Commissioner stated that areas are in chronic need and
the tax base is so excessive that development of these areas is very difficult from an economic standpoint.
He expressed hope that the pilot program will be successful and develop pockets within the suburban
areas of Cook County.

1426

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Assessor Houlihan appreciated the commissioners' comments and took them as a pledge to work wi th
him on the next step. He stated the portions that were left out gave rise because of problems of
reclassification and the over reliance on property taxes. He said there is a need to address classificatio ns
in the context wherein the school communities and local municipalities can participate. The Assessor's
Office will discuss the multiplier, sales ratio studies and the triennial assessment which are all linked to
the economic viability of Cook County .

than 24 months, that finding, along with the specification of the circumstances, shall be
included in the resolution or ordinance supporting and consenting to the Class 8
application. Such resolution or ordinance shall be filed with the eligibility application. If
the ordinance or resolution is that of a municipality, the approval of the Board of
Commissioners of Cook County is required to validate such shortened period of
qualifying abandonment, and a resolution to that effect shall be included with the Class 8
eligibility application filed with the Assessor.
A copy of fil!Y tfi.at: resolution received will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Cook County Board of Commissioners for distribution to the
Commissioners from the affected districts.

rehabilitation was completed and initially assessed, or in the case of abandoned property,
from the date of substantial reoccupancy. During the tenth year, an application may be
filed with the Assessor's Office for renewal of the incentive for an additional ten year
period. This incentive may be renewed during the last year a property is entitled to a 16%
assessment level , ifthe following requirements are met:

of Cook County, if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, adopts a
resolution expressly stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may
be, has determined that the industrial use of the property is necessary and beneficial
to the local economy, and supports and consents to renewal of the Class 8 and;

3.

a copy of that resolution and a completed renewal application are filed with the
Office of the Assessor before the expiration of the 16% assessment level period.

treatment, but the assessment level is higher than 16%, that taxpayer may apply for
renewal as outlined above and receive a 16% assessment level for the prescribed
period beginning after the filing and approval of the resolution and renewal
application. However, if at the time this ordinanee is adopted,on that effective date

real estate shall revert to the applicable classification under this ordinance.
The Assessor may adopt rules consistent with the foregoing necessary to insure
proper review of the application, supporting data and all other pertinent factors.
The certification of an area as in need of substantial revitalization shall expire five
years from the date such certification is granted. The Assessor shall notify the
applicant of the date of expiration of certification one year before the date of the
expiration of the certification. Such certification, pursuant to the same criteria,
may be extended for one additional five-year period subject to reapplication by the
appropriate local governing body within the period from one year to six months

Section 4.
(A)

To qualify as a commercia l development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that the
project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
( I)

the area is, or has been within the last I 0 years, designated by federal, state or local
agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing a
rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban Renewal
Consolidation Act of 196 1, as amended, or the Commercial Renewal Re-development
Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a federal Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Communi ty, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners on June 22, 1994 or the C hicago City Counci l on May 18, 1994, or the
Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance of the City of Ch icago or
designation(s) of like effect adopted under any similar statute or ordinance; and

(2)

real estate taxes within said area, during the last six years, have declined, remained
stagnant or potentia l real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to the depressed
condition of the area; and

(3)

there is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or rehabilitation
of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go forwa rd on a reasonably
timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and will therefore resu lt in the
economic enhancement of the area; and

(4)

certification of the commercial development project for C lass 7a or 7b designation w ill
materially assist development, re-development or rehabilitation of the area and the
commercial development proj ect would not go forward without the fu ll incenti ve offered
under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

certification of the commercial development project fo r Class 7a or 7b designation is
reasonably expected to ultimately resu lt in an increase in real property tax revenue and
employment opportunities within the area.

Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must obtain
from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County if the real estate is located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly
stating that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, has determined that factors ( I )
through (5) are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports
and consents to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance
or resolution shall be included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the
appl ication with the Assessor. A copy of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted,
will be forwarded by the Assessor' s Office to the secretary of the Board of Comm issioners for
distribution to the Commissioners from the affected districts. The application shall incl ude any
other infonnation deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant must demonstrate that the
commercia l development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification and shal l bear the
expense of doing so.

1446

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the neighborhoods of
Cook County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit the
expense of such applications, the Assessor sha ll liberally construe the requirements of factors ( I)
through (5) for Class 7a applications.
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the application
and supporting data.
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of insuffi cient
size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in factor (4) above, consideration may be given to any lawful intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the
appropriate taxing districts.
For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that factors ( I) through (5) exist, he shall,
within 60 days after receipt of the application and necessary supporting data, certify the
commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment under this Ordinance
In order to determine C lass 7b app lications, upon receipt of the application and all the necessary
s upporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory Committee
of Cook County. The Committee shall within thirty days return the application to the Assessor
with a finding stating whether factors ( I) through (5) are present. Upon receipt of a written
request from the Committee no later than seven days prior to the expiration of the thirty day
period, the Assessor may extend for a period not to exceed an additional thirty days the time for
return of the application with the Comm ittee's finding. The Assessor sha ll review the application,
supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate facts. Where the Assessor finds
factors (I) through (5) exist, he shall, w ithin 30 days of the receipt of the Comm ittee's findings,
certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this Ordinance.
C lass 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless new
construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of
the commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(B)

To be certified as an area in need of s ubstantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8 classification it
is necessary: (I) that the municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the
County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it
is not economically feasible fo r private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization,
rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and encouragement, or a
determination of similar import; (2) that the municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the
County apply to the Assessor for certification of the area as one in need of substantial_revitalization;
(3) that, upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of_substantial revitalization, the
Assesso r shall review the application, supporting data and other appropriate factors relevant to a
determination of the severity of the economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in
need of substantial revitali zation_" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong consideration
and substantial weight to the fact that an area is located in a federal Empowem1ent Zone or
Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on
June 22, 1994 or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994.

1447

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of substantial
revitalization, as defined in thi s Ordinance, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the
specific area for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the
City of C hicago sha ll be the "community area" as defined herein; for all other areas in the County
it shall be, where applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.
If a municipality within an Enterprise Commun ity, as proposed and approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994, determines by municipal resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and
that it is not economically feasi ble for private enterprise to accomplish the necessary
modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area without public assistance and
encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request for Class 8
certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this ordinance. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file their application in a
timely manner.
Section 5.
Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described classes,
each portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
Section 6.
All portions of this Ordinance are severable, and if any of its provisions or any sentence, clause or
paragraph shall be held unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court
shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.
Section 7.
A written report on the status and progress of the implementation of this Ord inance, or any amendments
thereto, and a ll rules promulgated by the Assessor hereunder, shall be submitted by the Cook County
Assessor to the President and Board of Cook County Commissioners annua lly on or before December I.
Section 8.
The incentive provisions of this Ordinance provided to qualifying parcels of real estate for Class 6b, Class
C, Class 7a, Class 7b and Class 8 shal l expire on December 31 , 2004, unless otherwise reviewed by
action of the Cook County Board of Comm issioners. Real estate granted a C lass 6, Class 6a, C lass 6b,
Class 7 or Class 8 classification on or before December 31 , 1994 shall retain such classification under the
terms and conditions of the Ordinance prior to January I, 1995. Real estate for which an application for
Class 6a, Class 6b, Class 7or Class 8 classification is filed with the Assessor on or before December 31,
1994 and which thereafter is determined by the Assessor to be eligible for the classification under the
terms and conditions of this Ordinance existing prior to after January I, 1995, sha ll be entitled to receive
such classification under such terms and conditions.
Real estate granted a Class 6b, Class 6c, Class 7a, Class 7b or C lass 8 classification on or before
December 31 , 1999 shall retain such classification under the terms and conditions of the Ordinance prior
to January 1, 2000. Real estate fo r which an application for Class 6b, Class 6c, C lass 7a, Class 7b or Class

Your Committee has considered the following item(s) and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
235135

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
Transmitting a Communication, dated March 23 , 2000:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for medical equipment, Bid Package #3, radiology equipment for
the New Cook County Hospital. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body
approve this request.
This request is for the purchase and installation of Major Radiology Equipment including:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging units (MRI), ultrasound units, a Picture Archiving and
Communication System (PACS), cat scan imaging units, mammography units, x-ray units,
cystoscopy systems, linear accelerators, ultrasound units, angiography units and cardiac
catheterization systems.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Bond Issue (22000) Account.
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover th is request.

*Referred to the Construction Committee on April 5, 2000.
Commissioner Hansen asked to what degree the bids wi ll be packaged separately and what is the intention
from a specification writing and a purchas ing point of view?
Michael LaMont responded that everything wi ll be packaged into one bid.
Commissioner Hansen asked why?
Michael LaMont stated because all the equipment wi ll be integrated in the network in order for the
eq uipment to function and for information to flow.
Commissioner Hansen stated that unless the County wants to give a huge profit to a middleman, the
County should go directly to the entities that manufacture the eq uipment. He further stated that this
approach could be negative to the interests of the taxpayers, unless the County can show some cost
effici ency, which means that the County receives a bid less than the sixty-five million.
Michael LaMont responded that the packaging approach was worked out with a team, the hospital, Dr.
Langer and experts working with the Office of Capital Planning and Policy.
Commissioner Hansen asked why going with one manufacturing company is the best solution?
Dr. Bradley Langer responded that there are fo ur manufacturers Toshiba, General Electric, Phillips and
Siemens that can bid and provide virtua lly everything in the bid. He stated these radiology units must
communi cate to each other and communicate to the PACS system, which is the system that is going to
transfer images throug h out the hospital. He continued by saying each manufacturer does their image
integration differently. Dr. Langer commented it is possible to individually get a PACS system and an
ind ividual bunch of image acquisition devices, but it will be more difficult to troubleshoot if there are
problems. He further stated that he thinks it is best to go with one manufacturer because when something
goes wrong you only talk to the one manufacturer.
Commissio ner Hansen asked a question regarding the accelerators.
Dr. Langer stated that there are primarily two manufacturers, Varian and Siemens that make accelerators.
Comm issioner Hansen asked how can the County prevent expansion of the bids, and if there is some way
to separate the bids that are not made by major manufacturers?
Commissioner Hansen asked about why the furniture is included?
Michael LaMont stated today he is asking for approval of bid package number three only, and requests fo r
the other packages wi ll be coming before the committee on a monthly bas is. He concluded by saying
there is no furniture included in bid package number three.
Commissioner Hansen asked why the columns do not add up?
Michael LaMont responded that a construction a llowance is also included.

1497

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere are any negati ves in awarding the package putting the package out to
one company?
Dr. Langer responded that he does not see any negatives, and he genuinely thinks this is the way to
proceed.
Commi ssioner Hansen asked if the County will run into any s pecial problems replacing segments in the
future, and if these are stand alone items, in bid package three, can they be replaced?
Dr. Langer responded yes, the item can be easil y replaced.
Commissioner Hansen asked w hat essential services will the units provide?
Dr. Langer responded that every radiological study performed in the hospital can receive read-outs from
multiple locations.
Commissioner Hansen asked how many locations?
Dr. Langer responded forty locations.
Commi ssioner Hansen asked what is the disposition of the old eq uipment?
Vice Chairman Butler responded that the Commissioner's question is a good one, but the hospital is not
prepared to respond to that question today but will respond at a later date.
Commissioner Collins asked ifthe tota l amou nt for the equipment is one hundred and forty-t hree mi llion?
Michael LaMont responded that is correct.
Commissioner Moreno asked if the new equipment will help reduce some of the medical malpractice
claims?
Dr. Langer responded yes.
Commissioner Hansen requested a memo directed to the Chairman of the Litigati on Committee from the
hospita l stating how the purchase will assist the County in medical malpractice claims.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that as long as the equipment is operated by people the County might still
have some problems in regards to medical malpractice.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ifthere are any other options?
Michael LaMont responded that the equipment is the guts of the hospital and is necessary to purchase.
Comm issioner Sutker asked if General Electric equipment is installed at the new Northwestern Hospital?
Dr. Langer responded that the equ ipment at Northwestern is not one hundred percent General Electric.
Commissioner S utker asked if some of the other newly constructed hospitals in the east, use only one
manufacturer?

1498

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Dr. Langer responded that it is done both ways, and the way they have seen works best is when using one
manufacturer. He said because the County is building a new hospital from the ground up, with all new
equipment and because the existing equipment at the old County hospital has to be replaced, he thinks
this is the right approach.
Commissioner Sutker asked when was the Certificate of Need fo r the fifty million approved?
Michael LaMont stated the Certificate of Need for most of th is equipment has not been approved by the
State of Illinois.
Commissioner Sutker asked ifthe County is still at five hundred and fifty-one million?
Michael LaMont responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Sutker asked if the fifty million is included in the five hundred and fifty-one million, on
any level for any reason and what relationship does it have to the previously mentioned thirty-seven
million that was an additional need for equipment?
Michael LaMont stated that there was always a component of the equipment in the 1994 Certificate of
Need and there was a lways a component that was held outside because of technology changing and it
would not be wise to have applied and received approval for that prior to this time when the equipment
needs to be ordered.
Vice Chairman Butler gave comments regarding the approval of the fifty million. The Vice Chairman
said the State asked the County to come back after the structure was underway and they would approve
the Certificate of Need fo r equipment purchases.
Commissioner Sutker expressed concern that the Certificate of Need obtained in 1994 did not include
major medical equipment and therefore the County may be acting recklessly by proceeding without
assurances that the Certificate of Need is approved.
Commissioner Collins asked how many other bid packages must the State still approve?
Michael LaMont stated that what the County is doing now is something that the County planned to do
over the past five years. He stated that the County is on schedule, and what needs to be done is to bid the
equipment, procure it and finis h building out the hospital. Director LaMont said the County always
intended to receive formal approval from the State at the time the County was bidding the equipment. He
further stated that it has all been planned fo r and the State knows that the County is asking for fo rmal
approval and there is no need to wait.
Commissioner Collins stated that what is important is that the County get approval for all packages rather
than each one individually.
Michael LaMont responded that bid package number 7 still needs State approval, which is being put a ll
together so that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy will not have to ask again for equipment
approval.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Mr. LaMont if there are only two-equipment bid packages that need to be
approved by the State?
Michael LaMont responded yes.

1499

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
Commissioner Si lvestri asked if the County has any other options?
Michael LaMont stated that the County must have State approval of the permit request prior to awarding
the contract.
Commissioner Silvestri asked does the County have the option of trying to get the permit approved first,
and then go out to bid?
Michael LaMont responded that this is an option, but the County is running concurrently to meet the
schedule.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ifthe request is within the project budget?
Michael LaMont responded yes.
Vice Chairman Butler called on Bureau Chief Ruth Rothstein to respond to Commissioner Sutker's
comments.
Ruth Rothstein stated that in 1994 when the County received approval from the Illinois Facilities
Planning Board, it was with the exclusion of this equipment and the other packages of equipment, so the
Facility Planning Board stated they would approve the Certificate of Need for construction of the new
hospital but could return at the time equipment was to be bid because of technology changes. Chief
Rothstein further stated that it is wiser to do it this way because the County saves time and the equipment
is received when it is needed.
Commissioner Hansen asked what is the estimated specification writing time?
Michael LaMont responded that they are in development now, and will be bid in the second week in May
2000.
Commissioner Hansen stated his concerns that there is nothing to prevent the County from having a
request before you have completion of specifications because it will not mean any difference in terms of
what is supplied to the State on the subject.

Commissioner Collins moved approval of Item 235135, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Hansen moved to adjourn the meeting, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri. The
motion carried.

This agreement is recommended in the Cook County Plan and is consistent with the goals and
objectives of the Plan which in part encourage the County to rely on existing units of
government for implementation thus avoiding duplication of effort, additional layers of
government and unnecessary fi scal impact on Cook County.
The Department seeks your consideration and support of this request.
Fiscal Impact: None.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that he had discussed the proposed contract between Cook County and
three suburban solid waste agencies with several suburban municipalities who are anxiously awaiting
approval by the Board of Commissioners to pursue the goals enumerated in the plan. The commissioner
further urged approval of the item and the expeditious execution of the points therein.
Commissioner Quigley thanked those involved in putting the plan together and stated that after talking
with several commissioners, there is interest in a coordinated and comprehensive plan to work with cities,
other governmental levels and waste agencies to determine what action should be taken in regard to
household hazardous waste as well as recycling, in general. The commissioner continued by stating that a
coordinated plan will accomplish something very valuable and timely. He said he believes the next step
should be how the County can work with waste stations and municipalities to incorporate how we address
the issue of recycling to divert waste from landfills, save money, help the environment and how to
address household hazardous waste.

Commissioner Silvestri moved approval of Item 234807. Seconded by Commissioner Quigley. The
motion carried unanimously.

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL, by Charles F. Lagges, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated February 29, 2000:
respectfully requests your consideration and approval of an update to the Cook County Solid
Waste Management Plan. The original plan was approved by the Cook County Board in
1996. State laws require review of Solid Waste Management Plan every five years, to
determine if revisions are appropriate or necessary.
This update intended to serve as compliance with the law. In addition, it provides an
evaluation of the original plan and considers changes in laws, available disposal facilities,
technology, and public perception/attitude.
Your review and approval wi II be appreciated.

Commissioner Hansen asked several questions regarding the update on the Cook County Solid Waste
Management Plan.
The commissioner referred to the statement in the Plan that most suburban areas belong to one of three
sub-county agencies. The commissioner's question related to those counties that do not belong to a subcounty agency. He furthered his inquiry by asking how those suburban areas are handled from the
standpoint of the goals of the Solid Waste Management Plan.
Charles Lagges, Director of Environmental Control responded that municipalities not a part of any subcounty agency are directly handled by their mayors or officials through the solid waste coordinator in the
Department of Environmental Control.

1502

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRJL 18, 2000
Commissioner Hansen then asked how often does the County Board receive status or progress reports
regarding the goals enumerated in the Plan.
Director Lagges responded that reports are generated annually but the agreement between the three
suburban solid waste agencies requires quarterly reports to the Department by the individual waste
agencies that will be forwarded to the County Board.
Commissioner Hansen requested that the Board receive reports either every six months or at annual
intervals.
Chairman Moreno s upported Commissioner Hansen ' s request and stated it would be of interest to the
Board to learn what these suburban agencies have been doing, and further requested that the Department
of Environmental Control submit timely reports.
Commissioner Hansen asked about long term prospects for new waste disposal facilities and asked for ten
to twenty year projections for solid waste management.
Director Lagges informed the committee that in ten to twenty years, landfills will get farther away and
there will be a need for more transfer stations, more trucks to move waste farther and as that happens,
tipping fees will increase. He said currently, landfills are the cheapest and most abundant option,
tempered by recycling and waste reduction.
Commissioner Hansen suggested there should be some mention or description of what will happen in ten
to twenty years and where the County will be in regard to the Plan .
Director Lagges responded that the Department intends to provide this information as part of a report
through the Coordinating Committee that will drive this whole cycle.
Commissioner Hansen asked a question relative to improving county-wide intergovernmental
coordination and why this would be particularly important to only non-members.
Director Lagges stated that this is important to members as well, but the sub-agencies already have
educational programs in which constituents and municipalities participate. The plan is to extend the
County's programs to the other municipalities.
Commissioner Hansen commented that it might be good to inform the County as to what it should do
when a municipality is not part of a group. The commi ssioner then asked for a description of the
County's role in monitoring.
Director Lagges said monitoring involves assessing the progress and conditions in the sub- agencies and
within the municipalities so the County can direct the entire process in a coordinated manner.
Commissioner Hansen asked the number of municipalities that belong to a suburban sub-agency and the
population of each group. The commissioner indicated he had read the table and determined that ninetyfour municipalities are members and thirty two are not members.
He further said this indicates that about one-fourth of the municipalities are not part of the sub-agency
arrangement.
Director Lagges agreed with Commissioner Hansen's statement. He further informed the committee that
most of those municipalities not part of a sub-agency are located in the southwest area of the county.

1503

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL I 8, 2000
Commissioner Hansen asked to what degree has the county met its priorities for the last five years and is
there a report?
Director Lagges responded that a report is prepared which he will provide. He further said that in regard
to recycling, in 1990, there was 9% residential recycling and today, it is at 25%. He said these figures do
not include landscape waste and other items banned from landfills. Mr. Lagges further commented that if
landscape waste is included, the figure would increase to about 44%.
Commissioner Hansen asked for this information in writing.
Commissioner Hansen asked how the County handles requirements set forth in the Plan for recycling
bins.
Director Lagges said the most effective laws would be state laws that would cover a wider geographic
area.
Commissioner Hansen asked ifthere is a possibility that the County could receive a special grant from the
lllinois Environmental Protection Agency to set-up a system in Cook County that might later be a model
for the entire state in either retail establishments or other locations within the county for drop-off of these
special goods.
Mr. Lagges said that the Department has already given some consideration to this idea and stated that his
office should be taking the lead on many of these issues.
Commissioner Hansen requested a memorandum on the above subject.
Chairman Moreno commented that it is extremely important that the County encourage residential
recycling and that the County should take some direct action in this area. The Chairman further
commented that the role of the Environmental Control Department may need to be expanded and that he
will be working with the Department toward this end.

Commissioner Silvestri moved approval of Item 234817. Seconded by Commissioner Quigley. The
motion carried unanimously.

WHEREAS, local governments in Cook County place great importance on improving railroad grade
crossing safety; and
WHEREAS, local governments in Cook County are very supportive of the current grade crossing
protection program administered by the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC); and
WH EREAS, the State of Illinois, via the Illinois Commerce Commission, has demonstrated its
commitment to railroad crossing safety by investing over $365 million into crossing safety upgrades at
the state's most dangerous crossings over the past twelve years, leading to a near 60% reduction in
accidents; and
WHEREAS, this accident reduction occurred during a period where automobile and train traffic volumes
significantly increased; and
WHEREAS, in 1994, Congress passed the Swift Rail Development Act, which targeted whistle ban
crossings nation-wide by requiring that whistles be sounded at every at-grade railroad crossing in the
United States; and
WHEREAS, the Proposed Rules to implement the Act were published by the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) on January 13, 2000, and have been thoroughly reviewed by a host of local,
regional and state agencies; and
WH EREAS, the Proposed Rules offer re lief from whistles only if communities spend vast sums of money
on supplemental safety upgrades to crossings, without access to any new federal funding; and
WH EREAS, the Rules wi ll compromise the ICC ' s highly effective safety program by diverti ng resources
away from the most dangerous crossings, towards installation of s upplements at relatively safe crossings,
simply to avoid the soundi ng of whistles; and
WH EREAS, review of the Rules has demonstrated that the majority of these supplements cannot be
installed in northeast Illinois; and
WH EREAS, northeast Illinois has been identified by the FRA as a "puzzling anomaly" due to the fact that
collision freq uencies at whistle ban crossings in the region are lower than those at crossings without bans;

and
WHEREAS, recent research has corroborated the existence of this anomaly; and
WHEREAS, over 1.5 million residents in northeast Illinois live within one half mile of an at-grade
crossing.

1546

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 18, 2000
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County
concur that the Federal Railroad Administration's Proposed Rules to implement nation-wide sounding of
train whistles should be sig nificantly modified or should be amended through appropriate legislation or
administrative action, to require the FRA to work with individual states to allow implementation of cost
effective railroad crossing safety programs tailored to unique local circumstances; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOL YEO, that any legislative or regulatory changes to the Rules should preserve
the ability of a community to establish an enforceable quiet zone where whistles are not sounded, and
should add actual value to existing state and local grade crossing safety programs.
