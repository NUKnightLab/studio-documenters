Trustee Hauser requested adoption of a Board order as submitted by the Board’s legal counsel in the
matter of Daniel Hauser. The Board finds that it does not have the jurisdiction to hear Mr. Hauser’s case,
and therefore, the application for a duty disability benefit filed by Daniel Hauser is not properly before
this Board. In the event it was determined that the Board had jurisdiction, it would find that Daniel
Hauser was not injured while in performance of an act of duty and therefore, he is not entitled to the
benefit he seeks.

Hauser as submitted.

One last item of business was a carry-over from the investment committee meeting held January 25, 2016.
Discussed and reviewed was a letter from Northern Trust which would allow the City Treasurer’s office
to have online view access to the Fund’s Northern Trust account.
Trustee Summers explained that it is an extension of the resolution, which was passed by the Board, and
it is an effort to view all of the investment management-related fees that are in the Northern Trust
database, as the Fund’s custodian. The purpose is to be able to aggregate a view of these fees so that the
Treasurer’s office can identify opportunities for fee sharing and fee savings.
It was moved by Trustee Avila, seconded by Trustee Lappe, that the Board direct the Executive Director
to sign the letter of agreement with the Northern Trust concerning allowing the City Treasurer’s office to
‘view only’ the Fund’s database of investments held at Northern Trust.
