Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Proposed Amendment Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drainage District Agreement

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) provides wastewater disposal
services to the Oakland Macomb Interceptor Drainage District (OMIDD). The Authority’s
Northeast Sewer Pump Station (NESPS) serves only OMIDD yet it is also a key component
in the continuing development of GLWA’s comprehensive regional wastewater master
planning efforts.
The 2009 OMIDD services agreement provided for sewage disposal services and
contemplated further collaboration in the future, including the NESPS. Since 2017,
representatives of OMIDD and GLWA have been meeting to explore those collaboration
opportunities.

Analysis: On January 14, 2019, OMIDD and GLWA staff representatives reached an
agreement on terms that both agreed to present to their respective boards before
proceeding with a proposed amendment to the 2009 agreement. The next steps are for the
outline of the terms to be brought forward to both the GLWA and OMIDD Boards for
review.
Key aspects of the proposal address: 1) operations (control maintained by GLWA),
2) maintenance (OMIDD provides maintenance), 3) capital funding (OMIDD has authority
to construct and finance), 4) annual fees, and 5) payout of debt associated with NESPS.

Attached is a simplified table that outlines the financial terms agreed to by the staff
representatives of each entity. This information was pertinent to GLWA in calculating the
FY 2020 charges for all member partners for next week’s charges rollout meeting #4. This
information will be referenced in other Audit Committee agenda items.
The next action is a review by the Board at a date to be determined by General Counsel.
Proposed Action: Receive and file.

Re:

Discussion: FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan

Background: In accordance with service agreements with Great Lakes Water Authority
(GLWA) member partners, charges for the next fiscal year are annually presented at the
end of January each year. To accommodate that schedule, the budget process for the GLWA
begins early in the fiscal year.
Analysis: At the Audit Committee meeting on a December 21, 2018, staff presented a
discussion draft of the FY 2020 & 2021 Biennial Budget and Five-Year Plan. This draft
focused on a) overall strategy of key budget elements including system-wide service
charges and b) proposed operating group budgets.

Additional analysis was provided at the January 4, 2018 Audit Committee meeting. Since
that time, staff has focused on efforts to close open issues that could impact timely approval
of budget and charges that are interdependent on resolution with GLWA’s member
partners.
For continued discussion at today’s meeting, the following are attached.

1. Memo for consideration from The Foster Group (TFG) dated January 17, 2019
regarding GLWA Sewer Facilities Served Directly by GLWA Transmission Mains
2. Personnel Budget

3. Other Budget Analysis for Discussion

Departmental Reviews – Area Chiefs asked to focus on two questions

1. Requests for budget increases in light of projected spending this year and actual
amounts spent last year
2. Actions taken to save money, increase efficiencies, etc.

Proposed Action: Receive for further review and discussion at the next Audit Committee
meeting on February 15, 2019 at 8 am.

MEMORANDUM
GLWA Sewer Facilities Served Directly by GLWA
Transmission Mains
To:

January 17, 2019

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
This memorandum has been prepared to introduce how the above referenced topic has been
addressed in the proposed GLWA FY 2020 Budget and service charge analysis. The
accompanying exhibit assists in the explanation below.
The facilities in question are part of the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) and
currently classified as retail water customers of DWSD. Traditional DWSD policy has been
to not bill WRRF facilities for sewer service, given that they are providing that service to the
region on property. Currently, these facilities are served as six DWSD retail water accounts
and billed approximately $3.6 million annually for water service.
Since the facilities are directly served via GLWA transmission mains, and do not receive any
direct benefit of DWSD retail activities, GLWA proposes to change the structure of the
accounts. It is our understanding that effective July 1, 2019, GLWA proposes to bill these
facilities directly, rather than have them treated as DWSD retail customer accounts. GLWA
(Water) will establish a mechanism to directly bill GLWA (Sewer) for wholesale water service.
In essence, GLWA Sewer will become a new “internal” Customer of GLWA Water. The task
at hand is to illustrate the various impacts of the proposed new approach GLWA is proposing
these accounts. is new business arrangement.
Let’s start with the impact on the GLWA Budget, as summarized on Lines 1 through 3 of the
exhibit. Initially, the GLWA Sewer operating expenses will experience a $3.6 million
reduction as the purchased retail water costs from DWSD are removed. These savings will be
offset by the replaced purchased wholesale water costs from GLWA Water. We have
established a reasonable wholesale price for this water ($9.89/Mcf) that is designed to
implement the new business arrangement in a manner that does not impact Suburban
Wholesale Water Customers. See Line 6. This produces an annual wholesale water expense of
approximately $1.4 million. So the net budget impact on GLWA Sewer is an operating expense
savings of approximately $2.2 million.

Next let’s evaluate the impact on GLWA cost of service allocations, as shown on Lines 4
through 9. On Line 4, we illustrate the preliminary allocation of the FY 2020 Water BUDGET
to the Detroit and Suburban Wholesale customer classes prior to recognizing the new
structure1. Since the facilities in question will no longer be categorized as retail DWSD
customers, it is appropriate to remove the volumes and demands in question from Detroit’s
water units of service. We removed those volumes and demands from our cost of service
analysis and assigned them to a new “Internal GLWA” Customer. The resulting reallocated
cost of service is shown on Line 5, and compared to the prior allocation on Line 6. The water
system in total, and the Suburban Wholesale class, are unaffected by this change. In effect, the
amount allocated to the new internal GLWA Customer results in a reduced water cost of
service allocation to the Detroit customer class.
A similar comparison for the Sewer cost of service impacts is shown on Lines 7 through 9. We
have verified that the sales volumes to the facilities in question were not included in
determining the current SHAREs, since they were not billed for sewer service. Therefore there
is no need to adjust Sewer units of service. Rather, the sewer operating budget savings are
allocated proportionally to the Detroit and Suburban customer classes based on their existing
SHAREs, as shown on Line 9. The internal GLWA amount on Line 9 is actually related to
reduced industrial surcharges as a result of the adjustment.
The consolidated impact of these adjustments is shown for the Detroit customer class on Lines
10 through 15. The wholesale water cost allocation savings of $1.4 million are offset by the
$3.6 million loss of retail water revenue, resulting in a net increase of $2.2 million to be
recovered from the “remaining” DWSD water customers. This equates to a 2.2% increase, all
else being equal, as shown on Line 15. Detroit’s $782,000 share of the sewer savings equates
to an overall reduction, all else being equal, of 0.3%. The combined water and sewer impact
of this adjustment is a net cost to DWSD of $1.4 million, or 0.3% of total DWSD retail
revenues, as shown on Lines 13 and 15.
Finally, Lines 16 through 19 present a similar analysis for the Suburban Wholesale customer
classes. There is no impact of this adjustment on Suburban Wholesale water customers. The
Suburban Wholesale $1.4 million share of the sewer savings equates to an overall reduction,
all else being equal, of 0.5% of annual revenue requirements.
We are prepared to discuss this matter at your convenience.

There are other, concurrent modifications to the cost of service analyses and the final impacts may not match
these calculations precisely. The differences will not be material.

 Personnel Costs
Budget & Five-Year Plan
FY 2020 through FY 2024

Personnel Budget
Achieving the GLWA’s initiatives is dependent on the ability to attract, retain, and develop highly
qualified and effective team members.
As shown in the following Personnel Budget tables, the entity-wide personnel budget increases
$2.6 million, or 2.6%, between FY 2019 and FY 2020.

While specific reasons for the variances in the personnel budget are addressed in other sections of
financial plan document, the following highlights some of the key factors.
Salaries & Wages – The increase in budget is due to several components.
•
•
•

An increase in number of staffing positions to support key initiatives
The filling of vacant positions with GLWA staff
A change in the classification of positions to those with a higher level of knowledge, skillset,
and abilities as existing staff advance and the needs of teams are evaluated.

Salaries & Wages – Workforce Development – The increase in budget is due to the continuation
and expansion of the apprenticeship program.
Overtime – The overall decrease to overtime is due to the review of prior year’s actuals as well as
the plan to fill vacant positions thereby reducing or eliminating the need for overtime in a number
of areas.

Personnel Transition Adjustment – The use of this account has been discontinued in FY 2020 as
GLWA continues its recruitment efforts to fill vacant positions instead of utilizing individuals on a
contractual basis.

Contractual Transition Services – The reduction in the Contractual Transition Services budget is
the result of transitioning positions previously filled by individuals on a contract basis to GLWA
employees.

Capital Program Allocation
The amounts in the following Capital Program Allocation tables are shown as negative amounts
because they are “contra” accounts which represent an offset to the Personnel Costs section of the
Operations & Maintenance (O&M) budget. The Capital Program Allocation activity supports project
delivery of the Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). As previously described, the decrease represents a
realignment between O&M costs and Capital Program expenses as a strategy to build financial
sustainability. This is achieved by ensuring that an appropriately conservative policy is in place for
charging personnel costs to projects.

In an effort to improve on the process of capturing time charged to capital projects by GLWA
employees, a new time tracking software, BigTime, was implemented and rolled out towards the
end of FY 2018. The increase in the Capital Program Allocation for FY 2019 is due, in part, to the
results of improved time tracking as well as an increase in construction activity for FY 2019 and FY
2020.

Staffing Plan
The table on the next page presents both a “Staffing Plan” reflecting the number of positions and a
“Staffing Budget” based on full-time equivalents (FTEs). In the Staffing Plan each position has a
value of one. The position count does not distinguish between a position that is filled 100% (2,080
hours per year), filled for a number of hours less than 2,080 per year, or one that is vacant. The FTE
staffing is based on the number of hours that the positions is filled, or budgeted for, in each year
based upon a standard of 2,080 hours per year.
The increase in the staffing plan from 1,184 to 1,207 positions is explained in detail in other
sections of the financial plan document. The Staffing Plan and FTE counts level out beginning in FY
2021 as the organization reaches an optimal staffing level and vacancies are filled. The goal of the
staffing plan is to provide the organization with an appropriate level of personnel to achieve
operational reliability, to ensure a safe environment, maintain compliance and efficient capital
delivery, and to provide reliable and quality services to our customer communities.

 Other Budget Analysis for Discussion
Employee benefits costs are accumulated in none cost center with an offsetting account to
the other funds (“Transfers – Employee Benefits”). The rates charged to cost centers is a
combination of fixed per person (i.e. medical plan premiums, net of employee premium
copay) and variable rate based on payroll dollars (such as payroll taxes at 7.65% of pay).
This is an area of the budget that may be subject to amendment if medical plan costs (fixed
and self-insured) increase or decrease from modest estimates.

FY 2019 Actuals Update based upon October 2018 in the December 21, 2018 draft budget
vs. November 2018 actual expenses annualized is shown below. The budget document is
presently being updated for the November 2018 amounts.

Top ten increases and decreases by expense account type and by cost center
(department) are attached.

 AGENDA ITEM #6C

Date: January 17, 2019
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Alicia Haskin, Management Professional – Intergovernmental Relations
Re:

Update: GLWA and DWSD Shared Services True-Up Status FY 2017

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) and the Detroit Water and
Sewerage Department (DWSD) are parties to a Shared Services Agreement (the
Agreement) dated December 1, 2015. This agreement provides the framework for shared
services for the efficient operation of both entities.

On a monthly basis, an invoice is prepared based on an agreed upon annual budget. While
the intent is for the monthly invoice to represent actual costs, the reality is that the timing
of certain vendor invoices and accumulation of internal charges requires a “true-up”
process. That being said, the intent is to condense the true-up timeline each fiscal year.
The Shared Service Agreement (Section 5.1) states that:

“Each invoice, whether for Services provided regularly or “as-needed,” shall itemize
the costs and charges by Services provided under each Service Delivery Schedule,
and shall provide sufficient detail to the Subscribing Party to identify the Services
performed and the basis for the charges. A Performing Party may only charge the
Service Costs for Services provided.”

In addition, the parties have come to realize that an exact itemization generates a level of
detailed analysis that is not cost-effective to produce. The data and experience garnered
from the first three years of the program are leading to a more efficient method of
calculating costs while staying true to the intent of Section 5.1 above.
Analysis: The following is an update of the FY 2017 True-Up status.

Page 25

 Fiscal Year 2017
The table on the next page lists the current amount to be billed for each Shared Service
based upon DWSD’s and GLWA’s staff analyses. There are still ongoing reviews and
discussions regarding the True-Up calculations provided to each other.

DWSD and GLWA Shared Services Teams are having meetings every two weeks to bring the
FY 2017 Shared Services True Up to a resolution.
The highlighted Shared Services True-Ups have not been received from City of Detroit. The
amounts reported are the annualized amounts paid in FY2016 for these Shared Services.

Re:

Proposed FY 2020 Service Charges

Background: The annual financial planning cycle encompasses development of the capital
improvement plan, the revenue requirement (in the form of a biennial budget), and the
resulting schedule of service charges. The Audit Committee has received information over
the past 30 days related to the budget and the capital financing plan. Today, the Audit
Committee will also receive a presentation related to the Schedule of Service Charges.

Committee meeting.

 Report from The Foster Group dated January 16, 2019 re: Preliminary Proposed FY
2020 Budget/Charges Executive Summary
 Presentation: Proposed FY 2020 Water and Sewer Services Charges

Next steps include the following.

1. Presentation of these materials to the GLWA Board at their meeting on January 23,
2019.
2. Distribution of individual member partner charge worksheets at the Charges
Rollout Meeting #4 on Thursday, January 24, 2019.
3. The charge worksheets are also mailed the next day to each member partner
community.

4. A public hearing is scheduled for the Board meeting on February 27, 2019 with
potential Board action on that date.

Proposed Action: Receive and file.

MEMORANDUM
Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Budget/Charges
Executive Summary
To:

January 16, 2019

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
This memorandum is intended to provide an executive summary introduction of our
preliminary proposed water and sewer service charges for FY 2020. The preliminary proposed
service charges are designed to support the proposed FY 2020 GLWA proposed budgets, and
to implement the results of our cost of service study to allocate the revenue requirements in the
proposed budgets to GLWA Customers. The format of this discussion follows the format of
prior submittals on this topic, which were set forth in memoranda dated December 19, 2018,
and reflected the status of the budget request and analysis as of December 18, 2018 and January
2, 2019. Those documents provide background, history, and perspectives which remain
pertinent. We’ll not repeat that material in this discussion, but rather focus on introducing
exhibits supporting the final proposed budgets, summarizing the proposed charges, and
discussing the resolution of the open issues referenced in those documents.
We’ll first address the proposed budget, then introduce a summary of the preliminary proposed
service charges.
Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Budget
We have reviewed in detail the proposed BUDGET for FY 2020, and have utilized it to
establish preliminary cost of service allocations. This final version of the FY 2020 BUDGET
reflects ongoing review and modifications over the past two weeks to address certain elements,
as discussed herein. In effect, this final version produces a sixth scenario (Scenario “F”) that
appends the five sequential scenarios presented in the prior memoranda.
As a reminder, here are the scenarios.
A. Original plan from 2nd year of the FY 2019 Biennial Budget
B. Updated forecast resulting from the Series 2018 bond sale results
C. Initial planning level budget targets
D. Working version of budget as of 12/18/18
E. Working version of budget as of 1/2/2019
F. Preliminary Proposed GLWA Budget – 1/16/2019

(a)

0.8%

As indicated in the exhibit, the final version of the budget request (expressed as Scenario F)
results in noteworthy changes compared to the prior Scenario E, as briefly introduced below2.
Water Supply System
• A slight increase ($93,000) in the Water O&M budget, related to a modification in
the shared services arrangement with DWSD for water quality sampling activities;
• A $1.4 million decrease in budgeted debt service;
o Based on updated information regarding the approved Drinking Water
Revolving Fund projects, it is apparent that any interest payment requirements
will be minimal, and we have removed the originally estimated amounts from
the budgeted revenue requirements.
• Maintaining the prior budgeted contributions to the I&E Fund;

2

See Exhibit Pages 1-3.
Several of these budget elements also impact proposed water and sewer charges, as discussed in the next section.

Page 45

 Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Budget/Charges
Executive Summary
•

January 16, 2019
Page 3

These developments reduce the overall Water BUDGET increase from 3.5%
to 3.1%, and reduce the average Water Charge increase from 1.6% to 1.2%.
o Further, the establishment of a new “internal” Customer related to how
certain GLWA Sewer facilities will be billed for water service will reduced the
average Water Charge increase for existing Water Customers to 0.8%.

Sewage Disposal System
• A reduction of approximately $2.2 million in the Sewer O&M budget, related to
purchased water costs for certain GLWA Sewer facilities;
o The facilities in question are served off of GLWA transmission mains but are
currently billed by DWSD as full-service retail customer. The budget assumes
that this arrangement will cease as of July 1, 2019, and that GLWA Water will
invoice GLWA Sewer for internal “wholesale only” costs related to this
transaction. This arrangement will result in GLWA Sewer budget savings and
impact water cost of service allocations, as introduced later.
• An additional reduction of $1.5 million in the Sewer O&M budget, related to
combined sewer overflow programs;
o Ongoing detailed review indicates that certain of the programs introduced in
the FY 2019 Budget are likely to not be complete until FY 2020. This budget
modification was made to embrace the commitment to monitor the progress of
such programs, and to make modifications to ensure charges reflect anticipated
costs for this special cost pool.
• A slight ($100,000) reduction in the Sewer O&M budget related to implementation
of the proposed amendment to the OMID Service Agreement;
• Maintaining the prior budgeted contributions to the I&E Fund;
• These developments reduce the overall Sewer BUDGET increase from 3.5%
to 2.7%, and reduce the average Sewer Charge increase from 2.1% to 1.3%.

Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Service Charges
We have allocated the revenue requirements introduced in the prior section to Customers in
accordance with the current cost of service methodologies and have prepared proposed charges
for each Customer. Our proposed charges will be formally introduced and submitted next
week and will be accompanied with a detailed report. Herewith a brief introduction of key
elements impacting our proposed charges, followed by some comparative summaries.
Water Supply System
Let’s initially define how we’re classifying Water Customers for purposes of this discussion.
•

Of the 88 existing GLWA Water Customers:
o 85 are Suburban Wholesale Customers served via Master Meters
§ 49 of these Customers had their FY 2020 contractual max day and peak
hour demands impacted by the Contract Alignment Process (“CAP’);
Page 47

 Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Budget/Charges
Executive Summary

January 16, 2019
Page 5

§

•

The other 36 Customers did not have their demands adjusted for this
year – and are referred to herein as “NoMod” Customers;
o The other 3 Customers are not served via Master Meters, and are referred to
as the Non Master Metered (“NMM”) Customer Class
§ Detroit, Dearborn, Highland Park
There will be a new GLWA “internal” Water Customer, as GLWA Water will bill
certain GLWA Sewer facilities directly for water service.

Next, let’s introduce key elements impacting FY 2020 Water cost of service allocations.
•

•

•

•

The Units of Service (“UoS”) Study for the NMM Customers;
o Findings from the first phase of this study resulted in significant charge
increases for this class. These increases were partially implemented in the
current (FY 2019) water charges, with the understanding that the second – and
final - step towards effecting the findings would occur in FY 2020.
o Findings from the second phase of this study resulted in materially lower
charges for this class that envisioned in the first phase. The proposed FY 2020
charges fully implement the phase 2 UoS findings.
o The originally forecasted benefit to the other Customers associated with phase
1 findings is effectively eliminated in the FY 2020 charges.
The CAP results for those Customers whose demands were modified for FY 2020.
o The reduced demands for this class reallocates (all else being equal)
approximately $3.7 million of annual revenue requirement responsibility away
from this class to the other classes.
Redefined water service to GLWA sewer facilities served via of GLWA transmission
mains;
o Since these facilities will no longer be reflected as a DWSD retail customer, it
is appropriate to remove the related water usage from their units of service
established by the UoS study.
o We have done so, which lowers the allocate revenue requirement to Detroit
(although Detroit also suffers the revenue loss from the facilities).
o Under this operating scenario, GLWA Sewer becomes an internal GLWA Water
Customer, and assumes the units of service associated with the facilities. We
have established a wholesale cost that does not impact other Suburban
Wholesale Water Customers, although there is a benefit to all Sewer
Customers, as discussed below.
The impact of the detailed cost pool analyses for the FY 2020 budget, particularly
related to Centralized Services activities;

Page 48

 Preliminary Proposed FY 2020 Budget/Charges
Executive Summary

January 16, 2019
Page 6

o The results of these analyses have the general impact of increasing the portion
of the revenue requirements related to Transmission Mains, which are
allocated to Customers based on their peak hour demand and their distance
factor;
o As a result, Customers with relatively high peak hour demands and/or distance
factors will experience a higher than average charge adjustment than
Customers with relatively low peak hour demands and/or distance factors, all
else being equal.
The impact of the proposed water service charges on the major customer classes is summarized
in the table below3.

Again, let’s start by defining how we’re classifying Sewer Customers for purposes of this
discussion.

Oakland Macomb Interceptor District (“OMID”):
o Treated separately due to the OMID only cost pool and the implementation of
the proposed amendment to the OMID Service Agreement, discussed herein;
Non-OMID Suburban Wholesale;
o All other Suburban Wholesale Customers;
Detroit Customer Class

Here are the key elements impacting FY 2020 Sewer cost of service allocations.
•

The proposed amendment to the OMID Service Agreement;

See Exhibit Pages 4 through 6 for an illustration of how individual cost of service allocation elements impact
each Customer Class in total. These exhibits follow the format for a portion of the individual charge calculation
sheets that will be distributed to each Customer next week.

o The specifics of this proposed amendment are detailed under separate cover. In
summary, the proposed amendment would limit services provided to the
Northeast Sewer Pump Station (“NESPS”) to operating activities. All capital
financing and maintenance activities would be directly provided by OMID;
o The initial recognition of this new operating scenario will result in fewer costs
allocated directly to OMID, and more costs allocated to other cost pools,
including the “common to all SHAREs” cost pool;
o Our cost of service study and proposed charges implement this arrangement in
a manner designed to embrace stability objectives;
o For purposes of the FY 2020 Charges, we have assumed that one-half ($5.92
million) of the total capital contribution of $11.92 million will be treated as
revenue during FY 2020, and will be designed to meet FY 2020 revenue
requirements;
o We have assumed that the remaining $5.92 million will be treated similarly for
FY 2021.
The impact of the detailed cost pool analyses for the FY 2020 budget, particularly
related to Centralized Services activities;
o These analyses were particularly critical to establish the revised OMID only
cost pool assignments mentioned above;
o The results of these analyses have also had the effect of decreasing the overall
Sewer budget, and slightly increasing allocation to the Combined Sewer
Overflow (“CSO”) cost pool.
The reduced revenue requirements related to:
o Lower purchased water costs related to the redefined water service to GLWA
sewer facilities;
§ These savings are reflected as “common to all” based on existing
SHAREs
o Reduced CSO program budget;
§ 83% of these savings accrue to Detroit, and 17% to the Suburban
Customers.
The FY 2020 SHAREs are identical to the FY 2019 SHAREs, so there is no charge
impact of differential units of service.

We note that the Suburban Wholesale Sewer Charge adjustments in the above table reflect the
lower allocation of bad debt expense associated with Highland Park, and the Detroit
adjustments do not. Absent this adjustment, the average charge increase for the “All Other
Suburban Wholesale” class would be 2.4%.
We continue diligent review of the proposed charges and preparation of additional materials
to present our findings. We are prepared to discuss this matter at your convenience.

 AGENDA ITEM #7B

Date: January 18, 2019

To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Kathy Smith-Roy, Financial Services Member

Re:

General Retirement System Financial Report for Year-end June 30, 2018

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority’s (GLWA) assumed a portion of the legacy
pension commitment assigned to the City of Detroit Water & Sewerage Department
(DWSD) pursuant to the terms of the regional water and sewer leases. For this reason,
GLWA monitors activity related to the City of Detroit General Retirement System (GRS).
Attached are the following reports presented to the GRS Board at its December 5, 2018
meeting:

 Report letter to those charged with governance for The General Retirement of the
City of Detroit for the year ended June 30, 2018 (dated November 26, 2018)

 Audited Financial Report for The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit
(dated November 26, 2018)
 GASB Statement No. 68 Employer Reporting and Accounting Schedules of
Component II, June 30, 2017 (dated July 23, 2018)

 GASB Statement No 67 and 68 Accounting and Financial Reporting of Pension Plans
of Component II June 30, 2018 (dated October 31, 2018)

Highlights/Analysis: The June 30, 2017 Net Pension Liability of the system decreased to
$943.8 million from $992.9 million as of June 30, 2016 (approximately 5%). In
determining the total pension liability as of June 30, 2017, the changes in actuarial
assumptions from June 30, 2016 included the following.

1. The long-term expected return on assets was 6.91% net of investment expenses, as
of June 30, 2016 (it was 6.75% net of investment and administrative expenses, in
the June 30, 2016 funding valuation, as required by the Plan of Adjustment).
2. The Single Discount Rate (SDR) changed to 6.91% from 7.23% when compared to
the June 30, 2016 GASB 68 valuation.

Page 59

 At June 30, 2017 the DWSD Net Pension Liability decreased to $254.6 million from $276.1
million at June 30, 2016 (approximately 7.8% decrease). The following excerpt from the
report shows the schedule of changes in Net Pension Liability by unit.

Source: GASB Statement No. 68 Employer Reporting and Accounting Schedules of Component II, June 30, 2017 (dated July 23,
2018), p 18

On January 24, 2017, the parties agreed that 70.3 percent of the liability was allocable to
the GLWA regional operations and 29.7 percent to DWSD and is the basis of allocation for
future pension contributions. That net pension liability is further subdivided between the
Water System and the Sewer System for each entity.

For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 GLWA reported a net pension liability of $179
million.

The combined administrative expenses for Component I (Hybrid) and Component II
(Legacy) plans were $2.2M for June 30, 2018. The administrative expenses for both plans

Page 60

 was 3.0% of payroll; Component II is allocated 60% of the expenses, a decrease from June
30, 2017 of a 71% allocation.

GLWA tracks the Administrative Charges payments and expenses. At June 30, 2018 the
excess/overpayment of administrative charges have accumulated to $2.1 million. These
amounts are included in Prepaid Items and Other Assets in the June 30, 2018 Statement of
Net Position for GLWA.

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit GASB Statement No. 67 Plan
Reporting and Accounting Schedules of Component II June 30, 2018 reports a projected
decrease in Net Pension Liability to $832.7 million from $943.8 million as of June 30, 2017
(approximately 11.8%). For purposes of determining the total pension liability as of June
30, 2018, the changes in actuarial assumptions from June 30, 2017 included the following.
1. The long-term expected return on assets was 7.38% net of investment expenses, as
of June 30, 2017 (it was 6.91% net of investment and administrative expenses, in
the June 30, 2017 funding valuation, as required by the Plan of Adjustment).
2. The Single Discount Rate (SDR) changed to 7.38% from 6.91% when compared to
the June 30, 2017 GASB Statement No. 67 valuation.
The following is an excerpt from the GASB 67 report required supplemental information
showing the multi-year schedule of changes in net pension liability including the June 30,
2017 projected net pension liability.

Independent Auditor's Report

To the Board of Trustees
Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System of the City of Detroit

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying ?nancial statements of the Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System of the City of Detroit (the "Combined Plan") as of and for the year ended June 30. 2018 and the related
notes to the ?nancial statements. which collectively comprise the Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System of the City of Detroit's basic ?nancial statements. as listed in the table of contents.

Management?s for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these ?nancial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design.
implementation. and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of ?nancial
statements that are free from material misstatement. whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor?s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ?nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ?nancial statements
are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amoUnts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor?s judgment. including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the ?nancial statements. whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly. we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of signi?cant accounting estimates made by management. as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf?cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion. the ?nancial statements referred to above present fairly. in all material respects. the fiduciary net
position of the Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit as of June 30, 2018 and

the changes in its fiduciary net position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Other Matters
Required Suppiementai information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and other required supplemental information, as identi?ed in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic ?nancial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic
financial statements. is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers it to be an
essential part of ?nancial reporting for placing the basic ?nancial statements in an appropriate operational,
economic. or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplemental
information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the
information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic ?nancial statements. and
other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic ?nancial statements. We do not express an opinion or
provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with suf?cient
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Other Suppiementai information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the ?nancial statements that collectively
comprise the Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit's basic ?nancial statements.
The other supplemental information. as identi?ed in the table of contents, is presented for the purpose of
additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The other supplemental information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly
to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain
additional procedures. including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting
and other records used to prepare the basic ?nancial statements or to the basic ?nancial statements themselves,
and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. In our opinion, the other supplemental information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the
basic ?nancial statements as a whole.

Report on Summarized Comparative Information

We have previously audited the Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit's June
30, 201? financial statements, and we expressed an unmodi?ed audit opinion on those audited ?nancial
statements in our report dated December 4, 201?. In our opinion, the summarized comparative information
presented herein as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017 is consistent, in all material respects, with the
audited ?nancial statements from which it has been derived.

Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit

 

Managcn'icnfs Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

Fund Overview. Membership. and Governance

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit (DGRS or the ?System") consists of defined bene?t pension
plans and de?ned contribution plans for the nonunifon'ned employees of the City of Detroit. Michigan [the ?City?).
comprised of Component I and Component II. which are memorialized in a document entitled The Combined Plan
for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit. Michigan, made effective July 1. 2014. as amended and
restated December 8. 2014 (the ?Combined Plan?). This discussion and its accompanying ?nancial statements are
primarily concerned with Component I. a new pension plan created by the City effective July 1. 2014 for active
nonuniformed employees of the City to earn pension benefits on and after that date (also referred to as the ?Hybrid
Plan"). and Component II. the legacy pension plan where bene?ts were earned through June 30. 2014.

As discussed in greater detail below. at the conclusion of the 2014 ?scal year. the City "froze? Component II. The
"freeze? of Component II. which was the pension plan that existed as of June 30. 2014. means that no further
bene?t accruals occurred after that date. and no new employees are allowed to participate as members.

DGRS exists to pay benefits to its members. Members of the System include active nonuniformed city employees
retirees. and their bene?ciaries. Active members still employed with the City on and after July 1, 2014 earn service
credit that entitles them to receive bene?ts in the future in Component I. but not in Component II. which. as noted
above. has been frozen. Both the employer and municipal plan Sponsor for the System. the City. and actively
employed members have historically contributed to the System (the employee contributions were voluntary prior to
July 1. 2014). Retirees. their beneficiaries, and disabled members are those currently receiving benefits. though
the City elected in fiscal year 2015 to transition new disability claims from the benefit program administered by the
System to one administered by a third?party insurance carrier.

Component of DGRS is a newly created plan (effective July 1. 2014). with more active members earning service
credit than members eligible to receive or receiving bene?ts. As of June 30. 201?. there were 5.11?' active
members. with 200 retirees and 903 terminated plan members entitled to but not yet receiving bene?ts.

Component ll of DGRS is a relatively mature plan in that there are more members receiving current benefits than
active members. As of June 30. 2017. in Component there were 3.025 active members. with 11.334 members
receiving bene?ts and 3.355 terminated plan members entitled to but not yet receiving bene?ts. On June 30. 2014.
the emergency manager of the City of Detroit. Michigan issued Order #30. which froze Component it. After that
date. no new employees were allowed to participate in Component II. and bene?t accruals for members with
respect to service rendered prior to July 1. 2014 were frozen based on the member?s years of service. average
?nal compensation. and the pension multiplier formula as of the freeze date. Employees working after July 1. 2014
are now earning service credit in the Hybrid Plan. or Component l.

By way of background. a brief review of the City's migration from the Legacy Plan to the Hybrid Plan is
appropriate. On June 30. 2014. the emergency manager of the City of Detroit. Michigan issued Order #30. which
froze Component ll. After that date. no new employees were allowed to participate in Component ii. and bene?t
accruals for members with respect to service rendered prior to July 1. 2014 were frozen based on the member's
years of service. average final compensation. and the pension multiplier formula as of the freeze date. Employees
working after July 1. 2014 are now earning service credit in the Hybrid Plan. or Component 1. On July 1. 2014. the
City first published the Combined Plan with the city clerk. By August 1. 2014. the City completed the payroll
information systems project transitions required to allow now-mandatory employee contributions to be contributed
to Component I.

On October 19. 2014. the emergency manager issued Order No. 43. which amended and restated the Combined
Plan. On December 8. 2014. before leaving of?ce. the emergency manager issued Order No. 44. which again
amended and restated the Combined Plan. According to Order No. 44. the latest amendments and restatements
to the Combined Plan conformed the Combined Plan terms to the requirements of the City's bankruptcy plan and
made clarifying modi?cations. The Combined Plan is available at DGRS's website.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

In December 2014, DGRS governance was modi?ed as part of the City?s bankruptcy plan. DGRS is governed by a
board of trustees {the ?Board"). Although investment management is now the ultimate responsibility of a
seven-member investment committee (the ?Investment Committee"), the Board maintains its role as the governing
board vested with responsibility for the general administration, management, and operation of the System, with
which the Investment Committee assists, pursuant to Michigan law.

The Board is composed of 10 members. Five members are elected by the active membership to serve six-year
terms. A sixth member is elected by the retiree membership to serve a two-year term. A seventh member is
appointed by the mayor of the City of Detroit, Michigan from the citizens of the City to serve a six-year term. The
three remaining members serve ex of?cio, these members being the mayor of the City (or designee}, the city
treasurer, and one representative from the Detroit City Council. Expirations of terms of elected trustees are
staggered, while the remaining trustees serve in accordance with their of?ce or as a designee of an office.

The investment Committee has ?ve independent members appointed to initial terms with staggered expirations,
which terms will all eventually become six years. Two additional members, one active and one retired, serve on
the Investment Committee based on appointment by the Board. The Investment Committee will be in place
through at least December 2034.

The City of Detroit, Michiqan's Chamter 9 Bankruptcy Case, the Plan of Adiustment, and Implementation

In March 2013, after the City had endured years of ?nancial difficulty, the governor appointed an emergency
manager for the City pursuant to Michigan Public Act 436 of 2012 436}, which is a law that includes the ability
for an emergency manager to ?le a bankruptcy proceeding. In anticipation of that possibility, DGRS had
assembled a restructuring team of professional legal, ?nancial, actuarial, and other advisers to assist the System's
on-stafi professionals with meeting the unknown challenges that could arise if the City filed for bankruptcy
protection. At the direction of the board of trustees, the team of DGRS on-staff and other professionals met those
challenges, which ultimately revealed themselves as unprecedented in scope and implication for DGRS and its
members.

 

On July 13, 2013, the City ?led a petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan
(the ?Bankruptcy Court") seeking protection from its creditors under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code {the "Chapter 9 Case"). DGRS, one of the City's largest creditors because of its duty to collect employer
contributions from the City and the Cityis delinquency in making required employer contributions as of ?scal year
2013, objected to the City's request for Chapter 9 relief on the basis that Article IX, Section 24 of the Michigan
Constitution of 1983 prevented the City from diminishing accrued pension bene?ts, even in bankruptcy. On
December 5, 2013, after a hearing lasting several weeks, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order determining that
the City was eligible for Chapter 9 relief and holding that accrued pension bene?ts could be impaired in bankruptcy
despite the language of the Michigan Constitution. DGRS immediately ?led an appeal with the United States Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

The Bankruptcy Court also ordered DGRS and other creditors to mediate their disputes with the City, a process
which gained momentum in early 2014. As a result of court-ordered mediation, DGRS supported a proposed
settlement of DORS member pension claims. which was memorialized in the City's Fourth Amended Plan for the
Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit, filed on May 5, 2014 along with an accompanying Fourth Amended
Disclosure Statement (the "Pension Settlement"). On May 12, 2014, the City issued ballots to all DGRS members
as claim holders in Class 11 under the City?s classi?cation system for its creditors, seeking their approval of the
Pension Settlement.

On June 11, 2014, the Board adopted a resolution supporting treatment of the DGRS Class II claim holders as
part of the Pension Settlement. DGRS thereafter issued correspondence to its membership in support of the
treatment of Class 11 claims. Also in June, the Michigan Legislature adopted legislation, which the governor
signed, conditionally approving the State?s contribution of $194.8 million, split between DGRS and the Police and
Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit. to support the resolution of the Chapter 9 Case.

Page 69

Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit

 

Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

In a balloting process that closed on July 11. 2014. the pension claim holders, including DGRS members, were
deemed by the Bankruptcy Court to have supported the City's treatment of pension claims in the Pension
Settlement. In order to facilitate the orderly flow of information on a timely basis to DGRS members concerning
their individual pension claims against the City, the System and its professionals provided material logistical
support to the City in connection with the balloting process, without which the City would not have met the
deadlines required by the Bankruptcy Court.

Meanwhile, in June 2014, separate and apart from the Chapter 9 Case, the emergency manager directed the City
and its professional pension advisors to undertake efforts to prepare documentation and emergency manager
orders necessary to freeze the Legacy Plan as of June 30, 2014 and establish the Hybrid Plan effective July 1,
2014. As alluded to earlier, the emergency manager effectuated this action pursuant to authority under PA 436,
separate and apart from those pension changes requiring Bankruptcy Court approval. The System and its
professionals provided timely cooperation to the City in this effort, without which the City could not have
accomplished the active pension transitions it deemed necessary.

In the Chapter 9 Case, the Pension Settlements terms were carried forward to the Eighth Amended Plan for
Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit {the ?Plan of Adjustment"), ?led with the Bankruptcy Court on October
22, 2014. In November 2014, after a confirmation hearing lasting several weeks, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed
the Plan of Adjustment, which became effective December 10, 2014. The Pension Settlement, as part of the Plan
of Adjustment, compromised pension claims and provided funding support for legacy pension bene?t obligations
under DGRS Component II from the State of Michigan, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and certain foundation donors.

Those governance changes included establishment of the Investment Committee effective December 10, 2014,
which of?cially marked the beginning of implementation of the Plan of Adjustment, though DGRS had for months
already undertaken contingency planning for all of the pension adjustments required by the Pension Settlement.
The governance changes also included periodic and interim special reporting requirements for the Board and the
Investment Committee to the City, the Foundation for Detroit?s Future. and the State of Michigan.

For DGRS, with respect to Component benefit adjustments, the Pension Settlement (for which benefit levels
were and are contingent on other factors, including receipt of outside contributions), provided for a loss of cost of
living adjustments, or ?escalators" (COLAs), paid after July 1, 2014; a 4.5 percent cut to the remaining accrued
pension bene?t after the COLA loss; and, for DGRS members who participated in the Annuity Savings Fund plan
between 2003 and 2013, subject to certain caps, recoupment of certain amounts of interest deemed by the City to
be in ?excess" of that which should have been credited to individual ASF accounts, referred to as 
Recoupment." ASF Recoupment, like other provisions of the Pension Settlement, was not optional. Most members
will pay their ASF Recoupment by a deduction from their future pension bene?ts for a set term of months,
including interest calculated at 5.75 percent. All members were offered a lump-sum cash option, which was limited
in the aggregate to $30 million in member recoupment. The Plan of Adjustment also included the possibility of
restoration of certain pension benefit cuts, based on a program for the most financially vulnerable pensioners and
bene?ciaries through the State of Michigan Treasury Department, as well as a new feature of Component ll
allowing restoration depending on the System?s funding level over time.

Other components of implementation of the Plan of Adjustment proceeded between December 2014 and March
2015 and included dismissal of related litigation proceedings, including appeal of the Bankruptcy Court?s
eligibility determination in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The process of implementing the
Plan of Adjustment is expected to continue through 2017 and beyond. with monitoring, compliance, and other
activity by DGRS. its board of trustees, and its Investment Committee. On December 1. 2014, DGRS provided its
retirees and beneficiary members with applications for the Income Stabilization Program (the Program?)
established as part of the State Contribution Agreement, another facet of the Pension Settlement. The ISF
Program, supported by city funds arising from an unlimited tax general obligation bonds settlement, is intended to
ensure that the most ?nancially vulnerable retirees and bene?ciaries do not fall below the poverty line as a result of
bankruptcy-related pension changes. The ISF Program was implemented on March 1, 2015, along with other
bankruptcy?related pension benefit changes.

Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit

 

Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

DGRS, with considerable contributions from its executive staff, management, and information technology
professionals, in addition to outside professional advisors, successfully implemented the vast majority of pension
adjustment required by the Plan of Adjustment in a timely fashion on March 1, 2015.

As of that date, less than three months after the effective date of the Plan of Adjustment, DGRS successfully
implemented the vast majority of bene?t changes required by the plan, including the Program coordinated in
conjunction with the Michigan Department of Treasury. DGRS continues to implement the Plan of Adjustment with
ongoing compliance and additional reporting requirements by the Board and the Investment Committee and
annual review of benefit levels and essentially provides for a 40-year plan to close the DGRS Legacy Component
II underfunded liability. ASF Recoupment, in particular, is a notable facet of the Plan of Adjustment that will
continue to be implemented as members apply for Component ll pension benefits over time. DGRS met its
obligations in ?scal year 2017 concerning implementation of the Plan of Adjustment and continued compliance in
fiscal year 2013.

Contributions to the System

Historically, both the City and active employees have made regular contributions to the System, though employee
contributions were optional in Component II, essentially before July 1, 2014, though there was a period of
transition due to the City's aging information technology infrastructure which meant that voluntary employee
contributions to Component ll continued through July 2014, and mandatory employee contributions to Component
I from active payroll were implemented as of August 1, 2014.

Basic pension and disability benefits in Component II had been funded through employer contributions plus
investment earnings on those contributions, but employee contributions are mandatory in Component I. The
required employer contributions had been determined by the System?s actuaries using the entry age normal cost
method, which is still the case. Assumptions used by the actuaries are subject to experience testing every five
years, which is also still the case. Effective December 10, 2014, as part of the resolution of the Chapter 9 Case,
the investment return assumption and discount rate used by the System?s actuary for purposes of determining the
System's assets and liabilities for funding purposes was fixed at 6.75 percent through the period ending June 30,
2023. This applies to both Component and Component ll.

Prior to the filing of the Chapter 9 Case, the City's General Fund stopped making payments related to unsecured
funded debt and legacy liabilities, including payments to the System for Component it on behalf of most of 
members. Notably, for some segments of member population, such as those employees and retirees from
the Detroit Library Commission, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, and the CCBC Authority, employer
contributions continued to be remitted to DGRS even after the Chapter 9 Case was ?led. These situations led to
disputes in the Bankruptcy Court, which were eventually resolved by the Plan of Adjustment.

When the City ?led the Chapter 9 Case, obligations owed by the City became potentially subject to compromise in
the bankruptcy process. The pension claims of DGRS members were determined by the Bankruptcy Court to be
included as unsecured obligations. The City's last General Fund employer contribution before the Chapter 9 Case
on behalf of employee and retiree groups not listed above was made on November 30. 2012. During fiscal year
2014, the City did not make any contributions to the System from the General Fund, but the Library, DWSD, and
COBC Authority did remit payments. In the Chapter 9 Case, DGRS ?led a claim against the City for $66.6 million
as of July 18, 2013, re?ecting past due employer contributions with interest for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. This
amount did not re?ect the full unfunded actuarial accrued liability of the System.

Page 71

 

Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit
Management's Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

 

Going forward, the obligations for contributions to support Component ll of the System through 2023 are
determined as ?xed amounts by the provisions in the Plan of Adjustment. Pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment, the
System is expected to receive contributions of a total of $718.6 million through fiscal year 2023. The Plan of
Adjustment calls for the System to receive $98.8 million from the State of Michigan; $428.5 million from 
$31.7 million from UTGC settlement proceeds; the present value equivalent or actual contribution of $50 million
from the and its foundation donors during a 10-year period ending in 2024; the present value equivalent or
actual contribution of $18.3 million per year from 2025 through 2034 from certain foundations; and $114.6 million
from the other City-related employer contribution sources, such as the General Fund, Detroit Library Commission,
and COED Authority, over a 10-year period covering fiscal year 2014 through ?scal year 2023. After 2023, the
City, and various other employer constituents such as the Library, DWSD, and C030 Authority, will retain
responsibility for the full funding obligations of Component II of the System, consistent with Michigan law.

The Plan of Adjustment allows for certain of the Legacy Plan funding obligations to through 2034 to be
met by prepayment of the present value equivalent using a discount rate of 6.75 percent. in ?scal year ended June
30, 2016, a portion of the BIA obligation to make annual $5 million contributions over 10 years ending in 2034 was
prepaid. This present value prepayment resulted in DGRS receiving $32,511,827 on June 30, 2016 from the BIA,
which represents the present value, using a 6.75 percent discount rate, of $4,625,000 per year for the nine years
remaining on that annual $5,000,000 commitment ending in 2024. Pursuant to the Plan of Adjustment, DGRS still
expects to receive the equivalent or actual remaining $375,000 per year from the BIA for that 10-year period
ending in 2024 and did also receive, on June 30, 2016, the amount of $375,000 in satisfaction of the fiscal year
2016 obligation from the BIA that was not prepaid.

In addition, the City was to remit payments on the UTGO Stub Bonds to the Combined Plan through 2028. In ?scal
year 2017, the City of Detroit, Michigan refunded all of its outstanding UTGO Stub Bonds. Upon refunding, the
payments to the Combined Plan were accelerated, with a majority of the outstanding balance paid to the
Combined Plan in fiscal year 2017; as a result, the Combined Plan received approximately $7.7 million in the ISP
and $18.3 million in Component ll related to this transaction.

With respect to Component l, the Hybrid Plan, nonuniformed employees who are members of DGRS are now
required to make mandatory contributions of 4 percent of pay toward their de?ned bene?t pensions earned with
the City, and the City contributes an additional 5 percent of pay. The City no longer counts overtime in the
calculation of its employer contribution.

The City is also setting aside an additional 0.75 percent of payroll to meet the premium payments required for the
disability insurance established with a third-party carrier. DGRS is not administering those third-party carrier-
managed disability bene?ts.

On June 30, 2018, the City met its obligation for Component employer contributions by contributing $14,673,644
to DGRS.

lm act of Ci of Detroit Michi an Collective Bar ainin and Bankru tc Pension Ad'ustments

 

Pursuant to Emergency Manager Order No. 30, the existing Component de?ned contribution plan and de?ned
benefit plan were frozen, preventing any future accruals or new members in Component effective June 30, 2014.

The following changes became effective July 1, 2014, with the advent of Component I:

. The Hybrid Plan de?ned bene?t plan commenced with mandatory contributions of 4 percent of base pay. The
City contributes 5 percent of employee base pay, not including overtime.

I A new Hybrid Plan de?ned contribution plan for the Annuity Savings Fund. Employees may make voluntary
Annuity Savings Fund contributions up to 7 percent of total after-tax pay. Interest will be credited at the actual
net investment rate of return of DGRS, but will, in no event. be lower than 0 percent or higher than 5.25
percent.

. The Hybrid Plan provides that future duty disability and nonduty disability retirement allowances for members
who become disabled after July 1, 2014 move to a commercial insurance program through the City

Benefit Payments

The System exists to pay the bene?ts that its members have earned pursuant to benefits promised by the City,
subject to the Chapter 9 Case bene?t adjustments going forward in the Legacy Plan and the new promises in the
Hybrid Plan. Bene?ts are paid In fiscal year 2016, DGRS paid out $256.5 million in bene?ts. consisting of
$240.4 million in benefits to retirees and beneficiaries plus $16.1 million in refunds of Annuity Savings Fund
balances. The bene?ts and refunds represent approximately 12.5 percent of the net position of the System as of
June 30, 2018. Employer, foundation, and employee contributions were $012 million, or 4.7 percent of the net
position of the System. The excess of benefits over contributions of $143.2 million is funded through investment
income. The public capital markets represent the primary source of opportunities to earn investment income.

Asset Allocation

The Board and Investment Committee of DGRS believe that the principal determinant of total fund investment
performance over long periods of time is asset allocation. The asset allocation is built upon the foundation
that the obligations of the System to pay the bene?ts promised to its members are very long-term obligations.
Accordingly, the Board and Investment Committee must make investment decisions that it believes will be the
most bene?cial to the System over many years, notjust one or two years.

has established asset allocation policies that are expected to deliver investment income over a very long
period of time to satisfy the obligations to pay the bene?ts promised to the members of the System. The following
is a summary of the DGRS asset allocation policy as of June 30, 2018:

 

Asset Class Target Allocation
Global equity 43.00 ?it:
Global ?xed income 19.00
Real estatefReal assets 15.00
Private equity 3.00
Hedge funds 5.00
Risk parity 5.00
Diversifying strategies 4.00
Cash 1.00

DGRS asset allocation policies comply with Michigan law.
Investment Results

DGRS calculates investment results on a time-weighted Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) basisr
unless explicitly stated otherwise. All returns for periods of one year or greater have been annualized.

Total Fund Comgosite

DGRS total fund composite return for the year was 6.5 percent. net of fees and expenses using a time-weighted
methodology. The fund returned and it? percent for its three-year and five-year annualized returns,
respectively, net of fees and expenses.

well-diversi?ed global portfolio performed well across most asset classes. During fiscal year 2018. volatility
in the equity markets remained subdued. and the fund?s performance was generated by a well-diversi?ed portfolio
largely driven by robust global equity returns. Domestic equities led the way with a total return in excess of 14
percent for the ?scal year.

As part of the resolution of the City of Detroit, Michigan?s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Case. the discount rate
assumption used to meet current and future benefit obligations was set at 6.75 percent through the period ending
June 30, 2023. This discount rate assumption provided in the Chapter 0 Case does not purport to establish an
investment return assumption or discount rate for purposes of. or in accordance with, generally accepted
accounting principles. Although the fund?s return for this year fell below this assumption, the fund's longer-term
return expectation, which this assumption is intended to characterize. still exceeds this assumption.

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies
Reporting Entity

The City of Detroit, Michigan {the "City"} sponsors the Combined Plan for the General Retirement System
of the City of Detroit [the "Combined Plan")? which consists of two single-employer retirement plans, as
described below.

Component if

This is the legacy plan that is the original defined benefit plan, which includes a defined benefit component
and a de?ned contribution component. Component ll generally applies to bene?ts accrued by members
prior to July 1, 2014. On June 30. 2014, as a result of negotiations between the City and the public
employee unions, the existing plan benefit formulas were frozen] and no employees were allowed to earn
bene?ts under the existing plan. The emergency manager issued Order #30 (General Retirement System
of the City of Detroit) on June 30+ 2014, which put these changes into effect. Except as speci?cally
provided in the Combined Plan, bene?ts provided under Component II are frozen effective June 30, 2014.

Component II also includes the Income Stabilization Fund. The fund, which is part of Component only
and established as a special plan of adjustment provision, was established for the sole purpose of paying
the income Stabilization Benefits and Income Stabilization Benefits Plus to Eligible Pensioners. A portion
of the funds received by the Combined Plan from UTGO Bond Tax Proceeds is credited to the Income
Stabilization Fund. The allocation is based on the "Aggregate Payments to Plan Assignees" included in the
Eighth Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit (the After 2022. the
Investment Committee may recommend to the board that a portion or all of the assets that exceed income
stabilization bene?ts {including Income Stabilization Bene?ts Plus) to be paid in the future be used to fund
regular pension payments.

Nonemgioger Contributing Entity withjn Component if

On September 9. 2014, a memorandum of understanding {the was entered into by the emergency
manager and mayor of the City of Detroit, Michigan; county executive of each of the charter counties of
Wayne and Macomb, Michigan; the County of Oakland. Michigan; and the governor of the State of
Michigan. The purpose of the MOU was to establish a framework for the creation of a regional authority
{known as Great Lakes Water Authority - GLWA) pursuant to Act 233 of 1955 to operate, control. and
improve the regional assets of the water supply system and the sewage disposal system owned by the
City.

Pursuant to the MOU, the City of Detroit, Michigan and GLWA entered into two lease agreements: the
Regional Water Supply System Lease dated June 12, 2015 and the Regional Sewage Supply System
Lease dated June 12. 2015. Under the provisions of the lease agreements, GLWA leases the regional
assets of the City for a period of at least 40 years.

Pursuant to the lease agreements, on December 1, 2015, a tri-party agreement between the City of
Detroit, Michigan; General Retirement System of the City of Detroit and GLWA was signed. Per
the FDA and Section 4.3 of the lease agreements, GLWA is required to pay a portion of the pension
obligation that will be allocable to the Detroit Water and Sewer Department (DWSD). The purpose of the
pension reporting agreement is to set forth in determining the funding status for the DWSD pension pool
and for GRS to agree to provide GLWA with certain actuarial and other reports to enable GLWA to
properly manage and pay its portion of the pension obligation that is allocable to DWSD.

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2018, GLWA was launched. Accordingly, the prior DWSD division was split into hvo -
one representing the ongoing DWSD department, now referenced as DWSD?Retail and
another to represent the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA). In accordance with the pension reporting
agreement, the net position and liabilities of DWSD were allocated to DWSD-R and GLWA in accordance
with written directions received from and GLWA. Per written directions, GLWA is to be allocated
70.3 percent of the net position and liabilities of DWSD. Because GLWA has no employees or retirees in
the Combined Plan, GLWA is considered a nonemployer contributing entity in accordance with GASB
Statement No. 

The ?nancial statements of the Combined Plan reflect the net position and pension liabilities of the plan as
a whole, which includes the portion allocable to GLWA. While the allocation of the net pension liability as
of June 30, 2018 has not yet been ?nalized, GLWA's portion of the total Component ll net pension liability
of $944,129,251 at June 30, 2017 was $178,961,908, with the remainder aliocable to the City of Detroit,
Michigan and related entities.

Component 

As of July 1, 2014, all current and future employees participate in the new hybrid pension plan, or
Component I. Active city employees who participated in the legacy plan will receive the bene?ts they have
earned under the plan through June 30, 2014 plus an additional bene?t under the new hybrid plan formula,
assuming all vesting requirements are met.

Combined Plan 

The Combined Plan is a separate and independent trust quali?ed under applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code; it is an independent entity (separate and distinct from the employerlplan sponsor]
as required by (1) state law and (2) lntemal Revenue Code provisions setting forth quali?ed plan status.
The trustees of the Combined Plan have a ?duciary obligation and legal liability for any violations of
?duciary duties as independent trustees. The Combined Plan provides retirement, disability, and survivor
bene?ts to plan members and beneficiaries.

The ?nancial statements for the Combined Plan are also reported in the ?nancial statements of the City of
Detroit, Michigan as a pension trust fund. The assets of the pension trust funds include no securities of or
loans to the City or other related parties.

These financial statements include comparative columns for 2017. Such information is not meant to be a
complete presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with the plan's ?nancial statements
for the year ended June 30, 201?.

Plan Sponsor Financial Condition - lmpact on the Combined Plan

In the past, the City of Detroit, Michigan (the "plan sponsor") has experienced signi?cant ?nancial dif?culty
and liquidity concerns. As of June 2013, the City had defaulted on approximately $38 million of pension
contributions due to the Combined Plan. During ?scal year 2014, the City did not pay any employer
contributions into the Combined Plan. despite the fact that there were actuarially required contributions.

In February 2013, the governor appointed a ?nancial review team, which determined that a local
government ?nancial emergency existed in the City. This culminated in bankruptcy proceedings, which the
City initiated in July 2013. Part of the federal court's ruling in December 2013 indicated that the bankruptcy
status usurped whatever protections may be offered governmental pensions under the Michigan
Constitution. On December 10, 2014. the City exited from bankruptcy through con?rmation of the Eighth
Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit (the The FDA speci?es certain
provisions pertinent to the Legacy and Hybrid plans, including contributions and bene?ts.

In fiscal year 2018, the contributions that were received by the Combined Plan were made in accordance
with the provisions of the FDA. See Note 10 for signi?cant changes that were implemented by the
Combined Plan under the POA.

Summagy of Significant Accounting Policies

The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies used by the Combined Plan for the
General Retirement System of the City of Detroit.

Accounting and Reporting Principles

The Combined Plan follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
as applicable to governmental units. Accounting and ?nancial reporting pronouncements are
promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.

Basis of Accounting

The Combined Plan uses the economic resources measurement focus and the full accrual basis of
accounting. Revenue is recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred,
regardless of the timing of related cash ?ows. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in
which the contributions are due. Employer contributions are recognized when due pursuant to legal
requirements. Bene?ts and rernds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of
the plan.

Specific Balances and Transactions
Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Combined Plan considers cash on hand, demand deposits. and short-term investments with an
original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

in vesunents

Investments are reported at fair value or estimated fair value. Short?term investments are reported at cost,
which approximates fair value. Securities traded on a national or international exchange are valued at the
last reported sales price at current exchange rates. Mortgages are valued on the basis of future principal
and interest payments. The fair value of real estate investments is based on periodic appraisals, as well
as the judgment of independent real estate advisers and management. Investments that do not have an
established market value are reported at estimated fair value as determined by the Combined Plan's
management.

Approximately $81,000,000 or 4 percent of the Combined Plan's net position as of June 30, 2018 does not
have a readily determinable market value and has been estimated by management.

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are generally priced by the custodian using
nationally recognized pricing services and practices. For investments that do not have readily observable
market prices. including but not limited to private equity, public and private real estate, alternatives, and
direct loans, management's estimate of their fair value is based on information provided by investment
managers, general partners, real estate advisers, and other means. These sources are held to a standard
of reasonable care in verifying that the valuations presented reasonably re?ect the underlying fair value of
the investments. A variety of factors is considered in the valuation process, including the nature of the
investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable investments. and
current and projected operating performance. However, due to the inherent uncertainty and the degree of
judgment involved in determining fair value for such investments, the values reflected in the ?nancial
statements may differ signi?cantly from values that would have been used had a readily determinable
market value for the investments existed, and the difference could be material.

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Contributions Receivable

At June 30, 2018, there was $2,981,384 in employer contributions receivable. This amount relates to fiscal
year 2018 Component I contributions and was paid in July 2018.

As a result of the Plan of Adjustment. payments on the UTGO Stub Bonds were assigned to the De?ned
Benefit and Income Stabilization Fund of Component ll of the Combined Plan. The City was to remit
payments on the UTGO Stub Bonds to the Combined Plan through 2028. In ?scal year 201?, the City of
Detroit, Michigan refunded all of its outstanding UTGO Stub Bonds. Upon refunding, the payments to the
Combined Plan were accelerated, with approximately million and $18.3 million (Component ll)
received by the Combined Plan in ?scal year 201?.

The remaining balance owed to the Combined Plan, excluding interest, was $4,250,318 for the De?ned
Bene?t Fund and $1,783,258 for the income Stabilization Fund. This amount, which had been recognized
as part of employer contributions during the year ended June 30, 2017. was remitted by an escrow agent
to the Combined Plan during the year ended June 30, 2018.

ASF Recoupment Receivable - Component ll (Legacy)

For members who elected to make employee contributions into the de?ned contributions-style program,
referred to as the annuity saving fund between July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2013. the PDA called for
recoupment of amounts that the City calculated were ?excess interest" credited to individual ASF
accounts. In 2011. the City Council adopted an ordinance that limited ASF interest credits to the plan?s net
investment return, with a cap of 7.9 percent and a ?oor of 0 percent. The FDA calculation of "excess
interest" applies the interest formula in the 2011 Ordinance to the July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2013
recoupment period, with a 20 percent cap on the highest balance in this given period. The recoupment
amount is also capped at 15.5 percent of the pension check. The City offered both a limited lump
sum or payment option. Repayment of these excess interest amounts is not optional. As of June
30, 2018, the Combined Plan has approximately $104.9 million to be collected. The receivable will be
collected, with 8.75 percent interest, as a reduction to pension bene?ts for those with recoupment
balances outstanding.

Receivabier?Payabie from investment Sales/Purchases

The Combined Plan liquidated investments prior to year end and reported a receivable from investment
sales at June 30, 2018 in the amount of $2,083,801. The proceeds from the sales were received
subsequent to year end. In addition, the Combined Plan purchased investments prior to year end and
reported a payable from investment purchases at June 30, 2018 in the amount of $15,878,514. This
amount was paid subsequent to year and.

Notes Receivable from Participants

In Component (Legacy), any active general employee who is or has been a participant in the 1573
de?ned contribution plan (annuity savings fund} may be eligible for the employee loan program. The
minimum amount of the loan was established at $1,000. The maximum loan is the lesser of 50 percent of
the member's account balance in the annuity saving fund or $10,000. Members can borrow as either a
general purpose loan payable in one to ?ve years or a residential loan payable in 1 to 15 years. A member
can have only two outstanding loans. The balance of these loans for the year ended June 30, 2018 was
$4,085,350. The balance is measured at the unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid
interest. Participant notes receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible.

Although Component I (Hybrid) allows participant loans, there are none outstanding at June 30, 2018.

Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
Capitai Assets

Capital assets for the Combined Plan include software, office equipment, and furniture. Depreciation
expense is calculated by allocating the net cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of ?nancial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
Unites States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the ?nancial statements and the reported amounts of additions and deductions during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Note 2 - Pension Plan Description
Component ii (Legacy Pian) and Component 1 (Hybrid Plan)
Pian Administration

The Combined Plan?s governance was modified in December 2014 as part of the City's bankruptcy plan.
The Combined Plan's board of trustees and investment Committee administer the Combined Plan for the
General Retirement System of the City of Detroit Pension Plan - a single-employer de?ned bene?t and
de?ned contribution plan that provides retirement benefits. as well as survivor and disability benefits, for
plan members and beneficiaries. Plan members include active employees, retirees, and bene?ciaries from
various departments within the City of Detroit, Michigan. Bene?t terms have been established by
contractual agreements between the Combined Plan and the employees' collective bargaining unit, as
modi?ed by the FDA. Future amendments are subject to the same process. However, pursuant to the
POA, pension benefit terms presently expressed in the Combined Plan are not subject to amendment
before June 30, 2023, unless an amendment is required to maintain the tax-quali?ed status of the
Combined Plan. The obligation to contribute to and maintain the Combined Plan was established by the
City Charter and negotiations with the employees? collective bargaining units.

The board is composed of 10 members. Five members of the board are elected by the active membership
to serve six-year terms. One member is elected by the retiree membership to serve a two-year term. One
member is appointed by the mayor of the City of Detroit. Michigan from the citizens of the City to serve a
six-year term. Three members serve ex-of?cio. these members being the mayor of the City (or designee},
the city treasurer. and one representative from the Detroit City Council. Expirations of terms of elected
trustees are staggered.

The Investment Committee has five independent members appointed to initial terms with staggered
expirations, which terms will all eventually become six years. Two additional members, two active
members, and two retired members serve on the Investment Committee based on appointment by the
board. The Investment Committee will be in place through at least December 2034.

Benefits Provided

The Combined Plan provides retirement, disability, and death bene?ts. Benefit terms had been
established by negotiations between the City Council and the employees' collective bargaining unit and
subject to amendment by the City Council. Further changes to bene?ts were provided for under the PDA.

Total employees covered by the plan 18,214 6,250

 

 

As of June 30, 2014, Component II has been frozen. As of that date, no new participants were allowed to
enter the plan, and no new bene?t accruals were allowed for existing participants.

After July 1, 2014, active members will retain existing service credit in the Legacy Plan, but will only earn
existing service credit in the new Hybrid Plan.

Contributions

Article 9, Section 24 of the State of Michigan Constitution requires that financial benefits arising on
account of employee service rendered in each year be funded during that year. Accordingly, in the past,
the Combined Plan had retained an independent actuary to determine the annual contribution. The
actuarially determined rate was the estimated amount necessary to ?nance the costs of bene?ts earned
by plan members during the year, with an additional amount to ?nance any unfunded accrued liability.
However, until 2024, contributions are based on specific provisions in accordance with the Plan of
Adjustment.

The City ?led for bankruptcy in 2013 and on November 12, 2014, the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan entered an order con?rming the Eighth Amended Plan for the Adjustment
of Debts of the City of Detroit. Going forward, the obligation for the City to contribute to the Combined Plan
will be determined by the provisions in the Eighth Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of
Detroit. Please read Note 10 for further information.

Employer and Nonempioyer Contributing Entity Contributions
Component ii

 

For Component ll, during fiscal year 2018, employer contributions are not actuarially determined, but are
determined by the provisions of the FDA detailed under Exhibit  l.B.3.r.ii.A of the FDA. Included within
contributions for ?scal year 2018 in Component II are contributions from the Foundation for Detroit's
Future (the "Foundation") in the amount of $375,000 and approximately $67.9 million of contributions from
the City, City-related entities. and GLWA. Employer contributions were also made into the income
Stabilization Fund for $38,494 from the UTGC Stub Bond proceeds.

Note 2 - Pension Pian Description (Continued)

Component i

For Component I, during ?scal year 2019, employer contributions are not actuarially determined, but are
determined by the provisions of the Combined Plan detailed under Section 9.3 of Component I. For
Section 9.3, commencing on July 1, 2014 and ending on June 30, 2023, the City is required to contribute 5
percent of compensation of active members. A portion of the employer's annual contribution for each plan
year, as determined by the City, shall be credited to the Rate Stabilization Fund reserve with the
remainder allocated to the Pension Accumulation Fund reserve. During ?scal year 2013, the City and
related entities contributed $14,5i3,644 into the Hybrid Plan. Beginning in 2024, the employer
contributions will be actuarially determined based on the amount necessary to fund the plan on an
actuarial basis.

Because there were no actuarially determined contributions for Component I, there is no required
schedule of city contributions included within these ?nancial statements.

Emgio yea Contributions
Component il

Contribution requirements of plan members were historically established and amended by the board of
trustees in accordance with the City Charter, union contracts, and plan provisions. For the year ended
June 30, 2018, there were no employee contributions into Component II, as the plan was frozen as of
June 30, 2014.

Component i

Contribution requirements of plan members are established in Sections 9.3 and 10.1 of Component of
the Combined Plan. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the required active member contribution rate for
employees was 4.0 percent of annual pay. Additionally, employees can make voluntary contributions of 3
percent, 5 percent, or percent of annual pay. During ?scal year 2018, the plan received mandatory and
voluntary employee contributions of $14,140,61 8.

Fiscal Responsibility Provision

To safeguard the long?term actuarial and financial integrity of the Combined Plan, in the event the funding
level of Component 1 projected over a ?ve-year period falls below 100 percent, certain remedial actions
are required, as set forth in Section 9.5 of Component of the Combined Plan, including elimination of
COLA, transfers from the Rate Stabilization Fund reserve to the Pension Accumulation Fund reserve, and
increases in mandatory employee contributions from 4 percent to 5 percent.

In the event the funding level of Component is protected to fall below 80 percent, additional remedial
actions are required, including further increasing the mandatory employee contributions to 6 percent and
the potential for reducing the retirement allowance.

Note 3 - Deposits and Investments

The Combined Plan is authorized by Michigan Public Act 314 of 1965, as amended, to invest in certain
reverse repurchase agreements, stocks, diversi?ed investment companies, annuity investment contracts,
real estate leased to public entities, mortgages, real estate, debt or equity of certain small businesses,
certain state and local government obligations, and certain other specified investment vehicles.

The investment policy adopted by the Board is in accordance with Public Act 196 of 1997' and has
authorized investments according to Michigan Public Act 314 of 1965, as amended. The Combined Plan?s
deposits and investment policies are in accordance with statutory authority.

Note 3 - Deposits and Investments (Continued)

The Combined Plan invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various
risks. such as interest rate, market, credit risks, and overall market volatility. Due to the level of risk
associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values
of investment securities will occur in the near term and such changes could materially affect the amounts
reported on the statement of changes in ?duciary net position.

The Combined Plan?s cash and investments are subject to several types of risk, which are examined in
more detail below:

Custodial Credit Risk of Bank Deposits

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the Combined Plan's deposits may not be
returned to it. The Combined Plan does not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. Approximately
$4.8 million of the Combined Pian's checking account balances was uninsured and uncollateralised at
June 30, 2018. The Combined Plan believes that, due to the dollar amounts of cash deposits and the
limits of FDIC insurance, it is impractical to insure all deposits. As a result, the Combined Plan evaluates
each ?nancial institution with which it deposits funds and assesses the level of risk of each institution; only
those institutions with an acceptable estimated risk level are used as depositories.

interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of investments will decrease as a result of a rise in interest rates.
The Combined Plan's investment policy does not restrict investment maturities.

At year end, the Combined Plan had the following investments and maturities:

 

 

Fair Value (in Less Than 1 More Than 10
Investment Type thousands) Year 1-5 Years 5?1 0 Years Years
Domestic ?xed income" 59,887 59.88? - - -
Mutual funds 182 - - - 132
Total 60,069 5; 59,83? :5 - - 182

 

 

*Not all domestic fixed income are subject to interest rate risk.
Credit Risk

State law limits investments in commercial paper to the top two ratings issued by nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations. The Combined Plan has no investment policy that would further limit its
investment choices.

At June 30, 2013, the credit quality ratings of debt securities (other than the U.S. government) as rated by
Moody's are as follows:

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that an investment denominated in the currency of a foreign country could
reduce its U.S. dollar value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Combined Plan
does not restrict the amount of investments in foreign currency.

The following securities are subject to foreign currency risk:

Securities Lending

As permitted by state statutes and under the provisions of a Securities Lending Authorization Agreement,
the Combined Plan lends securities to broker-dealers and banks for collateral that will be returned for the
same securities in the future. The Combined Plan's custodial bank manages the securities lending
program and receives cash, government securities. or irrevocable bank letters of credit as collateral. The
custodial bank does not have the ability to pledge or sell collateral securities unless the borrower defaults.
Borrowers are required to deliver collateral for each loan equal to not less than 102 percent of the market
value of the loaned securities.

As of June 30. 2018. the collateral provided was 102.16 percent of the market value of the loaned
securities. which is in excess of the required 102 percent.

The Combined Plan did not impose any restrictions during the fiscal year on the amount of loans made on
its behalf by the custodial bank. There were no failures by any borrowers to return loaned securities or pay
distributions thereon during the ?scal year. Moreover. there were no losses during the fiscal year resulting
from a default of the borrowers or custodial bank.

Notes to Financial Statements

 

June 30, 2018
Note 3 - Deposits and Investments (Continued)

The Combined Plan and the borrower maintain the right to terminate all securities lending transactions on
demand. The cash collateral received on each loan was invested, together with the cash collateral of other
lenders, in an investment pool. The average duration of such investment pool as of June 30, 2018 was
18.60 days. Because the loans are terminable on demand, their duration did not generally match the
duration of the investments made with cash collateral. On June 30, 2018, the Combined Plan had no
credit risk exposure to borrowers. The collateral held (at cost) and the fair market value of the underlying
securities on loans for the Combined Plan as of June 30, 2018 were $83,233,430 and $31,477,265,
respectively.

The following represents the balances relating to the securities lending transactions as of June 30, 2016;

Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements

In accordance with GASB Statement No. T2, Fair Vaiue Measurement and Appiication, the notes to the
financial statements now include enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement, the level of fair
value hierarchy, and valuation techniques.

The Combined Plan categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by
generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure
the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets; Level 2
inputs are significant other observable inputs; Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs.
Investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a
practical expedient are not classi?ed in the fair value hierarchy below.

In instances whereby inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels in the fair value hierarchy,
fair value measurements in their entirety are categorized based on the lowest level input that is signi?cant
to the valuation. The Combined Plan's assessment of the signi?cance of particular inputs to these fair
value measurements requires judgment and considers factors speci?c to each asset.

taking into account the characteristics of the asset.

The valuation method for investments measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent} is
presented in the following table.

The Combined Plan holds shares or interests in investment companies whereby the fair value of the
investments is measured on a recurring basis using net asset value per share {or its equivalent) of the
investment companies as a practical expedient.

As of June 30, 2018, the fair value. unfunded commitments, and redemption rules of those investments

The international equity funds class includes investments in funds that invest predominantly in equity
securities of non-US. companies. The funds invest in developed and emerging market countries and
utilize investments across the capitalization spectrum from large to small companies. The fair values of
the investments in this class have been estimated using net asset value per share of the investments.

The ?xed-income funds class includes investments in funds that invest predominantly in fixed-income
instruments in the U.S. and developed and emerging market countries. The funds invest across a diverse
group of security types, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed debt and across the credit
quality spectrum of investment grade and high yield. The fair values of the investments in this class have
been estimated using net asset value per share of the investments.

The global asset allocation funds class includes investments in funds that are designed to capture growth
with less risk than equities by managing a broad opportunity set of asset classes, including, but not limited
to, global equities, global bonds, commodities, currencies, and cash. The fair values of the investments in
this class have been estimated using net asset value per share of the investments.

Note 4 - Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

The hedge funds class includes investments in funds that achieve capital appreciation through
multimanager andior multistrategy investments. Within this group of funds, there is exposure to
investment strategies, including, but not limited to, credit, event-driven, equity, and relative value. The
funds have the ability to invest across all markets and across all asset classes to implement their various
strategies. The fair values of the investments in this class have been estimated using net asset value per
share of the investments. Approximately 1 percent of the value of the investments in the hedge fund class
above are in the process of being liquidated by the fund manager. Distributions from each fund will be
received as the underlying investments of the fund are liquidated. It is estimated that the underlying
investments of the fund will be liquidated over the next 12 to 18 months.

The real estate funds class includes investments in funds whose objective is to operate a core portfolio of
real estate investments predominantly located in the US. The funds acquire ownership in underlying
investments either through direct real estate ownership or ownership in real estate companies or the
equity of real estate investment trusts. The funds predominantly target purchases in of?ce, industrial,
retail, or multifamily real estate classes. The fair values of the investments in this class have been
estimated using net asset value per share of the investments (or its equivalent).

The private equity funds class is an alternative investment class and consists of investments in companies
that are not listed on a public exchange. The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit maintains a
diversi?ed portfolio of private equity investments by both style (buyout, turnaround, venture capital, etc.)
and vintage year exposure. With its private equity allocation, the General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit, seeks to take advantage of the illiquidity premium associated with these private equity
investments. The fair values of the investments in this class have been estimated using net asset value
per share of the investments {or its equivalents).

Note 6 - Pension Plan Reserves
Component ll (Legacy Plan)

In accordance with Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit and state law,
the following reserves are required to be set aside within the Component ll (Legacy) pension plan:

The annuitv reserve fund is an accumulation of transfers that is made from the annuity savings fund when
an employee retires. becomes disabled, or if a surviving spouse elects an annuity rather than a lump-sum
payout of accumulated employee contributions-

The pension reserve fund represents funded pension benefits available for retired members and is funded
by actuarially determined transfers from the pension accumulation fund. The transfers from the pension
accumulation fund to the pension reserve fund for fiscal year 2018 retirements have not yet been
determined.

The employee reserve (Annuity Savings Fund or is credited as employee contributions are
received throughout the year; ASF maintains a record of the amount contributed by each employee and
credits interest annually at a rate approved by the board. During ?scal year 2018, the board approved the
interest rate at 1.4 percent. Eligible active members may elect to withdraw their accumulated (annuity)
contributions plus investment earnings. Upon retirement, a member can elect to annuitize or receive a
lump sum of their accumulated contribution and interest earnings. When an employee retires, becomes
disabled, or if a surviving spouse elects an annuity rather than a lump?sum payout of accumulated
employee contributions, the balance is transferred to the annuity reserve fund. See Note 10 for disclosure
of significant changes to the ASF going forward.

The pension accumulation fund is the fund that will accumulate reserves for the pensions and other
bene?ts payable from the contributions made by the City, including various departments thereof. and
certain third parties pursuant to the FDA and from which pensions and other bene?ts will be paid on
account of members with prior service credit and transfers, as provided in Section E-1B. Contributions to
the pension accumulation fund from the effective date of the FDA through fiscal year 2023 shall be made
only in the amounts and from the sources identi?ed in the POA.

The expense fund is the fund that will be credited with all money provided by the City to pay the
administrative expenses of the Combined Plan and from which all the expenses necessary in connection
with the administration and operation of the Combined Plan will be paid. At year end, this reserve balance
is zero, as all employer contributions were credited to the pension accumulation fund.

The income fund shall be the fund to which all interest, dividends, and other income derived from the
investments of Component II of the Combined Plan will be credited. Transfers from the income fund will
be made to credit earnings and losses to various reserves of the Combined Plan in accordance with the
provisions of Component ll of the Combined Plan document. Amounts credited to the income fund in
excess of amounts needed to credit earnings and losses of the Combined Plan, as provided in
Component II, for any plan year shall be transferred to the pension accumulation fund and used to pay
retirement allowances and other bene?ts on account of members. During ?scal year 2018, the income
fund reserve was not utilized, and all investment income was credited to the pension accumulation fund.

Component! {Hybrid Plan)

In accordance with the Combined Plan for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit and state
law, the following reserves are required to be set aside within the Component {Hybrid} pension plan:

The accumulated mandatogy employee contribution fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated
the contributions of members to provide their retirement allowances. Upon the retirement. termination, or
death of a member with a vested retirement allowance, the member?s accumulated mandatory employee
contributions shall be deemed to be part of the pension reserve that shall be used to pay the member's
retirement allowance.

The accumulated voluntary employee contribution fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated
the voluntary after-tax contributions of members together with earnings thereon.

The pension accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated reserves for the
retirement allowances and other benefits payable from that portion of the employer's annual contribution
that is not credited to the rate stabilization fund and amounts transferred to Component and from which
shall be paid retirement allowances and other benefits on account of members. During ?scal year 2018. all
employer contributions were directed by the City into the pension accumulation fund, and no amounts
were credited to the rate stabilization fund.

The rate stabilization fund shall be the fund that shall be credited with the employer's annual contributions
in excess of the amount of the employer's contribution that is credited to the pension accumulation fund
and amounts transferred to Component I, as provided in Section of Component ll. See Note 9 for
details on the transfer provisions related to transfers between Component II and Component I. During
?scal year 2018, no amounts were credited to the rate stabilization fund. Therefore, this reserve balance is
zero.

The medical bene?t fund shall be the fund that will be credited with contributions made for the purpose of
funding medical bene?ts. During the year. no such contributions were made and, therefore, this reserve
balance is zero.

The expense fund shall be the fund to which will be credited any money provided by the employers to pay
the administrative expenses of the Combined Plan and from which certain expenses incurred in
connection with the administration and operation of the Combined Plan will be paid. At year end, this
reserve balance is zero. as all employer contributions were credited to the pension accumulation fund.

Plan ?duciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability 69.93 ?in
Actuarial Assumptions

The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 201?, which used
update procedures to roll forward the estimated liability to June 30. 2013. The valuation used the following
actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement:

Based on an experience study from 2008-2013 issued in February 2015. the mortality table assumption
was based on the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitanl Table for males and females. The tables are projected
to be fully generational. based on the two-dimensional sex-distinct mortality scale 

The actuarial assumptions other than mortality and the investment rate of return used in the June 3D,

June 30, 2018
Note 7 - Net Pension Liability for Component ll (Legacy Plan) (Continued)

Attribution period: As addressed more fully in Note 10. as of June 30. 2014. the plan was frozen such that
no new bene?t accruals were allowed and no new members could join. Starting July 1, 2014. the
participants in this legacy plan (Component II) will now be earning bene?ts under a newly created de?ned
benefit plan (Component I). GASB Statement No. requires that the service costs of all pensions be
attributed through all assumed exit ages through retirement. Neither GASB Statement No. 67' nor any
other GASB standard has set forth guidance speci?cally related to frozen plans with successor plans in
place. Absent any guidance to the contrary, due to the status as a frozen plan combined with the fact that
individuals are now earning service in a new de?ned bene?t pension plan, the retirement date for the
purpose of attribution was assumed to be June 30. 2014 for all members. Therefore, the total pension
liability at June 30. 2018 is equal to the present value of projected bene?t payments.

Note that the long?term assumed rates of return used for the purpose of the GASB Statement No. 6?
valuations were determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This should not
be confused with the provisions in the Plan of Adjustment which established a 6.75 percent assumed rate
of return for the purpose of the various provisions within the plan; the Plan of Adjustment did not attempt
to dictate the long-term rate of return to be used for accounting purposes.

Discount Rate

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30r 2018 was 7.38 percent:
however. the single discount rate used at the beginning of the year was 6.91 percent. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee contributions will be made at the
current contribution rate and that city contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between
actuarially determined contribution rates and the employee rate.

Projected Cash Flows

Based on the above assumptions, the pension plan?s ?duciary net position was projected to be available to
make all projected future bene?t payments of current active and inactive employees both at the beginning
of the year, as well as at the end of the year. Therefore, the long?term expected rate of return on pension
plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension
liability. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee
contributions will be made at the current contribution rate. Contributions to the Combined Plan are
projected to be at the minimum amounts required by the Plan of Adjustment through 2023. followed by
actuarially determined contributions beginning in 2024. While no funding policy has been adopted by the
City of Detroit, Michigan, the projection of cash ?ows assumes full funding of contributions such that the
plan's net position will be suf?cient to make all bene?t payments. The Combined Plan believes that the
funding practice adopted by the City will be consistent with the underlying objective used in the projection
to develop the single discount rate.

Note 7 - Net Pension Liability for Component ll (Legacy Plan) (Continued)

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block
method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of
pension plan investment expense and in?ation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges
are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates
of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected in?ation. Best estimates of
geometric real rates of return as of June 30, 2313 for each major asset class included in the pension
plan's target asset allocation, as disclosed in the investment footnote, are summarized in the following

Actuarial Assumptions

The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017, which used
update procedures to roll fonivard the estimated liability to June 30, 2018. The following are the signi?cant
assumptions:

Wage in?ation assumption was 2 percent for ?ve years, 2.5 percent for the next ?ve years, and 3 percent
thereafter.

The investment rate of return (net of pension plan investment expense, including in?ation) applied to the
beginning of year total pension liability was 8.91 percent as compared to 7.38 percent, which was the
assumed long-term rate of return as of the end of year. The rates were determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. This should not be confused with the provisions in the Plan of
Adjustment. which established a 6.75 percent assumed rate of return for the purpose of the various
provisions within the plan; the Plan of Adjustment did not attempt to dictate the long-term rate of return to
be used for accounting purposes.

Based on an experience study from 2008?2013 issued in February 2015, the mortality table assumption
was based on the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table for males and females. The tables are projected
to be fully generational, based on the two-dimensional sex-distinct mortality scale NIP-2014.

Cost of living adjustments: This plan has a postretirement COLA feature known as the Variable Pension
Improvement Factor of a 2 percent simple COLA. it can be granted beginning on July 1, 2018 only
if the ?ve-year projection shows the plan funded status at 100 percent based upon 8.75 percent future
investment return. For the purpose of the total pension liability, the actuary assumed a 0.50 percent simple
COLA beginning on July 1, 2018 to model the potential average COLA over time. Had no COLA been
assumed, the net pension asset would have been Had the full 2 percent COLA been
assumed, the net pension liability would have been $10,447,252.

There were no changes in benefit provisions during the year affecting the total pension liability.

Other than mortality and the investment rate of return, the actuarial assumptions used in the June 30,
2017 valuation to calculate the total pension liability as of June 30, 2018 were based on the results of an
actuarial experience study for the period from 2002?2007 modi?ed as necessary to account for the
difference in eligibility of this new plan.

Discount Rate

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 2018 was 7.38 percent;
however, the single discount rate used at the beginning of the year was 8.91 percent. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee contributions will be made at the
current contribution rate and that city contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between
actuarially determined contribution rates and the employee rate.

Projected Cash Flows

Based on those assumptions, the pension plan?s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to
make all projected future bene?t payments of current active and inactive employees both at the beginning
of the year as well as at the end of the year. Therefore, the long?term expected rate of return on pension
plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension
liability. The projection of cash ?ows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee
contributions will be made at the current contribution rate. Contributions to the Combined Plan are
projected to be at the minimum amounts required by the Plan of Adjustment through 2023. followed by
actuarially determined contributions beginning in 2024. While no funding policy has been adopted by the
City of Detroit, Michigan, the projection of cash flows assumes full funding of contributions such that the
plan's net position will be suf?cient to make all benefit payments. The Combined Plan believes that the
funding practice adopted by the City will be consistent with the underlying objective used in the projection
to develop the single discount rate.

The long-term expected rate of return on future pension plan investments is the same as Component ll

Note 9 - Commitments

When the Combined Plan enters into various investments, it may not completely fund the entire
investment at the beginning. Rather, it enters into commitments to fund remaining capital amounts at
certain points in time. At June 30, 2018, the remaining capital funding commitment for the Combined Plan
is approximately $83 million.

In addition, the Combined Plan document setting forth the Legacy Plan (Component II) contains a
provision for the transfer of certain excess investment returns to the new Hybrid Plan {Component In
any plan year during the period beginning on or after July 1, 2014 and ending on June 30, 2023, if the
annual rate of return credited to member annuity savings fund accounts is less than the actual rate of
return net of expenses of the Plan?s invested assets for the second plan year preceding the plan year in
which the annual rate of return is credited, the excess earned shall be transferred to the pension
accumulation fund maintained undEr Component of the Combined Plan and will be used to fund
transition costs related to Component I. The transition cost is a measure of the liability that Component I of
the Combined Plan has at its inception due to the fact that members in Component I receive vesting and
eligibility credit under Component I for service that was earned prior to July 1, 2014 and is otherwise
credited to members under Component II. Such transition costs have been calculated by the plan's
actuary. Yearly transfers to fund these costs are required in the second year following the year in which
the return is earned based on a two-year "Iooitback;" therefore, for example, any transfers based on the
plan year ended June 30, 2015 will be calculated and transferred during the plan year ended June 30,
2013. There were no transfers in ?scal year 2018.

Note 10 - City of Detroit?s Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment and
Continuing Impact on the Plan

In March 2013. after enduring years of ?nancial dif?culty. the City of Detroit, Michigan ?led for bankruptcy
protection. The Eighth Amended Plan for Adjustment of Debts of the City of Detroit (the ?Plan of
Adjustment") was filed with the Bankruptcy Court on October 22. 2014. In November 2014. after a
con?rmation hearing lasting several weeks. the Bankruptcy Court con?rmed the Plan of Adjustment
(FDA). which became effective December 10. 2014.

Legacy Plan {Component if}

The Pension Settlement. as part of the Plan of Adjustment. compromised pension claims and provided
funding support for legacy pension bene?t obligations under the General Retirement System of the City of
Detroit (DGRS or the ?System"} Component II from the State of Michigan. the Detroit Institute of Arts. and
certain foundation donors. The Plan of Adjustment also required certain governance changes for 
Those governance changes included establishment of the Investment Committee effective December 10.
2014, which of?cially marked the beginning of implementation of the Plan of Adjustment. although DGRS
had for months already undertaken contingency planning for all of the pension adjustments. In addition to
governance changes. the PCA requires of the System. through its board of trustees and Investment
Committee, certain periodic and interim reporting obligations to the City. the Foundation for Detroit?s
Future. and the State of Michigan. Although there were some delays in meeting certain obligations
because of new actuarial reporting requirements for governmental systems, which in turn impacted the
preparation of the System's audited ?nancial statements. the System believes it has ultimately met its
special reporting obligations in ?scal year 2016 and continued to do so in ?scal years 2017 and 2013.

For DGRS. with respect to Component II bene?t adjustments. the Pension Settlement (for which benefit
levels were and are contingent on other factors, including receipt of outside contributions} provided for:

- A loss of cost of living adjustments. or "escalators" paid after July 1. 2014
. A 4.5 percent cut to the remaining accrued pension bene?t after the COLA loss

. For DGRS members who participated in the Annuity Savings Fund plan between 2003 and 2013.
subject to certain caps1 recoupment of certain amounts of interest deemed by the City to be in "excess"
of that which should have been credited to individual ASF accounts. referred to as Recoupment."
ASF Recoupment. like other provisions of the pension settlement. was not optional. Most members will
pay their ASF Reccupment by a deduction from their future pension benefits for a set term of
months. including interest calculated at 6.75 percent. All members were offered a lump-sum cash
option. which was limited in the aggregate to $30 million in member recoupment. In ?scal year 2016.
the Bankruptcy Court approved certain additional members whose application submissions were not
timely received to participate in the lump-sum cash option.

. The possibility of restoration of certain pension bene?t cuts, based on a program for the most
financially vulnerable pensioners and bene?ciaries through the State of Michigan Treasury Department.
as well as a new feature of Component ll allowing restoration depending on the System's funding level
overtime.

Note 10 - City of Detroit's Chapter 9 Bankruptcy Plan of Adjustment and
Continuing Impact on the Plan (Continued)

- An Income Stabilization Program (the Program") was established as part of the State Contribution
Agreement, another facet ofthe Pension Settlement. The ISF Program, supported by city funds arising
from an unlimited tax general obligation bonds settlement, is intended to ensure that the most
financially vulnerable retirees and beneficiaries do not fall below the poverty line as a result of
bankruptcy-related pension changes. Beginning on March 1, 2015, certain DGRS members also
received benefit pension cut restoration under the ISF Program administered by DGRS pursuant to the
State Contribution Agreement based on eligibility and benefit payments calculated by the State of
Michigan. Following the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and pursuant to Component ll of
the Combined Plan and the State Contribution Agreement, the System implemented the ?rst annual
ISF Program bene?t adjustments effective July 1, 2013.

- The FDA also discusses a "restoration plan." Terms of the pension restoration are contained in
"Exhibit  l.B.3.r.ii.C" of the PCA and the terms govern how accrued pensions. including COLA bene?ts
that were reduced as a part of the FDA, may be restored over the 30-year period following the
Con?rmation Order. The Investment Committee will supervise the restoration process in accordance
with the restoration plan. The restoration plan shall be deemed a part of Component II. The funding
levels have not been attained yet as of June 30, 2013 for the restoration process to initiate.

Going forward, the obligations for contributions to support Component ll of the System through 2023 are
determined as ?xed amounts by the provisions in the Plan of Adjustment. Pursuant to the Plan of
Adjustment, the System is expected to receive contributions of a total of $i?13.6 million through fiscal year
2023. The Plan of Adjustment calls for the System to receive $93.3 million from the State of Michigan:
$423.5 million from $31.7 million from UTGO settlement proceeds; the actual or present value
equivalent of $50 million from the CIA and its foundation donors; and $114.3 million from the other City-
related employer contribution sources, such as the General Fund. Detroit Library Commission, and C030
Authority, over a 10-year period covering ?scal year 2014 through fiscal year 2023. Between 2025 and
2034, DGRS will receive $13.3 million per year from certain foundation donors. After 2023, the City, and
various other employer constituents such as the Library, DWSD, and C030 Authority, will retain
responsibility for the full funding obligations of Component i of the System, consistent with Michigan law.

in ?scal year 201?, DGRS received from the City, its employer-related contribution sources, and the CIA
and its foundation donors all contributions required by the Plan of Adjustment. The City was to remit
payments on the UTGO Stub Bonds to the Combined Plan through 2023. In ?scal year 2017, the City of
Detroit, Michigan refunded all of its outstanding UTGO Stub Bonds. Upon refunding, the payments to the
Combined Plan were accelerated. with a majority of the outstanding balance paid to the Combined Plan in
?scal year 201?; as a result, the Combined Plan received approximately $9.4 million in the ISF and $13.3
million in the Component ll Defined Bene?t Fund related to this transaction.

DGRS continues to implement the FDA, which includes ongoing compliance and additional reporting
requirements by the board and the investment Committee, annual review of bene?t levels, and essentially
provides for a 40-year plan to close the DGRS Legacy Component ll underfunded liability. ASF
Recoupment, in particular, is a notable facet of the Plan of Adjustment that will continue to be
implemented as members apply for Component pension benefits over time.

Allocation Between Divisions

The Combined Plan's allocation methodology to allocate ?scal year 2018 activity between the four main
divisions {General Division, DOT, DWSD, and Library) is dependent upon each revenue or expense type.
Below is a description of the allocation methodology used by the Combined Pian. Where applicable. the
allocation methodology outlined in the pension reporting agreement was utilized.

Investment Income - Investment income {including income from securities lending activity) and investment
expenses were allocated to the divisions, with the exception of the allocation between DWSD-R and GLWA,
based on the net position of each division compared to total net position {excluding the Annuity Savings Fund)
as of ?scal year ended June 30, 201?. The investment income and expenses allocated were after adjusting for
interest credited to the Annuity Savings Fund.

Administrative Expenses - In accordance with Section 2.3 of the pension reporting agreement, DWSD-R and
GLWA's collective allocable share of administrative expenses of approximately $1.6 million has been allocated
to the general division. Correspondingly, the expenses transferred to the general division are offset by a $2.5
million contribution made by DWSD-R and GLWA, collectively. for administrative expenses. which was credited
to the general division. This will occur until 2023, at which point the City and GLWA will mutually determine
and resolve whether any aggregate over- or underpayment will impact the obligation of DWSD-R and GLWA
to make payments to GRS under the pension reporting agreement.

Contributions - In ?scal year 2013. the Plan received contributions from the divisions and the Foundation for
Detroit's Future. The employer contributions were allocated between the divisions according to which division
the contribution was received from. with the exception of and GLWA's collective payments of
$45,400.00, which were allocated as outlined in the POA andi'or the pension reporting
agreement (see below). Of the total payment of re?ects and 
agreed-upon share of administrative expenses which, per the pension reporting agreement, is to be
transferred to the credit of the general division. The payment from the Foundation was allocated based on a
common understanding from the bankruptcy proceedings, which was ultimately determined by the City of
Detroit and agreed to by the other divisions. The Foundation proceeds were allocated solely to the general
division and DOT in proportion to their respective net pension liability as determined by the City?s actuary as of
June 30, 2017.

ASF Recoupment - Revenue from the ASF recoupment was allocated between the divisions, other than
between DWSD-R and GLWA, according to the division under which the individuals ASF earnings were
originally accumulated and paid out.

Member Refunds, Withdrawals, Retirees' Pension, and Annuity Benefits - These deductions were
allocated other than the allocation between DWSD-R and GLWA. based on the original division from which
bene?ts were being provided and withdrawals were being made.

Allocation between DWSD-R and GLWA - Once the above activity was allocated to the divisions, the DWSD
division was further subdivided between DWSD-R and GLWA in accordance with the pension reporting
agreement. which stipulated such allocation would be dictated to the Plan by DWSD-R and GLWA. Per those
instructions, the Plan allocated the DWSD activity between GLWA (70.3 percent) and DWSD-R (29.7 percent).

General Retirement System
of the City of Detroit

We have audited the financial statements of the Combined Plan for the General Retirement
System of the City of Detroit (the "Combined Plan?) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018
and have issued our report thereon dated November 26, 2018. Professional standards require
that we provide you with the following information related to our audit, which is divided into the
following sections:

Section - Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit
Section II - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
Section - Other Recommendations and Related Information

Section I includes any de?ciencies we observed in the Combined Plan's accounting principles or
internal control that we believe are significant. Current auditing standards require us to formally
communicate annually matters we note about the Combined Plan?s accounting policies and
internal control. The Combined Plan has been diligent in trying to remedy many of the previously
identified internal control de?ciencies. Because of its efforts, the number of control issues
identified in Section to this letter has continued to decline.

Section II includes information that current auditing standards require independent auditors to
communicate to those individuals charged with governance. We will report this information
annually to the board of trustees and investment committee of the Combined Plan.

Section presents recommendations related to internal control, procedures. and other matters
noted during our current year audit. These comments are offered in the interest of heiping the
Combined Pian in its efforts toward continuous improvement, not just in the areas of internal
control and accounting procedures, but also in operational or administrative efficiency and
effectiveness.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank the System?s staff for the cooperation and courtesy
extended to us during our audit. Their assistance and professionalism are invaluabie.

This report is intended solely for the use of the board of trustees, the investment committee, and
management of the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit and is not intended to be
and should not be used by anyone other than these speci?ed parties.

Section I - Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit

In planning and performing our audit of the ?nancial statements of the Combined Plan as of and
for the year ended June 30, 2018, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, we considered the Combined Plan's internal control over ?nancial
reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the ?nancial statements, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Combined Plan's internai control.
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Combined Plan's internal
control.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the preceding
paragraph and was not designed to identify all de?ciencies in internal control that might be
signi?cant de?ciencies or material weaknesses and, therefore, material weaknesses or signi?cant
de?ciencies may exist that were not identi?ed. However, as discussed below, we identi?ed certain
de?ciencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.

A de?ciency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to
prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.

A material weakness is a de?ciency, or a combination of de?ciencies, in internal control such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.

We consider the following deficiencies in the Combined Plan's internal control to be material
weaknesses:

Preparation and Review of Bankilnvestrnent Reconciliations (Repeat Finding)

- The Combined Plan has approximately $1.3 billion at Bank of New York in various
investments, as well as multiple bank accounts at First Independence Bank (FIB) and
Huntington Bank (Huntington). At the end of every month, the Combined Plan should be
reconciling the amounts at the bank with the amounts recorded in the Combined Plan's
general ledger on a timely basis. In addition, the Combined Plan should record activity for the
active accounts in the general ledger based on statements from Bank of New York, which
reflect fair value of the assets. This will ensure accurate representation of the Combined Plan?s
financial position throughout the year. While the reconciliations for the FIB and Huntington
accounts were performed and reviewed timely each month, the reconciliations for the Bank of
New York active investments were only performed beginning with the quarter ended March
31, 2018. Preparation of these reconciliations is imperative to ensure that the transactions
recorded by the Combined Plan match the transactions recorded at the bank. Furthermore,
timely preparation and review of these reconciliations serves as a key control to ensure that
the ?nancial reports generated by the Combined Plan are accurate.

Interest and dividends, realized gains (losses), and unrealized gains (losses) are the three
components of investment income. For investments where Bank of New York is the custodian
of the Combined Plan?s investments, the Combined Plan records the activity using the
individual investment statements as the source document. Due to the timing and availability
of information provided to Bank of New York, the Combined Plan is currently not able to tie to
the custodial bank's reports. The remaining controls are insuf?cient to validate amounts
recorded as investment income. Therefore, the Combined Plan?s current controls would not
detect an error in posting investment income in the general ledger. It is imperative that the
Combined Plan put in place a mechanism to ensure the amounts in the various investment
income accounts are appropriate.

(Continued)

Controls Over the Combined Plan?s Census Data and Actuarial Valuation Process
[Repeat Finding)

The Combined Plan has to accumulate and transmit voluminous member data to the actuary. The
actuary then uses this information to prepare the actuarial valuation, which impacts the calculation
of the annual required contribution (ARC) and the actuarial accrued liability (AAL) for funding
purposes and, under GASB Statement No. impacts the total pension liability disclosed in your
financial statements. It is key that the information that is provided to the actuary is complete and
accurate in order to ensure that the funding levels, AAL, and disclosures under GASB Statement
No. including the total pension liability, are also accurate.

. Controls over actuarial reportinq: The Combined Plan provides information on an annual basis
to the actuary in order for the actuary to compute the total pension liability under GASB
Statement No. as well as the ARC and AAL for funding purposes. The information provided
by the Combined Plan includes data for all participants in the Combined Plan. such as pay
information, date of birth, date of hire, etc. and enables the actuary to project the present value
of future bene?t payments. Prior to providing the information to the actuary, the Combined
Plan does perform certain tests on the data. While the Combined Plan has taken steps to
provide more accurate and complete data, during our testing, we noted several instances of
errors in the data or missing data that resulted in incomplete information. The following table
lists the issues found during the audit and related recommendations to resolve.

to obtain such data.

Also. we noted some key employee data was
missing for members and demographic
information for some members was incorrect.

being misstated due to incomplete or
inaccurate information.

 

 

 

 

In addition, based on discussions with the actuary and review of the actuarial valuations, it was
noted that significant work is performed on the original census data provided by the Combined
Plan that ultimately is used in the valuations. The actuary indicated it needed to make several
manual adjustments and assumptions to create data used for the valuation (after conferring with
the Combined Plan's staff on any changes to the data). This included removing ineligible
individuals and reclassifying individuals between the different statuses (active, deferred, retired).
The Combined Plan shouid implement more comprehensive procedures to provide the actuary
complete and accurate data from the onset.

Controls Over the Combined Plan's Information Technology Processes (Repeat Finding)

The Combined Plan has complex modi?able information technology that integrates with the City
of Detroit, Michigan?s (the "City?) various payroll databases. The Combined Plan?s IT department
is independent of the City and the Combined Plan?s other departments. The security provided by
the IT system is important to the validity and the accuracy of the data maintained, including the
census information provided to the actuary. Although the Combined Plan is currently in the
process of modifying the information technology system, we offer the following that the Combined
Plan should keep in mind as it continues to fully implement the new ERP system:

it Use of automated logs: The Combined Plan uses customized software for a majority of the
Combined Plan?s needs, which includes the maintaining of the census data and benefits
calculation application, which are managed internally by the Combined Plan?s lT personnel
and can be modified by the IT department. For all changes to that software, there should be
an automated log maintained listing those changes, and no single individual should be able
to effect a change without proper authorization. Currently, the Combined Plan does have a
process to review, authorize, and track changes, but it is not automated and is, therefore,
subject to human error and possible circumvention.

Page 114

 

Section - Internal Control Related Matters Identified in an Audit
(Continued)

. Master ?le changes: Additionally, it is recommended that the Combined Plan implement
processes to ensure that master ?le changes are documented, authorized. and reviewed. The
lack of this documentation could result in unauthorized and undocumented changes that go
undetected by the Combined Plan.

. Segregation of duties: Segregation of duty controls provide a separation of users with access
to program source code and users with the ability to make or implement changes into the
production environment. The ability to make or implement program source code changes
should be limited to individuals who cannot access and edit source code. The lack of this
control could result in inaccurate or unauthorized changes.

Section ll - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance

Our Responsibiliy Under U.S. Generally Accepted Auditjng Standards

As stated in our engagement letter dated July 27, 2018, our responsibility, as described by
professional standards, is to express an opinion about whether the ?nancial statements prepared
by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity
with US. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit of the ?nancial statements does not
relieve you or management of your responsibilities. Our responsibility is to plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the ?nancial statements are free of
material misstatement.

As part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the Combined Pian. Such considerations
were solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance
concerning such internal control.

We are responsible for communicating signi?cant matters related to the audit that are, in our
professional judgment. relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the ?nancial reporting
process. However, we are not required to design procedures speci?cally to identify such matters.

Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit

We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timing previously communicated to
you in our letter about planning matters dated July 2018.

?gni?canj Audit Findings
Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices

Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. In
accordance with the terms of our engagement letter, we will advise management about the
appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. The signi?cant accounting policies
used by the Combined Plan are described in Note 1 to the ?nancial statements. No new
accounting policies were adopted, and the application of existing policies was not changed during
yeah

We noted no transactions entered into by the Combined Plan during the year for which there is a
lack of authoritative guidance or consensus.

There are no signi?cant transactions that have been recognized in the ?nancial statements in a
different period than when the transaction occurred.

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the ?nancial statements prepared by management
and are based on management?s knowledge and experience about past and current events and
assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because
of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events
affecting them may differ signi?cantly from those expected.

The ?nancial statements include investments valued at approximately $81,000,000 (4 percent of
net position) at June 30. 2018, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the
absence of readily determinable market values.

Page 116

Section II - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
(Continued)

The valuation of alternative investments constitutes a very sensitive and significant estimate
affecting the ?nancial statements. Management uses various means to value the investments,
including utilizing a third-party valuation firm, con?rmations from the investment managers.
periodic appraisals, guidance from real estate advisers, etc. These estimates are very subjective
and highly sensitive to change. We believe management's estimates are in accordance with
GAAP.

The financial statement disclosures and required supplemental information schedules contain
information about the Combined Plan?s total pension liability. In order to determine the total
pension liability. the actuary must apply certain assumptions, which are highly sensitive to
estimation. The most sensitive estimates used in the valuation were as follows:

0 Assumed long-term rate of return: For the purpose of GASB Statement No. as of June 30,
2018, the Combined Plan is currently using 7.38 percent for the assumed long?term expected
rate of return based on information provided by the Combined Plan?s investment advisor
combined with calculations performed by the Combined Plan. This assumed rate of return has
increased from the 6.91 percent assumption used by the Combined Plan as of June 30, 201?.
Nationally, this Iong-tenn rate of return assumption has garnered significant public attention,
with many being critical of the average return assumption used by plans across the United
States, which, according to a February 2018 National Association of State Retirement
Administrators (NASRA) study, was T36 percent. Nationally, the trend continues to show a
continued decline in this assumption, and we believe that trend will continue. We encourage
the Combined Plan to continue to be criticai of this signi?cant assumption, watch the trends
nationally, and re-evaluate the return assumption annually with a critical eye. Please note that
this assumption related to the long-term assumed rate of return is for ?nancial reporting
purposes only; the plan of adjustment requires that the projected rate of return for funding
purposes be 6.75 percent.

4- Single discount rate calculation: The calculation of the single discount rate under GASB
Statement No. 67, which is calculated using the long-term assumed rate of return as one of
many assumptions, is highly sensitive to estimates the actuary makes about future
contributions and future bene?t payments. Inherent in those assumptions is some subjectivity
surrounding the projection of future contributions, since the Combined Plan does not have an
explicit written funding policy dictating contributions after 2023. The assumption made in these
calculations is that the actuarialiy assumed contributions will be made at rates suf?cient to
fund the bene?ts by amortizing the unfunded liability over a closed 30-year period.

. Accuracy of census data elements: The actuarial valuation relies heavily on the accuracy of
the census data provided by the Combined Plan. We tested the accuracy of this data and
noted some errors in the data; however, we do not believe the magnitude of these errors
would materially impact the results of the valuation. Additionally, the Combined Plan?s actuary
still has not been provided with the calculations of the frozen accrued bene?ts for active
members, which is key to estimating the total pension liability (TPL) disclosed within these
financial statements for Component II. The actuary estimated these amounts in order to
determine the TPL. Based on our testing, we believe those estimates, combined with an
actuarial adjustment, result in a materially accurate TPL.

Modality assumgtions: The assumptions about mortality were estimated by the actuary based
on the results of an experience study issued in February 2015. Generally, the actuary used
the Blue Collar Annuitant Table for males and females, projected on a fully
generational basis.

Page 117

 

Section II - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
(Continued)

Other assumptions: All other assumptions in the actuarial valuation are based on an
experience study for the period from 2002-2007. We are aware the Combined Plan has
decided to wait and perform the next experience study for the period from July 1, 2015 through
June 30, 2020 in order to avoid any results that could be skewed due to the City?s bankruptcy.

Disclosure of these assumptions and resultant sensitivity of the discount rate can be found in
Notes 7 and 8 to the ?nancial statements.

The disclosures in the ?nancial statements are neutral, consistent, and clear. Certain ?nancial
statement disclosures are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement
and schedule users. The most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements and the
schedules are the disclosures related to GASES Statement No. 67, including the actuarial valuation
results.

Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit

We are required to inform those charged with governance of any serious difficulties encountered
in dealing with management related to the performance of the audits. We encountered no
signi?cant dif?culties in dealing with management in performing and completing our audit.

Disagreements with Management

For the purpose of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as
a ?nancial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction,
that could be signi?cant to the financial statements or the auditor's report. We are pleased to
report that no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit.

Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements

Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified
during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level
of management. We did not detect any misstatements of the financial statements as a result of
audit procedures. However, see the attached schedule that summarizes passed disclosures and
?nancial reporting matters of the ?nancial statements. Management has determined that their
effects are immaterial. both individually and in the aggregate, to the ?nancial statements taken as
a whole.

Significant Findings or issues

We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and
auditing standards, business conditions affecting the Combined Plan, and business plans and
strategies that may affect the risks of material misstatement, with management each year prior to
our retention as the Combined Plan's auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the
normal course of our professional relationship, and our responses were not a condition of our
retention.

Management Representations

We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the
management representation letter dated November 26, 2018.

Page 118

 

Section ll - Required Communications with Those Charged with Governance
(Continued)

Management Consultations with Other independent Accountants

In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and
accounting matters, similar to obtaining a "second opinion" on certain situations. It a consultation
involves application of an accounting principle to the Combined Plan?s ?nancial statements or a
determination of the type of auditor?s opinion that may be expressed on those statements, our
professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine that the

consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with
other accountants.

Section - Other Recommendations and Related Information

During our audit, we noted areas where we believe there are opportunities for the Combined Plan
to further strengthen internal control or to increase operating ef?ciencies. Our observations on
those areas are presented below for your consideration:

- Contributions Received from the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City")

0 Employee contributions: The Combined Plan receives employee contributions directly
from the City. The City deducts the amount from the employee and remits to the Combined
Plan periodically. The Combined Plan's IT department collects data on these contributions
to properly track the contributions by individual. Currently, no reconciliation of employee
contribution money received from the City and data IT received from the City indicating
how much each member contributed is being performed. It is recommended a
reconciliation be performed to ensure the Combined Plan is receiving the proper amount
of funds, which are being credited to an individual?s account.

0 Emplover contributions: We noted the Combined Plan relies on wage information that
comes from the City in order to calculate the amount of employer contributions to the
Hybrid Plan. The Combined Plan currently uses this wage information to derive
pensionable wages and calculates the amount the City owes. The Combined Plan
calculates the pensionable wages by utilizing only those payroll codes that would be
considered for pensionable wages overtime wages should be excluded from
pensionable wages). This amount is billed to the City each quarter. The Combined Plan
should work with the City to verify the codes that are used to calculate pensionable wages
are proper. In addition. the Combined Plan should consider whether independently
testingiverifying these pensionable wages would bene?t the Combined Plan by further
ensuring the base amount on which contributions are calculated is complete and accurate.

0 Information Technology Processes

0 During our testing. we noted no formal process to disable access for terminated
individuals. We recommend the Combined Plan have a formal process for HR to fill out a
termination form and send to IT and perform it timely. In addition, all new hires should be
timely documented.

0 There currently is no formal process to ?ll out a production release form. Usually a member
of the IT department will inform Ray Tchou to review a production change. Ray is the only
individual with the ability to release a production change. We recommend the Combined
Plan have a formal policy for individuals to fill out a production form to document change
requests.

to It was noted there are admin user pro?les that remained in the system for users no longer
employed at the Combined Plan. These pro?les have remained active, as staff need to
access old ?les. In addition, we noted duplicate admin user pro?les for current employees.
We recommend the Combined Plan perform a user pro?le review and only allow one user
pro?le for each current employee.

. Bene?t Payment Calculations

Pension factors are used in calculating an individual?s pension payment based on age and
option selected. Currently, the pension factor used in the calculation of bene?t payments
is using an old mortality table (1984 table) and an 8 percent rate of return. Pension factors
should be updated with a newer mortality table (RP-2014 mortality table is currently being
used in the actuarial valuations) and rate of return of 6.75 percent (current rate of return
used for funding purposes, as stipulated by the Plan of Adjustment).

Board of Trustees
The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit
Dear Board Members:
This report provides information required for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit in
connection with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68 “Employer
Reporting for Pension Plans.” These calculations have been made on a basis that is consistent with our
understanding of this Statement. This information is subject to the System’s Auditor’s review. Please let
us know if the System’s Auditor recommends any changes.
Our calculation of the liability associated with the benefits described in this report was performed for the
purpose of satisfying the requirements of GASB Statement No. 68. The calculation of the plan’s liability
for this report is not applicable for funding purposes of the plan. A calculation of the plan’s liability for
purposes other than satisfying the requirements of GASB Statement No. 68 may produce significantly
different results. In particular, this is not a funding report and nothing in this report should be construed
as a funding recommendation. This report may be provided to parties other than the System only in its
entirety and only with the permission of the Board. GRS is not responsible for unauthorized use of this
report.
This report is based upon information, furnished to us by System staff, concerning retirement and
ancillary benefits, active members, deferred vested members, retirees and beneficiaries, and financial
data. This report is based on the valuation date of June 30, 2016. The total pension liability was rolledforward from the valuation date to the plan year ending June 30, 2017 using generally accepted actuarial
principles. The asset information as of June 30, 2017 was provided by the System. This information was
checked for internal consistency, but it was not audited by Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Company. A
description of the adjustments made to the data is incorporated in this report (either directly or by
reference). GRS is not responsible for the accuracy of the data provided by the Retirement System. This
report is based upon estimates of frozen accrued benefits. Final calculations of frozen accrued benefits
for active members were not provided. Future measurements based on final calculation of benefit
amounts will differ.
At the direction of the System and approval of the System’s Auditor, the long-term expected return on
assets used to determine the discount rate is 6.91%, net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2017,
down from 7.23%, net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2016. We have reviewed this assumption
based on the System’s asset allocation and have determined it to be reasonable for the purpose of the
measurement being taken.

The benefit provisions reflected in this valuation for the development of the end of year Total Pension
Liability (TPL) are those in effect for Component II as of the end of the plan year on June 30, 2017. We
understand that Component I is a separate plan for GASB No. 67 purposes and will, therefore, be
disclosed in a separate report.
To the best of our knowledge, the information contained within this report is accurate and fairly
represents the actuarial position of the System on the measurement date for purposes of GASB
Statement No. 68 reporting. All calculations have been made in conformity with generally accepted
actuarial principles and practices as well as with the Actuarial Standards of Practice issued by the Actuarial
Standards Board.
The signing individuals are independent of the plan sponsor.
This report supplements our GASB Statement No. 67 report dated October 31, 2017. The Total Pension
Liability, Plan Fiduciary Net Position, Net Pension Liability, and corresponding schedules are unchanged
from the prior report. However, the GASB Statement No. 68 specific schedules (such as Pension Expense,
deferred inflows/outflows, proportionate share, etc.) have been added to this report. In addition, we
received revised asset information. While the Plan Fiduciary Net Position is not changed, administrative
expenses and investment income differ from what was reported for the GASB Statement No. 67 report. As
a result, the revenue and expenditure exhibits have been updated.
David T. Kausch and Judith A. Kermans are Members of the American Academy of Actuaries (MAAA) and
meet the Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries to render the actuarial opinions
contained herein.

 Discussion
Changes to the Actuarial Assumptions
For purposes of determining the total pension liability as of June 30, 2017, the following actuarial
assumptions were changed/modified from those used in the June 30, 2016 funding valuation:
•

At the direction of the System and approval of the Systems’ Auditor, the long-term expected
return on assets was 6.91% net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2017 (it was 6.75% net of
investment and administrative expenses, in the June 30, 2016 funding valuation, as required by
the Plan of Adjustment). The Single Discount Rate (SDR) changed to 6.91% from 7.23% when
compared to the June 30, 2016 GASB Statement No. 68 valuation.

All other actuarial assumptions were the same as those used in the June 30, 2016 actuarial valuation (the
funding valuation).

Changes to the Benefit Provisions
There were no changes in benefit provisions during the year.

Data Approximations and Assumptions
A description of the data approximations and assumptions used in making this report are included in the
June 30, 2016 funding valuation report.

Magnitude of Administrative Expenses
Combined Component I (Hybrid) and Component II (Legacy) administrative expenses for the 2017 fiscal
year are approximately 30% higher when compared to the 2016 fiscal year expenses. We understand that
this increase is temporary. In addition, ongoing payroll (Component I payroll) has decreased with the
departure of GLWA. We will be monitoring actual expenses as a percent of ongoing payroll and may
recommend an increase in this assumption in future valuations. For this valuation, we have adjusted the
assumption as a percent to prevent the projected dollars from decreasing due to the lower payroll. This
brings the expenses as a percent of Component I payroll up from 3.0% to 3.55% due to the lower payroll.
In addition, we allocated 71% of the expenses to Component II and 29% to Component I, consistent with
this year’s allocation as shown in the assets.

Changes from GASB Statement No. 67 Report
This report supplements our GASB Statement No. 67 report dated October 31, 2017. The Total Pension
Liability, Plan Fiduciary Net Position, Net Pension Liability, and corresponding schedules are unchanged
from the prior report. However, the GASB Statement No. 68 specific schedules (such as Pension Expense,
deferred inflows/outflows, proportionate share, etc.) have been added to this report. In addition, we
received revised asset information. While the Plan Fiduciary Net Position is not changed, administrative
expenses and investment income differ from what was reported for the GASB Statement No. 67 report. As
a result, the revenue and expenditure exhibits have been updated.

 Accounting Standard
For State and local government employers (as well as certain non-employers) that contribute to a Defined
Benefit (DB) pension plan administered through a trust or equivalent arrangement, Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 68 establishes standards for pension accounting and
financial reporting. Under GASB Statement No. 68, the employer must account for and disclose the net
pension liability, pension expense, and other information associated with providing retirement benefits to
their employees (and former employees) on their basic financial statements.
The following discussion provides a summary of the information that is required to be disclosed under
these accounting standards. A number of these disclosure items are provided in this report. However,
certain information is not included in this report if it is not actuarial in nature, such as the notes to the
financial statements regarding accounting policies and investments. As a result, the Retirement System
and/or plan sponsor is responsible for preparing and disclosing the non-actuarial information needed to
comply with these accounting standards.

Financial Statements
GASB Statement No. 68 requires State and local government employers that contribute to DB pension
plans to recognize the net pension liability and the pension expense on their financial statements, along
with the related deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources. The net pension
liability is the difference between the total pension liability and the plan’s fiduciary net position. In
traditional actuarial terms, this is analogous to the accrued liability less the market value of assets (not
the smoothed actuarial value of assets that is often encountered in actuarial valuations performed to
determine the employer’s contribution requirement).
Paragraph 57 of GASB Statement No. 68 states, “Contributions to the pension plan from the employer
subsequent to the measurement date of the collective net pension liability and before the end of the
employer’s reporting period should be reported as a deferred outflow of resources related to pensions.”
The information contained in this report does not incorporate any contributions made to the General
Retirement System of the City of Detroit subsequent to the measurement date of June 30, 2017.
The pension expense recognized each fiscal year is equal to the change in the net pension liability from
the beginning of the year to the end of the year, adjusted for deferred recognition of the certain changes
in the liability and investment experience.

Development of Employer Proportionate Shares
As instructed, we have developed the proportionate employer shares as follows:
•
•
•

General, DOT, DWSD, and Library have contribution rates assessed on separate relationships and
are therefore accounted for separately under Paragraph 49 of GASB No. 68.
The component units in the General Division were 1) General City; 2) Parking; and 3) Airport.
Proportionate shares in the General Division were determined by prorating based on the Total
Pension Liability.

 Notes to Financial Statements
GASB Statement No. 68 requires the notes of the employer’s financial statements to disclose the total
pension expense, the pension plan’s liabilities and assets, and deferred outflows of resources and inflows
of resources related to pensions.
In addition, GASB Statement No. 68 requires the notes of the financial statements for the employers to
include certain additional information, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

a description of the types of benefits provided by the plan, as well as automatic or ad hoc COLAs;
the number and classes of employees covered by the benefit terms;
for the current year, sources of changes in the net pension liability;
significant assumptions and methods used to calculate the total pension liability;
inputs to the Single Discount Rate;
certain information about mortality assumptions and the dates of experience studies;
the date of the valuation used to determine the total pension liability;
information about changes of assumptions or other inputs and benefit terms;
the basis for determining contributions to the plan, including a description of the plan’s funding
policy, as well as member and employer contribution requirements;
the total pension liability, fiduciary net position, net pension liability, and the pension plan’s
fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability;
the net pension liability using a discount rate that is 1% higher and 1% lower than used to
calculate the total pension liability and net pension liability for financial reporting purposes;
a description of the system that administers the pension plan; and
a description of the terms of the plan’s deferred retirement option program (DROP) and the total
DROP balance for those members currently participating in the DROP. (The General Retirement
System of the City of Detroit does not have a DROP program.)

Required Supplementary Information
The financial statements of employers also include required supplementary information showing the
10-year fiscal history of:
•
•
•

sources of changes in the net pension liability;
information about the components of the net pension liability and related ratios, including the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability, and the net
pension liability as a percent of covered-employee payroll; and
a comparison of actual employer contributions to the actuarially determined contributions based
on the plan’s funding policy.

While the first two tables may be built prospectively as the information becomes available, sufficient
information may currently be available for the third table from prior financial statements.

Page 130

 Timing of the Valuation
An actuarial valuation to determine the total pension liability is required to be performed at least every
two years. For the employer’s financial reporting purposes, the net pension liability and pension expense
should be measured as of the employer’s “measurement date” which may not be earlier than the
employer’s prior fiscal year-end date. If the actuarial valuation used to determine the total pension
liability is not calculated as of the measurement date, the total pension liability is required to be rolled
forward from the actuarial valuation date to the measurement date.
The total pension liability shown in this report is based on an actuarial valuation performed as of June 30,
2016, rolled to the plan year end of June 30, 2017.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single
Discount Rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the
extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) taxexempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general obligation bonds with an average AA
credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the contributions for use with the long-term
expected rate of return are not met).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 6.91%; the
municipal bond rate is 3.56% (based on the weekly rate closest to but not later than the plan year end of
the “20-Bond GO Index” rate from the Bond Buyer Index); and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 6.91%,
as of June 30, 2017.
The expected rate of return was provided by the Retirement System and approved by the System’s
auditor.

Limitation of Assets as a Percent of Total Pension Liability Measurements
This report includes a measure of the plan fiduciary net position as a percent of total pension liability
(67.57% as of June 30, 2017). Unless otherwise indicated, with regard to any such measurements
presented in this report:
(1) This measurement is not intended to be a funded ratio or a measure of funded progress.
(2) This measurement is inappropriate for assessing the sufficiency of Plan assets to cover the
estimated cost of settling the Plan’s benefit obligations.
(3) The measurement is inappropriate for assessing the need for or amount of future employer
contributions.

 Limitations of Project Scope
Actuarial Standards do not require the actuary to evaluate the ability of the plan sponsor or other
contributing entities to make required contributions when due. Such an evaluation was not within the
scope of this project and is not within our area of expertise. Consequently, we have not made such an
evaluation.

Benefits as of June 30, 2016
As of the June 30, 2016 census date:
1) Frozen Accrued Benefit amounts were not available for active members.
Data provided was used to estimate the impact of the above information. As this data becomes available
in the future, the results of our liability calculations may differ.
The reported June 30, 2017 Annuity Savings Fund (ASF) balance included a receivable, computed by the
System’s auditors, that accounts for future ASF recoupments. We understand this amount was originally
determined as of June 30, 2015 and updated to June 30, 2017 in accordance with GAAP accounting.

A Special Funding Situation may occur if a non-city entity has a legal obligation to contribute directly to
the Retirement System. The Net Pension Liability shown here has not been adjusted for any potential
funding situation. Our understanding is that the City makes all the employer contributions into the fund,
even though the City may receive monies from other entities as a result of the POA.

 Notes to Schedule of Contributions
Contribution Requirement: The expected contributions for fiscal year 2015 and beyond are provided in
the POA. Subsequent to the POA, the DIA entered into an agreement to pay part of its contribution
requirement to the Detroit General Plan in a single lump sum payment (in 2016). Furthermore, we
understand that the City has modified all of its outstanding UTGO Stub Bonds. The current contribution
schedule (from Retirement System staff) showing the DIAs and UTGOs future contribution requirements is

 Single Discount Rate
A Single Discount Rate of 6.91%, net of investment expenses, was used to measure the total pension
liability as of June 30, 2017. This Single Discount Rate was based on the expected rate of return on
pension plan investments of 6.91% as directed by the System and approved by the System’s Auditor. The
projection of cash flows used to determine this Single Discount Rate assumed that plan member
contributions ceased as of June 30, 2014, and that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to
those set by the final Plan of Adjustment through June 30, 2023 and contributions consistent with PERSIA
and the intention to fully fund the System by 2053 as determined in the bankruptcy (POA). Based on
these assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of
return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to
determine the total pension liability.
Regarding the sensitivity of the net pension liability to changes in the Single Discount Rate, the following
presents the plan’s net pension liability, calculated using a Single Discount Rate of 6.91%, as well as what
the plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a Single Discount Rate that is one
percent lower or one percent higher.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

Page 152

Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
Component II Frozen Benefits
All Component II benefits are frozen as of June 30, 2014 based on service and average final compensation
accrued as of that date and the provisions of the Detroit General Retirement System as it existed on June 30,
2014. Frozen benefits are further reduced by 4.5% and all future cost-of-living adjustments (“COLA’s”) were
eliminated. Benefits resulting from the Annuity Savings Fund and benefits paid from the Annuity Reserve
Fund were subject to a separate reduction described as a “Claw-back.” Details of the claw-back provision are
complicated and can be found in the Eighth Amended Plan of Adjustment. The benefits evaluated in this
report are the frozen reduced benefits after the claw-back. Component II benefits are payable after
separation from service, upon meeting the eligibility conditions of the plan as it existed on June 30, 2014,
regardless of whether the individual is eligible to receive a Component I benefit at that time.
Our understanding of the June 30, 2014 plan provisions is provided below for completeness. The material
below does not have legal standing and is not intended to cover all potential situations that could occur. If
there are discrepancies between the description below, and appropriate legal documents, the latter
necessarily govern.

Age and Service Pension
Eligibility - Any age (minimum age 55 for non-EMS members hired after 1995) with 30 years of service (25
for EMS members), or age 60 with 10 years of service, or age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount – EMS Members:
Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of
service, plus b) a pension equal to 2.0% of AFC multiplied by years of service. Maximum benefit is 90% of
AFC. Other Members: Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of service, plus b) a
pension equal to the first 10 years of service multiplied by 1.6% of AFC, plus 1.8% of AFC for each year of
service greater than 10 years up to 20 years, plus 2.0% of AFC for each year of service greater than 20
years up to 25 years, plus 2.2% of AFC for each year of service greater than 25 years. Future benefit
accruals for certain active members (depending on bargaining unit) were reduced to 1.5% of final average
compensation per year of service.
Type of Average Final Compensation (AFC) - Highest 3 consecutive years out of the last 10. Pension
benefits will not be diminished if compensation is reduced because of a fiscal emergency. Effective July 1,
1999, in computing the AFC, a member shall have the option of adding the value of 25% of unused
accrued sick leave to the earnings used in computing the AFC. Longevity is added to AFC in accordance
with the following schedule: $150 after 5 years, $300 after 10 years, $450 after 15 years, $600 after 20
years, and $750 after 25 years.

Early Retirement
Eligibility - Any age with 25 or more years of service (min. age 55 for members hired after 1995).
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but actuarially reduced.

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit – Component II

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Continued)
Deferred Retirement (Vested Benefit)
Eligibility - Hired prior to 7-1-80: Age 40 with 8 years of service. Hired on or after 7-1-80: Any age with
10 years of service.
Benefit Commencement - APTE hired prior to July 1, 1988: Benefit begins at the age the member would
have become eligible for regular retirement if service had continued. SAAA, Non-Union and lawyers
hired prior to June 30, 1986: Benefit begins at the age the member would have become eligible for
regular retirement. Others: Benefits based on service rendered by June 30, 1986 begin at the age the
member would have become eligible for regular retirement. Benefits based on service rendered after July
1, 1986 begin at age 62.
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but based on average final compensation and service at the
time of termination.

Duty Disability Retirement
Eligibility - Service related disability before age 60. No service requirement.
Annual Amount - An annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated contributions at date of
disability plus a pension of two-thirds of average final compensation at time of disability. The maximum
annual pension is $9,000. At the earliest of when the member would have accrued 30 years of service
credit (25 for EMS) or age 60, the annuity is recomputed assuming contributions would have continued at
a salary level equal to final compensation. The pension is recomputed with additional service credit
granted from the date of disability to age 60 (or 30 years of service credit) with no maximum.

Non-Duty Disability Retirement
Eligibility - Disability from any cause before age 60 with 10 or more years of service.
Annual Amount - Computed in the same manner as a regular retirement benefit. Maximum annual
pension to age 60 is $6,000. Benefit is recomputed at age 60 with no maximum.

Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death from service related causes. No age or service requirements.
Annual Amount - One-third of final compensation to the surviving spouse for life or until remarriage, plus
an equal share of 1/4 of final compensation to each unmarried child under age 18. If there is no eligible
spouse, eligible children each receive 1/4 of final compensation; if there are more than 2 such children,
each child shares an equal part of 1/2 of final compensation. Maximum total amount for spouse and
children is $9,000 annually. If there is no eligible spouse or children, dependent parents each receive 1/6
of deceased’s final compensation, to a total maximum of $600 annually.

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit – Component II

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Concluded)
Non-Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death-in-service at any age with 15 years of service; or after age 60 with 10 years of service; or
after age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount - To Surviving Spouse: Computed as a regular retirement benefit but reduced in
accordance with a 100% joint and survivor election for members with 20 or more years of service. For
members with 15 years of service but less than 20, benefit is reduced in accordance with a 50% joint and
survivor election. To Dependent Children if no Surviving Spouse: $9,000 payable to age 19 of the
youngest child or for life if child is physically or mentally impaired for members with 20 or more years of
service ($6,000 if less than 20 years of service).

Post-Retirement Cost-of-Living Adjustments
Benefit is increased annually by 2.25% of the original pension amount at retirement. Post-retirement
cost-of-living increases were eliminated on future accruals for certain active members (depending on
bargaining unit).

Member Contributions
Members have the option of choosing one of four contribution amounts: (1) 0%; (2) 3.0% of
compensation up to the Social Security wage base, plus 5.0% of compensation in excess of the Social
Security wage base; (3) 5.0% of total compensation; or (4) 7.0% of total compensation. Member
contributions can be paid as a lump sum or annuitized at retirement to provide an annuity in addition to
the pension (which is not affected by the level of member contributions).

ACTUARIAL COST METHOD AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Page 156

Summary of Assumptions and Methods Used for
GASB Actuarial Valuations
Adopted by Board of Trustees
All assumptions are estimates of future experience except as noted. The rationale for the assumptions
is based on experience studies where noted.

Economic Assumptions
The investment return rate used in making the valuation was 6.91% per year, compounded annually (net
after investment expenses) as of June 30, 2017. This assumption was provided by the Retirement System.
We determined it to be reasonable when using a 2.50% assumed price inflation.

Non-Economic Assumptions
The mortality table used to measure retired life mortality was 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant
Table set-forward 1 year for males and 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table set-forward 1
year for females. Tables were extended below age 50 with a cubic spline to the published Juvenile rates.
Pre-retirement mortality is based on the corresponding Employee tables. The tables are projected to be
fully generational, based on the 2-dimensional, sex distinct mortality improvement scale MP-2014 (which
was published and intended to be used with RP-2014). This table was first used as of June 30, 2014. For
disabled members, the same tables are used. The rationale for the mortality assumption is based on the
2008-2013 Mortality Experience Study issued February 4, 2015.
The probabilities of retirement for members eligible to retire are shown on pages 30 and 31. These
probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale is based on the 2002-2007
Experience Study.
The probabilities of separation from service (including disability) are shown for sample ages on page 32.
These probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale is based on the 2002-2007
Experience Study.

 Miscellaneous and Technical Assumptions
Benefit Service

Exact Fractional service is used to determine the amount of benefit
payable.

Decrement Operation

Disability and mortality decrements do not operate during the first 5
years of service. Disability and withdrawal also do not operate during
retirement eligibility.

Decrement Timing

Decrements of all types are assumed to occur mid-year.

Eligibility Testing

Eligibility for benefits is determined based upon the age nearest
birthday and rounded service on the date the decrement is assumed to
occur.

Forfeitures

None.

Incidence of Contributions

Contributions are assumed to be received at the middle of the year.

Marriage Assumption

100% of males and 100% of females are assumed to be married for
purposes of death-in-service benefits. Male spouses are assumed to be
three years older than female spouses for active member valuation
purposes.

Normal Form of Benefit

Straight life is the normal form of benefit. Straight life is generally the
most valuable under valuation assumptions. Actuarial equivalent factors
are based on 7.5% interest and 1984 Group Annuity Mortality table.

Service Credit Accruals

Service accruals stop as of June 30, 2014 for measurement of
Component II liabilities. However, future service in Component I may be
used to satisfy benefit eligibility requirement in Component II. Members
who became duty disabled prior to June 30, 2014 are assumed to get
projected service from date of disability to conversion date. Members
who become disabled after June 30, 2014 are assumed to get their
frozen accrued benefit as of June 30, 2014 at date of conversion.

Administrative Expenses

3.55% of Component I payroll. 71% was allocated to Component II and
29% to Component I.

Sick Leave

As of June 30, 2014, this information was included in the 2014 Average
Final Compensation (AFC) amounts.

AFC Adjustment

Reported 2014 AFC amounts were increased by 2.0% for active
members due to data discrepancies related to the reported AFC. This
adjustment was made based on discussions with System staff and the
System’s auditor and was checked for reasonableness for the 2016
valuation.

Member Contributions

Member contributions to this Component II plan are assumed to have
ceased with the bankruptcy.

Rationale for assumption is based upon a 2002 to 2007 Experience Study, modified as necessary for
changes in data or administration.

 SECTION 

CALCULATION OF THE SINGLE DISCOUNT RATE

Page 163

Calculation of the Single Discount Rate at End of Year
GASB Statement No. 67 includes a specific requirement for the discount rate that is used for the purpose
of the measurement of the Total Pension Liability. This rate considers the ability of the fund to meet
benefit obligations in the future. To make this determination, employer contributions, employee
contributions, benefit payments, expenses and investment returns are projected into the future. The Plan
Net Position (assets) in future years can then be determined and compared to its obligation to make
benefit payments in those years. As long as assets are projected to be on hand in a future year, the
assumed valuation discount rate is used. In years where assets are not projected to be sufficient to meet
benefit payments, the use of a municipal bond rate is required, as described in the following paragraph.
The Single Discount Rate (SDR) is equivalent to applying these two rates to the benefits that are projected
to be paid during the different time periods. The SDR reflects (1) the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments (during the period in which the fiduciary net position is projected to be
sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the
contributions for use with the long-term expected rate of return are not met).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 6.91%; the
municipal bond rate is 3.56%; and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 6.91% as of June 30, 2017.
The tables in this section provide background for the development of the Single Discount Rate.
The Projection of Contributions table shows the development of expected contributions in future years.
Normal Cost contributions for future hires are not included (nor are their liabilities). For purposes of
determining the discount rate as of June 30, 2016, the employer contributions for the 10-year period
ending June 30, 2023 were set by the 8th Amended Plan of Adjustment (POA), as adjusted by subsequent
agreements. Subsequent employer contributions were determined by a closed 30-year level principle
amortization of any unfunded actuarial accrued liability using 6.91% interest, net of investment expenses,
consistent with the 100% funded target by 2053 in the POA and State Law.
Rates of Return: Note that these projections are specifically used to determine the SDR and should not
be interpreted as a funding recommendation. The 6.91% rate of return was before administrative
expenses. Therefore, the projections assumed that any administrative expenses incurred by the plan will
directly increase employer contributions beginning with FY 2024. The rate is net of investment expenses.
Administrative Expenses: For purposes of the projection using a 6.91% rate of return, administrative
expenses were assumed to be related to payroll. Payroll was increased by an assumed wage inflation as
of June 30, 2014 of 2.00% for 5 years, 2.50% for the next 5 years and 3.00% thereafter. Since benefits are
frozen, the wage inflation assumption does not affect anything other than the administrative expenses.

 The Projection of Plan Fiduciary Net Position table shows the development of expected asset levels in
future years.
The Present Values of Projected Benefit Payments table shows the development of the SDR. It breaks
down the benefit payments into present values for funded and unfunded portions (if any) and shows the
equivalent total at the SDR. For purposes of determining the discount rate as of June 30, 2017, the
benefit payments reflect the plan provisions in force as of June 30, 2017.
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liabilities. Actual employer contributions through June 30, 2023 are set by
the POA. The amortization period and method after 2023 has not yet been established by the Board.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Page 172

Glossary of Terms
Actuarial Accrued Liability
(AAL)

The AAL is the difference between the actuarial present value of all
benefits and the actuarial value of future normal costs. The definition
comes from the fundamental equation of funding which states that
the present value of all benefits is the sum of the Actuarial Accrued
Liability and the present value of future normal costs. The AAL may
also be referred to as "accrued liability" or "actuarial liability."

Actuarial Assumptions

These assumptions are estimates of future experience with respect to
rates of mortality, disability, turnover, retirement, rate or rates of
investment income and compensation increases. Actuarial
assumptions are generally based on past experience, often modified
for projected changes in conditions. Economic assumptions
(compensation increases, payroll growth, inflation and investment
return) consist of an underlying real rate of return plus an assumption
for a long-term average rate of inflation.

Accrued Service

Service credited under the system which was rendered before the date
of the actuarial valuation.

Actuarial Equivalent

A single amount or series of amounts of equal actuarial value to
another single amount or series of amounts, computed on the basis
of appropriate actuarial assumptions.

Actuarial Cost Method

A mathematical budgeting procedure for allocating the dollar amount
of the actuarial present value of the pension trust benefits between
future normal cost and actuarial accrued liability. The actuarial cost
method may also be referred to as the actuarial funding method.

Actuarial Gain (Loss)

The difference in liabilities between actual experience and expected
experience during the period between two actuarial valuations is the
gain (loss) on the accrued liabilities.

Actuarial Present Value
(APV)

The amount of funds currently required to provide a payment or series
of payments in the future. The present value is determined by
discounting future payments at predetermined rates of interest and
probabilities of payment.

Actuarial Valuation

The actuarial valuation report determines, as of the actuarial
valuation date, the service cost, total pension liability, and related
actuarial present value of projected benefit payments for pensions.

Actuarial Valuation Date

The date as of which an actuarial valuation is performed.

Actuarially Determined
Contribution (ADC) or
Annual Required
Contribution (ARC)

A calculated contribution into a defined benefit pension plan for the
reporting period, most often determined based on the funding policy
of the plan. Typically the Actuarially Determined Contribution has a
normal cost payment and an amortization payment.

 Glossary of Terms
Amortization Payment

The amortization payment is the periodic payment required to pay off
an interest-discounted amount with payments of interest and principal.

Amortization Method

The method used to determine the periodic amortization payment
may be a level dollar amount, or a level percent of pay amount. The
period will typically be expressed in years, and the method will either
be “open” (meaning, reset each year) or “closed” (the number of
years remaining will decline each year).

Cost-of-Living Adjustments

Postemployment benefit changes intended to adjust benefit
payments for the effects of inflation.

Cost-Sharing MultipleEmployer Defined Benefit
Pension Plan (cost-sharing
pension plan)

A multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan in which the
pension obligations to the employees of more than one employer are
pooled and pension plan assets can be used to pay the benefits of the
employees of any employer that provides pensions through the
pension plan.

Covered-Employee Payroll

The payroll of covered employees, which is typically only the
pensionable pay and does not include pay above any pay cap.

Deferred Inflows and
Outflows

The deferred inflows and outflows of pension resources are amounts
used under GASB Statement No. 68 in developing the annual pension
expense. Deferred inflows and outflows arise with differences
between expected and actual experiences; changes of assumptions.
The portion of these amounts not included in pension expense should
be included in the deferred inflows or outflows of resources.

Discount Rate

For GASB purposes, the discount rate is the single rate of return that
results in the present value of all projected benefit payments to be
equal to the sum of the funded and unfunded projected benefit
payments, specifically:
1. The benefit payments to be made while the pension plans’
fiduciary net position is projected to be greater than the benefit
payments that are projected to be made in the period; and
2. The present value of the benefit payments not in (1) above,
discounted using the municipal bond rate.

 Glossary of Terms
Entry Age Actuarial Cost
Method (EAN)

The EAN is a funding method for allocating the costs of the plan
between the normal cost and the accrued liability. The actuarial
present value of the projected benefits of each individual included in
an actuarial valuation is allocated on a level basis (either level dollar
or level percent of pay) over the earnings or service of the individual
between entry age and assumed exit ages(s). The portion of the
actuarial present value allocated to a valuation year is the normal
cost. The portion of this actuarial present value not provided for at a
valuation date by the actuarial present value of future normal costs is
the actuarial accrued liability. The sum of the accrued liability plus
the present value of all future normal costs is the present value of all
benefits.

GASB

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board is an organization that
exists in order to promulgate accounting standards for governmental
entities.

Fiduciary Net Position

The fiduciary net position is the value of the assets of the trust.

Long-Term Expected Rate of
Return

The long-term rate of return is the expected return to be earned over
the entire trust portfolio based on the asset allocation of the portfolio.

Money-Weighted Rate of
Return

The money-weighted rate of return is a method of calculating the
returns that adjusts for the changing amounts actually invested. For
purposes of GASB Statement No. 67, money-weighted rate of return is
calculated as the internal rate of return on pension plan investments,
net of pension plan investment expense.

Multiple-Employer Defined
Benefit Pension Plan

A multiple-employer plan is a defined benefit pension plan that is used
to provide pensions to the employees of more than one employer.

Municipal Bond Rate

The Municipal Bond Rate is the discount rate to be used for those
benefit payments that occur after the assets of the trust have been
depleted.

Net Pension Liability (NPL)

The NPL is the liability of employers and non-employer contribution
entities to plan members for benefits provided through a defined
benefit pension plan.

Non-Employer Contribution
Entities

Non-employer contribution entities are entities that make
contributions to a pension plan that is used to provide pensions to the
employees of other entities. For purposes of the GASB Accounting
statement plan members are not considered non-employer
contribution entities.

Normal Cost

The actuarial present value of the pension trust benefits allocated to
the current year by the actuarial cost method. Also known as service
cost.

Board of Trustees
The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit
Dear Board Members:
This report provides information required for the General Retirement System of the City of Detroit in
connection with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 67 “Financial
Reporting for Pension Plans” and Statement No. 68 “Employer Reporting for Pension Plans.” These
calculations have been made on a basis that is consistent with our understanding of this Statement. This
information is subject to the System’s Auditor’s review. Please let us know if the System’s Auditor
recommends any changes.
Our calculation of the liability associated with the benefits described in this report was performed for the
purpose of satisfying the requirements of GASB Statement Nos. 67 and 68. The calculation of the plan’s
liability for this report is not applicable for funding purposes of the plan. A calculation of the plan’s
liability for purposes other than satisfying the requirements of GASB Statement Nos. 67 and 68 may
produce significantly different results. In particular, this is not a funding report and nothing in this report
should be construed as a funding recommendation. This report may be provided to parties other than the
System only in its entirety and only with the permission of the Board. GRS is not responsible for
unauthorized use of this report.
This report is based upon information, furnished to us by System staff, concerning retirement and
ancillary benefits, active members, deferred vested members, retirees and beneficiaries, and financial
data. This report is based on the valuation date of June 30, 2017. The total pension liability was rolledforward from the valuation date to the plan year ending June 30, 2018 using generally accepted actuarial
principles. The asset information as of June 30, 2018 was provided by the System. This information was
checked for internal consistency, but it was not audited by Gabriel, Roeder, Smith & Company. A
description of the adjustments made to the data is incorporated in this report (either directly or by
reference). GRS is not responsible for the accuracy of the data provided by the Retirement System. This
report is based upon estimates of frozen accrued benefits. Future measurements based on final
calculation of benefit amounts will differ.
At the direction of the System and approval of the System’s Auditor, the long-term expected return on
assets used to determine the discount rate is 7.38%, net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2018, up
from 6.91%, net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2017. We have reviewed this assumption based
on the System’s asset allocation and have determined it is not unreasonable for the purpose of the
measurement being taken.

The benefit provisions reflected in this valuation for the development of the end of year Total Pension
Liability (TPL) are those in effect for Component II as of the end of the plan year on June 30, 2018. We
understand that Component I is a separate plan for GASB Nos. 67 and 68 purposes and will, therefore, be
disclosed in a separate report.
To the best of our knowledge, the information contained within this report is accurate and fairly
represents the actuarial position of the System on the measurement date for purposes of GASB
Statement Nos. 67 and 68 reporting. All calculations have been made in conformity with generally
accepted actuarial principles and practices as well as with the Actuarial Standards of Practice issued by
the Actuarial Standards Board.
The signing individuals are independent of the plan sponsor.

 Discussion
Changes to the Actuarial Assumptions
For purposes of determining the total pension liability as of June 30, 2018, the following actuarial
assumptions were changed/modified from those used in the June 30, 2017 funding valuation:
•

•

At the direction of the System and approval of the Systems’ Auditor, the long-term expected
return on assets was 7.38% net of investment expenses, as of June 30, 2018 (it was 6.75% net of
investment and administrative expenses, in the June 30, 2017 funding valuation, as required by
the Plan of Adjustment).
The June 30, 2017 funding valuation included approximately $5.9 million in liabilities to account
for an anticipated excess ASF earnings transfer to Component I expected to occur in the future as
a result of FY 2017 investment performance. We have discussed this additional liability with the
Plan’s auditor who indicated that the excess earnings transfer should not be included as a liability
in the GASB 67/68 reports until it actually occurs. As such, the excess earnings transfer is not
included as a liability in this report. Please see the funding valuation for more details.

All other actuarial assumptions were the same as those used in the June 30, 2017 actuarial valuation (the
funding valuation).
The following assumptions were changed/modified from those used in the June 30, 2017 GASB Statement
Nos. 67 and 68 valuations:
•

The Single Discount Rate (SDR) changed to 7.38% from 6.91% (coincident with the change in the
long-term expected return). While this assumption is not unreasonable, it is important to note
that the direction and magnitude of the change is not consistent with the industry trend.

Changes to the Benefit Provisions
There were no changes in benefit provisions during the year.

Data Approximations and Assumptions
A description of the data approximations and assumptions used in making this report are included in the
June 30, 2017 funding valuation report.

Magnitude of Administrative Expenses
The Component I (Hybrid) payroll has significantly increased since the last valuation. As a result, for this
valuation, we have adjusted the administrative expense as a percent of payroll assumption to bring the
assumption in line with current experience. This brought the expenses as a percent of Component I
payroll down from 3.55% back to the previous assumption of 3.0%. In addition, we allocated 60% of the
expenses to Component II and 40% to Component I, consistent with this year’s allocation as shown in the
assets.

 Development of Employer Proportionate Shares
As instructed, we have developed the proportionate employer shares as follows:
•
•
•

General, DOT, DWSD, and Library have contribution rates assessed on separate relationships and
are therefore accounted for separately under Paragraph 49 of GASB No. 68.
The component units in the General Division were 1) General City; 2) Parking; and 3) Airport.
Proportionate shares in the General Division were determined by prorating based on the Total
Pension Liability.

Accounting Standard
For pension plans that are administered through trusts or equivalent arrangements, Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 67 establishes standards of financial reporting for
separately issued financial reports and specifies the required approach for measuring the pension liability.
Similarly, GASB Statement No. 68 establishes standards for state and local government employers (as well
as non-employer contributing entities) to account for and disclose the net pension liability, pension
expense, and other information associated with providing retirement benefits to their employees (and
former employees) on their basic financial statements.
The following discussion provides a summary of the information that is required to be disclosed under
these accounting standards. A number of these disclosure items are provided in this report. However,
certain information, such as notes regarding accounting policies and investments, is not included in this
report and the retirement system and/or plan sponsor will be responsible for preparing and disclosing
that information to comply with these accounting standards.

Financial Statements
GASB Statement No. 68 requires state or local governments to recognize the net pension liability and the
pension expense on their financial statements. The net pension liability is the difference between the
total pension liability and the plan’s fiduciary net position. In traditional actuarial terms, this is analogous
to the accrued liability less the market value of assets (not the smoothed actuarial value of assets that is
often encountered in actuarial valuations performed to determine the employer’s contribution
requirement).
Paragraph 57 of GASB Statement No. 68 states, “Contributions to the pension plan from the employer
subsequent to the measurement date of the collective net pension liability and before the end of the
employer’s reporting period should be reported as a deferred outflow of resources related to pensions.”
The information contained in this report does not incorporate any contributions made to the General
Retirement System of the City of Detroit subsequent to the measurement date of June 30, 2017.
The pension expense recognized each fiscal year is equal to the change in the net pension liability from
the beginning of the year to the end of the year, adjusted for deferred recognition of the certain changes
in the liability and investment experience.

Page 184

 Pension plans that prepare their own, stand-alone financial statements are required to present two
financial statements – a statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net
position in accordance with GASB Statement No. 67. The statement of fiduciary net position presents the
assets and liabilities of the pension plan at the end of the pension plan’s reporting period. The statement
of changes in fiduciary net position presents the additions, such as contributions and investment income,
and deductions, such as benefit payments and expenses, and net increase or decrease in the fiduciary net
position.

Notes to Financial Statements
GASB Statement No. 68 requires the notes of the employer’s financial statements to disclose the total
pension expense, the pension plan’s liabilities and assets, and deferred outflows and inflows of resources
related to pensions.
GASB Statement Nos. 67 and 68 require the notes of the financial statements for the employers and
pension plans to include certain additional information. The list of disclosure items should include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

a description of benefits provided by the plan;
the type of employees and number of members covered by the pension plan;
a description of the plan’s funding policy, which includes member and employer contribution
requirements;
the pension plan’s investment policies;
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and the net pension liability;
the net pension liability using a discount rate that is 1% higher and 1% lower than used to
calculate the total pension liability and net pension liability for financial reporting purposes;
significant assumptions and methods used to calculate the total pension liability;
inputs to the discount rates; and
certain information about mortality assumptions and the dates of experience studies.

Retirement systems that issue stand-alone financial statements are required to disclose additional
information in accordance with GASB Statement No. 67. This information includes:
•
•
•
•

the composition of the pension plan’s Board and the authority under which benefit terms may be
amended;
a description of how fair value is determined;
information regarding certain reserves and investments, which include concentrations of
investments greater than or equal to 5%, receivables, and insurance contracts excluded from plan
assets; and
annual money-weighted rate of return.

 Required Supplementary Information
GASB Statement No. 67 requires a 10-year fiscal history of:
•
•
•

sources of changes in the net pension liability;
information about the components of the net pension liability and related ratios, including the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position as a percentage of the total pension liability, and the net
pension liability as a percent of covered-employee payroll; and
a comparison of the actual employer contributions to the actuarially determined contributions
based on the plan’s funding policy.

Timing of the Valuation
An actuarial valuation to determine the total pension liability is required to be performed at least every
two years. The net pension liability and pension expense should be measured as of the pension plan’s
fiscal year end (measurement date) on a date that is within the employer’s prior fiscal year. If the
actuarial valuation used to determine the total pension liability is not calculated as of the measurement
date, the total pension liability is required to be rolled forward from the actuarial valuation date to the
measurement date.
The total pension liability shown in this report is based on an actuarial valuation performed as of June 30,
2017, rolled to the plan year end of June 30, 2018.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single
Discount Rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the
extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) taxexempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general obligation bonds with an average AA
credit rating (which is published by the Federal Reserve) as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the contributions for use with the long-term expected rate of return are not met).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.38%; the
municipal bond rate is 3.62% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than the measurement date
of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”); and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 7.38%.
The expected rate of return was provided by the Retirement System and approved by the System’s
auditor.

 Limitation of Assets as a Percent of Total Pension Liability Measurements
This report includes a measure of the plan fiduciary net position as a percent of total pension liability
(69.98% as of June 30, 2018). Unless otherwise indicated, with regard to any such measurements
presented in this report:
(1) This measurement is not intended to be a funded ratio or a measure of funded progress.
(2) This measurement is inappropriate for assessing the sufficiency of Plan assets to cover the
estimated cost of settling the Plan’s benefit obligations.
(3) The measurement is inappropriate for assessing the need for or amount of future employer
contributions.

Limitations of Project Scope
Actuarial Standards do not require the actuary to evaluate the ability of the plan sponsor or other
contributing entities to make required contributions when due. Such an evaluation was not within the
scope of this project and is not within our area of expertise. Consequently, we have not made such an
evaluation.

ASF Recoupments
The reported June 30, 2018 assets included a receivable, computed by the System’s auditors, that
accounts for future ASF recoupments. We understand this amount was originally determined as of June
30, 2015 and updated to June 30, 2017 in accordance with GAAP accounting.

Single Discount Rate
A Single Discount Rate of 7.38%, net of investment expenses, was used to measure the total pension
liability as of June 30, 2018. This Single Discount Rate was based on the expected rate of return on
pension plan investments of 7.38% as directed by the System and approved by the System’s Auditor. The
projection of cash flows used to determine this Single Discount Rate assumed that plan member
contributions ceased as of June 30, 2014, and that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to
those set by the final Plan of Adjustment through June 30, 2023 and contributions consistent with PERSIA
and the intention to fully fund the System by 2053 as determined in the bankruptcy (POA). Based on
these assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of
return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to
determine the total pension liability.
Regarding the sensitivity of the net pension liability to changes in the Single Discount Rate, the following
presents the plan’s net pension liability, calculated using a Single Discount Rate of 7.38%, as well as what
the plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a Single Discount Rate that is one
percent lower or one percent higher.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

Page 213

Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
Component II Frozen Benefits
All Component II benefits are frozen as of June 30, 2014 based on service and average final compensation
accrued as of that date and the provisions of the Detroit General Retirement System as it existed on June 30,
2014. Frozen benefits are further reduced by 4.5% and all future Cost-of-Living Adjustments (“COLAs”) were
eliminated. Benefits resulting from the Annuity Savings Fund and benefits paid from the Annuity Reserve
Fund were subject to a separate reduction described as a “Claw-back.” Details of the claw-back provision are
complicated and can be found in the Eighth Amended Plan of Adjustment. The benefits evaluated in this
report are the frozen reduced benefits after the claw-back. Component II benefits are payable after
separation from service, upon meeting the eligibility conditions of the plan as it existed on June 30, 2014,
regardless of whether the individual is eligible to receive a Component I benefit at that time.
Our understanding of the June 30, 2014 plan provisions is provided below for completeness. The material
below does not have legal standing and is not intended to cover all potential situations that could occur. If
there are discrepancies between the description below, and appropriate legal documents, the latter
necessarily govern.

Age and Service Pension
Eligibility - Any age (minimum age 55 for non-EMS members hired after 1995) with 30 years of service (25
for EMS members), or age 60 with 10 years of service, or age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount - EMS Members: Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of
service, plus b) a pension equal to 2.0% of AFC multiplied by years of service. Maximum benefit is 90% of
AFC. Other Members: Sum of a) a basic pension of $12 for each of the first 10 years of service, plus b) a
pension equal to the first 10 years of service multiplied by 1.6% of AFC, plus 1.8% of AFC for each year of
service greater than 10 years up to 20 years, plus 2.0% of AFC for each year of service greater than 20
years up to 25 years, plus 2.2% of AFC for each year of service greater than 25 years. Future benefit
accruals for certain active members (depending on bargaining unit) were reduced to 1.5% of final average
compensation per year of service.
Type of Average Final Compensation (AFC) - Highest 3 consecutive years out of the last 10. Pension
benefits will not be diminished if compensation is reduced because of a fiscal emergency. Effective July 1,
1999, in computing the AFC, a member shall have the option of adding the value of 25% of unused
accrued sick leave to the earnings used in computing the AFC. Longevity is added to AFC in accordance
with the following schedule: $150 after 5 years, $300 after 10 years, $450 after 15 years, $600 after 20
years, and $750 after 25 years.

Early Retirement
Eligibility - Any age with 25 or more years of service (min. age 55 for members hired after 1995).
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but actuarially reduced.

The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit – Component II

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Continued)
Deferred Retirement (Vested Benefit)
Eligibility - Hired prior to 7-1-80: Age 40 with 8 years of service. Hired on or after 7-1-80: Any age with
10 years of service.
Benefit Commencement - APTE hired prior to July 1, 1988: Benefit begins at the age the member would
have become eligible for regular retirement if service had continued. SAAA, Non-Union and lawyers
hired prior to June 30, 1986: Benefit begins at the age the member would have become eligible for
regular retirement. Others: Benefits based on service rendered by June 30, 1986 begin at the age the
member would have become eligible for regular retirement. Benefits based on service rendered after July
1, 1986 begin at age 62.
Annual Amount - Same as regular retirement but based on average final compensation and service at the
time of termination.

Duty Disability Retirement
Eligibility - Service related disability before eligibility for service retirement prior to July 1, 2014. No
service requirement.
Annual Amount - An annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated contributions at date of
disability plus a pension of two-thirds of average final compensation at time of disability. The maximum
annual pension is $5,700 ($9,000 for EMS). At the earliest of when the member would have accrued 30
years of service credit (25 for EMS) or age 60, the annuity is recomputed assuming contributions would
have continued at a salary level equal to final compensation. The pension is recomputed with additional
service credit granted from the date of disability to age 60 (or 30 years of service credit) or June 30, 2014,
whichever is earlier.

Non-Duty Disability Retirement
Eligibility - Disability from any cause before age 60 with 10 or more years of service prior to July 1, 2014.
Annual Amount - Computed in the same manner as a regular retirement benefit. Maximum annual
pension to age 60 is $6,000. Benefit is recomputed at age 60 with no maximum.

Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death from service related causes. No age or service requirements.
Annual Amount - One-third of final compensation as of June 30, 2014 to the surviving spouse for life or
until remarriage, plus an equal share of 1/4 of final compensation to each unmarried child under age 18.
If there is no eligible spouse, eligible children each receive 1/4 of final compensation; if there are more
than 2 such children, each child shares an equal part of 1/2 of final compensation. Maximum total
amount for spouse and children is $9,000 annually. If there is no eligible spouse or children, dependent
parents each receive 1/6 of deceased’s final compensation, to a total maximum of $600 annually.
The General Retirement System of the City of Detroit – Component II

Page 215

 Summary of Benefit Provisions Evaluated
(Concluded)
Non-Duty Death Before Retirement
Eligibility - Death-in-service at any age with 15 years of service; or after age 60 with 10 years of service; or
after age 65 with 8 years of service.
Annual Amount - To Surviving Spouse: Computed as a regular retirement benefit but reduced in
accordance with a 100% joint and survivor election for members with 20 or more years of service. For
members with 15 years of service but less than 20, benefit is reduced in accordance with a 50% joint and
survivor election. To Dependent Children if no Surviving Spouse: $9,000 payable to age 19 of the
youngest child or for life if child is physically or mentally impaired for members with 20 or more years of
service ($6,000 if less than 20 years of service).

Post-Retirement Cost-of-Living Adjustments
Benefit is increased annually by 2.25% of the original pension amount at retirement. Post-retirement
cost-of-living increases were eliminated on future accruals for certain active members (depending on
bargaining unit).

Member Contributions
Members had the option of choosing one of four contribution amounts: (1) 0%; (2) 3.0% of compensation
up to the Social Security wage base, plus 5.0% of compensation in excess of the Social Security wage base;
(3) 5.0% of total compensation; or (4) 7.0% of total compensation. Member contributions can be paid as
a lump sum or annuitized at retirement to provide an annuity in addition to the pension (which is not
affected by the level of member contributions).

ACTUARIAL COST METHOD AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

Page 217

Summary of Assumptions and Methods Used for
GASB Actuarial Valuations
Adopted by Board of Trustees
All assumptions are estimates of future experience except as noted. The rationale for the assumptions
is based on experience studies where noted.

Economic Assumptions
The investment return rate used in making the valuation was 7.38% per year, compounded annually (net
after investment expenses) as of June 30, 2018. This assumption was provided by the Retirement System.
Price inflation is not directly used in the valuation. For purposes of assessing the reasonability of the
investment return assumptions, we assumed price inflation of 2.50% per year.

Non-Economic Assumptions
The mortality table used to measure retired life mortality was 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant
Table set-forward 1 year for males and 100% of the RP-2014 Blue Collar Annuitant Table set-forward 1
year for females. Tables were extended below age 50 with a cubic spline to the published Juvenile rates.
Pre-retirement mortality is based on the corresponding Employee tables with corresponding set forward.
The tables are projected to be fully generational, based on the 2-dimensional, sex distinct mortality
improvement scale MP-2014 (which was published and intended to be used with RP-2014). 75% of all
deaths-in-service are assumed to be non-duty related. This table was first used as of June 30, 2014. For
disabled members, the same tables are used. The rationale for the mortality assumption is based on the
2008-2013 Mortality Experience Study issued February 4, 2015.
The probabilities of retirement for members eligible to retire are shown on pages 34 and 35. These
probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale is based on the 2002-2007
Experience Study.
The probabilities of separation from service (including disability) are shown for sample ages on page 36.
These probabilities were revised for the June 30, 2008 valuation. The rationale is based on the 2002-2007
Experience Study.

 Miscellaneous and Technical Assumptions
Benefit Service

Exact Fractional service is used to determine the amount of benefit
payable.

Decrement Operation

Disability and mortality decrements do not operate during the first 5
years of service. Disability and withdrawal also do not operate during
retirement eligibility.

Decrement Timing

Decrements of all types are assumed to occur mid-year.

Eligibility Testing

Eligibility for benefits is determined based upon the age nearest
birthday and rounded service on the date the decrement is assumed to
occur.

Forfeitures

None.

Incidence of Contributions

Contributions are assumed to be received at the middle of the year.

Marriage Assumption

100% of males and 100% of females are assumed to be married for
purposes of death-in-service benefits. Male spouses are assumed to be
three years older than female spouses for active member valuation
purposes.

Normal Form of Benefit

Straight life is the normal form of benefit. The Board adopted
assumptions for Actuarial Equivalence to be an 80%/20% unisex blend of
RP-2014 mortality (Male/Female) with Blue Collar Adjustment, set
ahead 1 year for males and females, projected 11 years with MP-2014,
an interest rate of 6.75, and no COLA for optional forms of payment and
early retirement reduction. Assumptions for annuitizing member
contributions are the same except for using a 60%/40% unisex blend and
a 5.25% assumed rated of interest. Prior to that, actuarial equivalent
factors were based on 7.5% interest and 1984 Group Annuity Mortality
table.

Service Credit Accruals

Service accruals stop as of June 30, 2014 for measurement of
Component II liabilities. However, future service in Component I may be
used to satisfy benefit eligibility requirement in Component II. Members
who became duty disabled prior to June 30, 2014 are assumed to get
projected service from date of disability to conversion date. Members
who become disabled after June 30, 2014 are assumed to get their
frozen accrued benefit as of June 30, 2014 at date of conversion.

Administrative Expenses

3.00% of Component I payroll. 60% was allocated to Component II and
40% to Component I.

Sick Leave

Sick leave banks as of June 30, 2014 were included in the 2014 data file
provided by the System.

Member Contributions

Member contributions to this Component II plan are assumed to have
ceased with the bankruptcy.

Rationale for assumption is based upon a 2002 to 2007 Experience Study, modified as necessary for
changes in data or administration.

 SECTION 

 

CALCULATION OF THE SINGLE DISCOUNT RATE

Page 224

Calculation of the Single Discount Rate at End of Year
GASB Statement No. 67 includes a specific requirement for the discount rate that is used for the purpose
of the measurement of the Total Pension Liability. This rate considers the ability of the fund to meet
benefit obligations in the future. To make this determination, employer contributions, employee
contributions, benefit payments, expenses and investment returns are projected into the future. The Plan
Net Position (assets) in future years can then be determined and compared to its obligation to make
benefit payments in those years. As long as assets are projected to be on hand in a future year, the
assumed valuation discount rate is used. In years where assets are not projected to be sufficient to meet
benefit payments, the use of a municipal bond rate is required, as described in the following paragraph.
The Single Discount Rate (SDR) is equivalent to applying these two rates to the benefits that are projected
to be paid during the different time periods. The SDR reflects (1) the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments (during the period in which the fiduciary net position is projected to be
sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the
contributions for use with the long-term expected rate of return are not met).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.38%; the
municipal bond rate is 3.62%; and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 7.38% as of June 30, 2018.
The tables in this section provide background for the development of the Single Discount Rate.
The Projection of Contributions table shows the development of expected contributions in future years.
Normal Cost contributions for future hires are not included (nor are their liabilities). For purposes of
determining the discount rate as of June 30, 2018, the employer contributions for the 10-year period
ending June 30, 2023 were set by the 8th Amended Plan of Adjustment (POA), as adjusted by subsequent
agreements. Subsequent employer contributions were determined by a closed 30-year level principle
amortization of any unfunded actuarial accrued liability using 7.38% interest, net of investment expenses,
consistent with the 100% funded target by 2053 in the POA and State Law.
Rates of Return: Note that these projections are specifically used to determine the SDR and should not
be interpreted as a funding recommendation. The 7.38% rate of return was before administrative
expenses. Therefore, the projections assumed that any administrative expenses incurred by the plan will
directly increase employer contributions beginning with FY 2024. The rate is net of investment expenses.
Administrative Expenses: For purposes of the projection using a 7.38% rate of return, administrative
expenses were assumed to be related to payroll. Payroll was increased by an assumed wage inflation as
of June 30, 2014 of 2.00% for 5 years, 2.50% for the next 5 years and 3.00% thereafter. Since benefits are
frozen, the wage inflation assumption does not affect anything other than the administrative expenses.

 The Projection of Plan Fiduciary Net Position table shows the development of expected asset levels in
future years.
The Present Values of Projected Benefit Payments table shows the development of the SDR. It breaks
down the benefit payments into present values for funded and unfunded portions (if any) and shows the
equivalent total at the SDR. For purposes of determining the discount rate as of June 30, 2018, the
benefit payments reflect the plan provisions in force as of June 30, 2018.
Unfunded Actuarial Accrued Liabilities. Actual employer contributions through June 30, 2023 are set by
the POA. The amortization period and method after 2023 has not yet been established by the Board.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

Page 233

Glossary of Terms
Actuarial Accrued Liability
(AAL)

The AAL is the difference between the actuarial present value of all
benefits and the actuarial value of future normal costs. The definition
comes from the fundamental equation of funding which states that
the present value of all benefits is the sum of the Actuarial Accrued
Liability and the present value of future normal costs. The AAL may
also be referred to as "accrued liability" or "actuarial liability."

Actuarial Assumptions

These assumptions are estimates of future experience with respect to
rates of mortality, disability, turnover, retirement, rate or rates of
investment income and compensation increases. Actuarial
assumptions are generally based on past experience, often modified
for projected changes in conditions. Economic assumptions
(compensation increases, payroll growth, inflation and investment
return) consist of an underlying real rate of return plus an assumption
for a long-term average rate of inflation.

Accrued Service

Service credited under the system which was rendered before the date
of the actuarial valuation.

Actuarial Equivalent

A single amount or series of amounts of equal actuarial value to
another single amount or series of amounts, computed on the basis
of appropriate actuarial assumptions.

Actuarial Cost Method

A mathematical budgeting procedure for allocating the dollar amount
of the actuarial present value of the pension trust benefits between
future normal cost and actuarial accrued liability. The actuarial cost
method may also be referred to as the actuarial funding method.

Actuarial Gain (Loss)

The difference in liabilities between actual experience and expected
experience during the period between two actuarial valuations is the
gain (loss) on the accrued liabilities.

Actuarial Present Value
(APV)

The amount of funds currently required to provide a payment or series
of payments in the future. The present value is determined by
discounting future payments at predetermined rates of interest and
probabilities of payment.

Actuarial Valuation

The actuarial valuation report determines, as of the actuarial
valuation date, the service cost, total pension liability, and related
actuarial present value of projected benefit payments for pensions.

Actuarial Valuation Date

The date as of which an actuarial valuation is performed.

Actuarially Determined
Contribution (ADC) or
Annual Required
Contribution (ARC)

A calculated contribution into a defined benefit pension plan for the
reporting period, most often determined based on the funding policy
of the plan. Typically the Actuarially Determined Contribution has a
normal cost payment and an amortization payment.

AFC

Average Final Compensation.

Amortization Payment

The amortization payment is the periodic payment required to pay off
an interest-discounted amount with payments of interest and principal.

Amortization Method

The method used to determine the periodic amortization payment
may be a level dollar amount, or a level percent of pay amount. The
period will typically be expressed in years, and the method will either
be “open” (meaning, reset each year) or “closed” (the number of
years remaining will decline each year).

ASF

Annuity Savings Fund.

Cost-of-Living Adjustments

Postemployment benefit changes intended to adjust benefit
payments for the effects of inflation.

Cost-Sharing MultipleEmployer Defined Benefit
Pension Plan (cost-sharing
pension plan)

A multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan in which the
pension obligations to the employees of more than one employer are
pooled and pension plan assets can be used to pay the benefits of the
employees of any employer that provides pensions through the
pension plan.

Covered-Employee Payroll

The payroll of covered employees, which is typically only the
pensionable pay and does not include pay above any pay cap.

Deferred Inflows and
Outflows

The deferred inflows and outflows of pension resources are amounts
used under GASB Statement No. 68 in developing the annual pension
expense. Deferred inflows and outflows arise with differences
between expected and actual experiences; changes of assumptions.
The portion of these amounts not included in pension expense should
be included in the deferred inflows or outflows of resources.

DIA

Detroit Institute of Art.

Discount Rate

For GASB purposes, the discount rate is the single rate of return that
results in the present value of all projected benefit payments to be
equal to the sum of the funded and unfunded projected benefit
payments, specifically:
1. The benefit payments to be made while the pension plans’
fiduciary net position is projected to be greater than the benefit
payments that are projected to be made in the period; and
2. The present value of the benefit payments not in (1) above,
discounted using the municipal bond rate.

Entry Age Actuarial Cost
Method (EAN)

The EAN is a funding method for allocating the costs of the plan
between the normal cost and the accrued liability. The actuarial
present value of the projected benefits of each individual included in
an actuarial valuation is allocated on a level basis (either level dollar
or level percent of pay) over the earnings or service of the individual
between entry age and assumed exit ages(s). The portion of the
actuarial present value allocated to a valuation year is the normal
cost. The portion of this actuarial present value not provided for at a
valuation date by the actuarial present value of future normal costs is
the actuarial accrued liability. The sum of the accrued liability plus
the present value of all future normal costs is the present value of all
benefits.

Long-Term Expected Rate of
Return

The long-term rate of return is the expected return to be earned over
the entire trust portfolio based on the asset allocation of the portfolio.

Money-Weighted Rate of
Return

The money-weighted rate of return is a method of calculating the
returns that adjusts for the changing amounts actually invested. For
purposes of GASB Statement No. 67, money-weighted rate of return is
calculated as the internal rate of return on pension plan investments,
net of pension plan investment expense.

Multiple-Employer Defined
Benefit Pension Plan

A multiple-employer plan is a defined benefit pension plan that is used
to provide pensions to the employees of more than one employer.

Municipal Bond Rate

The Municipal Bond Rate is the discount rate to be used for those
benefit payments that occur after the assets of the trust have been
depleted.

 AGENDA ITEM #7C

Date: January 17, 2019
To:

Great Lakes Water Authority Audit Committee

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer
Re:

Proposed Audit Fee Change Order for the FY 2018 Audit and Other Technical
Services

Background: The firm of Rehmann Robson was selected as auditors for the Great Lakes
Water Authority (GLWA) in January 2017. The contract executed provided for the base
fees only which were directly related to the audit for FY 2016, FY 2017, and FY 2018.

Analysis: The audit for FY 2018 was started in October 2018 and completed with the
issuance the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) on December 14, 2018 prior
to the state of Michigan’s submission due date. The audit went smoothly and there were no
extraordinary challenges for FY 2018 as there was with the first two audits (such as
accounting for the bifurcation and implementing Governmental Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 69, Government Combinations and Disposals of Government
Operations, for FY 2016 followed by other technical matters and delays to work through to
a Memorandum of Understanding for FY 2017). Nevertheless, in completing the CAFR this
year, there was a substantial level of rework requested of Rehmann Robson by GLWA in
revising and re-revising the various sections and items throughout the report. These
changes to the CAFR were in response to investor and rating analyst feedback during the
2018 bond refunding transaction – largely driven by the complexity of the Master Bond
Ordinance as well as the combination of DWSD and GLWA financial reports (DWSD was
also completing their audit at the same time). These final changes then needed to be
reflected in the two separate fund reports which are required for reporting the water and
sewer system as separate credits. The Rehmann team incurred an additional 72 hours
from December 2, 2018 through December 14, 2018 as a result of these requests. This
equals approximately $15,000 in fees for which a discount has been provided for a request
of $12,500 for additional audit fees for FY 2018 (the original fee for FY 2018 audit is
$203,908). The effective hourly rate is competitive – especially since this impacted the
highest level of audit team members.
It should be noted that the GLWA Articles require that the Audit Committee recommend
three audit firms to the Board every three years. Staff is presently drafting an auditing
services request for proposal for the Audit Committee’s review. While the current contract

Page 240

 with Rehmann extends to January 2020, there was no provision for additional services or
consultation. With upcoming lease accounting rule changes, member partner contract
matters, potential regulatory matters, and other unknown needs, staff is also requesting an
allowance of $50,000 for technical consulting services be added to bridge the gap until a
new audit contract through the RFP process is completed. This was originally discussed
when Rehmann was selected in 2017, but the conversation focused on the budged funds
being available which was inadvertently did not carry forward to the executed contract.

Budget Impact: The auditing services account is budgeted at $450,000 (GL# 5910-5910884111.000-611200-WS7900). This line item does include other contracted audit services
as well as the annual external audit fee and the provision for technical assistance from
GLWA’s auditors. No budget amendment is required to include the proposed contract
amendment.
Proposed Action: Move that the Audit Committee recommends that the Board of
Directors of the Great Lakes Water Authority approve a change order for audit services
contract with Rehmann Robson in the amount of $12,500 for the FY 2018 audit and
$50,000 for other technical professional services as needed.

 Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended October 31, 2018
Budget to Actual Analysis
The Budget to Actual Analysis report includes the following three sections.

1. Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis
2. Operations Budget – Major Operations & Maintenance Budget Category
3. Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories

Revenue Requirement Budget Basis Analysis

GLWA’s annual revenue requirement aligns with a) the basis for calculating customer
charges and b) the Master Bond Ordinance flow of funds. The budget basis is not the same
as the full accrual basis used for financial reporting although the revenues and operations
and maintenance expense are largely reported on an accrual basis. The primary deviation
between the revenue requirement basis to financial reporting basis is the treatment of debt
service, legacy pension obligations, and lease related activities. The Revenue Requirement
Basis is foundational to GLWA’s daily operations, financial plan, and of most interest to key
stakeholders.
Table 1A – Water Revenue Requirement Budget and Table 1B – Sewer Revenue
Requirement Budget presents a year-over-year budget to actual performance report. For
both systems there were no budget amendments that changed the totals, therefore, only an
“amended” budget column is represented. The revenue requirement budget is accounted
for in the operations and maintenance fund for each system. Since this report is for
October 2018, the pro-rata benchmark is 33.3% (4 of 12 months of the fiscal year).
Items of key interest discussed below are highlighted in gold on Tables 1A (Water) and 1B
(Sewer).
1. For both systems, FY 2019 revenues are at or above target and are consistent with
the prior year (FY 2018) at the same time.
2. The operations and maintenance (O&M) expense for the water system is above the
pro-rata benchmark for FY 2019 at 37.9%. Conversely the sewer system O&M
expenses at 26.1% is less than the pro-rata benchmark. This variance between the
funds is partly due to a project in-process to refine centralized and administrative
cost allocations. It is likely that this will result in a budget amendment after the
December 2018 close.
3. The remaining revenue requirements for both systems are generally funded on a
1/12th basis each month in accordance with the Master Bond Ordinance. The debt
service amount shown on the table is accounted for on that same basis. In October
2018, the GLWA had a successful bond sale which will provide a positive budget
variance for both systems. That amendment will be reported in a future month.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

4. Overall total revenue requirements for both systems are in line with the benchmark.
Detailed schedules related to revenues are provided in the Wholesale Billings,
Collections, and Receivables section of this financial report binder.
5. For the sewer system, the FY 2019 year-to-date revenue requirements exceed
revenues by $8.4 million. This is a timing difference between revenues and revenue
requirement (i.e. expenses) which is expected to be reversed by mid-fiscal year.

Table 1B – Sewer Revenue Requirement Budget (year-over-year)

Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories
The year-over-year benchmark ratio as of October 31, 2018, is 33.3% (four months). When
comparing FY 2019 to FY 2018 in Table 2, it would appear that the spending has increased.
This is true in some instances; however, the greater impact is that the Financial Reporting
& Accounting Team has implemented a full accrual basis for interim financial statements
during FY 2018. This anomaly will decrease as we proceed through FY 2019.

In addition to the four major budget categories, an internal charge cost center for employee
benefits is shown in the table below. If the number is positive, it indicates that the internal
cost allocation rate charges to other cost centers is not sufficient. A negative number
indicates a surplus in the internal cost center. A moderate surplus is preferred as it
provides a hedge for mid-year benefit program cost adjustments (premiums adjust on
January 1 each year) as well as managing risk as the program is partially self-insured.

Table 2 – Operations & Maintenance Budget – Major Budget Categories

Alignment of Operations & Maintenance Budget Priorities – Expense Variance
Analysis
The purpose of Table 3 is to evaluate whether the actual spend rate within a category is in
alignment with the budget. Given the effort to develop an accurate budget, a variance is a
red flag of a potential budget amendment or misalignment of priorities.

In total, the O&M expenses are at 30.7% which is reasonably close to the pro-rata
benchmark of 33.3%. This positive variance equates to a dollar amount of $8.2 million. The
expense category commentary is provided below for items highlighted on Table 3.
Personnel Costs: The overall category is on target at 33.1% through October 2018.

Utilities: The overall category is slightly lower than the benchmark; coming in at 31.8%.
Variances in this category are not unexpected given the seasonality of the operations. In
comparing FY 2019 to FY 2018 the expenses appear more in line with the budget in FY
2019. This is due in large part to the month-end closing process improvements
implemented during the latter half of FY 2018.

Supplies & Other: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at 23.0%
through October 2018. An internal review is underway to better understand the causes for
this variance. Given that the nature of the items in this category are subject to one-time
expenses that do not occur evenly throughout the year, this variance is not a concern at this
time.
Contractual Services: The overall category is on target at 33.4% through October 2018.

Chemicals: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at 28.1% through
October 2018. This variance is not unexpected as usage varies throughout the year. Staff is
working on enhancements to future monthly financial reports to correlate spending with
operational metrics.
All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

Page 248

 Budget to Actual Analysis
for the Month Ended October 31, 2018
Capital Program Allocation: This category is lower than the benchmark; coming in at
27.5% through October 2018. In July 2018, GLWA launched a time keeping software
(including an app), BigTime, to make it easier for team members to report their time spent
on direct capital delivery. As we begin the close for December 2018, new processes are
being evaluated to better understand and cure the shortfall. An update will be provided
next month.

Shared Services: Most of the shared services reimbursement is labor which is also
tracked via BigTime in addition to some annual fees for software licensing which do not
occur evenly throughout the year. Staff is working to refine service level estimates and the
budget with DWSD to evaluate the budgeted amount as we move toward the December
2018 close.

 Basic Financial Statements for the
Month Ended October 31, 2018

In general, the Statement of Net Position reflects a mature organization with no unexpected
trends. One item of note as of October 31, 2018 is that there is a decrease in cash since June
30, 2018 which is offset by an increase in investments (highlighted in gold on the table). This is
due to the engagement of an active investment management during the current fiscal year;
hence the shift from cash to investments.
An ongoing challenge is the Net Position Deficit. The underlying causes took years to build
(largely heavy use of debt to finance capital asset investment versus a strategic blend of debt,
state revolving funds, and cash). This causes GLWA to have a high debt interest expense. The
GLWA is regularly updating the FY 2030 forecast that will guide the path toward a positive Net
Position.
Footnotes to Statement of Net Position
a. Cash and Investments include restricted amounts.
b. Due from Other Funds and Due to Other Funds is shown at the gross level for sub-fund
activity.
c. Other Assets primarily consists of the contractual obligation receivable from DWSD related
to reimbursement of bonded indebtedness for local system improvements.
d. Cash Held FBO Advance (for benefit of) DWSD and Cash Held FBO DWSD represents the net
difference between DWSD retail cash received from customers and net financial
commitments as outlined in the Master Bond Ordinance.
e. Deferred Inflow and Deferred Outflow relate to financing activity and GLWA’s share of the
legacy General Retirement System (GRS) pension obligation.
f. Liabilities - Short-term include accounts payable, retainage payable, and certain accrued
liabilities. Some items, such as compensated absences and worker’s compensation, are
reviewed periodically but are only adjusted on an interim basis if there is a material change.
g. Other Liabilities account for the cash receipts set aside for the Budget Stabilization Fund and
the Water Residential Assistance Program.
h. Liabilities – Long-term include bonds payable, lease payable, and legacy GRS pension
liabilities.
i. Net Position Deficit is defined by the accounting standards as the residual of all other
elements presented in a statement of financial position. It is the difference between (a)
assets and deferred outflows of resources and (b) liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources. A net deficit occurs when the liabilities and deferred inflows exceed assets and
deferred outflows. GLWA’s net deficit is largely driven by an increase in depreciation
expense as a result of the increase in the acquisition valuation approach for recording
capital asset values in the opening Statement of Net Position on January 1, 2016. Efforts
are underway to evaluate the net operating effect of this matter over the long term.

Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department (DWSD) via a Water
and Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of this monthly report.
Wholesale Water Billing Basis: Beginning with FY 2016, wholesale water charges were
restructured to create a more stable revenue stream by using a historical rolling average to
project customer volumes which accounts for 40% of the monthly charges and 60% of the annual
customer revenue requirement as a monthly fixed charge.
Table 1 - Wholesale Water Billings shows the FY 2019 water billed usage and
revenues. As of October 31, 2018, the billed usage was at 100.99% of budget and
billed revenue at 100.92% of budget. Billings and usage from the City of Flint are
included as they were assumed in the FY 2019 Budget.
Wholesale Water Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Table 2 - Wholesale Water Collections shows collections by month for the past 12
months compared to collections for the prior year as well as the calculated
difference between the periods. Variability in collections in the current year are
associated with timing of the billing cycle. Bills for December, February and
August were posted later than usual due to holiday conflicts and higher volumes
of meter reads requiring review (associated with meter issues and water main
breaks). While at times unavoidable, the GLWA billing team is identifying steps to
prevent delays wherever possible.
All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

18

Note: Services are provided to the Detroit Water & Sewerage Department via a Water and
Sewer Services Agreement (WSSA). See the “Retail Revenues, Receivables, and Collections
Report” section of the monthly report.
Wholesale Sewer Billing Basis: Beginning in FY 2015, the “sewer rate simplification” initiative
was applied which provides for a stable revenue stream and predictability for our member
partners. Wholesale sewer customers are billed a fixed monthly fee based upon the annual
revenue requirement.
Table 3 - Wholesale Sewer Billings shows the FY 2019 sewer billed revenue.
Consistent with expectations as a result of sewer rate simplification, billed
revenue is at 100.00% of budget through October 31, 2018.
Wholesale Sewer Collections: The collections represent payments made by wholesale
customers. These receipts are deposited directly into a lockbox with a trustee for administration
of the flow of funds defined by GLWA’s Master Bond Ordinance.
Table 4 - Wholesale Sewer Collections shows collections by month for the past 12 months
compared to collections for the prior year as well as the calculated difference between
the periods. Variability in collections in the current year are associated with timing of the
billing cycle.
The shift in wholesale sewer collection patterns is largely attributable to the timing of
payments received from one customer. Starting in February 2018, Wayne County’s
(Rouge Valley, NE Wayne and Wayne County #3) payments were received just after the
first of the calendar month for one invoice (showing no collection for the previous month)
and the subsequent invoice was paid in the same calendar month. This pattern has
continued through September 30, 2018. At no time during this period has Wayne County
been over 45 days delinquent in its sewer payments to GLWA. Given the payment amount
of $6.8 million, this produces noticeable swings in collection volumes by month.

All amounts are unaudited unless otherwise noted.

 Financial Report
Trust Receipts & Disbursements
for the Month Ended October 31, 2018
The Monthly Trust Receipts & Disbursements Report includes the following.
1. GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
2. DWSD Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows and Receipts
3. Combined System Trust Receipts & Disbursements – Net Cash Flows

GLWA Trust Receipts & Disbursements
Net Cash Flows and Receipts Basis: The trusts established pursuant to the Master Bond
Ordinance (MBO) outline a flow of funds that governs the priority of the application of cash
receipts from both the regional wholesale (i.e. Great Lakes Water Authority or GLWA) and local
retail (i.e. Detroit Water & Sewerage Department) activities which are further separated by the
water system and the sewage disposal system.
This report provides an ongoing status of the net cash flow of both organizations (GLWA and
DWSD) to fund their allocated share of Master Bond Ordinance requirements in accordance with
the leases for the regional systems. This report begins with the operational effective date of the
GLWA on January 1, 2016.
Table 1 – GLWA Net Cash Flows from Trust Receipts & Disbursements provides a
summary of cash receipt collections and required MBO transfers by fiscal year as
well as a total of all activity for GLWA since inception at January 1, 2016. Fiscal
year 2019 reflects four months of activity to date.
Through October 31, 2018 the water fund cash receipts exceeded MBO
disbursements by 19% with a ratio of 12% since January 1, 2016. Through October
31, 2018, the sewer fund cash receipts exceeded MBO disbursements by 1% and
by a ratio of 3% since January 1, 2016.
Chart 1 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Water outlines monthly cash receipt
trends across two points of reference for the regional water system—current year
and prior year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net
receipts.
Chart 2 – GLWA 12-Month Net Receipts – Sewer outlines monthly cash receipt
trends across two points of reference for the regional sewer system—current year
and prior year. The black line at the zero highlights the minimum goal for net
receipts.
