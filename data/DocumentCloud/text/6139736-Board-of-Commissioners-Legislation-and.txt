NOTICE

There will be a meeting of the Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations Committee of
the Board of Commissioners of Cook County on Wednesday, May 28, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 AM. in
the Board Room, Room 569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois to consider the

294146

CANDIDATES FOR THE INTERIM BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COOK COUNTY
BUREAU OF HEALTH (ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENTS). Transmitting a Communication from
Todd H. Stroger, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners, dated May 15, 2008.

With the restructuring and reorganization of the Bureau of Health Services, the passage of
adequate new revenue found in the 2008 Budget and an agreement on the legislation needed
to establish an independent hospital governance, the County Board, under my leadership, is

poised to take the next step, in a series of positive steps, to preserve the Cook County Health
Care System.

As this process moves forward, it is important to af?rm that all of the parties involved have
worked with genuine concern for the long-term well-being of our health system. The
organizations which participated in the Nominating Committee did a tremendous job in
fonrvarding a solid group of individuals. Additionally, I believe the County Board did their duty in
analyzing the nominees presented by this administration. This is not a perfect process (and it is
not enough to merely vote but it is the process we must move forward in order to ensure
that our children?s generation has universal access to quality health care in Cook County.

Based on the amendments passed by the Board to the Cook County Health and Hospitals
System Ordinance, I am transmitting the names of four additional persons to serve:

pgvid Ansell. MD. MPH: Chief Medical Of?cer, Associate Dean and Vice President of
Hospital Affairs, Rush University Medical Center;

0 Warren L. Batts:

Retired Chairman and Chief Executive Of?cer,
International;

Premark

. Sister Sheila President and Chief Executive Of?cer, Mercy Hospital
Medical Center; and

. Luis Munoz. MD: Director

of Occupational
Management

Medicine, WorkCare Medical

Their vast experience in health care administration, as well as their backgrounds in both the
public and private sectors, will be much-needed assets. I am con?dent that these four

individuals will bring professional and independent oversight and I therefore urge the Board of
Commissioners to provide for their swift con?rmation. 



Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans Relations
