 II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
ICJIA has administered federal grant funding for the Dual Diagnosis program since
2008; however, there has been no formal evaluation of the program. The purpose of
the study is to:
• Learn how the program operates and the effectiveness of the program.
• Make suggestions for program enhancement.
• Guide funding decisions and possible program expansion.
Two data sources will be used:
• Administrative data:
o All written policies and procedures;
o Data contained in Illinois Department of Correction’s administrative files
and databases;
o Arrest and court disposition data available through the state’s Criminal
History Information System;
o WestCare Treatment files, including the Buss-Perry Aggression
Questionnaire, PCL-5 (PTSD checklist), ASI (Addiction Severity Index),
and client exit/satisfaction survey
o Wells Center Treatment files including the names and dates of birth of
program participants and those on the program’s waiting list.
• Interviews with program staff and program clients.

5. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for
them.
We will include all staff (currently 3) and all current program clients (capacity is 25).
For secondary analysis, we will include prior clients from 2009-2013.

D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
6. Briefly describe the potential benefits of the project to subjects and/or to society. Note:
Social science research typically does not provide a direct benefit to the subjects.
There are no direct benefits for those who choose to participate in this study. However, there is
potential benefit to the field of treatment of prisoners for mental health and substance use
disorders, as well as for integrating services for those with co-occurring disorders. In addition,
the study can guide funding decisions and possible program expansion.

7. Does this study involve any of the following?
Yes

No
X

Use of deception by researchers

X

Use of punishment by researchers

X

Use of drugs by subjects for study purposes

X

Covert and/or participant observation

X

Induction of mental and/or physical stress to subjects by researchers

X

Procedures which risk physical harm to the subject

X

Materials and behaviors commonly regarded as socially unacceptable

X

Procedures by researchers that might be regarded as an invasion of privacy to
subjects or cause a degree of discomfort
Possible/probable disclosure of information by subjects to researchers that may
be harmful to the subject (e.g., child abuse, criminal behavior, immigration
status)

X

a.) If you checked YES to any of the above procedures, explain the procedure in detail, as
well
as provide the methods being used to control or minimize the danger to the subjects.
Researchers will ask subjects about prior traumatic or adverse experiences in their lives to
better understand their issues and needs that have lead them to the program. These
questions have the potential to be regarded as private and sensitive information. In
addition, these questions may cause discomfort because it is asking subjects to share

6

 information about traumatic events.
To minimize discomfort, subjects will be informed that they can skip any questions or stop
the interview at any time. Subjects will be informed that if they would like to talk to someone
after the interview, they can ask to see a WestCare counselor who will be made available
to meet with them.

b.) Please indicate the theoretical and/or methodological necessity for employing each
procedure(s) checked YES.
Since researchers are evaluating a dual diagnosis program, researchers will ask questions
about mental health and substance use, including prior treatment for those conditions. These
questions are necessary to answer the research question—Who were the clients of the
program? Researchers will also understand prior treatment attempts and how they were
different or the same, and more or less successful than their current program.

8. If the study involves deception, when and how will the subjects be debriefed? (Generally,
the nature of the deception and its necessity should be explained to the subjects).
Not applicable

9. Are provisions for subject’s medical care available in the event of a personal (physical or
mental) injury resulting solely from subject’s participation in the research? Please explain.
Yes

X

No

Not applicable

Subjects will be informed that if they would like to talk to someone after the interview, they can ask
to see a WestCare counselor who will be made available to meet with them.

10. Will other care or counseling be available or referrals made to agencies for the subject
should he or she become stressed, uncomfortable, angry, or experience other psychological
difficulties as a result of participating in the research? Please explain.
Yes

X

No

Not applicable

Subjects will be informed that if they would like to talk to someone after the interview, they can
ask to see a WestCare counselor who will be made available to meet with them.

Minimal risk: A risk is minimal where the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the proposed research are not greater, in and of themselves, than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations or tests.
Greater than minimal risk: A risk is greater than minimal where the probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in the proposed research are greater than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations or tests.
High risk: A risk is high when a moderate-to-high probability of serious adverse effects might
occur as a result of participation in a research study.
Risks and benefits that would result even if the research weren’t undertaken should not be
considered.

No

X

F. CONFIDENTIALITY
16. Will any data be gathered through photographic, video or sound recording devices?
Yes

No

X

a.) If YES, how will the confidentiality of the materials produced by such devices be

8

 protected?
Note: A separate line of the consent form for the subjects to agree to be video/audio taped or
photographed must be included.
b.) What will be done with the still photos, video, or audio recordings after the study has been
completed? Will this information be destroyed, kept xx number of years, used in publications,
etc? How does the investigator(s) define “completion” of the study?

17. Will names or individual identifiers of subjects be recorded? If YES, answer a through d
below.
Yes

X

No

a.) Where will the names or other individual identifiers be recorded (e.g., on test protocols,
on a separate list with code numbers, etc)?
A “data master list” will be created that contains each individual’s name, date of birth, State
Identification Number, and numeric code assigned by the research team. The individual’s
name, date of birth, and State Identification Number will be used to link the IDOC data,
program data, and criminal history records together.
An “interview master list” will be created to keep track of individuals who have consented to
participating in an interview and been interviewed.
Individuals who are participating in interviews will be asked to sign an informed consent
form.

b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point
in the data collection process.
Researchers will obtain a list of all individuals who have participated in the program since
its inception from program staff at IDOC. The data master list will include each individual’s
name, date of birth, State Identification Number, and numeric code assigned by the
research team. The individual’s name, date of birth, and State Identification Number will be
used to link the IDOC data, program data, and criminal history records together. Once the
data have been merged, the final dataset will be stripped of all identifying information. The
final de-identified dataset will be used for all analyses conducted. The final de-identified
dataset will be maintained separately from the master list on a secure, password protected
server accessible only to research staff.
An interview master list will be created containing the names of current program staff and
clients. The list will be used to keep track of individuals who have consented to participating
in an interview and been interviewed. The list will be maintained separately from all other
materials, including interview notes, in a secure location only accessible to research staff.
This list will also maintain the numerical key codes that link interview materials to
interviewees.
Prior to being interviewed, participants will be asked to sign an informed consent form.
Signed consent forms of those individuals who have agreed to be interviewed will be
transported to ICJIA’s office and maintained securely in a locked cabinet accessible only to
research staff. Signed consent forms will be maintained separately from interview notes.
Staff will also ensure that during notetaking no identifying information about the subject or

9

 others is recorded. All interview notes will be secured in a locked cabinet accessible only to
research staff. Notes that are later transcribed will be maintained separately from the
master list on a secure, password protected server accessible only to research staff.

c.) Would it be possible to conduct the proposed project without recording names or other
individual identifiers? Please explain why or why not.
Yes

No

X

Identifying information is needed to link various datasets together. It would not be possible
to accurately link those data without identifiers. Additionally, an interview master list is
necessary to manage the interviews of program staff and participants.

d.) Will access to names be under your exclusive control?
Yes

X

No

If NO, what will be done to protect the confidentiality of the subjects? Who would have
access to names or other individual identifiers? Describe the procedures for maintaining
security of paper files, automated files, and other records.
e.) Will names of subjects be included in any publication based on this study? If YES, for
what reason(s)?
Yes

No

X

18. Sometimes research findings are presented in a manner that permits knowledgeable
readers to infer the identity of a person used as a subject, even if names are omitted. Do you
expect to present findings that may possibly provide such clues? If YES, explain.
Yes

No

X

19. Will information be obtained pertaining to persons other than immediate subjects (e.g.,
their friends)? If YES, how will the confidentiality of such persons be protected?
Yes

No

b.) How will consent be obtained?
A consent form will be provided before the interview begins.
c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Consent will be obtained only once, prior to the start of the interview.

d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent?
Before the start of the interview, researchers will ask participants if they have any
questions about the consent form. The researcher can offer to read the consent form if
the subject needs assistance.

e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
The purpose of the present study is to develop a survey tool to examine the victimization and helpseeking experiences of LGBTQ identified individuals in Illinois. Participants will be screened via phone
to determine their study eligibility. Eligible participants will be asked to participate in a phone interview
for researchers to learn more about their experience in thinking of and responding to questions, and
assess their understanding of survey questions on discrimination, coping, and help-seeking. Participants
will be emailed or mailed an informed consent sheet and list of community resources prior to the
interview. This study will offer an understanding of how well select discrimination, coping, and helpseeking measures capture these phenomena among LGBTQ identified individuals.

39

 B. PROCEDURES
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.
Include the following information:
Individuals who identify as LGBTQ and have experienced at least one violent victimization
experience in their lifetime will be recruited to participate in phone interviews with ICJIA
research staff.
a.) Time involvement of subjects: Total time involvement of participants is estimated to be 50
minutes. Screening for study eligibility will take approximately 5 minutes. The interview with
participants will take 30-45 minutes.

b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable: Interviews will be conducted by phone.
c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily): Participants will receive a $30 gift card.
d.) What subjects will experience or do:
Researchers will use the following methods to recruit eligible participants.
1. Distribution of study flyer to LGBTQ specific and allied service agencies.
2. Distribution of study flyer via email listservs.
3. Use of online resources, such as ICJIA’s website and social media accounts.
4. Ask participants to share study information with others.
Recruitment materials will direct potential participants to a phone number to call in order to be
screened for eligibility to participate in the study.
Participants will be screened via phone to determine their study eligibility. Participants in the present
study are those who:
1. Reside in Illinois;
2. Identify as LGBTQ
3. Are 18 years or older; and
4. Have experienced at least one violent victimization at any point in their lifetime.
For ineligible participants, research staff will offer to send a list of community resources via email or
mail. Research staff will record their names and addresses, or email addresses in order to send them
the resource list. All names, addresses, and email addresses will be kept in a password protected
document saved in a protected file. This list will also be maintained in order to ensure that individuals
are not screened more than once.
For eligible participants, research staff will invite them to participate in the study. They will be
mailed or emailed an informed consent sheet for review and a list of community resources. Research
staff will record participants’ names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses in order to send
them the study materials. This information will be kept in a password protected document saved in a
protected file. To ensure victim’s safety, researchers will ask if these methods of contact are safe and
whether or not a message can be left.
After receiving the materials, participants may call or email to schedule an interview. Alternately,
research staff will follow-up, via phone or email, with eligible participants one week after the

40

 materials are sent to ensure participant receipt of materials and to schedule an interview.
The interview will be conducted over the phone, estimated to last approximately 30-45 minutes. The
interview will be audio-recorded with the participant’s permission. Interview questions will seek to
learn more about participants’ experience in thinking of and responding to questions on
discrimination, coping and help-seeking, and in assessing participant understanding of the survey
questions.
Within 72 hours of the interview, participants will be mailed or emailed a $30 gift card.

5. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for
them.
Inclusion: Participants in the present study are those who:
1. Reside in Illinois;
2. Identify as LGBTQ
3. Are 18 years or older; and
4. Have experienced violent victimization at any point in their lifetime.
These criteria are necessary to better understand the victimization and help-seeking experiences of
LGBTQ identified individuals in Illinois.
Given that the materials are written in English, participants will also be those who speak English.

41

 Exclusion: Excluded individuals are those not meeting the above criteria. These individuals are excluded
because the present study seeks to better understand the victimization and help-seeking experiences of
LGBTQ identified individuals in Illinois.

D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
6. Briefly describe the potential benefits of the project to subjects and/or to society. Note:
Social science research typically does not provide a direct benefit to the subjects.
Each participant will receive a $30 gift card. The study may benefit society by expanding knowledge of
LGBTQ identified individuals understanding of survey measures focused on discrimination, coping, and
help-seeking to better understand this population’s experiences following victimization.

7. Does this study involve any of the following?
Yes

No
X

Use of deception by researchers

X

Use of punishment by researchers

X

Use of drugs by subjects for study purposes

X

Covert and/or participant observation

X

Induction of mental and/or physical stress to subjects by researchers

X

Procedures which risk physical harm to the subject

X

Materials and behaviors commonly regarded as socially unacceptable

X

X

Procedures by researchers that might be regarded as an invasion of privacy to
subjects or cause a degree of discomfort
Possible/probable disclosure of information by subjects to researchers that may
be harmful to the subject (e.g., child abuse, criminal behavior, immigration
status)

a.) If you checked YES to any of the above procedures, explain the procedure in detail, as well
as provide the methods being used to control or minimize the danger to the subjects.
Participants will be asked to report if they have experienced a violent victimization at any point in
their lifetime, and will be asked to think about their coping and help-seeking behaviors following
victimization, as well as any discriminatory experiences they’ve had, which may be distressing.
Researchers will provide participants with a list of community resources, including referral
information for victim services and LGBTQ service providers they can contact if they experience
distress. At the start of each interview, participants will be reminded of their ability to stop
participation at any point, without affecting compensation or their relationship with ICJIA.

Minimal risk: A risk is minimal where the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the proposed research are not greater, in and of themselves, than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations or tests.
Greater than minimal risk: A risk is greater than minimal where the probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in the proposed research are greater than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations or tests.
High risk: A risk is high when a moderate-to-high probability of serious adverse effects might
occur as a result of participation in a research study.
Risks and benefits that would result even if the research weren’t undertaken should not be
considered.
11. Indicate the overall degree of the research’s physical risk to the subject, according to

F. CONFIDENTIALITY
16. Will any data be gathered through photographic, video or sound recording devices?
Yes

X

No

a.) If YES, how will the confidentiality of the materials produced by such devices be
protected?
Note: A separate line of the consent form for the subjects to agree to be video/audio taped or
photographed must be included.
Should participants consent to audio recording, the interview will be recorded using a handheld
recording device. Audio-recordings of interviews will be saved on secure computers and/or servers in
the Authority offices accessible only to the research staff on this project. Audio-recordings on the
recording devices will be erased within 48 hours of recording. Transcripts of the recordings will be
stored securely on the Authority computers and servers separate from the master list of study
participants and only accessible to the research staff on this project.
At the start of the interview, participants will be asked for their verbal consent to participate in the
interview. If a participant does not agree to participate, the interview will be terminated.

44

 Participants will also be asked if they agree to be audio-recorded. If an individual does not wish to be
audio-recorded, the participant can still participate, and researchers will instead only take handwritten
notes. The audio-recordings will be transcribed by research assistants associated with this project. Any
identifying information will be redacted during the transcription process. The transcriptions will be
maintained in a secure location separate from the master list of study participants. Only the
transcriptions and written notes will be analyzed.
Researchers will take notes during the interviews whether or not the interview is audio-recorded. No
identifying information will be recorded during the notetaking process. All notes will be stored in a
filing cabinet in a locked office at the Authority. Only ICJIA research staff will have access to these
materials.

b.) What will be done with the still photos, video, or audio recordings after the study has been
completed? Will this information be destroyed, kept xx number of years, used in publications,
etc? How does the investigator(s) define “completion” of the study?
Audio recordings will be transferred to secured computers accessible only to research staff and
deleted from the recording device within 48 hours of the interview. Interview transcriptions will be
maintained in computerized word processing files and stored securely on the Authority computers
and servers accessible only to research staff. The transcripts and notes will be maintained separately
from the recordings. Files will be stored for 3 years after the completion of the study. Completion of
the study occurs when a survey tool for use in assessing the victimization and help-seeking
experiences of LGBTQ identified individuals is developed. This data may be used in publications,
including peer-reviewed journals and reports on ICJIA’s website, and in presentations. Identifying
information will be redacted in interview transcripts and replaced with a pseudonym or nonidentifying descriptor in any publications or presentations.

17. Will names or individual identifiers of subjects be recorded? If YES, answer a through d
below.
Yes

X

No

a.) Where will the names or other individual identifiers be recorded (e.g., on test protocols,
on a separate list with code numbers, etc)?
Identifying information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses will be
stored in a master list in a password protected document on password-protected computers
accessible only to research staff. Each individual who contacts the study will be assigned a unique
code. Only research staff will have access to this master list that links a participant’s identifying
information to their unique code. This code will be used to track their participation in the study and
to distribute payment. The master list will be maintained separately from all other study materials.

b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point in
the data collection process.
Information about who has participated in our study will only be accessible to the research staff at
ICJIA. Records with identifiable information (i.e., master list of participants) will be password
protected files that will be stored on password protected computers accessible only to research staff.
In this master list, participant will be assigned a unique identifier; this code will be used on all study
materials and spreadsheets. Transcripts will be de-identified and labeled with the unique code.
Handwritten notes will be de-identified, labeled with a unique code, and stored in a file cabinet in a
locked office at ICJIA.

45

 c.) Would it be possible to conduct the proposed project without recording names or other
individual identifiers? Please explain why or why not.
Yes

No

X

Researchers need to record personally identifying information to send a community resource list to
ineligible study participants, and to send study materials, including the informed consent sheet and
community resource list, and payment to participants.

d.) Will access to names be under your exclusive control?
Yes

X

No

If NO, what will be done to protect the confidentiality of the subjects? Who would have access
to names or other individual identifiers? Describe the procedures for maintaining security of
paper files, automated files, and other records.
e.) Will names of subjects be included in any publication based on this study? If YES,
for what reason(s)?
Yes

No

X

18. Sometimes research findings are presented in a manner that permits knowledgeable
readers to infer the identity of a person used as a subject, even if names are omitted. Do you
expect to present findings that may possibly provide such clues? If YES, explain.
Yes

No

X

19. Will information be obtained pertaining to persons other than immediate subjects (e.g.,
their friends)? If YES, how will the confidentiality of such persons be protected?
Yes

X

No

Participants will be asked to think about their help-seeking experiencing following victimization, including
ways in which others may have responded to them. Participants will not be asked to provide any identifying
information for these individuals or agency representatives. Any identifying information that is voluntarily
offered by participants will be redacted in the interview transcript and not recorded during notetaking.
Audio-recordings will be erased within 48 hours of recording. Transcripts of the recordings will be stored
securely on the Authority computers and servers separate from the master list of study participants.

G. INFORMED CONSENT
20. Do you intend to obtain informed consent?
X

Verbal

Written

No consent needed

Waiver of consent
documentation

If NO CONSENT NEEDED or VERBAL, please answer a through c below.
a.) Why do you not intend to use written forms?

46

 The present research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures
for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. Requiring participants

to complete a written consent form and mail that form to ICJIA researchers would increase the
risk associated with participation.
b.) In what manner and to what extent would potential subjects be given advance information
about the procedure in which they are asked to participate? If using a contact letter, please
include it.
Consent forms will be sent in advance of the scheduled interview. Researchers will review the informed
consent information prior to staring the interview. Participants will be asked if they have any questions
about the consent form prior to beginning the interview. Participants will also be asked if they consent to
participate in the study before the start of the interview.

c.) In what manner would potential subjects be advised that their participation and continuation
in the project would be entirely voluntary? Please provide a copy of the text to be used.
The consent form provided to potential participants in advance of the scheduled interview will inform
individuals that their participation and continuation in the project is voluntary. Additionally, at the
beginning of our research protocol, the interviewer will restate the following: “Participation in this
study is voluntary; You may request that the recording stop, choose to not answer a question, or end the
interview at any time.”

21. If receiving verbal or written consent, please attach a copy of the script or the consent
form that you will use.
Attached

X

Unable to provide

Not applicable

a.) If you are unable to provide the script or consent form, please explain why
22. Please give a detailed description of the process that will be used to obtain consent and
answer all applicable questions:
a.) Who will obtain consent? Research staff

b.) How will consent be obtained? Verbally before the start of the interview
c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Before the start of the interview, researchers will review the informed consent information prior to
staring the interview and ask participants if they have any questions about the consent form. After
any questions are answered, the interviewer will ask if the participant consents to the interview and to
be audio-recorded.

d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent?
Researchers will ask participants if they have any questions about the consent form. The consent
forms will also provide contact information for the principal investigator, the Authority’s IRB
secretary to request further information about the studies, their rights as a research participant, and
the initiative.

e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?

47

 All Authority research staff are certified in the National Institutes of Health Office of Extramural
Research’s web-based training course “Protecting Human Research Participants.”

23. Will/is the consent form be translated for non-English speaking participants?
Yes

No

X

a.) If NO, please explain why.
It is expected that all of the individuals being surveyed will be English speaking.

b.) If YES, please provide an explanation of who will/did translate the forms and their
qualifications.
24. Does the consent form you have attached fully comply with ICJIA instructions for consent forms

Victim of Crime Act (VOCA)

Why am I being asked?
You are being asked to be a subject in a research study to examine how well survey questions
that ask about discrimination, coping, and help-seeking measures capture the experiences of
individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer/questioning (LGBTQ)
who have been the victim of a crime. You have been asked to participate in this study because
you have been the victim of a crime and have identified as LGBTQ.
Your participation in this research is voluntary. Your decision whether to participate will not
affect your current or future dealings with the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
(ICJIA). If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without affecting
that relationship.
Approximately 50 subjects may be involved in this research at ICJIA.
What is the purpose of this research?
Researchers are trying to create a survey that accurately captures the victimization and helpseeking experiences of LGBTQ identified individuals in Illinois. Specifically, researchers are
trying to see how well certain survey questions that ask about discrimination, coping, and helpseeking capture the experiences of LGBTQ identified individuals.

53

 What procedures are involved?
If you agree to participate, a researcher will ask you to participate in a phone interview. The
interview will be audio-recorded with your permission. You can choose not to be audiorecorded. If you choose not to be audio-recorded we will simply document your responses using
paper and pencil. You will be asked questions about your victimization experience(s). In
addition, you may be asked questions about one of the following experiences: instances of
discrimination, how you have dealt with your victimization, or experiences you had seeking help
from others. You will also be asked some basic demographic information.
What are the potential risks and discomforts?
There may be risks from the study that are not known at this time. To the best of our knowledge,
the things you will be doing have no more risk of harm than you would experience in everyday
life.
Some questions may make you uncomfortable. Please remember, it is up to you to decide
whether to answer any of the questions.
Will I be told about new information that may affect my decision to participate?
During the course of the study, you will be informed of any significant new research information
(either good or bad), such as changes in the risks or benefits resulting from participation in the
research or new alternatives to participation, that might cause you to change your mind about
continuing in the research. If new information is provided to you, your consent to continue
participating in this research may be re-obtained.
Are there benefits to taking part in the research?
You will be offered a $30 gift card for being in this study. You will receive no other direct
benefit from participation in the research. Indirect benefits would include a better understanding
of how to capture the experiences of LGBTQ identified individuals following victimization. This
information could be used to inform future research that may have important policy implications
for how the state can work to improve victim services for LGBTQ identified individuals.
What other options are there?
You have the option to not participate in this study. Even if you initially choose to participate
you may change your decision at any time without penalty. You may also not answer a
question at any time. This will not affect the compensation you receive for participating in the
study.
You will be asked to be audio-recorded. You may choose to participate in an interview but not be
audio-recorded. If you choose not to be audio-recorded, the information will be collected using
pencil and paper.

54

 What about privacy and confidentiality?
The people who will know that you are a research subject are members of the research team.
If you agree, interviews will be audio-recorded and saved on secure computers and/or servers in
the Authority offices. Audio-recordings on the recording devices will be erased within 48 hours
of recording. Interview transcriptions in computerized word processing files will be stored
securely on the Authority’s computers and servers. Any information that might identify you will
be removed from the interview transcripts. Only the researchers will have access to the audiorecording, transcripts, and notes.
You may choose to participate in the study even if you do not want to be audio-recorded. In this
case, we will simply take notes using pencil and paper. These notes will be later typed and stored
securely on the Authority’s computers and servers. These notes will not contain any information
that might identify you.
The information collected in the study may be used to write a report. No potentially identifying
information that can be attributed directly to you will be included in the report or discussed with
others.
What are the costs for participating in this research?
There are no costs to you for participating in this research.
Will I be reimbursed for any of my expenses or paid for my participation in this research?
You will be offered a $30 gift card for being in this study.
Can I withdraw or be removed from the study?
If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participation
at any time. This will not affect the compensation you receive for participating in the study.
Who should I contact if I have questions?
If you have any questions regarding this project you may contact Amanda L. Vasquez or Dr.
Jaclyn Kolnik at 312-793-8550 or CJA.VictimStudies@illinois.gov

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the study
and the procedures subjects will undergo.
PERC is a new program to help formerly incarcerated men and women start their own
businesses. The program includes classroom training on business fundamentals and
mentoring and coaching to develop a business plan. Post-release classroom training will begin
at five south and west side Chicago locations in early 2018. Graduates of the program will be
eligible to apply for special loans to help them start a business.
The purpose of the study is to identify and share effective program components that contribute
to successful participant outcomes. These components will be identified through the collection
and analysis of administrative program information about each training organization and the
participants. This information will help to measure specific outcomes for participants such as
71

 reductions in recidivism, the creation of their own business, obtainment of a loan, and/or
employment outcomes after the training takes place. This information will also help educate
policy makers about the potential benefit of offering formerly incarcerated men and women
intensive business training and planning followed by small loans to start their own business.
Researchers will employ a randomized control trial design. Research will track administrative
data on subjects who are applicants to the PERC program and who consent to participation in
the study.

B. PROCEDURES
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.
Include the following information:
Component 1: Client treatment records (n=375)

Benefits to PERC include:
 A comprehensive program evaluation that identifies effective practices and areas in
need of improvement.
 Outcome information that informs potential funders and policy makers about the
efficacy of the program model and its implementation.
Benefits to the field include:
 Provide information on effective critical program components of a business program for
73

below.
Yes

X

No

a.) Where will the names or other individual identifiers be recorded (e.g., on test protocols,
on a separate list with code numbers, etc.)?
The Illinois Department of Corrections will provide the applications of those eligible for
PERC who have consented to the study. The applications will contain individual identifiers
including names, dates of birth, DOC number, and social security number. A master list of
all individuals who have consented to the study will be created. That master list will contain
the names, dates of birth, DOC number, and social security number along with a unique
study ID number assigned by the research staff. These data contained in the master file
will be used to match participants to their corresponding Illinois criminal history arrest
records, IDOC incarceration records, and Illinois Department of Employment Security
employment records. Once matching is complete, a de-identified working file will be
constructed from this master file for all subsequent analysis purposes. The unique study ID
will be the linking variable between the master list and the de-identified dataset.

76

 b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point in
the data collection process.
Individual identifiers of the sample (treatment and control group) are needed to link to
administrative data. Once the data have been linked, the data will be stripped of the
identifiers. Only the unique study ID number will remain. Only the final, de-identified
dataset will be used to analyze the data.
The master list containing the personally identifying information and study ID will be
maintained on secure, password protected servers and computers accessible only to the
research staff. The final de-identified dataset will also be kept on secure, password
protected servers and computers accessible only to the research staff separate from the
master list.

c.) Would it be possible to conduct the proposed project without recording names or other
individual identifiers? Please explain why or why not.
Yes

No

X

Researchers need to link pre- and post-tests and administrative data in order to answer its
research questions.

d.) Will access to names be under your exclusive control?
Yes

X

No

If NO, what will be done to protect the confidentiality of the subjects? Who would have access
to names or other individual identifiers? Describe the procedures for maintaining security of
paper files, automated files, and other records.
e.) Will names of subjects be included in any publication based on this study? If YES, for what
reason(s)?
Yes

22. Please give a detailed description of the process that will be used to obtain consent and
answer all applicable questions:
a.) Who will obtain consent? ICJIA researchers will provide consent forms to staff of Illinois
Department of Corrections (IDOC) and Safer Foundation, which operates several
correctional facilities. IDOC staff will administer and collect consent forms at eight
Correctional Centers (CC): Hill CC, Lawrence CC, Robinson CC, Sheridan CC,
Kewanee CC, Pinckneyville CC, Logan CC, and Big Muddy CC. The Safer Foundation
staff will administer and collect consent forms at two of their Adult Transition Centers
(ATC) in Chicago: ATC-North Lawndale, and ATC-Crossroads.
If a research subject has been released from one of the above facilities and is eligible to
be in the research study, researchers will attempt to work with their parole officer to
administer a consent form to be in each study.

b.) How will consent be obtained?
Researchers will offer a brief script for IDOC and Safer staff administering the consent
forms. A paper form will be used to obtain consent for participation in the study.

c.) How often will consent be obtained (e.g., longitudinal or long-term field studies)?
Consent will be obtained once after completing an application and meeting eligibility
requirements.

d.) How will you verify the subject fully understands the consent? The consent forms are
written in a 9th grade or lower reading level. The consent forms will provide contact
information for the principal investigator, the Authority’s attorney/IRB secretary to
request further information about the studies, their rights as a research participant, and
the initiative.

e.) How will your investigators be trained to use the informed consent process?
IDOC and Safer staff are experienced in obtaining consent for participation in research
and other programming. The hard copies of the consent forms will be mailed to ICJIA
78

 researchers. IDOC and Safer will not be involved in the random selection of individuals
into the treatment or control group.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. PROJECT SUMMARY 
1. Please provide a brief summary (3 – 5 sentences), in lay terms, of the purpose of the
study and the procedures subjects will undergo.
The purpose of this study is to gather community input as part of an evaluation of a
community-based violence prevention program. The information will also be used to inform
the development of the bystander intervention/gatekeeper training program.
The program will be implemented in up to four communities in Illinois. Researchers will conduct
focus groups with community leaders and members about their perceptions of, and attitudes
towards targeted violence prevention programs and more specifically about their perceptions
about the utility of bystander training programs as it relates to reducing ideologically inspired
violence. Junaid Afeef--the program director for the bystander training program--will contact
community leaders from each of the respective sites and provide them with a script and
information sheet to recruit community members to participate in the focus groups. Each
community will have up to 6 focus groups, each with up to 8 community members. It is
anticipated that each focus group will take about 1-2 hours.

2

86

 B. PROCEDURES 
2. Describe the procedures involving human subjects and list the steps you will take.
Include the following information:
a.) Time involvement of subjects:

Approximately 1-2 hours per focus group.
b.) Location(s) the study will be conducted with subjects, including a description, if
applicable:
Each focus group will occur in the locale of the sites that have agreed to participate in
the training. The locations will be chosen by the community leaders, and will be in a
setting that provides privacy.
c.) Amount of payment to subject, if any (consent form must note plan for payment if they
withdraw voluntarily):
No payment will be offered.
d.) What subjects will experience or do:
Community members will be asked to participate in a focus group. During the focus
group, participants will be asked questions about community concerns and their
perceptions of bystander intervention/gatekeeper program elements.

C. EQUITABLE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS

 5. Identify the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of subjects and provide a clear rationale for
them.
Prior to the focus groups, Junaid Afeef, the ICJIA-TVPP director, will contact identified
community leaders in each of the pilot communities and provide them a recruitment script as
well as an information sheet containing the location, date, time, and purpose of the focus groups
to members in their community (see Community Leader Script; DHS-CVE Community Focus
Group Flyer). Community leaders will recruit individuals from their respective communities to
participate in the focus group. Only individuals 18 years and older will be recruited.
Only adult members of the community will be recruited as the purpose of the focus groups is to
gain insight from these implementation sites as to how the program can best be designed and
implemented and to document information that will inform the overall evaluation of the
program.

D. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
6. Briefly describe the potential benefits of the project to subjects and/or to society. Note:
Social science research typically does not provide a direct benefit to the subjects.
There are no direct benefits to the subjects. The benefit for society is to help better inform
community-based CVE/TVP programs and efforts. The information and feedback received
from participants may inform the work that ICJIA-TVPP does in the future and will be used to
document the program’s implementation (e.g., process evaluation).

 research staff associated with this project. The audio recording will be deleted from the
recording device after successful transfer to the secure server. The recording will be stored
for 3 years, per federal regulation (45 CFR 46), at which point the audio recordings will be
destroyed.
The focus group audio recording will be transcribed using a professional transcription
service that is NIH and CITI trained and certified in Protecting Human Subject Research
Participants. No identifying information will be included in the recording transcription. The
transcripts will be maintained separately from the audio recordings and consent sheets in a
password protected folder on a secure server accessible only to research staff on this project.
b.) What will be done with the still photos, video, or audio recordings after the study has
been completed? Will this information be destroyed, kept xx number of years, used in
publications, etc? How does the investigator(s) define “completion” of the study?
The audio recording will be wiped clear from the recording device after transfer to the
computer. The recording will be stored for 3 years, per federal regulation (45 CFR 46), at
which point the audio recordings will be destroyed. The grant study period is from August 1,
2017 through July 31, 2019. Completion of the study is determined by the end of the grant
period; however, production of deliverables may extend past July 31, 2019. These
deliverables include a formal report for ICJIA-TVPP director, Mr. Afeef, as well as a report
for the ICJIA website.

Prior to the focus group starting, participants will be asked not to share personally
identifying information. However, it is possible during the course of the focus groups that
such information is shared. In such cases, the information will be removed from all
recording transcripts during the transcription process. Only the transcripts will be used
during analysis. No identifying information will be recorded by researchers taking notes
during the focus groups.
b.) Describe project procedures for maintaining the security of these records at every point
in the data collection process.
Once the focus group is complete, the researcher will transfer the audio recordings from the
recording device to a password protected folder on a secure server accessible only to
research staff associated with this project. The audio recording will be deleted from the
recording device after successful transfer to the secure server. The recording will be stored
for 3 years, per federal regulation (45 CFR 46), at which point the audio recordings will be

If NO, what will be done to protect the confidentiality of the subjects? Who would have
access to names or other individual identifiers? Describe the procedures for maintaining
security of paper files, automated files, and other records.
Other focus group participants will know who attended the focus groups and will know of
any personally identifying information shared during the course of the focus groups. Prior to
the focus group starting, participants will be asked not to share personally identifying
information and the information discussed during the focus groups. Researchers will inform
the other participants that although we will do everything we can to protect their identity
and the information shared, we are unable to provide full protection given the presence of
other individuals in the focus groups.
Researchers will do everything in their control not to share identifying information,
including maintaining the audio recordings in a password protected folder on a secure server
accessible only to research staff associated with this project, deleting the recording device
after successful transfer to the secure server, using a transcription service that is certified in
human subjects protections, removing all potentially identifying information during
transcription, ensuring no identifying information is recorded when taking notes during the
focus groups, and ensuring that audio records, transcripts and notes, and consent forms are

 Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Script for Focus Group Participant Recruitment – Initial Contact
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) is working in partnership with
Illinois communities on a project that seeks to develop a training program that helps community
members intervene before crime or violence occurs. The program will focus on helping
community members be able to recognize behaviors or actions that might indicate a concern
worth paying attention to and know how to respond.
Researchers will be gathering community input by conducting six focus groups—small group
discussions—with various community members in [Community Name]. Each group will include
up to eight people. The information gathered during the focus groups will be used to develop and
evaluate the training program.
The focus groups are completely voluntary and the discussion will be confidential. Here
[Included] is a flyer with more detailed information about a focus group in your community,
including the location and date/time. Please contact Megan Alderden, PhD at
Megan.Alderden@illinois.gov or (312) 793-8550 if you have questions about the focus groups.

What is the purpose of this research?
Researchers at the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) are gathering community
input on a project that seeks to develop a training program that helps community members intervene
before crime or violence occurs. The program will focus on helping community members be able to
recognize behaviors or actions that might indicate a concern and know how to respond. The
information gathered will be used to develop the training program. The information will also be used
as part of a larger evaluation of the bystander training program.
Why am I being asked?
You are being asked to participate in this focus group because you have been identified as a
community member of [COMMUNITY NAME]. Approximately 8 other community members may
be involved in this focus group.
What am I being asked to do?
You are being asked to participate in a focus group with other members of your community. The
focus group will last about 1 ½ to 2 hours. During the focus group researchers will ask questions
about:
 Your views about violence and safety in your community.
 Your opinions about the program’s design and content.
 Concerns you may have about the program.
The focus group will be audio-taped. Your participation in the focus group is voluntary. Your
decision to participate does not require you to attend the training program being developed. Your
decision whether to participate will not affect your current or future relations with the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority. You may decide not to answer any of the questions asked. If
you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any point in time.
What are the potential risks and discomforts to participating?
To the best of our knowledge, participating in the focus group will have no more risk for harm than
you would experience in everyday life. There may be some questions that make you feel

97

 uncomfortable. Please remember that participation is completely voluntary and you may choose to
not answer any question or participate at any time without penalty.
Will I be told about new information that may affect my decision to participate?
During the course of our research, you will be informed of any significant new research information
(either good or bad), such as changes in the risks or benefits resulting from participation in the focus
group or new alternatives to participation, that might cause you to change your mind about
participating. If new information is provided to you, your consent to continue participating in this
research may be re-obtained.
Are there benefits to taking part in the research?
You will not receive any direct benefits; however, information gathered from the focus groups will
be used to inform the development of training program that aims to intervene before crime or
violence occurs. This will provide benefit to the communities receiving the training. The information
will also be used as part of a larger evaluation of the training program that will benefit future
programs.
What other options are there?
You have the option to not participate in this study.
What about privacy and confidentiality?
We will be audio recording the focus group. Researchers will do everything we can to protect your
identity. This includes the following.







Only the researchers working on this project will have access to the signed consent forms,
interviewer notes, audio recording, and audio transcript.
All interview notes and transcripts will be recorded in a manner that protects your identity.
This includes ensuring that any names or other identifying information is removed.
The interview notes, recordings, and transcripts will electronically stored on passwordprotected computers and servers that only the researchers have access to. The interviewer
notes and transcripts will be maintained separately from the audio recordings and signed
consent forms.
No information will be included that would reveal your identity when the results of the
research are published, discussed, or presented to persons outside the research team. This
includes sharing specific, identifying information to those developing the program.

 Focus Group Questions
Introductory Script
The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) is working in partnership with
communities in Illinois on a project that seeks to develop a training program that helps
community members intervene before crime or violence occurs. The program will focus on
helping community members be able to recognize behaviors or actions might indicate a concern
worth paying attention to and know how to respond.
My name is [name], and I am a researcher with that agency. This is [other researcher name],
[she/he] is also a researcher on this project and will be helping me by taking notes. Our role is to
assist project staff by hosting several focus groups—which are small group discussions guided
by trained researchers—with folks like you about this project. Researchers assist program staff
by engaging in lots of different activities, including talking with stakeholders like you. As a
researcher, I am required to inform you of your rights, including the confidential nature of this
discussion, and provide you with information to help you decide whether you would like to
participate in this discussion. That information is on this sheet, which you can take home with
you.
[Full Review of Informed Consent]
Does anyone have any questions about the information just provided?
 If yes: [respond to questions].
 If no: Great. I ask that you sign the consent form if you are willing to participate in this
discussion.
Let’s get started. We do ask that you try not to share personally identifying information, such as
your name, or the names of others. If you forget, don’t worry. We will make sure any references
to names or other information that could be identifying are removed from our notes or
transcripts.
If you don’t mind, I thought we could start by talking a little bit about your role within or
relationship to [name] community.
Community Concerns
Now I would like to talk a little bit about things you are concerned about in your community as it
relates to community members’ health and well-being.


Thinking about the health and well-being of members of your community, what do you feel
are the primary issues/concerns?
o What about specifically for youth and young adults in your community?



What would you say are some of the primary safety concerns facing your community?
o Is violence a concern?
o What about specifically for youth and young adults?
Probe:
 School violence

100

 

 Mass shootings
 What about hate crimes?
Where might ideologically inspired violence fall on your list? [By ideologically inspired
violence, I mean violence that is encouraged, condoned, or engaged in for the purpose of
furthering a particular political, social, economic, religious, or ideological perspective.
This includes hate crimes.]

Bystander/Gatekeeper Program Elements
As mentioned, the primary purpose of this group’s discussion is about a project our agency is
engaged in that seeks to develop a workshop for community members that helps them know
what behaviors or actions might indicate a concern worth paying attention to, what response
options might exist, and encouraging them to take action. You may be aware of similar programs
of like this. They are sometimes referred to as bystander intervention or gatekeeper programs.
They have been successfully used in the area of bullying intervention and suicide. These types of
programs have been shown to increase community members’ knowledge of concerning
behaviors worth noting and prepare them to intervene successfully.
As noted, one aspect of bystander intervention and gatekeeper programs is providing individuals
with information about behaviors that may be concerning and are worth paying attention to. We
would like to use a similar approach.


How receptive do you feel community members would be if the intervention related
specifically to preventing ideologically inspired violence? As you may recall, by
ideologically inspired violence we mean: violence that is encouraged, condoned, or engaged
in for the purpose of furthering a particular political, social, economic, religious, or
ideological perspective. This includes hate crimes.
 What concerns might they have about a program like this?
 What might be the best approach to a program like this?



If we developed a workshop that uses a bystander intervention or gatekeeper approach, who
might be best positioned to deliver that training? (Probe: community organization,
community leaders, local professionals, community members?)

As mentioned, one aspect of bystander intervention and gatekeeper training is preparing
individuals to take some type of action if they see something of concern. I would like to talk
about specific types of information that we could provide to participants. For each piece of
information I would like you to think about how comfortable you or others might feel using that
information to take some sort of action.
Social Isolation
Sometimes people might notice that someone is socially isolated—or not engaged with others.


How comfortable would you be talking with someone you casually know if he or she
appeared socially isolated?



How comfortable would you be encouraging this person to connect with a local resource?

Who might you be most comfortable encouraging them to connect with?
Does this resource—the one you feel most comfortable using—exist in your community?
What if that person was a family member or relative? (Same resource?)
What about a close friend? (Same resource?)



Another option for might be to refer someone you are concerned about to a specially trained
individual or group who would contact that person to assess the situation and help create a
plan to support them. That means sharing information about that person with someone else.

of people living in the community.


If a new resource was developed specifically to assist communities that could be a referral
resource for individuals whose behaviors or actions might indicate a concern worth paying
attention to, what would you need to know about this resource in order to feel comfortable
contacting them?

Sometimes individuals who notice something concerning might not take action because they are
fearful of getting others in trouble or hurting them in some way. They may fear having law
enforcement become involved.
 What concerns might you have?
 What might ease those concerns?
Is there anything else that we didn’t discuss that you feel is important?

Changes

No changes

1.) Please explain in detail what changes you plan to make to the study design or protocol
(such as changes to instruments used, data collection, recruitment procedures, or
compensation).

through the mail. However, it was learned that most providers prefer to securely send participant
data through encrypted emails using a secure file transfer.

109

 2.) Please explain in detail the rationale for the above change(s). What prompted the
investigators to propose the amendment? Is the amendment the result of an
adverse/negative event?
The proposed change is to add to the IRB application that data will be shared via secure transfer.
This is to accommodate the preference of treatment providers. Data will still be kept secure. This
is not due to an adverse/negative event.

3.) Does this amendment alter, in any way, the assessment of potential risks described in your
approved protocol?
Yes

X

No

4.) If you answered yes to question 3, please explain in detail how this alters the assessment of
potential risk and whether the benefits of the study outweigh the risks.
