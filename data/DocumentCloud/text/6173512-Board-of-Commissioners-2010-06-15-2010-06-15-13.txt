RECOMMENDATION
It is recommended that the Board of Commissioners ratifies the acceptance of a grant award from the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) HOPE VI Revitalization
Program for the Stateway Gardens/ Park Boulevard Phase II redevelopment in the amount of
$20,000,000.00. In association with the ratification of the grant acceptance, it is further recommended
that the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to increase the
FY 2010 comprehensive budget by the same amount as the grant, and to execute any and all
documentation necessary to implement or undertake activities necessary to administer the grant in
compliance with applicable laws, regulations or other procedures.
FUNDING
N/A
EXPLANATION
n September 23, 2008, the CHA received official written notice of an award of $20,000,000.00 from
HUD through the HOPE VI Revitalization Program. The CHA received the final and amended HOPE VI
grant agreement for execution on May 12, 2010. This grant was competitively awarded to fund the second
phase of the Park Boulevard’s mixed-income development at the former Stateway Gardens site. With the
addition of this HOPE VI grant funding, capital development funds currently committed for the Stateway
revitalization effort can now be reallocated to other currently planned but unfunded mixed-income
revitalization projects.
Stateway/Park Boulevard’s Phase II is in progress and will produce 499 rental and for-sale units. It will
be implemented in four sub-phases with development occurring both on- and off-site, Phase 2A is
targeted to close by the end of 2010. Of the 1,300 total units originally proposed in the Stateway’s master
redevelopment plan 239 units have been completed and the first eighty-one (81) public housing families
(mostly former Stateway residents) have returned home and prosper in the new Park Boulevard
community. Phase 1A delivered a total of 80 units off-site in 2005 and Phase 1B delivered a total of 159
units in 2008.
Stateway Associates, LLC is the master developer for the Stateway redevelopment project and has served
in this capacity since the inception of the project.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to ratify the acceptance of the HUD grant
award for the Stateway Gardens/Park Boulevard Phase II Development in the amount of $20,000,000.00,
and to authorize the CEO or his designee to increase the FY2010 comprehensive budget and effectuate
the grant and its related activities through execution of any and all documents necessary to implement the
foregoing.
