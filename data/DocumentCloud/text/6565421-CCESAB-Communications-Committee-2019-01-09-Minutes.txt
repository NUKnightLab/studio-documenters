9. ANNOUNCEMENTS / OTHER BUSINESS
• Chief from Fairview Park said that they are having radio reception problems and the
Lieutenant from Bay Village said that the North-West area is a major problem. He had
radios from Cleveland and tested it in the known areas without problems.
• Garwood asked for the information to be sent to him so he can go back and see that it is
fixed.
• Brad mentioned that work with the MetroParks showed radio issues were addressed with
equipment changes but there are still reception issues. Trying to nail down the problem is
not easy because many different problems are happening with different agencies. Brad
suggested that there may be a cellular interference issue that is hard to discover.
