A RESOLUTION providing for the approval of the 2010 Preliminary Budget
of the Cook County Health & Hospitals System
WHEREAS, on June 3, 2008, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved an Ordinance
establishing the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“Enabling Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance provides the following with regard to the County
Board’s approval of the System’s Preliminary Budget:
a. That the System Board shall recommend and submit a Preliminary Budget for the System to the
President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and the County Board, for approval by
the County Board, not later than forty-five (45) days prior to the first date for submission of
budget requests by the County’s Budget Director; and
b. That the County Board shall approve or reject each Preliminary Budget within forty-five (45)
days of submission to the County Board or such Preliminary Budget is deemed approved; and
c. That the Preliminary Budget shall be included in the President’s Executive Budget
Recommendation; and
WHEREAS, Section 38-83 of the Enabling Ordinance further provides that after approval of each
Annual Appropriation Ordinance, the System Board has the authority to make intra-fund transfers within

items set forth in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, in previous years, the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill contained
language providing that all funds appropriated to any account or sub-account within Category 100
(Personal Services) shall remain fixed and restricted to that category for which they were originally
appropriated, and shall not be subject to transfer to any impersonal account, or to any line item other than
those within the 100 Series, as listed in the Chart of Accounts; and
WHEREAS, consistent with the spirit and intent of the powers and authority granted to the System Board
by the County Board in the Enabling Ordinance, the System wishes to adopt an enterprise fund model
which would allow the System Board through the System’s Chief Executive Officer to have authority
(within the confines of the total budget appropriation adopted by the County Board) over the expenditure
of funds allocated to the System by the County Board, notwithstanding any limitations on funds
appropriated to the 100 accounts in the County’s Resolution and Annual Appropriation Bill; and
WHEREAS, both the System Board (on July 16, 2009) and the County Board (on July 21, 2009)

equipment through an operating lease as opposed to acquisition through financing by a bond issuance by
the County; and
WHEREAS, the System wishes to acquire capital equipment for 2010 through this Master Lease
Agreement, and inasmuch as this action may occur prior to the issuance of a bond by the County, the
System wishes to be exempt from any temporary “budget holds” that might occur at the County level
pending discussion and approval of bond issuance for certain purchases of capital equipment; and
WHEREAS, the System receives funds from various granting agencies which funds are already
accounted for in the System’s proposed Preliminary Budget and the System wishes to have authority to
approve and receive these grant funds without having to return to the County Board for such approval;

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #54
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 26, 2009 from
DAVID ORR, Cook County Clerk
by
CLEM BALANOFF, Deputy Clerk
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $996,700.00 from Account
524-240 Printing and Publishing to Account 524-260, Professional and Managerial Services for Election
Judge Management System (EJMS). (See related Item #52).
Reason:

An RFP was issued on April 21, 2009 for an Election Judge Management System for the
County Clerk’s Election Department. After oral presentations, proof-of-concept sessions and
negotiations with four different respondents, the Clerk’s Evaluation Committee has
recommended Catalyst Consulting Group, Inc. for this contract and is requesting
authorization to proceed on the September 16, 2009 Board Agenda. Since there is a surplus
in the 524-240 Printing and Publishing account, the Clerk is requesting to transfer funds to
the 524-260 Professional and Managerial Services account in order to encumber the FY09
surplus funds for the entire contract.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS continued
ITEM #54 cont’d
1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent in mid-August that RFP evaluations and funding availability would allow this
project to proceed in FY 2009. This will allow for lead time needed to have the system in place for
testing during the February 2010 primary. The unencumbered balance in the account on August 17,
2009 was $1,918,440, unchanged from the balance as of July 13, 2009.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The surplus funds in the 524-240 printing account are due to anticipated re-use of previously
printed election materials. Due to the recent completion of the post-election cleanout of the Voting
Supply Carriers (VSCs) the Election Department now has an updated inventory of re-usable printed
materials.
Additionally, as customers become more and more reliant on internet access to information,
printing requirements have been reduced as the Clerk’s office increasingly uses email to
communicate with its 12,000 election judges and others.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 524-240.
There are no other obligations for printing that will be deferred, delayed or cancelled as a result of
this transfer.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The 2009 account is funded to meet the printing requirements of the February 2010 gubernatorial
primary. Some printed materials have been updated in 2009 to provide for re-use. These materials
and other unused printed election materials from the two previous elections in 2009 exceed
expectations and will be re-used for the February 2010 election.
In addition, though internet access to election information has reduced printing costs, the data is
too new to quantify and therefore, the budget is based on both historical data and contingencies
for emergency printings or extra elections.

requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $63,600.00 from the
Department of Fiscal Administration and Support Services Account 211-449, Operation, Maintenance
and Repair Not Otherwise Classified to the Court Services Division Account 230-449, Operation,

Reason:

The Court Services Division anticipated and budgeted an amount of $190,000.00 for fiscal
year 2009 which was for the maintenance contract and registration fee for courtroom x-ray

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 230-449 would require additional funds on July 7, 2009, when the
purchase order was issued. The balance on this date was $163,411.00 and thirty days prior was also
$163,411.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts

This account has a surplus due to the budget preparation in the fall of 2008, we did not have a firm
amount for the new Motorola maintenance contract. We anticipated the amount of the contract to
be $2,100,000.00 per year, but the actual cost was $1,651,000.00. This has resulted in a surplus for
this account.

Increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$ 79,899.70
35,000.00
$114,899.70

The requested increase of funds would allow Vehicle Services to continue purchasing
automotive parts from this vendor that are used for “in house” repairs of Sheriff's
Office vehicles. The aging condition of the Sheriff's Office fleet has caused a significant
increase in repairs. By buying vehicle parts "wholesale" from Tryad Automotive and doing
many repairs at our facility, the Sheriff's Office is saving Cook County a significant amount
of money. The expiration date of the current contract is March 10, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $35,000.00 (211-444 Account).
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.
