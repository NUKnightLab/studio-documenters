Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates
Dr. Krishna Das, System Chief Quality Officer, presented the following report.
Dr. Das provided an update on The Joint Commission’s survey of the Ambulatory and Community Health
Network of Cook County (ACHN) that was performed in March. Plans for improvement were submitted to
The Joint Commission; they have reviewed and accepted those, and have given ACHN a full accreditation
for the next three years.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
A. Regulatory and Accreditation Updates (continued)
Dr. Das provided an update on the United States Department of Justice’s (DOJ) evaluation of Cermak
Health Services of Cook County (Cermak). Under the Agreed Order, biannual evaluations are performed
by DOJ surveyors; in May, six surveyors were present for a full week as part of their biannual visit. The
surveyors looked at every aspect of Cermak including operations, nursing, medical, physical plant, etc.
There are thirty-one different areas in the DOJ Agreed Order. Cermak was found to be in substantial or
partial compliance in all of them; it was not found to be non-compliant in any of the areas. The major areas
mentioned staffing issues; leadership updated the surveyors on the staffing plans, and the surveyors found
this acceptable. There were issues relating to access to care that were linked to the staffing that was felt by
the surveyors to be a priority to address. There were issues relating to space and space utilization; those
corrective actions are underway. Additionally, their review of the policies found that there is a need to
update the policies – the policies are essentially okay, they just need some revision and updating. Together
with the policies, it was recommended to also institute disease management plans for some of the
commonly seen diagnoses; actions are definitely underway to address that matter. The surveyors were
extremely positive about the System’s support at Cermak – they felt that was a positive direction. They
were happy that a permanent Medical Director had been named, and they felt that considerable progress had
been made in a couple of different areas, including mental health.

B. Publicly Reported Ratings
There was nothing to report on this matter at this time.

C. Introduction of proposed Patient Safety Plan – Stroger Hospital (Attachment #1)
Dr. Das provided an overview of the Introduction of the proposed Patient Safety Plan for Stroger Hospital,
which included information on the following topics: Purpose and Goal of the Plan; Current Regulatory
Environment; Approach; Objectives, Goals and Measurement Tools; Analysis and Reporting of Events; and
Evolution to a Safety Culture. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
Dr. Das stated that this is an introduction to presenting the first formal patient safety plan. In the past, the
administration has presented a quality assessment performance improvement plan, which is a regulatory
requirement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); patient safety had been included
as part of that plan. Presenting a separate patient safety plan will be beneficial to highlight the patient safety
issues, as well as help focus thinking about patient safety issues. She noted that, when the administration
moves forward with a new quality assessment plan, the patient safety plan will be an appendix to it. The
administration is going through the process of reviewing the draft plan with the medical staff and internal
quality committees; once the final plan is ready, it will be presented to the Board for approval.
Director Lerner inquired whether America’s Essential Hospitals puts out anything like a benchmark
dashboard for safety net institutions. Dr. Das responded affirmatively; she noted that the System is engaged
in a collaborative with them. There is a hospital engagement network to improve patient safety, called
Partnership for Patients; this is a CMS-funded initiative to improve patient safety throughout the institution.
The System submits its data to them, and they benchmark it against other safety net hospitals.

Report from System Chief Quality Officer
C. Introduction of proposed Patient Safety Plan – Stroger Hospital (continued)
In response to a question whether the System is a member/participant in either The Advisory Board or
University Healthsystem Consortium (UHC) to access benchmarking tools and analytics, Dr. Das stated that
the System has access to submit data to UHC; it does not have access to the full dashboard that they
provide, but they have access to a subset of that dashboard. Staff is in the process of finalizing the setup of
that to get the data to UHC. She noted that UHC is not going to benchmark the System against the entire
UHC group, but will benchmark against the America’s Essential Hospitals group. Dr. Shannon provided
additional information. He stated that, later in her presentation, Dr. Das will be providing information about
an event reporting system that was recently put in place – that is a UHC product. However, the System is
not a member of UHC’s entire suite of services; similarly, the System does not currently have a membership
with The Advisory Board for that purpose. It has engaged The Advisory Board for some organizational
development with physician leadership, but has not bought into the entire suite of services. Going forward,
this is a subject that will need to be strategically considered.
The Committee discussed staff training and education, in relation to reporting of events. Dr. Das stated that
the administration has done some education of staff, but it needs to penetrate further into the organization.
A lot of it has been addressed towards management staff, because it is really their behavior that will drive
the reporting. The System needs to get to a critical mass in training; there needs to be enough people
speaking the same language for it to become a true cultural shift. There is a training package that is used in
the Leadership Development Program and with the medical staff. Training has taken place with basically
all of the medical departments and residency programs, and this is standard training for all new interns
coming into the System. Additionally, there have been discussions regarding expanding this training and
education to all employees as they come into the organization.
The Committee briefly discussed the subject of CountyCare and quality and patient safety dashboards. Dr.
Das stated that the administration has had extremely preliminary discussions on the subject and just
received some guidance from the State about the Managed Care quality indicators; they are starting to work
to address that subject.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Reports from the Medical Staff Executive Committees
i. Provident Hospital of Cook County
ii. John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County
Dr. Ozuru Ukoha, President of the Executive Medical Staff (EMS) of John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook
County, was unable to attend the meeting due to a work-related conflict that arose.
Dr. Anwer Hussain, President of the EMS of Provident Hospital of Cook County, presented his report.
Dr. Hussain stated that Provident Hospital is currently within the window of time for the surveyors from The
Joint Commission to arrive anytime. He added that staff recently went through a mock survey exercise; the
issues that were identified during the mock survey are being rectified by the hospital.
Dr. Hussain stated that there is a subset of EMS members who are looking to create a board certification
policy. He noted that they are in the very preliminary stages of review and discussion; it is hoped that if and
when this policy gets approved by the medical staff, that it will be brought to leadership in order to
potentially work towards creating a unified policy for the System. Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical
Director/Medical Director Stroger Hospital, provided additional information. She stated that, at Provident
Hospital, their Medical Staff Bylaws allow that each department can establish their own individual rules and
regulations, so different departments have different language regarding board certification. Most
departments have eliminated the term “board eligible,” and most departments at Stroger Hospital require
board certification.

VI.

Closed Meeting Items
A. **Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes
B. Litigation Matter(s)
The Committee did not recess the open meeting and convene in a closed meeting.
