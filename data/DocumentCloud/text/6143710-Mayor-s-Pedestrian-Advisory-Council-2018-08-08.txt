At the neighborhood level, we will remake the ½ mile area around transit 
into a center of commerce, culture and social interaction in collaboration 
with local partners, building and harnessing community power, and 
aligning and cultivating capital.

At the systems level, we will remove policy barriers, foster 
residents’ influence, and ensure that equitable, forward‐thinking 
development around transit is a community priority and civic 
mandate.

The 59th Street Une is a former 1.7 mile elevated rail line that will be converted
into a multi-use trail to provide recreation, transportation and a source of
jobs to the residents of Englewood and surrounding communities. it will
link several vital projects in Chicago?s Urban Agricultural District and ful?ll the
communitYs aspirations for a safe, inviting, and peaceful space for all to enjoy.

The 59th Street Line is the first phase of a larger loop that will connect to the
49th Street Line in the Back of the Yards neighborhood to the north. The trail
has been recommended in a number of City plans and community-driven
planning processes, including the New Era Trail completed in 2009 and the
Green Healthy Neighborhoods Plan in 2014.

In 2014, the City of Chicago passed an ordinance authorizing the transfer
of the ?former Englewood Connecting Line'from Norfolk Southern Railway
Company as part of a larger land transfer to enable an intermodai yard

This land transfer enables the City of Chicago to move forward with the design
of a new trail that will further several community interests:
. Creating a safe trail for community use;
- Connecting a variety of uses that are currently being planned;
- Providing a source of jobs both for the construction of the trail as well
as an anchor for economic development along the trail; and
- Improving community safety by improvements to the pedestrian and
bicycle environment in the corridor.
The Concept Plan includes:
. Community Assets and Destinations
Existing Conditions of the Trail
Past Plans
Demographics
Key Objectives
Community Engagement
Issues and Opportunities
. Concept Plan Maps and illustrations

Land Use

The trail will be located in Englewood and West Englewood In the ?rst phase
and extended to New City - Back of the Yards In future phases The three
Community Areas have distinct land use patterns due to their historical
development with a mlxof residential, industrial, commercial and institutional
land uses.

The mix of land uses varies among these neighborhoods, with a greater
sharesof multi-famiiy housing in Englewood, a greater share of single-family
housing in West Englewood, and a greater share of industrial land in New
City Back of the Yards. All three neighborhoods have signi?cant amounts
of vacant land, especially in Englewood.

There are a variety of land uses in the 59th Street Line Corridor. The area grew

as a mix of industrial properties that grew along the railway, with residential

properties, and commercial uses along 59th Street. Vacant land
Commercial

Over time, most of the industrial and commercial uses have left the corridor.

Residential properties have declined as well as population has decreased.

The result is an excess of vacant land and vacant buildings along the corridor. . Ran line

Trail Access Conditions

There are a variety of physical conditions that can be taken advantage of in order
to provide a variety of experiences in accessing the trail. As shown in the Issues
and Opportunities Maps, there are three distinct elevation change conditions:

. Surface access to the trail at Damen Avenue and through a maintenance
access route at Halsted Street

. ?Mid'slopes, where there is a short, approximatelyfour foot high retaining
wall, with a mid-slope condition from the retaining wall to the surface of
the line.

. ?Steep? slopes which provide a taller retaining wall and steep slope to the
surface of the line.

. Based on these varying conditions, there can be different designs for
access points, allowing direct access at Damen and Halsted Streets,
possibilities for meandering trail access to reach the surface in the mid
slope conditions, and more traditional ramps and/or stairs at steep slope
conditions.

Provide multi-modal connections for residents to access bikes, bus, and trains.
The trail should be designed to reinforce the existing strong transit network in the
corridor. While there is already frequent CTA bus and rail service, the trail, along
with improvements in the sidewalk network and improvements to bike lanes
and routes, can maximize the pedestrian and bicycle experiences in the area and
improve safety for all users.

just 1.7 acres per 1,000 residents in Englewood, 2.5 acres in West Englewood
and 2 acres in New City Back of theYards compared with 3.9 acres in Chicago.
The trail will provide a continuous connection linking several parks including

Support efforts to expand urban farming, food, and restaurants along the Trail

As previously discussed, the trail will be at the center of Chicago?s Urban
Agricultural District. Currently, expanding farming operations include Growing
Home at Honore and Wood Streets, Eat to Live. In addition, Urban Pathways,
convened by NeighborSpace and Grow Greater Englewood, is developing a
proposal for urban farmers to own their own land and work together through
common infrastructure, storage facilities, and processing. Urban Pathways is
investigating locations along the Corridor to establish their farms.

The vision is to have greater economic development in the Corridor. Goodness
Greenness, for example is an organic food distributor at the eastern end of the
corridor. Kusanya Cafe is located within the 1.0 mile study area at 69th Street
and Halsted. Whole Foods will be open in 2016 at 64rd Street and Halsted, within
.5 mile of the corridor.

The goal is to have locally owned businesses such as restaurants and markets ?ll
in sites in the corridor, reusing vacant buildings and/or land, and employing local
residents.

Explore unique vegetation, qa'deninq and desiqr? a one the Tra.

The Englewood Line currently is lined by trees on both sides of the former rail. An inventory was conducted of all trees over 8' in caliper that is documented in the
Environmental and Vacancy Maps. Efforts will be made to preserve as many of these trees as possible to provide a unique, natural experience, with shade for users, while
providing visibility and public safety by clearing the underbrush. There are also opportunities to expand community gardening in vacant lots along the Trail, building on
work that has already been taking place. Unique vegetation, natural design, and interpretive signage can provide experiences similar to Forest Preserve District trails, but
in the city, just steps from resident?s homes.
