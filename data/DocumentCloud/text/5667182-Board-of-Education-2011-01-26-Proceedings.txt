ADOPT A BREAKFAST IN THE CLASSROOM POLICY
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER RECOMMENDS:
That the Board adopt a Breakfast in the Classroom Policy ("Policy").

PURPOSE: This policy establishes the requirements for the full implementation of Breakfast In the
Classroom program in all Chicago Public Elementary Schools. This policy seeks to create a
school environment that supports breakfast participation by all students. encourages students to embrace
a morning routine that includes breakfast and creates a healthy start to each school day.

The Breakfast in the Classroom Program supports the Board's commitment to serve the needs of the
whole child (physical. emotional and academic) while at school, The primary goal of the BIC program is to
promote student health and academic achievement by providing a nutritious breakfast as a routine start of
every school day. By the end of the June 2011. CPS will be serving breakfast to apprOximater 295.000
Elementary Students in 474 schools.

POLICY TEXT:
I. Background

CPS participates in the Federal School Breakfast Program in which the US Department of Agriculture
encourages all schools to implement a Breakfast in the Classroom model to ensure all students
take part in breakfast. This model is preferred because more students eat breakfast and enjoy the health
and educational bene?ts when it is provided as a routine start to every school day.

Research shows that an effective school breakfast program not only reduces hunger but also has a range
of positive educational outcomes. including the following:

. Eating breakfast improves math grades. vocabulary skills and memory. Children who eat breakfast at
school closer to class and test-taking time - perform better on standardized tests than those who
skip breakfast or eat breakfast hours earlier at home.

. Students who participate in school breakfast have lower rates of absence and tardiness and exhibit
decreased behavioral and problems. Children who eat school breakfast have fewer
discipline problems and visit school nurses' of?ces less often.

. Children who participate in school breakfast eat more fruits. drink more milk. and consume a wider
variety of foods than those who do not eat school breakfast or who have breakfast at home. Children
and adolescents who eat breakfast are significantly less likely to be overweight. while skipping
breakfast is associated with a higher risk of obesity.

Beginning with the 2007-2008 school year. all Chicago Public Elementary Schools with a free and
reduced meal eligibility population of over 40% or more were required by ISBE mandate to implement
one of the following two breakfast programs for their students: (1) breakfast served before school in the
lunchroom available to all students who elect to eat breakfast. known as Traditional Breakfast. or (2)
Breakfast in the Classroom where a pro-bagged hot or cold breakfast is provided to all students when
entering the school and eaten in the classroom with the teacher at the commencement of each school
day. Both programs are offer to students at no charge and is referred to as Universal Breakfast,

25

January 26, 2011

Schools that voluntarily adopted the Breakfast in the Classroom model achieved an average 69% student
breakfast participation rate compared to an average 23% student participation for schools that adopted
the model where breakfast is served in the school dining center. In addition to the dramatically increased
participation rate. making breakfast a routine part of the instructional day through the BIC model relieves

students of the challenges posed by bus drop off schedules. relieves the pressure of getting to class on
time. respects the desire of students to be physically active before school starts and eliminates the
potential stigma of sewing breakfast only to free eligible students before school.

As of January 1, 2011. 192 CPS elementary schools are voluntarily particrpating in Breakfast in the
Classroom. Based on the success of Breakfast in the Classroom at these 192 schools. the Board wishes
to implement the BIC model in all CPS Elementary Schools.

II. Implementation.

All CPS Elementary Schools that do not currently offer Traditional Breakfast or the Breakfast in the
Classroom program will establish and operate 3 Breakfast in the Classroom program by June 30. 2011
in accordance with the schedule and timelines issued by the Department of Nutrition Suppon Services
(N88). N88 will employ a phased rollout strategy designed to ensure schools receive the necessary
supports to successfully implement the BIC program. All schools shall comply with the standards.
requirements, program goals and accountability measures outlined in the BIC Guidelines issued by NSS
when providing Breakfast in the Classroom.

Ill. Authorization to Formulate Guidelines.

The Nutrition Support Services Logistics Officer is authorized to issue Guidelines for the effective
implementation of the Universal Breakfast in the Classroom program, the requirements of this Policy and
further to ensure compliance with USDA regulations in the provision of school breakfast meals.

IV. Compliance.

Failure to abide by this Policy or the BIG Guidelines may subject employees to discipline up to and
including dismissal in accordance with the Board?s Employee Discipline and Due Process PoliCy.

January 26. 2011

SCOPE OF SERVICES:

The University. through Chapin Hall. will provide grant evaluation services regarding the replication of the
Teen Outreach Program model. The primary goal of the evaluation is to determine the effectiveness of
the TOP model as implemented within the Chicago Public Schools by comparing the difference in the
reduction of 1) teen rates; 2) course failures; and 3) suspension rates between
students in the treatment and control groups.

Chapin Hall will employ a cluster-ramdomized design for this study. Forty (40) schools will be selected
from thirty-four (34) community areas with a high risk and number of teen pregnancies. Schools will be
randomly assigned to either the treatment or control groups; randomization will be strati?ed by racial and
ethnic composition of students and school size to ensure balanced groups. The number of schools
randomly assigned will be determined by the Board. if there is variability between strata. this approach
has the potential of increasing the reliability of the study. This assignment will be done at the start of the
pilot phase of the study and will be maintained throughout its duration. Those schools selected for the
treatment group will implement the TOP program. utilizing an evidence based youth development model
consisting of 26 lesson plans and a minimum of 20 hours of service-learning experience facilitated by a
trained adult. Those schools selected for the control group will not implement the TOP program. but will
receive an incentive not to exceed $2,000 to participate in all evaluation activities related to the project.
In addition. Chapin Hall will conduct a process evaluation regarding the interagency collaboration
regarding implementation of the project.

Chapin Hall will collect and analyze data including CPS administrative data. attendance. ocurse grades,
ISAT scores. and graduation and drop0ut rates; conduct key informant interviews. classroom
observations. and a youth survey. This data will be used by Chapin Hall to make recommendations on
program implementation as well as program effectiveness.

DELIVERABLES:

1. Randomize sample of schools:

2. Develop and submit an approved Of?ce of Adolescent Health Evaluation Plan to Board Project
Manager:

3. Conduct baseline data collection from all participating schools:

4. Submit summary of baseline data collection;

for the next grant year; and

study that will determine the effectiveness of the TOP program in: a) reducing course failures; b) reducing
suspensions; c) reducing teen rates; and. c) reducing the school drop outs.
