Exploring Root Causes of Health Inequities
in Chicago
Nikhil Prachand
Director of Epidemiology

June 19, 2019

 Framework + Vision
A city where all people
and all communities
are empowered, free
from oppression and…

strengthened by
equitable access to
resources,
environments and
opportunities that …

Promote optimal health
and well-being

 Our BIG Questions
• How has Chicago changed?
• How healthy are people who live in Chicago?
• Do our neighborhoods have equitable access to
resources, opportunities and environments that
promote optimal health and well-being?
• What underlying social and institutional inequities may
be contributing to gaps in health outcomes?

 Our Approach
• Review demographic changes in Chicago.

• Analyze life expectancy and dig deeper into health
outcomes that are driving the gap.
• Gather new indicators to understand neighborhood
conditions that impact health.
• Apply a racial equity lens to help illuminate social and
institutional inequities.

Health is ultimately shaped by “the distribution of money,

responsible, and accountable. They want a city
where no one is left out and no one is left behind."
