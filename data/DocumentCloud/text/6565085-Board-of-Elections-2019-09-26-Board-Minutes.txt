Agenda Item 1: Determination of the validity of provisional ballots and authorization to count
provisional ballots from the September 10, 2019 Primary Election

that no provisional ballots were cast in-house. Of those ballots, 31 were found to meet the requirements for

NEW BUSINESS
March 17, 2020 Presidential Primary Update
Director Perlatti stated that since his last update, we have surveyed 332 polling locations that would be
utilized in the March Election to determine availability and any other potential conflict; to date, we have
received responses from 175 polling locations and 157 have not responded. Further follow up via email has
been sent to the remaining 157 with a link to complete the survey. Regarding the 157 that have not responded,
44 polling locations are in the City of Cleveland and they are typically good partners with us and there should
not be any issues.
Of the 175, we do have some challenges with four (4) locations outside of the downtown area who responded
that they are not available due to St. Patrick’s Day events:
1).

St. Ladislas Church (Westlake) – Five (5) precinct location.

2.)

St. Clarence Church (North Olmsted) – Five (5) precinct location.

3.)

St. Patrick Church (Rocky River) – Three (3) precinct location.

4.)

Villa Angela St. Joseph High School (Cleveland) has stated not only are they not available, but are no
longer interested in being a polling location due to sporting events that will need to use the space that
is normally provided for us. This is a two (2) precinct location and we do have a potential relocation
and have reached out to Councilman Polensek.

St. Roberts Church (Euclid) is available; however given a long Mass on Election Day – there would be a
potential parking issue that we will work through.
Director Perlatti also stated that the Cleveland Heights-University Heights school district will be having a
teacher in-service and may not be available for March and he will follow up with the Superintendent to
engage in further conversation about this.
Board Member Davis Chappell asked if the schools are aware that if the Board expresses to utilize the facility
that we have the right to hold an election at the school. Director Perlatti responded stating they are aware and
he would hope that we would not have to exercise that right.
Regarding Old Stone Church and St. Clair Place (locations within the downtown area):
A meeting was held with Councilman Jones and Councilman McCormack regarding polling locations in their
wards and the challenges they would have as polling locations in their respective wards are along the parade
route. Data has been sent to both regarding voting trends at the locations. A follow-up meeting will be
scheduled and we will also invite the Executive Directors from the County Democratic and Republican parties
to provide them with updates and receive their thoughts and explain the challenges that may occur so that
information can be shared with the candidates running within these wards. Both councilmen mentioned that
they would reach out to the security personnel for the parade utilized by the City of Cleveland. Overall, there
are 21 precincts that will be impacted.

 Office of Budget and Management Update
Director Perlatti stated that as a follow-up regarding the previously approved budget by the Board Members,
communication with OBM has been ongoing. This is a two part process dealing with the base budget and the
initiative budget. We do not foresee any issues with the base budget and there should not be any deductions.
Kendra Zusy, Manager of Fiscal Services, stated that we are scheduled to attend the County Executive’s
budget hearing on October 21st to discuss any existing funds, new initiatives or any concerns regarding
additional funding that we would want County Council to consider. A meeting has also been scheduled for
October 8th to address some of the initiatives to include the SOS security directive, the inventory management
system and the mail verifier equipment.
Director Perlatti added that we are still waiting to hear back from OBM regarding the purchase of the voting
booths. A decision will need to be made whether to phase in the purchase over a five (5) year period or
purchase at one time.
Board Member Davis Chappell inquired as to the cost of replacement of the voting booths and Director
Perlatti responded stating the cost could be $800K-1M.
Board Member Hastings asked if the pay band study would also be included and Director Perlatti responded
by saying yes; the pay band would be included and that the Archer Company had submitted a proposal.
Board Member Davis Chappell asked if we have considered utilizing other companies for potential better
pricing. Director Perlatti responded by stating that we can certainly look at other companies.
Board Member Hasting asked what the initial cost of study was; Director Perlatti responded by stating $25K
and the current proposal would be a maintenance plan. Fiscal Manager stated that the subsequent study cost
would be $12K.
Equipment Acquisition Update
Deputy Director Soeder stated since meeting with the vendors in December, a voting acquisition committee
was created and will be a part of the selection process. Going forward we will circle back with the vendors to
get a better understanding of how their systems work.
She further stated that staff is planning to observe systems in place at the Hamilton Board of Elections, who
uses Hart InterCivic on October 18th and the Warren Board of Election, who uses Clear Ballot on October 17th
and to visit Franklin County at a later time. Preliminary discussions will begin internally prior to the
Presidential Election in 2020 and formally after the 2020 Presidential Election. Staff will recommend to the
Board and receive approval to purchase equipment and implement use in the May 2021 Primary Election.
The next major item is to have an in-house voting event in January to see exactly how systems interact with
the ballot on demand system, whether or not to integrate poll books in the process, and do we have the ability
to introduce scanners with HB 41.
Board Member Chappell asked if there was a checklist being prepared to discuss with vendors prior to the
October site visits. Deputy Director Soeder stated that a draft checklist has been created and she will share
that document with the Board Members.

National Voter Registration Day Update

4

 Cathy Goskey, Outreach Coordinator for Community Outreach, stated that in collaboration with Cleveland
Votes and over 65 community partners, 40 events in celebration of National Voter Registration Day were held
on Tuesday, September 17th and proved to be a success.
Director Perlatti stated that we will be reaching out to individuals who worked with the Board on National
Voter Registration Day to see if there is any interest in working the polls on Election Day.
OAEO
Board Member Frost stated that the Ohio Association of Election Officials (OAEO) trustees met and took a
neutral position on Senate Bill 186, which is the Verified Voter Registration. This came after the Legislative
Committee of OAEO recommended being against the legislation. In the process, a substitute SB186 will be
introduced. There were issues with SB186 as introduced that are being addressed and the legislative
committee will be asked to re-assess the Verified Voter Registration after the substitute senate bill is
introduced and reevaluated. The bill is meant to improve the data breach and ensure quality of data coming in
from our partners.
He further stated, the Secretary of State is pleased to announce, in partnership with the Cleveland
Metropolitan Bar Association, that they have developed a curriculum for precinct election officials training to
qualify for continuing legal education credit so that we can recruit even more effectively. The Secretary of
State is recommending that all boards and trustees that are members of the Ohio Association of Election
Officials work with the Bar Association.
PUBLIC TESTIMONY
Adele Eisner – Provided a copy of a report from the City of Philadelphia, Office of the City Controller.
EXECUTIVE SESSION
Discussion of personnel issues (to consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion, or compensation of a public employee or official) and updates on pending/potential
litigation if necessary.
The Board unanimously voted to adjourn at 4:23 pm.
