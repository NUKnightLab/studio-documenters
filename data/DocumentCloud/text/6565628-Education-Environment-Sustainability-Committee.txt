 County Council of Cuyahoga County, Ohio
Resolution No. R2019-0183
Sponsored by: Councilmember

County Planning Commission

A Resolution supporting an application for
funding under the Clean Ohio Fund Green
Space Conservation Program available
through the Ohio Public Works
Commission on behalf of City of Euclid for
the conservation of ecologically significant
areas in the Euclid Waterfront – Weltman
Estate and IRG Properties Acquisition in
the City of Euclid; and declaring the
necessity that this Resolution become
immediately effective.

WHEREAS, Cuyahoga County has received a request from City of Euclid for a
Resolution supporting an application for funding under the Clean Ohio Fund Green
Space Conservation Program available through the Ohio Public Works Commission
on behalf of City of Euclid for the conservation of ecologically significant areas in the
Euclid Waterfront – Weltman Estate and IRG Properties Acquisition in the City of
Euclid, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23; and
WHEREAS, in 2009, the City of Euclid established a vision for public waterfront
development including a ¾ mile all-purpose trail and shoreline stabilization project
currently under construction with funding partially from the Cuyahoga County Casino
Revenue Program. The next phase of construction is anticipated in summer 2020
pending these proposed acquisitions. The City has an opportunity to acquire a total of
25 parcels within the project area, whereas the majority of the parcels will be
permanently conserved for trail development. The properties are controlled by the
Estate of Dennis Weltman (4 parcels) and IRG (21 parcels), long-time proponents of
the Euclid Waterfront Improvements Plan. The current owners are prepared to sell
the parcels to Western Reserve Land Conservancy and the City of Euclid for the
purposes of completing the lakefront trail and based on the fair market appraised
value of the parcels.
WHEREAS, the City of Euclid has a long-term access and maintenance easement
as well as a temporary construction easement over the properties; however, the City
prefers ownership where it can ensure permanent conservation and preserve in
perpetuity public access to our region’s greatest natural asset. In addition, if a public
entity were to own the properties, there could be enhanced public access from the
urban grid to the new waterfront trail as well as potential construction cost savings.
These acquisitions follow a pattern where other City-owned parcels within the project
area are conserved through grants from ODNR and we anticipate that more of our

Page 9 of 29

 lakefront will continue to be conserved as a public good through a partnership with
the Western Reserve Land Conservancy.
WHEREAS, the project is known as “Euclid Waterfront – Weltman Estate and
IRG Properties Acquisition” and is located in County Council District No. 11; and
WHEREAS, the total estimated project cost is $1,000,000.00, of which
$650,000.00 is estimated for the Clean Ohio application; and
WHEREAS, Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23 provides that “an entity seeking
a grant for a project that is eligible for funding shall submit an application to the
natural resources assistance council with geographical jurisdiction over the proposed
project area;” and, Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23(B) further provides that “in
addition to the application, an applicant for a grant for a project shall include a copy
of a resolution supporting the project from each county in which the proposed project
is to be conducted;” and
WHEREAS, the Ohio Public Works Commission provides financial assistance to
Natural Resources Assistance Councils for the purpose of preserving open spaces,
sensitive ecological areas, and stream corridors; and
WHEREAS, the applications for the fourteenth-round funding under the Clean
Ohio Fund Green Space Conservation Program are due on October 11, 2019 to the

A Resolution supporting an application for
funding under the Clean Ohio Fund Green
Space Conservation Program available
through the Ohio Public Works
Commission on behalf of Cuyahoga River
Restoration for the conservation of
ecologically significant areas in the
Cuyahoga River Fish Habitat – Carter
Road in the City of Cleveland; and
declaring the necessity that this Resolution
become immediately effective.

WHEREAS, Cuyahoga County has received a request from Cuyahoga River
Restoration for a Resolution supporting an application for funding under the Clean
Ohio Fund Green Space Conservation Program available through the Ohio Public
Works Commission on behalf of Cuyahoga River Restoration for the conservation of
ecologically significant areas in the Cuyahoga River Fish Habitat – Carter Road in the
City of Cleveland, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23; and
WHEREAS, Cuyahoga River Restoration seeks to provide shallow aquatic habitat
along the dredged industrial navigation channel where fish would be protected from
the turbulence of passing freighters and use the habitat for rest and reproduction. It
would also provide a publicly accessible trail and greenspace alongside the habitat.
The site stretches along most of the western edge of the Scranton Peninsula from just
downstream of the Carter Road bridge to just above the Columbus Road bridge. It
runs along the river adjacent to the proposed Thunderbird mixed-use development
and future Great Lakes Brewing facility, so that the naturalization of the river’s edge
and trail installation would provide not only much-needed habitat for fish and aquatic
life, but also a living, accessible green strip along the industrial channel for people to
enjoy. The current property owner is a partner in the project, recognizing the value of
a greenspace and trail as amenities to the development. It is a valuable asset in
restoring life to the ship channel and improving the health of the Cuyahoga River.
WHEREAS, the project is known as “Cuyahoga River Fish Habitat – Carter
Road” and is located in County Council District No. 7; and
WHEREAS, the total estimated project cost is $2,500.000.00, of which
$1,875,000.00 is estimated for the Clean Ohio application; and

Resolution No. R2019-0186
Sponsored by: Councilmember
Simon on behalf of Cuyahoga
County Planning Commission

A Resolution supporting an application for
funding under the Clean Ohio Fund Green
Space Conservation Program available
through the Ohio Public Works
Commission on behalf of Village of
Orange for the conservation of ecologically
significant areas in the Chagrin River and
Tinker’s Creek Headwaters Wetland
Protection in the Village of Orange; and
declaring the necessity that this Resolution
become immediately effective.

WHEREAS, Cuyahoga County has received a request from Orange Village for a
Resolution supporting an application for funding under the Clean Ohio Fund Green
Space Conservation Program available through the Ohio Public Works Commission
on behalf of the Village of Orange for the conservation of ecologically significant
areas in the Chagrin River and Tinker’s Creek Headwaters Wetland Protection in the
Village of Orange, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23; and
WHEREAS, the Village of Orange seeks to permanently protect approximately
56 acres of land along the drainage divide between the Chagrin River and Tinker’s
Creek watersheds in the Village of Orange. This project will include five parcels
(Permanent Parcel Numbers: 901-03-022, 901-03-023, 901-03-027, 901-03-032 and
901-05-002), which are located near the Interstate 271/Harvard Road interchange in
the Village of Orange. This land includes numerous wetlands that eventually drain to
Wiley Creek, a tributary to the Chagrin River and Hawthorne Creek, a tributary to
Tinker’s Creek. Downstream Ohio EPA monitoring locations indicate that Wiley
Creek is in partial attainment of its cold-water habitat aquatic life use designation and
Hawthorne Creek is non-attainment of its warm-water habitat aquatic life use
designation. The area surrounding the Interstate 271/Harvard Road interchange has
experienced substantial commercial development, and undeveloped land in this area
is in high demand, resulting in an immediate need to protect these sensitive wetland
areas to provide habitat for native wetland plant, macroinvertebrate and bird species.
In addition to protecting wildlife habitat in an expanding commercial zone in the
Interstate 271 corridor, this project will also protect the natural stormwater
management benefits of the wetlands and provide crucial greenspace access to
residents of the Village of Orange and surrounding Cuyahoga County communities
through future trail development. This project will also include invasive plant species
management to enhance and protect the native wetland vegetative communities at the
site.

 WHEREAS, the project is known as “Chagrin River and Tinker’s Creek
Headwaters Wetland Protection Project” and is located in County Council District
No. 9; and
WHEREAS, the total estimated project cost is $6,582,500.00, of which
$1,200,000.00 is estimated for the Clean Ohio application; and

a grant for a project that is eligible for funding shall submit an application to the
natural resources assistance council with geographical jurisdiction over the proposed
project area;” and, Ohio Revised Code Section 164.23(B) further provides that “in
