Report from System Chief Financial Officer
A. Update on pending information requests (continued)
Mr. Ayres presented information on Medicare Bad Debts, which is a recoverable revenue for the System,
providing that Medicare’s rules on collection are followed. Late in the summer, the work was completed by the
reimbursement department and the outside consultants and collection companies, to get that process in place.
They have run the first set of claims through that process, and will now claim them on the cost reports.
Chairman Carvalho noted that when the System engaged those contractors, there were estimates of what the
System would recover. Jerrold Wolf, of Public Consulting Group, stated that it was estimated that the System
would recover approximately $1 million; over time, they expect that estimate to go up.
On a similar subject, Chairman Carvalho inquired when the Committee would be receiving a report on
reimbursement for residents. Mr. Ayres responded that the report has just been completed; it is expected to be
presented for the January 15th Finance Committee meeting.
With regard to the information presented on the Charge Description Master (CDM), Director O’Donnell
inquired how the implementation of the CDM will change the System’s relationship with Medicare and
Medicaid. Mr. Ayres responded that it is the physician-side billing that will cause the change. The System
currently has a relationship with Medicare, called the “cost election method”. When the System moves to a
more detailed billing structure, they have to change to a fee-for-service methodology.
The Committee discussed the information provided on the 2010 budget, and the directive from the County’s
budget office to reduce the System’s budget by 1.5%, because the County asserts that the System failed to meet
the 19% budget reduction standard. Chairman Carvalho stated that the System reduced their tax request by
19% as a result of an earlier request that was in anticipation of a sales tax roll-back. Now, as a result of the tax
roll-back, the System is being asked to cut another 1.5% for the same reason. William T. Foley, Chief
Executive Officer, responded that the System’s position is that they already reduced the tax subsidy by 19%.
Dr. Anthony Tedeschi, Interim Chief Operating Officer, provided information on a request for information in
relation to testimony provided at the November 19, 2009 System Board meeting by Ms. Carol O’Neil. Her
testimony focused on staffing/rebalancing efforts in the Dietary Department at Oak Forest Hospital of Cook
County.
Dr. Tedeschi explained that the underlying issue with perceived discrepancies between the System’s data and
Ms. O’Neil’s information was that the two parties were using two different sets of numbers, which were based
upon a different definition of “food service worker”. Ms. O’Neil had interpreted a food service worker to be a
specific job classification, while the System’s data was generally defining all workers in the food service
department as “food service workers”.

Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items (continued)
B. Proposed redevelopment of the historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for System
administrative offices
The following individuals presented information on the proposed redevelopment of the historic Cook
County Hospital Main Building for System administrative offices: Bruce Washington, Director of the
County’s Office of Capital Planning and Policy; Anna Ashcraft, Special Assistant for Legal Affairs for the
Bureau of Capital Planning; and Hugh Murphy, Executive Vice President of Jones Lang LaSalle.
Additionally, Mr. Washington stated that Jim Peters, President of Landmarks Illinois, would be presenting
comments on the proposal.
Ms. Ashcraft provided a brief background on the subject. Mr. Peters presented testimony in support of the
redevelopment of the building. Mr. Murphy presented the proposal on the redevelopment (Executive
Summary – Attachment #3). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the subject of where the new Fantus Clinic might be located, under the
redevelopment scenario. Mr. Washington stated that it depends on several issues, but potential locations
include 1900 Polk, Hektoen Building, Durand Building, or behind the re-developed old Cook County
Hospital.
The Committee discussed the campus parking needs. Dr. Tedeschi asked how this issue affects the timeline
for the construction of the expansion of the parking garage. Mr. Washington responded that it doesn’t affect
the parking expansion timeline; the expansion is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011.
In response to Chairman Batts’ inquiry regarding the cost to demolish the building, Mr. Murphy responded
that it would cost between $3.5 million and $4 million. Additionally, Chairman Batts inquired regarding
asbestos removal. Mr. Murphy responded that it has been removed already, although they will need to recheck and test in that regard.
The Committee discussed the subject of cost and financing for redevelopment and new construction. Mr.
Murphy stated that in 2007, the City of Chicago amended the Central West Tax Increment Financing (TIF)
District, specifically to include the Old Cook County Hospital building and Rush; this was done with the
anticipation that the old Cook County Hospital building would be rehabilitated. As a result of this action,
TIF funds can be obtained and used for redevelopment of the building. He added that TIF financing could
total as much as 20-25% of the cost. He noted that these funds would not be available for new construction.
A comparison of costs concluded that the cost in County funding would be similar for either redevelopment
or new construction; the additional cost for redevelopment of the building would be offset by TIF financing
that would only be available for redevelopment.
Chairman Carvalho requested information on the number of square feet currently being utilized for office
space at 1900 W. Polk and for the other campus buildings included in the discussion; he believed that the
System’s needs should be examined before a location or building is chosen, not the other way around.
Further discussion took place on existing buildings on the campus, their utilization, and System needs.
Board Chairman Batts requested that information be provided on 1900 W. Polk relating to headcount and
function, so that current office space usage can be determined.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Golden, moved the approval of the proposed redevelopment of the
historic Cook County Hospital Main Building for System administrative offices. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Note: At the December 18, 2009 Meeting of the Board of Directors, a roll call vote was taken with regard
to the Finance Committee’s recommendation for approval of this item. The motion to approve failed.

 Memorandum
To: CCHHS Finance Committee
From: Michael Ayres, Chief Financial Officer
Subject: CFO Report
Date: December 1 1,2009
The following are some of the key items of interest that occurred during November,
2009:

a

a

a

Medicare Bad Debts - Robert Vais, Director of Reimbursement, has been
MedAssets and our third-party collectors to
working with outside cons~~ltants,
implement a methodology that will maximize reimbursement under the Medicare
bad debt policies. Those procedures were put in place late in the year. As a
result, we expect to increase reimbursement for fiscal years 2008 by $245,000 and
2009 by $453,000. These processes ensure increased reimbursement from
Medicare as we process unpaid claims.
Cash collections -- As of November 30, the system had been successful in
recovering a total of $361 million in Stimulus and prior and current year
Disproportionate Share Hospital payments. This was $314.7 million over the
budget for 2009. Patient service revenues totaled $242 million which was $49
million under budget. However; the state recovered $94 million of the $97.2
million in take back as part of the DSH settlement. Therefore, had the take back
not occurred, patient service revenues would have been approximately $335.9
million or $45.9 million above budget.
Bank Of America Lease -- We have worked through the final arrangements to
have access to the $30 million lease available through Bank of America. The
process implemented by the bank requires us to submit a detailed description,
purchasing terms and conditions to Bank of America prior to the financings.
They are requiring those items to receive Board of Director approvals. We are in
the process of identifying priority items and will place them on the .Tanuary board
cycle for your review and approval.
Roseland Payments -- We have received $37,500 from Roseland Community
Hospital Association for both October and November on the due date according to
contract. We are experiencing no difficulties in the operation of the revised
agreement.
Chamberlin-Edmonds Medicaid Qualification Program -- Implementation of
Chamberlin Edmonds throughout the system is going according to schedule.
During November, the company received a total of 1,907 qualified referrals and
accepted 849 of them for a "take rate" of 44.5%. The budgeted referrals were
anticipated to be 1,574 with acceptance of 691 or 43.9%.
ERP Implementation -- ASC and the system have been working on the
implementation schedule for the various initiatives. Attached is a copy of the
original timeline and key milestones followed by the revised timetable. Through

Page 7 of 129

 the efforts of the company and the system we are moving forward a number of the
initiatives to ensure implementation by January 1,201 1. Some of these initiatives
heavily rely on cooperation from the County services and are noted by the "at
risk" arrows. We are in discussions with the appropriate County offices in an
effort to ensure cooperation and agreement on necessary steps. I anticipate that
there will be several policy issues that need to be decided and anticipate that they
will be brought before you in January and February.
Charge Description Master -- the new single system wide charge description
master will be operational on January 1, 2010 with interfaces to the existing
Cerner clinical system by February 1. All of the other electronic ancillary
systems will be interfaced through the new CDM and the bills will be generated
by March 15. By August 3 1, we are planning for all of the remaining ancillary
departments will be reengineered to maximize charge capture. We anticipate that
by June 30 the physician billing component will also be installed and ready for
testing. By December 31, all physician billing processes should be completed.
During the last half of the year we will need to revise our Medicare contract away
from the current Cost Election Method, renegotiate the Medicaid combined rate as
well as Blue Cross and other third parties. It is difficult to determine how much
additional reimbursement the system will receive by direct physician billing but
we anticipate it will be an excess of $6 million per year. This timetable is
aggressive and we are in discussion with MedAssets concerning additional
resources or reprioritizing of current programs.
2010 Budget -- the 2010 Cook County budget has been completed. We were
notified by the budget office that we are to reduce the approved amount by $26
million or approximately 3% of the total -- 1.5% because we failed to meet the
19% budget reduction standard and the additional 1.5% as result of the sales tax
rollback. Were In the process of currently identifying how to modify our
operational budget to take into consideration the requirement.
Strategic Financial Planning - A financial structure has been put in place to work
directly with the strategic planning initiatives for purposes of calculating the
economic impact of changes under consideration. We have identified a database
and are looking for necessary analytical skills to assist in the development of the
appropriate models. The forecasting models, costing methodologies input
templates and quality assurance functions are being developed and will be in
place to respond to program changes.

Real value in a changing world

Cook County Hospital: Adaptive Reuse Study

December 1

Chicago’s Ellis Island
Chicago Tribune – November 29, 2009
Through much of the 20th century, when de facto segregation excluded poor minorities from
numerous upscale Chicago hospitals, thousands of America's top physicians offered worldclass care to millions of the city's newcomers -- Eastern Europeans, African-Americans,
Latinos, anyone in need. Cook County Hospital, the Beaux Arts gem on West Harrison Street,
delivered their babies by the tens of thousands -- the future Mayor Harold Washington
included.
Cook County Board members mothballed the nearly century-old structure after completion in
late 2002 of its replacement, Stroger Hospital. Now the County Board can give this aging but
solid landmark to Chicago's poor -- it's been called our Ellis Island -- new life as rehabbed
and badly needed office space for the county's health system.
We hope today's board members appreciate the rich history they can preserve, and the
sensible economics they can embrace. The opportunity to achieve both goals has just landed
in their laps.
A county-ordered study by real estate analysts Jones Lang LaSalle recommends
modernizing the old hospital to replace the county health system's current headquarters, a
dilapidated former nursing dormitory that's begging to be demolished. The county's
conversion of the old hospital to administrative space would offer "the highest and best
market use and lowest overall cost," says the study, which also evaluated conversions to a
hotel, rental housing, condos, senior housing and other possible improvements for the Near
West Side's medical district.

The late County Board President John Stroger blew hot and cold on saving the hospital.
Eventually, though, he grew intrigued about preserving a monument that had been so crucial
to generations of black Chicagoans.
In 2007, his successor and son, Todd, proposed rehabbing the old hospital as medical office
space. We said at the time and believe today that the right execution to preserve such a
stately and storied structure would respect Chicago's history, taxpayers' dollars -- and
common sense.
The concept now on the table evokes one Chicago opportunity seized, and one lost.
Persistent lobbying by the late Eleanor Daley, the wife and mother of mayors, was key to
saving the old Chicago Public Library building, now the Cultural Center. If only someone had
similarly championed the Chicago Stock Exchange before it was demolished. Losing the old
Cook County Hospital would be a similar mistake.
We watched some County Board members react skeptically to this plan when Jones Lang
LaSalle presented it at a Nov. 17 committee meeting. If only board members always would
react skeptically to county plans for spending taxpayer dollars.
But we hope the board members come to see the wisdom they can exercise here. If this
proposal to preserve Chicago's Ellis Island also preserves as much of that taxpayer money
as we think it does -- and finally permits destruction of the unsalvageable nursing dorm -- it
would be a big triumph for a city that has let too many of its landmark buildings turn to dust.

Jones Lang LaSalle pegs the cost of a rehab for offices at $107 million. That's serious money,
but probably cheaper than constructing new space. Seven years ago, county property
managers estimated the cost of just demolishing the old hospital at $20 million to $30 million,
owing in large part to the need for extensive asbestos abatement.
We've been applauding for years as Commissioner Larry Suffredin and Michael Quigley, a
former commissioner now in the U.S. House, fought alongside architectural preservationists
and urban historians to stave off the wrecking ball. Other board members eventually joined
them in votes to aggressively explore how best to reuse the building.

Page 15 of 129

 Project Overview
Jones Lang LaSalle was tasked by Cook County’s Office of Capital Planning & Policy (OCPP) with
identifying the feasibility of various uses and costs associated with the adaptive reuse of Cook
County Hospital (“Hospital” or “Property”). This involved reviewing the Property’s physical
characteristics and all property information, including the age and condition of the existing historic
improvements and their adaptability to reuse, analyzing existing local market and financing
conditions, and then identifying the most appropriate development scenarios for the Hospital.
Based upon the data collected from the initial analysis, Jones Lang LaSalle prepared construction
and project financing estimates to assess different potential uses and development scenarios that
the County may wish to pursue. A general, long-term assessment of the capital markets’ appetite
for real estate investment on the Hospital site was used to test market acceptance and refine these
development scenarios for feasibility.
It was concluded in the 2005 Master Plan completed by U.S. Equities that the Hospital was not
suitable tor rehabilitation as clinical space, due to the heavier floor loads that would be necessary
for medical equipment. Therefore, options considered for reuse of the Hospital property included
administrative office, hotel, housing (including student/dormitory, rental, condominium, and senior
housing), and educational use.
Adaptive Reuse Option
Office

Demand

Total Project Cost

Low overall demand in IMD and immediately-surrounding
area.
Known demand for relocation space for 1900 West Polk
Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS)
occupants.

$107.7M

Hotel

IMD could potentially absorb a select-service hotel.
However, since more optimal sites for a hotel exist within
the IMD, demand for Hospital is considered very low.

$116.1M

Dormitory

No demand found for dormitory space within the IMD.

$103.9M

Rental
Housing/Condominium

Current demand for housing is extremely low – should
demand rise, more optimal housing sites exist within the
IMD.

$109.3M

Senior Housing

No demand found for senior housing within the IMD.

$120.0M

Educational

Moderate demand exists for educational space within the
IMD, although the probability a developer or user will be
able to pay development costs and/or rent is low.

$109.3M

Various ownership and development scenarios were considered within each option. As a result of
this analysis, it is our recommendation that adaptive reuse of the Hospital for CCHHS
administrative office use is the best option for the County.

A developer, whether public (County) or private, should be able to access funds from the City of
Chicago’s Central West TIF to assist in funding the project. In addition, a private developer can
access Historical Tax Credits in the amount of 20% of qualified rehabilitation costs.

Recommendation
As our market analysis indicates an overall lack of current and projected private demand for the
Hospital property for office, hotel, or residential space, we conclude that the financial feasibility of
these commercial development options rests largely on public (County, other IMD tenants)
demand. Given the immediate CCHHS need for office space to relocate the 1900 W. Polk
occupants, the Jones Lang LaSalle Team recommends the following option, based upon the lowest
overall cost to the County:
County Rehabilitation of Hospital for CCHHS Administrative office use


We recommend County rehabilitation of the Hospital property for CCHHS
Administrative office use as the highest and best market use and lowest overall
cost to the County



This option will utilize County capital dollars and/or bonding capacity.



County annual debt service (for 30 years) to renovate/occupy Hospital represents
the lowest annual cost at $7M per year. This cost would be significantly
decreased by the procurement of TIF funds by the County.



The immediate demand for CCHHS Administrative office space is met, and the
Hospital building is fully utilized.

Comments

Pros

Cons

(All figures are EXCLUSIVE of
Operating Expenses)

County spends capital dollars, in
lieu of operating (lease) dollars.

--All 1900 Polk administrative
offices could be relocated to
the Hospital property.

--County absorbs entire
redevelopment with no rental income
to offset costs.

--County can utilize TaxExempt bonds

-- Historical Tax Credits cannot be
utilized, due to public ownership of
building

Total cost for County to renovate
Hospital:

$107.7M ($349 psf), or

Debt service of approximately $7.0M
for 30 years

It was assumed that a developer
would purchase the Hospital for
$1 from the County. This
transaction would be contingent
upon the developer securing
public (TIF, Historical Tax
Credit) funds, as no developer
equity would be extended.

--All 1900 Polk administrative
offices could be relocated to
the Hospital property.

If the County wishes to spend
operating instead of capital
dollars, this is a viable option.

--Decreased risk on part of
County (no ownership)

--County spends operating
dollars, not capital dollars.
--Developer can utilize TaxExempt bonds

-- Historical Tax Credits may
be able to be utilized, due to
private ownership of building

--Developer will require an annual
development or management fee
(assumed to be 5% of gross
revenues) in addition to rent which
covers its debt service.
--County must commit to 30-year
lease
--County has less control over
Property
--This transaction would most
definitely be contingent upon the
developer securing public (TIF,
Historical Tax Credit) funds.
--County must pay real estate taxes,
as the Property’s ownership will be
private

 Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the nine month of the fiscal year ahead of budget by
$123,550,340. The overall revenue excess at the end of nine months was
$112,188,604. Expenses were below budget by $11,361,736 or 1.4%.

Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of August collected from patient services were below
budget year to date by $21,890,205 or 10.0%. The number of Medicare
visits is down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of August is below the budget by $1,082,972 or
20.4%. Prior year revenues included one time payments which was
factored into the 2009 budget.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on an accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of August was above budget year to
date by $130,174,436 or 35.8%.
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of August were below budget by
$11,361,736 or 1.4%. This favorable expense performance was due to
positive variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities.
Salaries and Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.

Salaries and Wages – $31,833,781 or 7.5%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of August due to the
FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which resulted in
none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.

This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 31 of 129

 Benefits - $4,502,005 or 7.5%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.

Supplies – $2,500,000 or 2.1%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD August 31, 2008
supply expense of $88,579,197 ($67,032,035 as of YTD August ’09) was
based on actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s ledger of actual
items paid by the County. During the preparation of the prior year’s
report, there were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any missing
expenses.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 1.7%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD August 31, 2008 estimated purchase
services, rental, and other expense amount of $77,082,260 ($65,294,033
as of YTD August ’09) was based on expenses taken from the
Comptroller’s ledgers.
Utilities - $3,575,677 or 22.3%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 32 of 129

 Similar to supplies, the prior YTD August 31, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $13,642,207 ($10,137,478 as of YTD August ’09) was also
taken from the Comptroller’s ledgers.

 Summary
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System year to date financial
results finished the ten month of the fiscal year ahead of budget by
$124,599,392. The overall revenue excess at the end of ten months was
$112,431,953. Expenses were below budget by $12,167,439 or 1.4%.

Operating Revenue
Fees at the end of September collected from patient services were below
budget year to date by $32,811,225 or 13.6%. The number of Medicare
visits is down this year compared to the same period last year.
Other Revenue at the end of September is below the budget by $112,682
or 1.9%. Prior year revenues included one time payments which was
factored into the 2009 budget.
FMAP and NetDSH are recognized on an accrual basis to Budget.
Total Operating Revenue at the end of September was above budget year
to date by $131,045,850 or 32.8%.
Operating Expenses
Operating Expenses at the end of September were below budget by
$12,167,439 or 1.4%. This favorable expense performance was due to
positive variances for Supplies, Purchased Services, and Utilities.
Salaries and Employee Benefits were under the budget year to date.

Salaries and Wages – $35,305,437 or 7.5%
Salaries and wages were below the budget at the end of September due to
the FY 2009 Budget not being approved until mid-February which
resulted in none of the new budgeted positions being recruited for.

This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 50 of 129

 Benefits - $4,992,956 or 7.5%
The level of Benefit expense is directly related to salary and wage
expense. Benefits for employees are below the budget because salaries
and wages are also below the budget.

Supplies – $2,500,000 or 2.1%
Each of the System facilities supply expenses are below the budget year
to date. The System is using the accrual convention to estimate supply
expense based on the budgeted expenditures minus any documented
savings to date.
In comparison to the prior year, the estimated YTD September 30, 2008
supply expense of $102,674,287 ($75,552,194 as of YTD September ’09)
was based on actual expense taken from the Comptroller’s ledger of
actual items paid by the County. During the preparation of the prior
year’s report, there were no attempts to estimate an accrual for any
missing expenses.
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $2,100,000 or 1.7%
The year to date level expenses for the System for this category continues
to be significantly below the budget. The method used to estimate
expense is the same for purchased services as is used for supplies.
Similar to supplies, the prior YTD September 30, 2008 estimated
purchase services, rental, and other expense amount of $89,105,776
($79,873,058 as of YTD September ’09) was based on expenses taken
from the Comptroller’s ledgers.
Utilities - $4,102,076 or 23.1%
The estimated System year to date expense for utilities in total is below
budget. The accrual convention to estimate this expense is based on total
YTD bills, paid and unpaid, received by the Cook County Industrial
Engineer responsible for processing the utility bills for the County.
This information is an integral part of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
Page 51 of 129

 Similar to supplies, the prior YTD September 30, 2008 estimated utilities
expense of $14,870,704 ($10,366,933 as of YTD September ’09) was
also taken from the Comptroller’s ledgers.

 Notes on Payment of "Retro" ( F N 2008) Disproportionate Share Payments
and New Medicaid Pharmacy Billing Guidelines

In June, 2009, System hospitals received $134M (net) in Disproportionate Share payments as a result of the
Medicaid State Plan Amendment (SPA) approved by CMS in December, 2008, as implemented by the
Intergovernmental Agreement executed in May, 2009; These payments, and the accompanying inpatient
recoupments, corresponded to the July 1,2008 effective date of the 'SPA';
The original timing of the submittal of the State Plan Amendment allowed for System hospitals to be eligible
for additional retroactive DSH payments for the first three quarters of Federal Fiscal Year 2008 (October,
2007 thru June, 2008);
When dialogue with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Senices (HFS) first began in 2007 on
possible DSH funding for System Hospitals, HFS raised the possibility that any DSH monies ultimately
realized by the System might be offset, in part, by recoupment for possible 'overpaymentsn to the System over
a period of years, principally for pharmacy;
Prior to releasing the F N 8 DSH monies, the HFS sought to clarify a policy provision related to the hospitalbased clinics - these are termed critical care providers (CCP's). The general issue involved the specific
provisions in State Medicaid Plan concerning the frequency of billable encounters per day. Discussions
related to this matter between HFS, the System, and System consultants were extensive over a period of
months.
As outlined in a November 5,2009 letter from HFS, the policy has been clarified such that HFS will reimburse
the System for only one CCP encounter per day, effective December 1,2009. On November 12,2009, HFS
released the retroactive DSH monies, $61.5M (net).
HFS, the System, and the System's pharmacy billing vendor have been in discussions seeking to assure
compliance with the new, pharmacy billing guidelines going forward;

Only one encounter of a given type, for any given date of service, will be accepted for payment at
the CCP encounter rate. For subsequent claims of that type, with that date of service, the claim
detail will be retained and the claim will be priced at $0.
It is important that all products and services delivered be billed. Obtaining all of the detail from the CCPs
will ensure that the individual healthcare records maintained by HFS are complete. This is important
because HFS makes the complete record available to the individual eruollee's primary care provider to
facilitate appropriate coordination of care.
HFS will place edits in its claims processing systems to ensure that no more than one encounter claim of
each type, for each date of service, will be paid at the encounter rate. This is consistent with our
application of encounter rates across all providers.
The CCP encounter rate is applicable only to the qualiwng clinics. Drugs or other products dispensed by
a phannacy that is not organizationally part of a CCP (such as a hospital pharmacy) may not bill, nor be
paid, the encounter rate. The provider charges on all claims, phannacy or otherwise, submitted to HFS
must be the usual and customary charges of the provider (those that would be charged to the general
public)--not the HFS's reimbursement rate.
A provider notice, formally conveying to the CCPs the clarifications outlined above, is forthcoming.
It is important to note that paragraph (G)(4) of the intergovernmental agreement between HFS and the
county specifies that the county, the system board, and the county providers are jointly and severally
liable for repayment of the federal funds, should that be necessary. HFS's disposition of this matter on a
"going forward" basis is not a waiver by HFS of paragraph (G)(4) of the intergovenunental agreement.
Finally, HFS intends to initiate payment of the federal fiscal year 2008 disproportionate share hospital
@SH) adjustments to your three hospitals without any offsets resulting from pharmacy claims prior to
December 1,2009. HFS estimates the total amount will be $125 million, approximately half of which
would be from a transfer of funds from the county and the balance being federal matching funds. The
particulars of the necessary transactions will be sent under separate cover through the usual channels.
The final amount will be subject to reconciliation against the federal allocation, as we account DSH
adjustments for all other qualifLing hospitals. HFS expects his transaction to take place during
November 2009.
Again, HFS is highly appreciative of the services that the Cook County Health and Hospitals System
provides to individuals who are enrolled in the State's medical assistance programs as well as the poor
and indigent residents of Cook County. HFS will continue to work, in every way possible, with you and
CCHHS, toward our common goals with respect to these vulnerable populations.
Sincerely,

IS THIS CONTRACT
SOLE SOURCE? Yes

JUSTIFICATION:
The upgrade of the Cerner Millennium clinical software application to the current release and deployment to bring Provident livt
on the same clinical system required additional vendor support to meet the project timeline. The implementation and software
upgrade of the clinical systems for CCHHS was completed in June 09. Work was completed as scheduled but as a result of this
work, the original budget for the 2008-2009 Cerner Services Contract was exceeded by 1,610,727.62. This overage was largely
due to additional training and support services necessary to support the requested system upgrade and Provident go-live.
TERMS OF REQUEST:
The original contract, number 07-45-363, was awarded by the Cook County Board on 7/1/2008 for the amount of
$6,510,382.71. An additional increase of $249,600.00 was approved by CCHHS on 2/26/09. We are requesting an increase of
$1,6 10,727.62 for implementation services.
HAS THIS BEEN REVIEWED BY CONTRACT COMPLIANCE? Yes
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THIS CONTRACT IS MBE/WBE?
Percentage unavailable contract not on site. Vendor approved in 2007.
