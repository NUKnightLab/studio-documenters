Honorable City Council:

RE: Petition No. 354 Marathon Petroleum Company request permission to
vacate a section of Oakwood from the intersection of Dix and Oakwood to
the north for 1,872.82 ft and alleys between Sanders and Oakwood.

Correction: Minor error in one part of a legal description.

Petition No. 354 Mannik Smith Group on behalf of Marathon Petroleum LP request City
Council to accept the dedication of certain lands for public street purposes being the
Oakwood Avenue reroute, also requesting the vacation and conversion to easement of
part of Oakwood Avenue and two public alleys, all in the area of Dix Avenue, Oakwood
Avenue, and Sanders Avenue. Additionally the Department of Public Works is
requesting to convert an existing greenbelt into public right-of-way from the Oakwood
Avenue reroute to the Rouge River near Powell Avenue.

The dedication and conversion to easement requested by Mannik Smith Group on behalf
of Marathon Petroleum LP is being proposed in order to integrate a planned new
administration campus into the existing re?nery and for the bene?t of creating a larger
buffer between the traveling public and the existing re?nery.

A resolution granting the petition was approved by your Honorable Body on October 28,
2014 and found in J.C.C. pages 2214- 2228.

However, a review by Engineering has been made and a minor correction to
one legal description is needed and is herewith added as a part of this corrective
resolution. The revised legal description 18 represented 1n bold and underlined. All

deletions are represented 1n held?a?d?str?ee?through.

I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.
