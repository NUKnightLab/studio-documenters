PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL
The building at 3475 Iroquois is a two-story, single-family dwelling. Exterior walls are clad with
brick and windows are currently 1/1, wood-sash units with 4/1 windows at the rooftop dormers.
The hipped roof is covered with slate shingles. Hipped-roof dormers are present at the front and
rear roof surface. A two-story bay window at the rear elevation is clad with slate tiles. Until
recently, a full-width, one-story porch was located at the building’s front elevation.

 3457 Iroquois, detail, porch prior to unapproved removal
As per the above photos, the original porch included a concrete deck with centrally-located
concrete steps and brick railing with a cast stone cap. Four, round wood Doric columns sat atop
the brick railing and supported a wood cornice with dentilated detailing and a flat roof. As per the
below photo, the historic-age front porch was recently removed without permit and/or HDC
approval. Specifically, only the square wood pilasters, concrete deck with centrally-located
concrete steps and brick railing with cast stone cap remain.

Note that
the two
wood
pilasters
concrete
deck,
concrete
steps and
brick
railing
remain

3457 Iroquois, current condition, after unapproved porch removal

 The remnants of a porch, to include a deteriorated wood deck and steps, remain at the rear of the
home.

Rear elevation, current condition. Note, remaining wood deck and steps

The rear yard is littered with debris and includes a partially collapsed garage. A concrete
ribbon driveway leads from the street/sidewalk to the remaining concrete parking apron and
foundation/slab.
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval of the
following as per the attached:
• Install a new front porch/rebuild as per the attached drawings to include 4 new
composite round columns; replace existing wood pilasters with new composite
pilasters; install a new wood cornice and flat roof (finish color not provided)
• Repair deteriorated areas of the soffit and fascia with new wood/beadboard to match
existing (painted Yellowish White)
• Install new gutters and downspouts, painted Yellowish White (size/type, material, and
location not specified)
• At rear elevation, remove existing deteriorated wood deck and steps/porch, and replace
with a new, wood, two-story porch, painted Yellowish White
• Remove existing basement windows and replace with new glassblock windows
• Landscape, to include the removal of a dead tree on the right of house, front yard;
removal of a number of small” junk trees” that have grown about 10-15 feet high,
including those in the driveway; remove “junk bushes,” existing deteriorated dog
kennel, and wire fencing
• Replace existing driveway approach, concrete ribbon driveway and apron with new
concrete ribbon driveway and apron, same location and dimension

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Note that the applicant removed the historic-age wood columns, cornice, and roof at the front
porch without HDC approval and/or permit. Please see the below photos, which depicyt the
front porch’s recent condition/level of deterioration at the structure prior to the unapproved
work. It appears clear that portions of the roof/ceiling were rotted out, however, it is not clear to
staff that all of the porch’s wood components were deteriorated to a point which merited their
wholesale removal. Also, the remaining wood pilasters proposed for replacement with new
composite pilasters do not appear to be deteriorated beyond repair. It is staff’s opinion, the
wood porch elements which were removed without approval, to include the columns and
cornice, were distinctive, character-defining features at the home, as are the remaining wood
pilasters. Note, that the standards require that “…deteriorated historic features be repaired
rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities
and, where possible, materials.” Please see the proposal to rebuild the front the porch.
Specifically, note that the applicant narrative proposes to rebuild the front porch to match the
original design. However, the current submission does not provide a dimensioned elevation
drawing of the new porch within the context of the front facade and does not provide drawings
which indicate that the original porch details will be exactly replicated. Also, note that the
submission does not provide dimensions for the section of the proposed new rear elevation
porch, nor does it provide an elevation drawing which indicates where the new rear porch will
be installed.
In regard to the proposed new 3-car garage, note that it is located well to the rear of the home
and will be minimally visible from the public right-of-way. It is staff’s opinion that the
proposed new building is generally compatible with the existing historic home. However, staff
does question the durability/lifespan of the proposed textured OSB siding/cladding.

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(1) The level of the eaves of a proposed new structure having as much or more significance for
compatibility as the room height, an average eave or cornice height shall be determined by the
same process as that described above. The proposed new structure shall have a height at the
eaves, or cornice, of not less than ninety (90) per cent of the average determined from existing
structures, and in no case shall the eaves or cornice of the proposed structure be lower than the
lowest eave or cornice height used in the computation, nor higher than the highest.

 (2) Proportion of buildings’ front facades. Proportion varies in the district, depending on age,
style, and location in a specific subdivision. Height being established by the standards above,
proportion will be established by permitting no proposed building or addition to create a front
facade wider or narrower than those existing on the same block.
(3) Proportion of openings within the facade. Window openings are virtually always taller than
wide; several windows are sometimes grouped into a combination wider than tall. Window
openings are always subdivided, the most common window type being guillotine sash, whose
area are generally further subdivided by muntins. Facades have approximately fifteen (15) per
cent to thirty-five (35) per cent of their area glazed: Sun porches with a very high proportion of
glass subdivided by mullions and muntins are common.
(4) Rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. In buildings derived from classical precedents,
voids are usually arranged in a symmetrical and evenly-spaced manner within the facade. In
examples of other styles, especially those of neo-Tudor and Victorian substyles, voids are
arranged with more freedom, but usually in a balanced composition.
(5) Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets. The spacing of the buildings is generally
determined by the setback from the side lot lines; these tend to be consistent, even though lot
width may vary. Because of the existence of several subdivisions and their related subdivision
and deed restrictions, the placement of buildings on lots varies from area to area in the district.
In the case of very wide properties, two (2) conditions exist. A very wide site may have a house
placed centrally upon it, with extensive side yard space; this occurs only with extremely large
houses by district standards. A more typical placement of houses of average size for the district
is at the side of the wide site, placed normally in relation to one of the adjoining houses. The
rest of the property is a side yard on the other side of the house, and the entrance is often
oriented toward that side yard.
(6) Rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. In those examples of classical inspiration,
entrances and porches, if any, tend to be centered on the front facade. Other examples display
more freedom with entrance and porch placement, with some having the main entrance at the
side. Porches, often permanently enclosed sun porches, are often placed at the side of the
building.
(7) Relationship of materials. The majority of the buildings are faced with brick, while many
are partially or totally stucco. There are some stone buildings; clapboard is rare, and almost
never the sole material. Wood shingle is occasionally used as a wall covering, usually at the
second floor level, and never as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile, and wooden and
asphalt shingles. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost universally used for window frames
and other functional trim, and is used in many examples for all trim. Because of the existence
of several subdivisions and their related deed restrictions, the exterior textures and materials
may vary from block to block in the district.
(8) Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of
the low-relief pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted to the smooth surface of wood or
stone trim. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without half-timbering, as a contrast to brick
surfaces is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have particular textural values where
they exist. Asphalt shingles, generally, have little textural interest, even in those types which

 purport to imitate some other variety.
(9) Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it is usually left in its
natural state, or painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors,
wood colors) and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range. Paint
colors often relate to style. The classically inspired buildings, particularly neo-Georgian,
generally have woodwork painted white, cream or in the range of those colors, including
"putty." Doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in
use on buildings of this type in the eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries on similar buildings
may be considered for suitability. Buildings of Medieval inspiration (notably neo-Tudor)
generally have painted woodwork and window frames of dark brown or cream color. Halftimbering is almost always stained dark brown. Queen Anne or late Victorian examples may
have several paint colors on a single facade. These tend to be dark in tone and frequently of the
"earth tone" family. The original colors of any house, as determined by professional analysis,
are always acceptable for that house, and may provide suggestions for similar houses.
(10) Relationship of architectural details. These generally relate to style. Neo-Georgian
buildings display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometime in stone. Areas commonly, but
not always, treated are porches, shutters, window frames, cornices, and dormer windows.
Details on Mediterranean style or vernacular buildings are often done in stone, brick, tile, and
sometimes in stucco. They include arched windows, door openings, and porches. Buildings of
medieval inspiration tend to have details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornament
on window frames, door frames, and eaves. Queen Anne or late Victorian style buildings tend
to have details in wood, stone, or molded brick commonly embellishing cornices, window
frames and door frames. In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.
(11) Relationship of roof shapes. Roofs with triangular gables and hip roofs predominate. A
few examples of the gambrel-type roof exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or hip
types, with subsidiary roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs exist primarily
on porches and sunrooms, and other minor elements; large hip roofs sometimes have relatively
small flat sections in the center.
(12) Walls of continuity. The major wall of continuity is created by the buildings, with their
uniform setbacks within the blocks. New buildings should contribute to this wall of continuity.
Where gaslights are sufficiently numerous, and where trees in rows have survived in sufficient
numbers, minor walls of continuity are created. Fences across side lots contribute to the major
wall of continuity where placed at the front yard setback line.
(13) Relationship of significant landscape features and surface treatment. The typical treatment
of individual properties is a flat front lawn area in grass turf, often subdivided by a walk
leading to the front entrance, and sometimes with a walk at the side leading to the rear.
Materials for such walks are concrete, brick, or stone, or combinations of those materials. Some
front yards have rectangular raised earthwork terraces upon which the house stands. These
unpaved terraces have sloping embankments or brick and/or stone retaining walls at the change
of grade. Foundation plantings, often of a deciduous character, characteristic of the period
1895-1930, are present virtually without exception. Hedges between properties, and ornamental
front yard fences or hedges are not uncommon. The American elm is virtually extinct in the
district, though once the dominant tree. Replacement trees should be characteristic of the area

 and period, though only a disease-resistant American elm would be a practical choice.
Plantings of new trees should be directed toward the restoration of the former straight-line rows
of large trees on the front yards and "tree lawns." Straight side driveways leading from the
street to rear garages exist, but alley-facing garages are common, particularly in the southern
portion of the district. Where alley-facing garages are common, the lack of driveways lends a
unity to the succession of front lawns. Driveway materials include concrete, brick and gravel.
Side lots are not uncommon in the district, and a number of these form a part of the original site
plan for the residence. Such side lots are usually landscaped, often fenced at or near the setback
line, and very occasionally contain paved areas such as a tennis court. The street right-of-way
of eighty (80) feet combined with a pavement width of between twenty-four (24) and twentynine (29) feet creates wide "tree lawns" or berm areas, which adds to the generous ambience of
the urban landscape of the district. Street pavements are now asphalt; cut stone curbs still exist
in portions of the district. Alleys are frequently paved with brick, particularly where alley
facing garages are common. Fencing ranges widely in type; fencing in public view was
generally designed to compliment the style, design material, and date of the residence.
(14) Relationship of open space to structures. Open space in the district occurs in the form of
vacant land, a city park, school yards for the Waldorf and Nichols Schools, and side lots.
Where an original or early arrangement of a house and grounds included and still includes
landscaped lots which form part of the landscaping plan for the residence, such landscaped lots
are significant landscape features.
(15) Scale of facades and facade elements. There is a variety in scale from block to block and
style to style; most houses have a large and substantial appearance. The size and complexity of
facade elements and details either accentuate or subdue the scale of the facades. Facade
elements have been determined by what is appropriate for the style. Large wings at the front are
atypical, while small wings at the side, usually in the form of sunrooms and sun porches, are
common. Window sash are usually subdivided by muntins, which affects the apparent scale of
the windows within the facades.
(16) Directional expression of front elevations. In general, the expression of direction is neutral.
(17) Rhythm of building setbacks. Because of the existence of various subdivisions and their
related subdivision and deed restrictions, setbacks vary from area to area within the district,
though they are consistent within each block or area. The varying designs of the houses,
occasionally with slight setbacks in the facades, cause the houses to relate to the front setback
line in different ways; this creates a slight variation in the setback line. Nevertheless, within
each block or area a wall of continuity is created.
(18) Relationship of lot coverage. Lot coverage ranges from fifty (50) per cent to twelve (12)
per cent or less in the case of homes with large yards. Most homes are in the twenty (20) per
cent to thirty (30) per cent range of lot coverage.
(19) Degree of complexity within the facade. The degree of complexity has been determined by
what is typical and appropriate for a given style. The classically inspired buildings usually have
simple, rectangular facades with varying amounts of ornamentation. Other styles, such as
"Queen Anne" and those of Medieval inspiration, frequently have facades complicated by
gables, bays, slight setbacks, porches, and occasionally, turrets.

 (20) Orientation, vistas, overviews. While most of the buildings are oriented toward the street,
it is not unusual for an entrance to face the side, especially in the case of a landscaped side lot
or corner house.
The street facade in these cases is well coordinated with the rest of the street facades. Garages
are frequently oriented either toward an alley or a side street; almost all garages are detached
and at the rear of the lot. In those few cases where pre-1930 houses have attached garages, they
are at the rear and are entered from the side or rear. The doors of such attached garages are
generally not visible from the street.
(21) Symmetric or asymmetric appearance. Neo-Georgian and other classically inspired
buildings are generally symmetrical. Other styles, including the neo-Tudor, are generally
asymmetrical, but balanced compositions.
(22) General environmental character. The Indian Village District, with its long, straight streets,
its hierarchy of walls of continuity (lamps, trees, buildings) and its large, dignified homes, has
an urban, substantial, low density residential character.
RECOMMENDATION
It is staff’s opinion that the erection of the proposed new garage will not result in the removal
of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize the property and that
the garage itself is generally compatible with the existing historic home. It is also staff’s
opinion that the proposed new landscaping, hardscape, basement windows, debris removal, and
gutters/downspouts will not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. Staff
therefore recommends that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for
these work items because they meet the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation,
standards # 2.) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The
removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property
shall be avoided and # 9. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and
architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 10.)
New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired. However, staff does recommend that the Commission issue
this approval with the following conditions:
•
•
•

•

The garage shall be clad with lapped composite/Hardi siding with a smooth
finish/texture.
The color of the new garage’s exterior doors and windows shall be Yellowish White, to
match building’s the trim color
The applicant shall provide HDC staff the dimensions of the existing hardscape and the
proposed new/replacement hardscape (driveway approach, ribbon driveway, and rear
yard parking apron) so that they might verify that the new will replicate the old/existing
prior to the issuance of the COA. If the application proposes to expand the existing
hardscape footprint, HDC staff shall forward this portion of the proposal to the
Commission for review at a future meeting.
The garage windows shall be aluminum or aluminum-clad wood units

 In regard to the front porch proposal, the applicant has stated that he plans on to rebuilding the
front porch to match the original design. However, the submitted drawings are not dimensioned
and do not provide drawingswhich indicate that the original porch details will be exactly
replicated. Also, although the proposed new rear porch generally appears to be appropriate, the
submission does not provide dimensions for the section of the porch, nor does it provide a rear
elevation drawing which indicates where the new will be installed. Staff therefore recommends
that the Commission issue COA work proposed at the front and rear porches because they meet
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation, standards # 6) Deteriorated historic
features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires
replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. However, staff
does recommend that the Commission issue this approval with the following conditions:
•
•

•

•

The applicant shall retain the two remaining wood pilasters at the front elevation.
The applicant shall provide HDC staff a dimensioned elevation drawing which depicts
the building’s front elevation; the existing wood pilasters, brick walls, and concrete
steps; and the proposed new columns, cornice, and roof prior to the issuance of the
project COA. HDC Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the
new dimensioned elevation drawing prior to the issuance of the project COA. If HDC
staff determines that any of the new porch elements do not exactly replicate the historic
porch, staff shall forward the porch proposal to the commission for review at a future
meeting.
The applicant shall provide drawings to HDC staff which indicate that the original front
porch cornice and columns will be exactly replicated in material, dimension, style/type,
and detailing prior to the issuance of the project COA. HDC Staff shall be afforded the
opportunity to review and approve the new detail drawings. If HDC staff determines
that any of these new elements do not exactly replicate the historic porch, staff shall
forward the porch proposal to the Commission for review at a future meeting.
The applicant shall provide HDC staff a dimensioned elevation drawing which depicts
the building’s rear elevation and the proposed new porch prior to the issuance of the
project COA. HDC Staff shall be afforded the opportunity to review and approve the
new dimensioned elevation drawing prior to the issuance of the project COA. If HDC
staff determines that any of the new porch does not meet the Standards, staff shall
forward the porch proposal to the commission for review at a future meeting.

Below are the Current Photos of the backyard, driveway and glassblock windows. We are planning on
cleaning up debris in the yard, replacing the driveway and garage slab, building a new garage and
installing new glassblock windows

       Description of Existing Condition:
(A)Front Porch: At present the front porch roof, pillars and supporting wood is completely water
damaged and in need of complete replacement. Pillars are split and damaged and roof sheathing has in
numeral leaks and sunlight is visible in numerous areas through the roof decking. Porch ceiling
completely non-existent.
Explanation of us demolishing the porch without approval: Without getting your approval, we
did demolish the wood portion of the front porch. We really should have waited for your
approval. The thinking was that it was clearly not salvageable and 90% of the wood lumber was
completely rotted and beyond any possibility of repair. In our expert opinion there was not even
a remote possibility that it could be salvaged. It had and has to be replaced. Knowing that we
demolished it. Again, sorry, we should have waited for your approval.
(B) Back Porches (both stories): At the back of the house, the 2-story porch is completely removed and
needs to be replaced. There is a porch for the lower, and a porch for the upper. Only the lower porch
exists, which is water damaged, unsafe stairs, porch incline is not correct and needs complete
replacement
(C) Landscaping: The landscaping of the property has not be addressed in many many years. We are
intending to make the landscaping look very nice and commensurate with the beautiful Indian village
neighborhood. There about 3 dumpsters of junk, trash and a collapsed garage in the backyard alone. As
you can see from the front photo, there is a large tree to the right of the property that is leaning over
the house. The top of half the tree has been cut off and the tree is not attractive any longer. I believe
the street would look better without it. There are many other nice trees on the lot. We plan on
removing that and grinding the stump down. There is a random wire fence dog kennel that is in the
middle of the side yard, and many junk trees about 10-15 feet tall that have grown in the driveway, side
yard and backyard. In the lawn portion of the side lot there is an enormous amount of brush that has
grown about 4-5 feet high.
(D) Soffits/Fascia/Gutters:
Replace matching soffits and fascia boards with new soffits and facia boards. There are no gutters on the
house at present
(E) Driveway:
Driveway is strips of concrete with grass inbetween them from the sidewalk to about 10 feet past the
back of the house. At that point it converts to a full driveway sweeping open to a 30ft wide garage.
Garage slab is old, and in need of replacement. Driveway is also in need of replacement, has many
cracks and concrete strips are pitched and not horizontal in many places
(F) Garage:
There was obviously a garage in the past because of the slab. At present there is no garage.

(G) Glassblock: Currently on the basement windows there are old and damaged single pane wood
windows.

 Description of the project:
Front Porch:
For the front porch, the actual floor and brick of the porch floor is completey fine. We will be leaving
that. What is damaged is the porch roof and the pillars and supporting wood beams. As you can see
from the photos the roof on that has not been replaced in many many years and has made the structure
a safety hazard. Pillars are split in 2 so they are not usable and almost all the dimensional structural
lumber that holds up the porch roof decking is water damaged and soiled. We plan on rebuilding the
porch as it currently stands. Including matching the exterior trim around the house We will reinstall an
architectural shingle as the final roofing (at the present roof pitch it is barely visible)
Back Porch:
The back porch is completely missing the 2nd floor. We plan on removing the first floor porch which is
damaged and is not structurally sound anymore. Afterwards we will rebuild the 1st and 2nd floor porches.
Landscaping: Clean up landscaping. Removing 1 large dead tree to the right of the front of the house.
Remove all smaller junk trees, remove all trash and debris from the exterior of the property including
waterlogged firewood, barrels and collapsed garage.

Soffits/Fascia/Gutters:
Remove rotted boards, reinstall matching beadboard or 1-by wood as necessary. Paint and install
gutters and downspout to match trim
Driveway: Remove and replace the driveway and garage slab. Repour concrete strips and then enlarge
to full driveway and full slab (30x20) for garage. The driveway and all concrete work is designed to
replicate the current concrete work, with the exception that the current garage slab is 22 feet deep and
the proposal is for a 20 foot deep garage. Besides that no alterations from the original historical design
are made. Please see site plan below.
Garage: We are proposing to build a 30 (wide) x 20 (deep) 3 car garage. Plans are attached. The man
door on the garage will be on the right side of the garage near the front of the garage.
Glassblock: Remove existing wood single pane windows and replace with standard glassblock windows.
Install wood frame and screen over the exterior of the glass block to comply with Historic commission
requirements
