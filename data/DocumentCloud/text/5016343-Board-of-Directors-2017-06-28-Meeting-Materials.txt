OTHER MATTERS

PUBLIC COMMENT

Mr. Lewand called for public comment and stated that two minutes would be given.
Mr. John Lauve of Holly, Michigan stated the following:

?Tomorrow we are having a public hearing by the City Council on the Plan for this project.
Planning is something that is done in advance of the project, but you guys have taken care
of it because you have watched very diligently and seen that you don?t have to follow the
rules. That also has to be mailed out to every taxpayer the notice.

Apparently, the Arena deal, this property was sold to ilitich. This property for the Wayne
State deal was sold to llitich, and now you are going to give him this other piece of property
over here. Here is the layout of what has taken place.

They came up with this catalyst deal. Notice how they came along here, they came around
and swooped around this piece of property right next to the ball park and continued all
around. This whole thing was constructed for one purpose and that was to help out liitch.
He?s gotten enough and now he wants $100 million more because he deserves it.

He promised to fix these buildings up when he put the stadium in and then he used it as a
temptation to justify this. And here is our favorite right here. That project is in the cataiyst
project and instead we are going to build a new Fox headquarters instead of ?xing up these
buildings. Here?s two buildings that he owns. This is from the Arena site on Cass. He
owns that Hotel next to the Masonic Temple. if we took the money and made the Masonic
Temple a project, then we couid ?x up that neighborhood instead of a garage and these
little headquarters.

Here is another set of buildings that he owns right across the street. Notice the windows
are air windows. So we are not fixing up properties that need to be ?xed up. We are being
irresponsible by just rubber stamping his new headquarters. And that is corruptionmthat
is what it is.?

Mr. Lewand advised Mr. Lauve that his time was up and thanked him for his comments.

2017 DDA Bonds pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement for the purposes authorized herein,
the Authority hereby irrevocably pledges all of its right, title and interest in and to receipts of the

The Authority shall irrevocably direct or cause the Series 2014A MSF Trustee to transfer

collection for deposit in the same manner.

It is the intention of the Authority that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, this pledge
shall be valid and binding from the time when it is made, that the Series 2017 General Tax
Increment Revenues and the Series 2017 Catalyst Project Revenues so pledged and then or
thereafter to be released and transferred to the Authority shall immediately be subject to the lien
of such pledge without any physical delivery or further act, and that the lien of such pledge and
the obligation to perform the contractual provisions in the Series 2017 DDA Indenture and herein
made by the Authority shall constitute ?rst and senior liens pursuant to Act 197 (including, without
limitation, Section 16(2) thereof), having priority over any or all other obligations and liabilities
of the Authority, and shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in
tort, contract or otherwise against the Authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice
thereof.

For so long as the Senior Authority Obligations remain outstanding, they are secured by a
?rst and senior lien on the General Tax Increment Revenues pursuant to the Master Resolution,
and for so long as the Series 2014A MSF Bonds remain outstanding, they are secured by a ?rst
and senior lien on the Net General Tax Increment Revenues and Catalyst Project Revenues
pursuant to the Series 2014A MSF Indenture and the related authorizing resolution of the
Authority, and the liens created hereunder are limited to the Series 2017 General Tax Increment
Revenues and the Series 2017 Catalyst Project Revenues.

Resolution and Section 614 of the Series 2017 DDA Indenture.

The Authority agrees not to amend any existing agreement, enter into any agreement,
approve the issuance of any bond, note or other evidence of indebtedness or approve any
amendments to the Development Plan or take any other action which grants a priority or lien
on the Series 2017 General Tax Increment Revenues or the Series 2017 Catalyst Project Revenues
which is not subordinate to the priority and liens created hereunder, or (ii) which creates any
additional liens on the Series 2017 General Tax Increment Revenues or the Series 2017 Catalyst
Project Revenues which will, or can reasonably be expected to, otherwise jeopardize the

8

Page 39 of 102

Authority?s ability to pay all amounts due and payable under the Series 2017 DDA Bonds
as provided in this Resolution and the Series 2017 DDA Indenture.

in the Series 2017 DDA Indenture or the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to the contrary, the obligations
of the Authority with respect to the Series 2017 DDA Indenture and the Series 2017 DDA Bonds
shall be special, limited obligations of the Authority payable solely from the Series 2017 Pledged

Means by the Remarketing Agent to the Trustee and the Issuer not later than 12:00 noon on the
Variable Rate Adjustment Date for each Daily Rate Period and Weekly Rate Period and not

Date for each Term Rate Period and (B) available on any Business Day between 4:00 pm. and

attempt to contact the Remarketing Agent.

(ii) If the Remarketing Agent fails for any reason to determine or notify
the Trustee of the Variable Rate for any Variable Rate Period when required hereunder: (A) for

All determinations of Variable Rates pursuant to this Section shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee, the Credit Facility Provider and the holders
of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to which such rates are applicable. Failure by the Trustee to give
any notice as herein provided, any defect therein, and any failure by any Series 2017 DDA

payment of the purchase price to be made after an effective election or in any way change such
owner?s obligation to tender the Series 2017 DDA Bonds for purchase.

Variable Rate Adjustment Date is not a Business Day).

(C) Term Rates. Each Term Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent shall represent
the lowest annual rate of interest, expressed as a percentage and rounded to the nearest one
thousandth of one percent, which would, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent, enable a

37

Page 89 of 102

particular Series 2017 DDA Bond to be remarketed at the principal amount thereof on such
Variable Rate Adjustment Date for a Term Rate Period. A Term Rate shall be determined by the
Remarketing Agent for each Term Rate Period not later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day

Business Day; provided, however, that if the conversion is from a Term Rate Period to a different
Variable Rate Period or a Term Rate Period of a different length, the Variable Rate Conversion
Date shall be limited to the Business Day succeeding the last day of the Term Rate Period or a day
that is a permitted optional redemption date for Bonds in the Term Rate Period pursuant to Section
of this Trust Indenture.

Variable Rate Conversion Date shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent in the manner
provided above on the date set forth above applicable to the Variable Rate Period to which the
conversion shall be made. Notice of such Variable Rates shall be given or made available on the
dates and to the parties specified above in the manner provided above applicable to the Variable
Rate Period to which the conversion shall be made.

The Issuer may revoke its election to effect a conversion of the
interest rate on the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to a Variable Rate by giving written notice of such
revocation to the Issuer, the Trustee, the Remarketing Agent and the Purchaser at any time prior
to the setting of the Variable Rate by the Remarketing Agent with the effect described in Section
hereof.

Section 206. Certain Changes in Term Rate Period not a Conversion. In the event that
a Term Rate Period is shorter than the immediately preceding Term Rate Period due to the
occurrence of the Maturity Date of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds, or due to the occurrence of an
Extension Term Rate Period, such difference in length of the last Term Rate Period shall not be
considered to cause a Variable Rate Conversion Date to occur and the conditions required by
Section to convert from a Term Rate Period of one length to a Term Rate Period of a
different length shall not be required to be satis?ed.

Section 207. Flexible Rates and Interest Periods; Conversions to Flexible Rate Periods.

(A) Flexible Rates and Interest Periods. A Flexible Rate for each Interest Period shall
be determined as follows:

The Interest Periods for each Bond bearing interest at a Flexible Rate
shall be of such duration, not less than one day and not exceeding 270 days, as may be offered by
the Remarketing Agent and speci?ed by the purchaser as hereinafter described in subparagraph



41

Page 93 of 102

(ii) The Flexible Rate for each Interest Period shall be effective from
and including the commencement date of such period through and including the last day thereof.
Each such Flexible Rate shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent in connection with the sale
of the Series 2017 DDA Bond or Series 2017 DDA Bonds to which it relates pursuant to clause
hereof, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 204 hereof. Each Flexible Rate
determined by the Remarketing Agent shall represent the lowest annual rate of interest, expressed
as a percentage and rounded to the nearest one thousandth of one percent, which would, in the
judgment of the Remarketing Agent, enable a particular Series 2017 DDA Bond to be remarketed
at the principal amount thereof on such Flexible Rate Adjustment Date given the applicable
Interest Period for such Series 2017 DDA Bond; provided, however, a Series 2017 DDA Bond
may be remarketed at a different price other than the principal amount thereof if there is delivered
to the Trustee and the Issuer by the Issuer a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel. The Remarketing
Agent shall determine each Flexible Rate and Interest Period on or before 1:00 pm. on the ?rst
day of each Interest Period.

The Remarketing Agent shall offer for sale and use its best efforts
to ?nd purchasers for all of the Bonds required to be purchased on the Repurchase Date at the
Repurchase Price. In remarketing such Bonds, the Remarketing Agent shall offer and accept
purchase commitments for the Bonds for such Interest Periods and at such Flexible Rates as it
deems to be advisable in order to minimize the net interest cost on the Bonds under prevailing
market conditions. The foregoing notwithstanding, during a Flexible Rate Period when the Credit
Facility is in full force and effect, no Interest Period may be established which exceeds the shortest
of (A) 270 days, (B) the Interest Coverage Period, if any, (C) the remaining number of days prior
to any Mandatory Tender Date, or (D) the remaining number of days prior to a date on which such
Bonds are subject to redemption pursuant to Article hereof, if and to the extent necessary to
enable the Trustee to make such purchases on or before such date.

(iv) If the Remarketing Agent fails for any reason to determine or notify
the Trustee of the Interest Period or Flexible Rate when required hereunder, the Interest Period
shall be of the shortest permitted duration and the Flexible Rate shall be equal to the SIFMA Index.

All determinations of Flexible Rates and Interest Periods pursuant
to this Section shall be conclusive and binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee, the Credit Facility
Provider and the holders of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to which such rates and periods are
applicable.

(B) Conversions to Flexible Rate Periods. At the option of the Issuer, the Series 2017
DDA Bonds may be converted from a Variable Rate Period or an Index Floating Rate Period to a
Flexible Rate Period, as follows:

In the case of a conversion from a Daily or Weekly Rate Period,
the Flexible Rate Conversion Date shall be a Business Day; in the case of a conversion from a
Term Rate Period, the Flexible Rate Conversion Date shall be the Business Day succeeding the
last day of the Term Rate Period or a day that is a permitted optional redemption date for Bonds
in the Term Rate Period pursuant to Section 501 of this Trust Indenture; and in the case
of a conversion from an Index Floating Rate Period, the Flexible Rate Conversion Date shall be
an Interest Payment Date.

42

Page 94 of 102

(ii) The Issuer shall give written notice of any such conversion to the
Trustee, the Remarketing Agent, the Concessionaire (during the Initial Term Rate Period), the
Credit Facility Provider and the Purchaser not less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the date
on which the Trustee is required to notify the Bondholders of the conversion pursuant to
subparagraph below. Such notice shall specify the Flexible Rate Conversion Date. Such
notice shall be accompanied by a written statement from the Remarketing Agent, addressed to
the Issuer, the Credit Facility Provider and the Trustee, to the effect that the Remarketing Agent
has determined that, in its judgment, a change to Flexible Rates from the Variable Rate or the
Index Floating Rate would result in the lowest aggregate cost, taking into account interest and any
other then determinable fees and expenses, being payable with respect to the Series 2017 DDA
Bonds during the twelve month period commencing with the Flexible Rate Conversion Date or 
an approval in writing of such Flexible Rate Period by the Issuer or an Authorized Of?cer or 
an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that neither such statement nor such approval is required
for the continued validity and enforceability of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds in accordance with
their terms. Together with such notice, the Issuer shall ?le with the Credit Facility Provider and
the Trustee a form of a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel. No change to a Flexible Rate shall
become effective unless the Issuer shall also ?le with the Credit Facility Provider and the Trustee,
a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel dated the Flexible Rate Conversion Date. Notwithstanding
the provisions of the preceding two sentences, such Opinion shall not be required to be delivered
with respect to a conversion from a Daily Rate Period or Weekly Rate Period or from a Term Rate
Period with a duration of one year or less.

Not less than ?fteen (15) days prior to the Flexible Rate Conversion
Date, the Trustee shall mail a written notice of the conversion to the holders of the Series 2017
DDA Bonds, specifying the Flexible Rate Conversion Date and setting forth the matters required
to be stated pursuant to Section hereof with respect to mandatory tender of Series 2017
DDA Bonds governed by such Section.

(iv) The Issuer may revoke its election to effect a conversion of the
interest rate on any Series 2017 DDA Bonds to a Flexible Rate Period by giving written notice of

next succeeding such Computation Date and interest at such SIFMA Index Rate shall accrue each
day during the Index Interest Period to which such Computation Date relates, commencing on and

43

Page 95 of 102

including the first day of such Index Interest Period to and including the last day of such Index
Interest Period. The SIFMA Index Rate shall be rounded upward to the second decimal place.
following the determination of each SIFMA Index Rate, the Calculation Agent shall give
notice thereof to the Trustee and the Issuer. If the SIFMA Index Rate is not determined by the
Calculation Agent on the Computation Date, the rate of interest born on such Index Floating Rate
Bonds shall be the rate in effect on the immediately preceding SIFMA Reset Date until the
Calculation Agent next determines the SIFMA Index Rate as required hereunder.

(2) LIBOR Index Rate. During each LIB OR Index Rate Period, the Series 2017
DDA Bonds shall, subject to subsections (3) and (4) of this Section 209(a), bear interest at the
LIBOR Index Rate from time to time in effect. The Calculation Agent shall determine the LIBOR
Index Rate on each Computation Date, and such LIBOR Index Rate shall become effective on the
LIBOR Reset Date next succeeding the Computation Date and interest at such LIBOR Index Rate
shall accrue each day during the Index Interest Period to which such Computation Date relates,
commencing on and including the first day of such Index Interest Period to and including the last
day of such Index Interest Period. The LIBOR Index Rate shall be rounded upward to the nearest
one-eighth of one percent. following the determination of the LIBOR Index Rate, the
Calculation Agent shall give notice thereof to the Trustee and the Issuer. If the LIB OR Index Rate
is not determined by the Calculation Agent on the Computation Date, the rate of interest born on
such Index Floating Rate Bonds shall be the rate in effect for the immediately preceding Index
Interest Period until the Calculation Agent next determines the LIBOR Index Rate as required
hereunder.

(3) Aay'ustment to Index Rates. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 209, upon the occurrence and continuation of an Event of Default, from and after the
effective date of such Event of Default, the interest rate for Series 2017 DDA Bonds in an Index
Floating Rate Period or any Unremarketed Bonds (other than Unremarketed Bonds in the Initial
Term Rate Period, which shall bear interest at the Default Rate) shall be equal to the greater of (A)
the Default Rate and (B) the interest rate that otherwise would be applicable to the Series 2017
DDA Bonds or the Unremarketed Bonds but for the provisions of this paragraph, payable on
demand to the holders of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds or the Unremarketed Bonds.

(4) Taxable Rate. From and after any Taxable Date, the interest rate on Series
2017 DDA Bonds in an Index Floating Rate Period or any Unremarketed Bonds shall be equal to
the Taxable Rate.

2017 DDA Bonds may be converted from a Variable Rate Period or a Flexible Rate Period to an
Index Floating Rate Period, as follows:

In the case of a conversion from a Variable Rate Period, the Index
Floating Rate Conversion Date shall be a Business Day; provided, however, that in the case of a
conversion from a Term Rate Period, the Index Floating Rate Conversion Date shall be the
Business Day succeeding the last day of the Term Rate Period or a day that is a permitted optional
redemption date for Bonds in the Term Rate Period pursuant to Section of this Trust
Indenture. In the case of a conversion from a Flexible Rate Period, the Index Floating Rate
Conversion Date shall be the last regularly scheduled Interest Payment Date on which interest is

44

Page 96 of 102

payable for any Interest Periods theretofore established for the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to be
converted.

(ii) The Issuer shall give written notice of any such conversion to the
Issuer, the Trustee, the Remarketing Agent, the Concessionaire (during the Initial Term Rate

Conversion Date, the Trustee shall mail a written notice of the conversion to the holders of all
Series 2017 DDA Bonds to be converted; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not mail such

income derived under, and as otherwise provided under this Indenture, without recourse to any
other revenues of the Issuer or to any other properties or assets of the Issuer now owned or hereafter

entitled to any security or bene?t under this Indenture unless and until a certi?cate of
authentication on such Bond substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit shall have been
duly executed by the Trustee, and such executed certi?cate of the Trustee upon any such Bond
shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this
Indenture. The Trustee?s certi?cate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been
executed by it if signed by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, but it shall not be necessary that
the same signatory sign the certi?cate of authentication on all of the Bonds issued hereunder.

Section 214. Form of Bonds and Temporary Bonds. The Bonds issued under this
Indenture shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, with such appropriate

Section 216. Mutilated, Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Bonds. In the event a temporary or
de?nitive Bond is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee may
authenticate a new Bond of like form, date, maturity and denomination as that mutilated, lost,
stolen or destroyed; provided that, in the case of any mutilated Bond, such mutilated Bond shall
?rst be surrendered to the Trustee, and in the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Bond, there shall
be ?rst furnished to the Trustee evidence of such loss, theft or destruction satisfactory to the Issuer
and the Trustee, together with indemnity satisfactory to them. The replacement of any Bond under
this Section shall be in accordance with Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated Section 129.131 et.
seq. In the event any such Bond shall have matured, instead of issuing a duplicate Bond, the Issuer
or the Trustee may pay the same without surrender thereof. The Issuer and the Trustee may charge
the holder or owner of such Bond with their reasonable fees and expenses in this connection.

Section 217. Transfer and Exchange of Bonds; Persons Treated as Owners. The Bond
Register shall be kept by the Trustee at its Principal Of?ce. The Bond Register may be inspected
and copied to the extent and in the circumstances described in Section 606 hereof.

Upon surrender for transfer of any Bond at the Principal Of?ce of the Trustee, the Issuer
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or
transferees a new fully registered Bond or Bonds of the same series and maturity and in an
Authorized Denomination for the aggregate principal amount which the registered owner is
entitled to receive. Any Bond or Bonds may be exchanged at said of?ce of the Trustee for a like
aggregate principal amount of Bond or Bonds of the same maturity of other Authorized
Denominations. The execution by the Issuer of any Bond shall constitute full and due authorization
of such Bond, and the Trustee shall thereby be authorized to authenticate, date and deliver such
Bond.

On each date on which the Trustee authenticates and delivers a Bond, it shall complete the
information required to be inserted by the form of Bond and shall keep a record of such
information.

All Bonds presented for transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written instrument
or instruments of transfer or authorization for exchange, in form and with guaranty of signature
satisfactory to the Trustee, duly executed by the registered owner or by such owner?s duly
authorized attorney in writing.

No service charge shall be imposed upon the owner for any exchange or transfer of Bonds.
The Issuer and the Trustee may, however, require payment by the person requesting an exchange
or transfer of Bonds of a sum suf?cient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto, except in the case of the issuance of a Bond or Bonds for the
unredeemed portion of a Bond surrendered for redemption.

The Issuer, the Trustee and any Paying Agent shall not be required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Bond after notice calling such Bond or portion thereof for redemption has
been mailed or (ii) during the 15-day period next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption
of the Bonds of the same maturity.

52

Page 104 of 199

New Bonds delivered upon any transfer or exchange shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, 
evidencing the same debt as the Bonds surrendered, shall be secured by this Indenture and shall be
entitled to all of the security and bene?ts hereof to the same extent as the Bond surrendered.

The Issuer and the Trustee may treat the registered owner of any Bond as the absolute
owner thereof for all purposes, whether or not such Bond shall be overdue, and shall not be bound
by any notice to the contrary. All payments of or on account of the principal of and premium, if
any, and interest on any such Bond as herein provided shall be made only to or upon the written
order of the registered owner thereof or his legal representative, but such registration may be
changed as herein provided. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge
the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.

Any Bond surrendered for the purpose of payment or retirement or for exchange or transfer
or for replacement pursuant to this section shall be cancelled upon surrender thereof to the Trustee
or any Paying Agent; provided that a Holder of Index Floating Rate Bonds shall not be required to
present Series 2017 DDA Bonds for payment except on an Index Floating Rate Purchase Date or
in connection with a redemption of all of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds held by such Holder or on
the Maturity Date. Any such Bonds cancelled by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall
be transmitted by such Paying Agent to the Trustee. Certi?cation of Bonds cancelled by
the Trustee and Bonds cancelled by a Paying Agent other than the Trustee which are transmitted
to the Trustee shall be made to the Issuer and to the Issuer. Cancelled Bonds may be destroyed by
the Trustee unless instructions to the contrary are received from the Issuer.

Section 218. Boole-Entry Only System. During any Index Floating Rate Period, unless
otherwise directed by the Purchaser, the Series 2017 DDA Bonds shall be held in physical form.
During any Rate Period other than an Index Floating Rate Period, it is intended that the Bonds be
registered so as to participate in a securities depository system with DTC (the System?), as
set forth herein, and the ownership of each such Bond shall be registered on the Bond Register in
the name of Cede Co., or any successor thereto, as nominee for DTC. The Issuer and the Trustee
are authorized to execute and deliver such letters to or agreements with DTC as shall be necessary
to effectuate the DTC System, including the Letter of Representations.

Section 218. With respect to Bonds registered in the Bond Register in the name of Cede
Co., as nominee of DTC, the Issuer and the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to
any broker?dealer, bank or other ?nancial institution for which DTC holds Bonds from time to
time as securities depository (each such broker-dealer, bank or other ?nancial institution being
referred to herein as a ?Depository Participant?) or to any person on behalf of whom such a
Depository Participant holds an interest in the Bonds (each such person being herein referred to as
an ?Indirect Participant?). Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, the Issuer and
the Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation with respect to the accuracy of the records
of DTC, Cede Co., any Depository Participant or any Indirect Participant with respect to the
ownership interest in the Bonds, the delivery to any Depository Participant or any Indirect
Participant or any other person, other than a registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond
Register, of any notice with respect to the Bonds, including any notice of redemption, the
payment to any Depository Participant or Indirect Participant or any other person, other than a
registered owner of a Bond as shown in the Bond Register, of any amount with respect to principal
of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Bonds, any consent given by the Securities Depository
as registered owner, or subject to Article V, the selection by the Securities Depository or any
Depository Participant of any bene?cial owners to receive payment if Bonds are redeemed in part.
While in the DTC System, no person other than Cede Co., or any successor thereto, as nominee
for DTC, shall receive a Bond certi?cate with respect to any Bond. Upon delivery by DTC to the
Trustee of written notice from DTC to the effect that DTC has determined to substitute a new
nominee in place of Cede Co., and subject to the provisions hereof with respect to the payment
of interest by the mailing of checks or drafts to the registered owners of Bonds at the close of
business on the Record Date applicable to any interest payment date, the name ?Cede Co.? in
this Indenture shall refer to such new nominee of DTC.

The Issuer has executed the Letter of Representations. Such Letter of Representations is
for the purpose of effectuating the book?entry only system only and shall not be deemed to amend,
supersede or supplement the terms of this Indenture which are intended to be complete without
reference to the Letter of Representations. In the event of any con?ict between the terms of the
Letter of Representations and the terms of this Indenture, the terms of this Indenture shall control.
The Securities Depository may exercise the rights of a Bondholder hereunder only in accordance
with the terms hereof applicable to the exercise of such rights.

Section 219. Successor Securities Depository; Transfers Outside Book-Entry Only
System. In the event that the Issuer determines that DTC is incapable of discharging its
responsibilities described herein and in the Letter of Representations, the Letter of
Representations shall be terminated for any reason or the Issuer (with the consent of the
Trustee) determines that it is in the best interests of the bene?cial owners of the Bonds that they
be able to obtain certi?cated Bonds, the Issuer shall appoint a successor securities depository,
quali?ed to act as such under Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, notify DTC and DTC Participants of the appointment of such successor securities
depository and transfer one or more separate Bond certi?cates to such successor securities
depository or (ii) notify DTC of the availability through DTC of Bond certi?cates and transfer one
or more separate Bond certi?cates to DTC Participants having Bonds credited to their DTC
accounts. In such event, the Bonds shall no longer be restricted to being registered on the Bond
Register in the name of Cede Co., as nominee of DTC but may be registered in the name of the

54

Page 106 of 199

successor security depository, or its nominee, in whatever name or names registered owners of
Bonds transferring or exchanging Bonds shall designate, in accordance with the provisions hereof.

Section 220. Payments and Notices to Cede Co. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Indenture to the contrary, so long as any Bond is registered in the name of Cede Co., as
nominee of DTC, all payments with respect to principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such
Bond and all notices with respect to such Bond shall be made and given, respectively, in the
manner provided in the Letter of Representations. The Trustee shall request in each notice sent to
Cede Co. pursuant to the terms of this Indenture that Cede Co. forward or cause to be
forwarded such notice to the DTC Participants.

the Trustee shall out of such proceeds deposit the funds as follows:

Deposit Ito the credit of the Project Fund established by
Section 302 hereof; and

the acquisition, construction, renovation, remodeling and equipping of the Project a separate
account to be known as the ?Project Fund Detroit DDA Development Area No. I Project 
Series 20] 7? (the ?Project Fund?), to the credit of which deposits shall be made as required by
the provisions of Section 301 hereof. Any moneys received by the Trustee from any source for
the payment of Costs of the Project shall be deposited in the Project Fund. The moneys in the
Project Fund shall be held in trust by the Trustee, shall be applied to the payment of the Costs of
the Project and, pending such application, shall be held as trust funds under this Indenture until
paid out or transferred as provided in this Section 302.

(B) Moneys deposited in the Project Fund shall be paid out from time to time by the
Trustee, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Requisition Certi?cate signed by an Authorized Of?cer
of the Issuer, together with the attachments described in the Requisition Certi?cate, in order to
pay, or to reimburse the Concessionaire for payment made, for the Costs of the Project and such
other costs related to the Project as are permitted under Act 197 and the Development Plan.

(C) Upon receipt of each Requisition Certi?cate of the Concessionaire (as approved in
writing by the Issuer) made pursuant to subsection (B) above, the Trustee shall pay the costs set
forth in such Requisition Certi?cate out of moneys in the Project Fund; provided, however in
making such payments the Trustee may conclusively rely upon such Requisition Certi?cate and
the related attachments, provided such Requisition Certi?cate and related attachments satisfy the

55

Page 107 of 199

requirements set forth in subsection (B) above. If for any reason the Issuer or Concessionaire
should decide prior to the payment of any item in said Requisition Certi?cate not to pay such item,
it shall give written notice of such decision to the Trustee and thereupon the Trustee shall not make
such payment. The Trustee shall not be liable to the Issuer, or the Concessionaire for any payment
made pursuant to a Requisition Certi?cate prior to the Trustee?s receipt of such written notice.
The Trustee has no duty or obligation to con?rm that such requested disbursements constitute
Costs of the Project.

(D) The Issuer covenants that it shall deliver, or cause the Concessionaire to deliver, to
the Trustee and the Issuer within 90 days after the completion of the Project (or the portion thereof
which is being ?nanced with the proceeds of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds) a Completion
Certi?cate certi?ed by an Authorized Of?cer.

(E) If after payment by the Trustee of all orders theretofore tendered to the Trustee
under the provisions of subsection (B) of this Section 302 and after receipt by the Trustee of the
certi?cates and other documents mentioned in subsection (B) of this Section 302 there shall remain
any moneys in the Project Fund, the Issuer may direct the Trustee to deposit such moneys
in the Bond Sinking Fund to the extent necessary to make the next payment therefrom so long as
the next principal payment is required to be made within one year from the date of deposit therein
and then deposit the remainder of such moneys in the Redemption Fund, or (ii) apply such
moneys in any other manner, provided there shall be delivered to the Trustee and the Issuer an
Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such application will not adversely affect the validity
of the Bonds or any exemption from federal income taxation to which the interest on the Bonds
would otherwise be entitled.

As soon as practicable after the Issuer has made an election pursuant to of the
immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall recalculate the average reasonably expected
economic life of the Bond Financed Pr0perty, as re?ected in the Project Certi?cate, to include the
amount of moneys transferred from the Project Fund to the Bond Sinking Fund or the Redemption
Fund as an asset with an economic life of zero.

If any recalculation of the average reasonably expected economic life of the Project
demonstrates that the average life of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds exceeds 120% of the average
reasonably expected economic life of the Bond Financed Property, the Issuer covenants and agrees
to deposit immediately following such recalculation in the Redemption Fund established in Section
406 of this Indenture as a prepayment of the principal amount owing hereunder an amount which,
when applied by the Trustee to redeem Bonds, is suf?cient, in the Opinion of Bond Counsel to
cause the average maturity of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to be no more than 120% of the average
of the reasonably expected economic life of the Bond Financed Property. Such deposit to the
Redemption Fund shall be made at such time as will permit the Trustee, accompanied by a written
direction of the Issuer to the Trustee, to call Series 2017 DDA Bonds for optional redemption
pursuant to Section 501 of this Indenture not later than the ?rst date such Series 2017 DDA Bonds
can be redeemed at a price of par and (ii) give proper notice of redemption pursuant to Section 503
of this Indenture. In lieu of making the deposit described above, the Issuer may deliver to the
Trustee an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that failure to provide for such redemptions will
not adversely affect the validity of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds or any exemption from federal
income taxation to which the Series 2017 DDA Bonds would otherwise be entitled.

56

Page 108 of 199

If any recalculation required by this paragraph demonstrates that the average maturity of
the Series 2017 DDA Bonds exceeds 120% of the average reasonably expected economic life of
the assets ?nanced with the proceeds thereof the Trustee, in accordance with the written Request
of the Issuer, shall call the Series 2017 DDA Bonds for optional redemption pursuant to Section
501 hereof in connection with the funds deposited in the Redemption Fund by the Issuer in an
amount equal to the principal amount of Series 2017 DDA Bonds required to be redeemed in order
to suf?ciently reduce the average maturity of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds.

(F) Subject to the provisions of Section 411 hereof, moneys at any time on deposit in
the Project Fund shall, by oral instruction followed by a Written Request of the Issuer,
be invested or reinvested by the Trustee in Quali?ed Investments maturing at such time or times
so that the Trustee will be able to pay the Costs of the Project from time to time upon the order of
the Issuer as herein provided. The Trustee and the Issuer shall be entitled to rely upon a schedule
of anticipated payments of construction and equipment costs approved by the Issuer in scheduling
such investments. Any interest or pro?t on such investments shall be credited to, and any losses
on such investments shall be charged against, the Project Fund in which such investments are held.
The Trustee shall not be obligated to invest any moneys held by it hereunder except as directed by
the Issuer, but shall as soon as practicable inform the Issuer of any amounts that remain uninvested.
The Trustee may sell or present for redemption any obligations so purchased whenever it shall be
necessary in order to provide moneys to meet any payment pursuant to this Section 302 and the
Trustee shall not be liable or reSponsible for any loss resulting from such investments.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, the Issuer acknowledges that all investment
earnings shall be subject to the provisions of the Tax Certi?cate.

(G) If any moneys remain on deposit in the Project Fund on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date and the Project is ongoing but has not been completed, such moneys may remain on
deposit in the Project Fund if the Issuer delivers an Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that
such use of the Project Fund will not adversely affect any exemption from federal income taxation
to which the Series 2017 DDA Bonds are entitled and shall be invested pursuant to the limitations
set forth in the Tax Certi?cates. If moneys remain on deposit in the Project Fund on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and the Trustee has not received the certi?cate required by Section
hereof or the Opinion of Bond Counsel required by preceding sentence is not delivered,
such moneys must be deposited in the funds speci?ed in clause of the ?rst paragraph of Section
hereof.

Section 303. Expense Fund. The Issuer shall establish with the Trustee a separate
account to be known as the ?Expense Fund - Detroit DDA Development Area No. I Project 
Series 201 7? (the ?Expense Fund An initial deposit to the credit of the Expense Fund is to be

pursuant to the provisions of Section 901(i) hereof, so as to assure that such Eligible Moneys will
be available if timely payments are made in accordance with the Series 2017 DDA Bonds.

*Final Maturity

provided, that such amounts shall be reduced by the amount of Series 2017 DDA Bonds
acquired and delivered in accordance with Section 404 hereof in satisfaction of such Bond Sinking
Fund requirements, and in connection with a partial redemption of Series 2017 DDA Bonds if
the Issuer elects to reduce mandatory Bond Sinking Fund redemptions for the Series 2017 DDA
Bonds in the manner provided in Section 501 (D).

The Series 2017 DDA Bonds are entitled to the bene?ts of a Bond Sinking Fund as
provided in this Indenture. Moneys on deposit in the Bond Sinking Fund on [July 1 of the years
2019 through 2047] shall be applied to redeem a portion of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds maturing
[July 1, 2047] by lot, with the notice and in the manner as provided in this Indenture; and moneys
on deposit in the Bond Sinking Fund on [July 1, 2047] shall be applied to the payment of the
Series 2017 DDA Bonds maturing on that date. Payment or redemption of the Series 2017 DDA
Bonds pursuant to this Section 502 shall be without premium. In the event the Series 2017 DDA
Bonds maturing on a speci?c date as aforesaid have been fully paid and moneys are on deposit in
the Bond Sinking Fund to pay Series 2017 DDA Bonds maturing on that speci?c maturity date,
then such moneys on deposit in the Bond Sinking Fund shall be applied to Series 2017 DDA Bonds
maturing on the next succeeding maturity date in the order above set forth. The Series 2017 DDA
Bonds shall be paid by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph without any notice
from or direction by the Issuer.

(B) Prior to conversion of the Series 2017 DDA Bonds to the Fixed Rate pursuant to
Section 210 hereof, the Remarketing Agent shall deliver to the Trustee and the Issuer a certi?cate
which allocates the payments of principal due through the Bond Sinking Fund described above in
Section specifying which of the July 1 payments will be payable by maturity, and which
will be payable by call for mandatory Bond Sinking Fund redemption, and specifying the interest
rate payable on each payment of principal. In determining the principal maturities, mandatory
Bond Sinking Fund redemption payments and interest rates for the converted Bonds, the
Remarketing Agent shall use the following guidelines:

74

Page 126 of 199

 The Remarketing Agent shall allocate the converted Bonds between serial
bonds and term bonds in such manner as shall produce the lowest aggregate interest payable with
respect to the converted Bonds; and

(2) The Remarketing Agent shall set the interest rate at the lowest interest rate
that will enable each converted Bond to be remarketed at par (plus any accrued interest) on the
Fixed Rate Conversion Date, taking into account the maturity of such Bond and the Bond Sinking
Fund payments, if any, to be made with respect to converted Bonds of such maturity.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Issuer may agree to another method for providing for
payment of principal on the Bonds after the Fixed Rate Conversion Date if there is delivered to
the Trustee by the Issuer a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel.

and the Rating Agencies then rating the Bonds, provided, however, that failure to give such notice
by mailing or to provide such notice to any registered Securities Depository (as hereinafter
provided) or a defect in the notice or the mailing as to any Bond will not affect the validity of any
proceedings for redemption as to any other Bond with respect to which notice was properly given
to the holder thereof. In addition, so long as the ownership of the Bonds is maintained in book-
entry form by the Securities Depository, in the event of any redemption of the Bonds or an advance

redemption notice is ?rst mailed as aforesaid, funds shall be placed with the Trustee to pay the
principal of such Bonds (which funds shall be Eligible Moneys if the Bonds bear interest in the
Daily Rate, the Weekly Rate or the Flexible Rate), the accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the
Redemption Date and the premium, if any, thereon, or such notice of redemption shall state

Bonds shall not be subject to redemption and the Holders thereof shall have the same rights as if
no such notice had been given. In such event, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the
owners of such Bonds by ?rst class mail, postage prepaid.

All Bonds which have been redeemed shall be cancelled and cremated or otherwise

The Tender Agent shall deposit all moneys delivered to it pursuant to Section 
hereof from a payment by or on behalf of the Credit Facility Provider for the purchase of Bonds

the Remarketing Proceeds Account to the extent funds are available therein, (2) in the case of

purchase obligation, such excess shall be returned to the Credit Facility Provider.

(C) Failed Conversion. If on a Variable Rate Conversion Date, Flexible Rate
Conversion Date, Index Floating Rate Conversion Date or Proposed Fixed Rate Conversion Date,
other than any such conversion from an Index Floating Rate Period, any condition precedent to
such conversion required hereunder shall not be satis?ed, such conversion shall not occur, the

Provider and the Trustee a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that the conversion of
the Bonds to a Weekly Rate for Weekly Rate Periods will not adversely affect the validity of the
Series 2017 DDA Bonds or any exemption from federal income taxation to which interest on the
Series 2017 DDA Bonds would otherwise be entitled, the Bonds to be converted shall bear interest
at the Weekly Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent on the failed Conversion Date for a

Index Floating Rate Period, the Series 2017 DDA Bonds proposed to be converted shall remain in
the Index Floating Rate Period that was in effect immediately prior to the proposed conversion
with interest rates established in accordance with Section 209(a) hereof; and if the conversion

shall deliver such Bonds to the Trustee. Upon such delivery, the Trustee shall make any necessary
adjustments to the Bond Register.

(G) No Remarketing t0 the Issuer. The Remarketing Agent shall not remarket any
Bonds to the Issuer, or any af?liate or guarantor of the Issuer; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall prevent the Issuer or any af?liate of the Issuer that is then the Credit Facility Provider
from purchasing and owning Bonds as such Credit Facility Provider.

(H) Pledged Bonds. The Remarketing Agent shall exercise on an ongoing basis its best
efforts to remarket Pledged Bonds at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to the

federal income taxation to which the interest on the Series 2017 DDA Bonds would otherwise be
entitled or the validity or enforceability of any Series 2017 DDA Bonds, and if the Series 2017
DDA Bonds are in the Daily Rate Period, Weekly Rate Period, Flexible Rate Period or Term Rate

The Trustee shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the Credit Facility Provider
to be re?ected as the bene?cial owner of Pledged Bonds in the records of DTC, including, if
requested by the Credit Facility Provider, the assignment of separate CUSIP numbers for such
Pledged Bonds, with the cost of acquiring any such CUSIP number to be borne by the Issuer.

(A) General. The Issuer covenants and agrees that, except when the Series 2017 DDA
Bonds are in the Index Floating Rate Period, Term Rate Period or the Fixed Rate Period, it will

terms. If at any time during the term of the Credit Facility any successor Trustee shall be appointed
and quali?ed under this Indenture, the resigning Trustee shall request that the Credit Facility
Provider transfer the Credit Facility to the successor Trustee. If the resigning Trustee fails to make
this request, the successor Trustee shall do so before accepting appointment. When the Credit

Credit Facility Provider. When a Credit Facility is in effect, the Issuer shall maintain the Interest
Component of the Credit Facility in an amount which shall not be less than the sum of the amount
determined by multiplying (A) the outstanding principal amount of Bonds bearing interest for
Variable Rate Periods times (B) the Interest Coverage Rate for such Rate Period required to be
used pursuant to this paragraph times (C) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the Interest
Coverage Period for such Rate Period required to be used pursuant to this paragraph by (2) 365
(or 360, in the case of Bonds bearing interest during any Term Rate Period). The Interest Coverage
Rate utilized for each Rate Period in the above described calculation shall not be less than the rate
speci?ed by the Issuer to the Trustee for the Bonds in each particular Rate Period. The Interest
Coverage Period utilized for each Rate Period in the above described calculation shall not be less
than the sum of with respect to Bonds bearing interest at a Daily and Weekly Rate, 35 days, and
with respect to Bonds bearing interest at a Term Rate, 184 days, plus (ii) the maximum number of
days designated by the Remarketing Agent as the maximum number of days the Credit Facility
Issuer is allowed pursuant to the provisions of the Credit Facility then in effect to reinstate the
Credit Facility after a drawing for interest, plus six days, representing the maximum number
of days the Tiustee is allowed pursuant to Section 507 hereof to call the Bonds for special
mandatory tender in the event the Credit Facility does not provide for automatic reinstatement of
the amount available for interest payments immediately upon payment of an interest drawing, plus
(iv) any additional number of days then required by any Rating Agency then maintaining a rating
on the Bonds entitled to the bene?t of such Credit Facility. If any Series 2017 DDA Bond is
bearing interest at a Term Rate and if the Expiration Date is scheduled to occur during the Term
Rate Period, the amount of the Credit Facility must include an amount to pay the applicable
premium on the Renewal Date on which such Bond is required to be purchased pursuant to Section
507 hereof.

shall also receive an Opinion of counsel for the Credit Facility Provider issuing the Renewal Credit
Facility as to the due authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Renewal Credit
Facility in substantially the form of opinion of counsel for the Initial Credit Facility delivered to

15 days prior to such substitution becoming effective that the Credit Facility is being replaced
by such Substitute Credit Facility, and (ii) the Series 2017 DDA Bonds are required to be tendered
for purchase in accordance with Section 508 hereof.

Upon the effective date of the Substitute Credit Facility, the Trustee shall surrender the
Credit Facility previously in effect to the Credit Facility Provider which issued it; provided,
however, that the Trustee shall not surrender the Credit Facility if any draws have not been paid
under the existing Credit Facility.

(D) Unreimbursed Draws on Credit Facility. If principal of, redemption premium or
interest on any Series 2017 DDA Bonds are paid in whole or in part from draws under the Credit
Facility for which the Credit Facility Provider is not reimbursed in accordance with the terms of

Bondholders of such Series 2017 DDA Bonds to the extent of any such unreimbursed draws.
Series 2017 DDA Bonds shall not be considered to be paid and discharged under Article XI hereof
if and to the extent that principal of, redemption premium or interest on such Series 2017 DDA
Bonds are paid in whole or in part from draws under the Credit Facility for which the Credit
Facility Provider is not reimbursed in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement,

Increment Revenues and Catalyst Project Revenues to be captured on the applicable Brown?eld
Project site as a result of such Brown?eld Project, without taking into account any other tax
incentives available from or granted by any other governmental entities. Such decrease shall be

Issuer shall not issue any additional indebtedness under the Senior DDA Bond Resolution, except

payable from the Net General Tax Increment Revenues for every ?scal year of the Issuer through
the current maturity date of the Senior DDA Obligations to be refunded and, if the refunding
obligations extend the maturity date of the Senior DDA Obligations to be refunded beyond their

Section 603 of this Indenture when the same shall become due and payable, whether upon a
scheduled Interest Payment Date, at Maturity or upon any date ?xed for prepayment.

Notice of the occurrence of the foregoing events of default and the continuation of the same
for the period, if any, speci?ed in said paragraphs, shall be given by the Trustee to the Credit
Facility Provider, if any, and to the Purchaser, by Electronic Means.

Section 703. Remedies; Rights of Bondholders. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default, the Trustee may, with the written consent of the Credit Facility Provider, if any, and the
Purchaser, during the Initial Term Rate Period or an Index Floating Rate Period, but without any
action on the part of any other Bondholder, pursue any available remedy, including a suit at law
or in equity to: enforce the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Bonds outstanding hereunder, by mandamus, or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in
equity, enforce all rights of the owners under, and require the Issuer to carry out any agreements
with or for the bene?t of the owners of Bonds and to perform its or their duties under, Act 197 and
this Indenture, provided that any such remedy may be taken only to the extent permitted under this
Indenture; (0) bring suit upon the Bonds; or by action or suit in equity to enjoin any acts or
things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the owners of Bonds.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred, and if the Trustee shall have been requested to
do so by the Credit Facility Provider, if any, or the Purchaser, or the owners of not less than 25%
in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then outstanding with the written consent of the Credit
Facility Provider, if any, or the Purchaser, during the Initial Term Rate Period or an Index Floating
Rate Period, the Trustee shall be obligated to exercise such one or more of the rights and powers
conferred by this Section as the Trustee shall deem most expedient in the interests of the owners
of the Bonds; provided, however, that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to comply with
any such request or direction if the Trustee shall be advised by counsel (who may be its own
counsel) that the action so requested may not lawfully be taken or the Trustee in good faith shall
determine that such action would be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of Bonds not parties to
such request.

No remedy by the terms of this Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee (or to
the holders of Bonds or the Credit Facility Provider) is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other
remedy given to the Trustee, the holders of Bonds or the Credit Facility Provider hereunder now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

101

No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or Event of
Default shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such
default or Event of Default, or acquiescence therein; and every such right and power may be
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

No waiver of any default or Event of Default hereunder, whether by the Trustee, the Credit
Facility Provider or by the holders of Bonds shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default
or Event of Default or shall impair any rights or remedies consequent thereon.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after the occurrence of an act of
bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer, such expenses and the compensation for such services are
intended to constitute expenses of administration under any federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, arrangement, moratorium, reorganization or other debtor relief law.

Section 704. Direction of Proceedings. The Credit Facility Provider or the owners of not
less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Bonds with the written consent
of the Credit Facility Provider or the Purchaser during the Initial Term Rate Period or an Index
Floating Rate Period shall have the right, at any time, by an instrument or instruments in writing
executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method and place of conducting all proceedings
to be taken in connection with the enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Indenture, or

shall not be otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of law and of this Indenture.

Section 705. Appointment of Receivers. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and
upon the ?ling of a suit or other commencement of judicial proceedings to enforce the rights of
the Trustee and the holders of Bonds under this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled, as a matter
of right, to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of the rights and properties pledged hereunder
and of the revenues, issues, payments and pro?ts thereof, pending such proceedings, with such
powers as the court making such appointment shall confer.

Section 706. Application of Moneys. Subject to the provisions of the Tax Certi?cate, all
moneys received by the Trustee or by any receiver pursuant to any right given or action taken
under the provisions of this Article shall, after payment of the cost and expenses of the proceedings
resulting in the collection of such moneys and of the fees of, and the expenses, liabilities and
advances incurred or made by the Trustee at the request or with the concurrence of the Trustee
(provided, however, that the Trustee shall not have a prior right to payment from any amounts
drawn under the Credit Facility, remarketing proceeds or any other Eligible Moneys, and any
amount drawn under the Credit Facility shall be applied solely to pay the principal of and interest
on the Eligible Bonds or to pay the purchase price of tendered Eligible Bonds), be deposited in the

application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on
such dates shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall give such notice as it may deem appropriate of
the deposit with it of any such moneys and of the ?xing of any such date and of the Special Record

than 25% in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding with the written consent of the
Credit Facility Provider or the Purchaser, as applicable, shall have made written request to the
Trustee and shall have offered it reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the powers
hereinbefore granted or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name, and unless also
they have offered to the Trustee indemnity as provided in Section 801 hereof, and unless the
Trustee shall thereafter fail or refuse to exercise the power hereinbefore granted, or to institute
such action, suit or proceeding in its own name; and such noti?cation, request and offer of

to any determination in such proceeding, be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder
with respect to the property pledged and assigned hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers
of the Trustee shall continue as if no such proceedings had been taken.

consent of the Purchaser but without any action on the part of the Bondholders, and shall, upon
the direction of either the Purchaser during an Index Floating Rate Period or the Credit Facility

Credit Facility Provider, if any, upon being indemni?ed to its satisfaction and receipt of the written
request of the holders of (1) at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Bonds
outstanding in respect of which default in the payment of principal and/or interest exists, or (2) at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of all the Bonds outstanding in the case of any other

failure to have Eligible Moneys on deposit in the Interest Fund, Bond Sinking Fund or Redemption
Fund on any date on which interest or principal is payable on the Eligible Bonds in an amount
sufficient to make all payments of principal and interest becoming due on such date on the Eligible
Bonds, unless prior to such waiver or rescission the Credit Facility shall be reinstated to an amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of Series 2017 DDA Bonds to be outstanding plus the
number of days of interest thereon at the Maximum Rate required pursuant to Section 509 hereof
and unless prior to such waiver or rescission all arrears of interest, with interest thereon (to the
extent permitted by law) at the rate borne by the Bonds in respect of which such default shall have

then and in every such case the Issuer, the Trustee and the Bondholders shall, subject to any

this Indenture and to perform such trusts as an ordinarily prudent trustee under a corporate
mortgage, and no implied covenants or obligations should be read into this Indenture against the
Trustee. If any Event of Default under this Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing, the

of such prudent person?s own affairs. The Trustee agrees to perform such trusts only upon and
subject to the following expressed terms and conditions:

of counsel concerning all matters of trusts hereof and duties hereunder, and may in all cases pay
such reasonable compensation to any attorney, agent, receiver or employee retained or employed
by it in connection herewith. The Trustee may act upon the opinion or advice of an attorney,
surveyor, consultant, engineer or accountant selected by it in the exercise of reasonable care or, if
selected or retained by the Issuer, approved by the Trustee in the exercise of such care. The Trustee

Certi?cates), or for the recording or re-recording, ?ling or re??ling of this Indenture, or any
supplement or amendment thereto, or the ?ling of ?nancing statements, or for the validity of the

the maintenance of the security hereof.

of the Bonds or the proceeds thereof or for the use or application of any money paid over by the
Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture or for the use and application of money
received by any Paying Agent (except when the Trustee acts as Paying Agent). The Trustee may
become the owner of Bonds secured hereby with the same rights it would have if not Trustee.

consent, certi?cate, order, Opinion (including an opinion of Independent Counsel), af?davit, letter,
telegram, electronic mail or other paper or document in good faith deemed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. Any action taken by the
Trustee pursuant to this Indenture upon the request or authority or consent of any person who at
the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of any Bond,
shall be conclusive and binding upon all future owners of the same Bond and upon Bonds issued
in exchange therefor or in place thereof.

(B) As to the existence or non?existence of any fact or as to the suf?ciency or validity
of any instrument, paper or proceeding, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely upon a certi?cate signed
on behalf of the Issuer by an Authorized Of?cer as suf?cient evidence of the facts therein
contained and prior to the occurrence of a default of which the Trustee has been noti?ed as
provided in subsection (G) of this Section, or of which by said subsection it is deemed to have
notice, may accept a similar certi?cate to the effect that any particular dealing, transaction or action
is necessary or expedient, but may in its discretion secure such further evidence deemed necessary
or advisable, but shall in no case be bound to secure the same. The Trustee may accept a certi?cate
of an Authorized Of?cer of the Issuer to the effect that a resolution in the form therein set forth
has been adopted by the Issuer as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted

not be construed as a duty and the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its gross
negligence or willful default.

default hereunder except failure by the Issuer to cause to be made any of the payments to the

107

Page 159 of 199

Trustee required to be made by Article IV unless a Responsible Of?cer of the Trustee shall be
speci?cally noti?ed in writing of such default by the Issuer, the Credit Facility Provider or the

or other instruments required by this Indenture to be delivered to the Trustee must, in order to be
effective, be delivered at the Principal Of?ce of the Trustee and, in the absence of such notice so
delivered, the Trustee may conclusively assume there is no default except as aforesaid.

have the right, but shall not be required, to demand, in respect of the authentication of any Bonds,
the withdrawal of any cash, the release of any property, or any action whatsoever within the
purview of this Indenture, any showings, certi?cates, opinions, appraisals or other information, or

making payments of principal and interest on the Bonds as the same becomes due, or paying the
Tender Price of the Bonds, or making a draw under Credit Facility whenever required by this
Indenture, the Trustee may require that reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it be furnished by the
Issuer for the reimbursement of all expenses to which it may be put and to protect it against all
liability, which may be incurred in connection with any action so taken, including, but not limited
to any present or future federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation relating to
hazardous substances or the protection of the environment, except liability which is adjudicated to
have resulted from its gross negligence or willful default in connection with any action so taken.

any such prior right of payment or claim therefor against moneys or obligations deposited with or
paid to the Trustee for the redemption or payment of Bonds which are deemed to have been paid.

the Trustee may be removed at any time with or without cause by an instrument or concurrent

In the event that the Trustee hereunder shall give notice of resignation or be removed, or be
dissolved, or shall be in the course of dissolution or liquidation, or otherwise become incapable of
acting hereunder, or in case it shall be taken under the control of any public of?ce or of?ces, or of
a receiver appointed by a court, a successor may with the prior written consent of the Issuer (to the
extent that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing hereunder), be appointed by
the owners of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Bonds then Outstanding, by an
instrument or concurrent instruments in writing signed by such owners, or by their duly authorized
attorneys in fact, a copy of which shall be delivered personally or sent by ?rst class mail, postage

be delivered personally or sent by ?rst class mail, postage prepaid, to the retiring Trustee, the
successor Trustee, the Credit Facility Provider, if any, and the Remarketing Agent, if any.

instrument in writing accepting such appointment hereunder and under the Tax Certi?cates, and
thereupon such successor, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested
with all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations of its predecessor; but
such predecessor shall, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer, or of its successor,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the estates, properties,
rights, powers and trusts of such predecessor hereunder under the Tax Certi?cates; and every
predecessor Trustee shall deliver all securities and moneys held by it as Trustee hereunder to its
successors. Should any instrument in writing from the Issuer be required by any successor Trustee
for more fully and certainly vesting in such successor the estate, rights, powers and duties hereby
vested or intended to be vested in the predecessor, any and all such instruments in writing shall,
on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Issuer. The resignation of any Trustee
and the instrument or instruments removing any Trustee and appointing a successor hereunder,
together with all other instruments provided for in this Article shall be ?led and/or recorded by the

shall have delivered to the successor Trustee a Substitute Credit Facility in substantially the
same form as the existing Credit Facility, but in favor of the successor Trustee, whereupon the

111

Trustee shall return the existing Credit Facility to the Credit Facility Provider for cancellation or

Trustee.

opinions, certi?cates and other instruments provided for in this Indenture may be accepted by the
Trustee as conclusive evidence of the facts and conclusions stated therein and shall be full warrant,
protection and authority to the Trustee for the release of property and the withdrawal of cash
hereunder.

Bond Registrar. In the event of a change in the of?ce of Trustee, the predecessor Trustee which
has resigned or been removed shall cease to be trustee of the Revenue Fund, Interest Fund, Bond
Sinking Fund, Redemption Fund, Purchase Fund and any other funds provided hereunder and shall
cease to be the Bond Registrar and Paying Agent for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the Bonds and the successor Trustee shall become such Trustee, Bond Registrar and Paying Agent
unless a separate Paying Agent or Agents are appointed by the Issuer in connection with the
appointment of any successor Trustee.

Section 813. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Trustee. All Federal,
state and local governmental, public, and regulatory authority approvals, consents, notices,
authorizations, registrations, licenses, exemptions, and ?lings that are required to have been

Bonds which are outstanding hereunder at the time of the execution of any such supplemental
indenture shall have consented to and approved the execution thereof as herein provided, no holder
of any Bond shall have any right to object to any of the terms and provisions contained therein, or
the operation thereof, or in any manner to question the propriety of the execution thereof, or to

on a subsequent date prior to the ?rst date on which the Bonds in a Term Rate Period or a Fixed
Rate Period are subject to redemption, at the option of the Issuer, such Bond Counsel will be
unable, absent payment by the Issuer to the Internal Revenue Service, to render an unquali?ed

single maturity to be selected by lot using such method as may be designated by the Trustee), at
the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date and without premium;
provided, however, that in no event shall the principal amount of Series 2017 DDA Bonds so

prepaid, to the registered owners of Series 2017 DDA Bonds to be redeemed at their addresses as

DDA Bonds, the accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Redemption Date and the premium, if
any, thereon, or such notice of redemption shall state that any redemption is conditional on such
funds being deposited with the Trustee on the Redemption Date and that failure to make such a
deposit shall not constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Failure to give notice in the manner prescribed under the Indenture with respect to any
Series 2017 DDA Bond, or any defect in such notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings
for redemption for any Series 2017 DDA Bond with respect to which notice was properly given.

provisions of the Indenture. The Trustee shall redeem, in the manner provided in the Indenture,
such an aggregate principal amount of such Series 2017 DDA Bonds at the principal amount
thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date and premium, if any, as will exhaust as nearly
as practicable such funds. At the direction of the Issuer, such funds may be invested in United
States Government Obligations until needed for redemption payout.

Bonds shall not be subject to redemption and the holders thereof shall have the same rights as if



Page 185 of 199

owners of such Series 2017 DDA Bonds by ?rst class mail, postage prepaid.

Bonds (including the payment of premium, if any, and interest payable on such portion of the
Series 2017 DDA Bonds to the maturity or redemption date thereof), provided that such moneys,
if invested, shall be invested in United States Government Obligations which are not prepayable
or callable prior to, but mature on a date on or prior to, the date the moneys therefrom are

principal of, or premium or interest on, or otherwise in default with respect to, any bonds, notes,
?nancing leases or other obligations which it has issued, assumed or guaranteed as to payment of
principal, premium or interest. No event has occurred or is continuing that, upon the issuance of

lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute an event of default.

The Issuer is not a party to any contract or agreement or subject to any
restriction, the performance of or compliance with which may have a material adverse effect on
the Net General Tax Increment Revenues and Catalyst Project Revenues, except as described in
the Of?cial Statement relating the Series 2014A MSF Bonds.

disclosed in writing to the Purchaser, there has not been any materially adverse change in the

such materially adverse change.

writing to the Purchaser that will have a material adverse effect on the properties, business,
prospects, pro?ts or condition (?nancial or otherwise) of the Issuer, or the ability of the Issuer to
perform its obligations under the Legal Documents.

No litigation, proceeding or of?cial investigation of any governmental or
judicial body is pending against the Issuer or against any other party of which the Issuer has notice

of its aggregate principal amount of City of Detroit Downtown Development
Authority Subordinate Tax Increment Revenue Bonds, Series 2017 (Development Area No. 1
Projects) (the ??Bonds?) issued I 2017]. The Purchaser is purchasing the Bonds pursuant
to the Bond Purchase Agreement, dated 2017, by and between the Purchaser and the

bank organized under the laws of the United States of America having a combined capital and
surplus of $5,000,000,000 or more. The Purchaser has suf?cient knowledge and experience in
?nancial and business matters, including the purchase and ownership of tax?exempt obligations,
to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Bonds, and is able to bear
the economic risks of such investment.

3. The Purchaser has made its own independent investigation of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the issuance of the Bonds and has been provided with such information
and materials relating to the Issuer, the Bonds and the uses of the proceeds of the Bonds, including
information regarding the security for payment of the Bonds, as the Purchaser has requested of the
Issuer and deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of investment in the Bonds.

4. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Bonds are not being registered under the

continuing disclosure requirements for the bene?t of the Purchaser and any other holders of the
Bonds.

7. The Purchaser is purchasing the Bonds for its own account as an investor in the
ordinary course of business and has no present intention of reselling or disposing of the Bonds or
engaging in any distribution thereof (as that term is used in the 1933 Act, and the regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder); provided, however, that the Purchaser
reserves the right at all times to control the disposition of its assets, including the B0nds, and
reserves the right to sell, assign and transfer the Bonds (or fractional interests in the Bonds) in
Authorized Denominations to ?quali?ed institutional buyers? whom the Purchaser reasonably
believes are not purchasing for more than one account or with a view to distribute.

8. In the event the Purchaser sells, assigns or transfers any fractional interests or
participations in the Bonds, it agrees to maintain and furnish to the Trustee a record of ownership
of any interests so transferred, including the identity, address and federal tax identi?cation number
of the transferee, and to require that any such transferees may only transfer their interests following
written noti?cation to the undersigned and upon furnishing the same recordkeeping information
to the Trustee.

proceeds of the Bonds (other than as may be required or permitted pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement).]

connection with rendering its opinion to the Issuer that the interest on the Bonds is not includable

undersigned?s interpretation of any laws; in particular the regulations under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, or the application of any laws to these facts. The certi?cations contained herein are

Form of Approving Opinion of Bond Counsel

 

July 2017 DRAFT 1 6/22/17
City of Detroit Downtown Development US. Bank National Association,
Authority as Trustee
Detroit, Michigan Detroit, Michigan
Bank of America, NA.
New York, New York
Re: City of Detroit Downtown Development Authority Subordinate

Tax Increment Revenue Bonds, Series 2017 (Development Area No. 1 Projects)
Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel in connection with the issuance by the City of Detroit Downtown
Development Authority (the ?Authority?) of its Subordinate Tax Increment Revenue Bonds, Series
2017 (Development Area No 1 Projects), in the aggregate principal amount of 

dated July_,2017 (the ?Bonds?), issued pursuant to Act No. 197, Public Acts of Michigan, 1975,

as amended (the an authorizing resolution adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Authority on June 28, 2017 (the ?Resolution?), and the Trust Indenture, dated as of July 1, 2017
(the ?Indenture?), between the Authority and US. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the
?Trustee?). In so acting, we have examined the law, registered Bond No. R-1 and the Indenture,
each as executed by the Authority, and such certi?ed copies of proceedings and other papers as
we have deemed necessary to render this opinion. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
de?ned shall have the meanings set forth in Article I of the Indenture.

The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered bonds, and are payable as to principal and interest
from the funds and sources provided pursuant to the Resolution and the Indenture. We refer you
to the Bonds, the Resolution and the Indenture for a description of the purposes for which the
Bonds are issued and the security therefor.

As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon the certi?ed proceedings and
other certi?cations of public of?cials furnished to us without undertaking to verify the same by
independent investigation.

We have not been engaged nor have we undertaken to review the accuracy, completeness or
suf?ciency of any offering material relating to the Bonds and we express no opinion relating
thereto. Except to the extent necessary to issue our approving opinion as to the validity of the
Bonds, we have made no inquiry as to any ?nancial information, statements or materials contained
in any ?nancial documents, statements or material that have been or may be furnished in

B-1
280473511 041567 AGMT

Page 219 of 271

connection with the authorization, issuance or marketing of the Bonds and, accordingly, do not
express any Opinion with respect to the accuracy or completeness of any such ?nancial
information, statements or materials.

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:

1. The Authority is a public body corporate validly existing under the laws of the State
of Michigan, including the Act, with the power to adopt the Resolution, to enter into the Indenture
and perform its obligations thereunder, and to issue the Bonds.

2. The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Authority
and is the valid and legally binding obligation of the Authority, enforceable in accordance with its
terms.

3. The Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered and are the valid and
binding special, limited obligations of the Authority, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
and secured by and payable solely from the Series 2017 Pledged Tax Increment Revenues, without
recourse to any other revenues of the Authority, or to any other properties or assets, now owned
or hereafter acquired, tangible or intangible, of the Authority. The Bonds and the interest thereon
do not constitute a general obligation of the Authority, the City of Detroit, Michigan (the ?City?)
or the State of Michigan (the ?State?), and do not constitute or give rise to any pecuniary liability
or charge against the general credit of the Authority or the general credit or taxing powers of the
City or the State.

4. Pursuant to the Act, the Resolution and the Indenture, the Authority has created a
valid lien on the Series 2017 Pledged Tax Increment Revenues as security for the payment of
principal of and interest on the Bonds, which under the Act constitutes a statutory lien. For so
long as the Senior DDA Obligations and the Series 2014A Obligation remain outstanding, they
are secured by senior liens on the General Tax Increment Revenues pursuant to the Senior DDA
Bond Resolution and the Series 2014A DDA Resolution, respectively, and the lien on the General
Tax Increment Revenues created under the Resolution and the Indenture is a subordinate lien and
limited to the Series 2017 General Tax Increment Revenues. For so long as the Series 2014A
Obligation remains outstanding, it is secured by a senior lien on the Catalyst Project Revenues
pursuant to the Series 2014A DDA Resolution, and the lien on the Catalyst Project Revenues
created under the Resolution and the Indenture is a subordinate lien and limited to the Series 2017
Catalyst Project Revenues.

5. The interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax
purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum
tax imposed on individuals and corporations. It should be noted, however, that with respect to
corporations (as defined for federal income tax purposes), the interest is taken into account in
determining adjusted current earnings for the purpose of computing the alternative minimum tax
imposed on such corporations. The Opinion set forth in clause above is subject to the condition
that the Authority comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the ?Code?) that must be satis?ed subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds in order that interest
thereon be (or continue to be) excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The
requirements include rebating certain earnings to the United States. Failure to comply with certain
of such requirements could cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income
retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds. The Authority has covenanted to comply with
each such requirement. We express no opinion regarding the effect on the exclusion of interest


2804785.11 041.567 AGMT

Page 220 of 271

on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes of (A) the conversion of a Rate
Period to a new Rate Period or to the same Rate Period with a different term, (B) the acceptance
of a Credit Facility or Substitute Credit Facility by the Trustee or (C) any other change or action
which may occur under the terms and conditions of the Indenture subject to receipt of an approving
opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel or (ii) other federal tax consequences arising with
respect to the Bonds and the interest thereon.

6. The Bonds and the interest thereon are exempt from all taxation provided by the
laws of the State of Michigan, except estate taxes and taxes on gains realized from the sale,
payment or other disposition thereof.

It is to be understood that the rights of holders of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds
and the Indenture may be subject to Bankruptcy and Insolvency Laws (as de?ned below) and that
their enforcement may also be subject to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases,
including those equitable remedies relating to equitable subordination. Further, the rights of the
holders of the Bonds in the Series 2017 Pledged Tax Increment Revenues derived from the real
and personal property taxes levied by a particular taxing jurisdiction, and the enforceability of the
lien thereon, may be subject to the application of Bankruptcy and Insolvency Laws (as de?ned
below) in bankruptcy or otherjudicial proceedings, but only to the extent that the Authority itself
or such taxing jurisdiction is the subject of those proceedings as a debtor. To the extent that a
taxing jurisdiction is the subject of those proceedings as a debtor, and in its capacity as tax
collecting agent is in possession of Series 2017 Pledged Tax Increment Revenues derived from
other taxing jurisdictions that are not the subject of those proceedings as a debtor, it is possible
that there may be a delay in the ability of the Authority to obtain possession of, or reductions in
the amount of, such Series 2017 Pledged Tax Increment Revenues. ?Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Laws? means bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
laws affecting creditors? rights generally, now existing or hereafter enacted to the extent
constitutionally applicable.

All counsel to the transactions herein described may rely on this opinion as though it were
speci?cally addressed to them, solely in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds
identi?ed above. This opinion may not be quoted or relied on by any other person, nor may copies
be delivered to any other person (except as may be required by law), nor may this opinion be used
for any other purpose, without our prior written consent.

This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement
this opinion to re?ect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention, or any
changes in law that may hereafter occur.

Very truly yours,

and the Authority Agreements, the performance by the Authority of the actions required on its part
to be taken pursuant to the Resolution, the Bonds and the Authority Agreements and the

Agreements do not and will not result in a violation of the Constitution or laws of the State of
Michigan (including Act 34, Act 197 or any debt limitations or other restrictions or conditions on
the debt issuing power of the Authority), any law, administrative regulation, order, writ, injunction
or decree of any governmental authority.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We serve as external general counsel to the City of Detroit Downtown Development

the Authority, public of?cials and such other persons, certi?ed or otherwise identi?ed to our

Based on such examination, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that:

and the Authority has the power and authority set forth in the Act. Under Michigan
law, the Authority is a legal entity separate and distinct from the City of Detroit.

any existing law, regulation, court order or consent decree to which the Authority is subject,

Authority is a party or by which the Authority is bound.

5. No consent, authorization or approval of, or ?ling or registration with, any governmental or
regulatory of?cer or body not already obtained is required to be obtained by the Authority for
the approval of the Authorizing Resolutions, or the performance of the obligations of the

ground level of the new construction.

On June 13, 2017, DDA staff presented the request to reduce the purchase price to the DDA

DDA staff is recommending a $350000 reduction in the purchase price to $1,781,000 for 1435
Randolph and 3 years from the completion of construction to provide first floor retail at 1455 Centre.
After the 3 years, DDA staff recommends an annual fee be assessed of $100,000 to incentivize the
development of retail space. The price for 1455 Centre will remain at $220000.

DDA staff is seeking the Board?s approval to amend the terms of the development agreement

SETTLEMENT OF PENDING OF DEBT OWED
BY ROBERT PORCHER

 

In May 2004, the Downtown Development Authority approved a Loan (the ?loan?) to
Seldom Blues, LLC to assist with the development of a restaurant in the Winter Garden area of the
Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan.

The loan was for $400,000.00 for seven years at 4% interest. The terms were interest only
payments for '12 months; thereafter 6 years of principal and interest payments. The security for the
loan was an all asset UCC filing and the Personal Guarantees of Frank 8: Carolyn Taylor. Robert
0 Kimberly Porcher, John at Iris Graves Alexander Zonjic Lorraine Steele.

The Borrower remitted interest only payments as required but could not remit principal and interest
payments when they became due. The borrower requested to continue to remit interest only
payments for a period. The borrower although always late, remitted some interest and sporadic
principal payments until 2009.

The restaurant opened in 2004, however sales expectations were never realized. The Borrower
early on failed in remitting timely payments and the required loan documentation. DDA staff
vigorously pursued the borrower for payments and loan documentation. The borrower was only
somewhat responsive. in 2009, the restaurant closed.

in 2010 DDA retained the services of Kotz Sangster Wysocki for collection purposes. Kotz
Sangster Wysocki ?led soil: against the Guarantors. Frank Taylor filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
and his debt was discharged. DDA through negotiated settlements have received $22,500 from
Carolyn Clifford (Taylor), $36,000.00 from Alexander Zonjic Lorraine Steele, $36,000.00 from
John 8: iris Graves and $65,200.00 from Kimberley Porcher. Staff has vigorously continued to
pursue the last remaining Guarantor, Robert Porcher.

In 2012, Wayne County Circuit Court granted summary disposition in favor of the DDA and awarded
damages. Thereafter, Robert Porcher appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which dismissed
upon the DDA Motion for dismissal. Robert Porcher relocated to Florida and Kotz Sangster
Wysocki with concurrence engaged a Florida firm (Broad Cassetl) to represent DDA in
further collection efforts.

The Judgement filed against Robert Porcher was domesticated in Florida. Broad 8; Cassell
provided timely updates in the matter and has informed DDA that Robert Porcher has additional
judgment creditors that have recently surfaced. He has made previous lower settlement offers, the
latest settlement offer is for $100,000.00. Robert Porcher's attorney has advised the impact of
recent creditors seeking judgement should not impact the DDA's settlement offer. The details of
the offer involve remitting a down payment of $35,000.00 with the remaining payment of $65,000.00
to be disbursed over 23 months. In the event of a default, the judgement is fully enforceable less
payments that are actually made.

In consideration of the ongoing vigorous collection efforts and Robert Porcher?s financial situation,
staff recommends the acceptance of the settlement offer of 3100.00000 from Robert Porcher. The

loan balance is $150,099.82. The remaining balance of $50,099.82 will be written off. The loan is
100% reserved.

A resolution is attached for the Board?s consideration.

RE: SPIRIT OF DETROIT PLAZA PILOT PROJECT 

 

The Downtown Detroit Partnership and the City of Detroit are leveraging the creative suggestions
from Bloomberg Associates to create the Spirit of Detroit pilot project that connects the core
Downtown to Hart Plaza and the riverfront. This project will close Woodward Avenue from Larned
Street to Jefferson Avenue to vehicular traf?c and activate 18,000 sq. feet of space from June 12,
2017 to August 31. 2017. The project's primary goals are to test the viability of a permanent civic
space and to help craft a long-term vison for both public space and mobility across the city.

Scheduled performances are planned three days a week (Mondays. Wednesdays and Fridays)
from 12PM 2PM. This summer long series will feature family-friendly performances from
neighborhood based community arts organizations, with a goal of attracting residents and visitors
from across Detroit to the city's new Spirit of Detroit Plaza. By spotlighting neighborhood based
community groups, the series will embrace and reinforce the fact that Detroit's vitality and cultural
life extends well beyond its popular downtown.

The Downtown Detroit Partnership has requested $50,000 to implement the public space pilot
project. The total cost of the three-month project is $300,000, which supports work with the
Groundswell Design Group to re?ne and maximize the initial design, neighborhood and cultural
programming. maintenance. security and amenities.

Other funding for this project is provided from a combination of public and private sources including
the City of Detroit, Knight Foundation, MDDT, Quicken Loans and the William Davidson
Founda?on.

The DDA staff is recommending that the DDA Board support the Spirit of Detroit Plaza Pilot Project

by providing $50,000 toward the total operating cost of the three-month project. This contribution
is consistent with the DDA's support of other projects that the DDA has historically funded.
