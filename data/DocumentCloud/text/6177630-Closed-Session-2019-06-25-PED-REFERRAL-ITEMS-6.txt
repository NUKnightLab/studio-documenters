RE: Community Benefits Ordinance Thresholds

According to the City of Detroit website, the Community Bene?ts Ordinance is de?ned as the
following, he Community Bene?ts Ordinance (C30) is a law that requires developers to
proactively engage with the community to identi?z community bene?ts and address potential
negative impacts of certain development projects. The ordinance was approved by Detroit
voters in 2016.

When projects trigger the CBO process, a Neighborhood Advisory Council is established, with
nine representatives from the project?s impact area to work directly with the developer and
establish community bene?ts, which are included in the ?nal development agreement approved
by the Detroit City Council?!

On November 29, 2016, Detotroit City Ordinance #35-16, the Community Bene?ts Ordinancez
was published in the Detroit Legal News and became effective on that date.

The Community Bene?ts Ordinance applies when a development project:
. Is $75 million or more in value
0 Receives $1 million or more in property tax abatements 0R
. Receives $1 million or more in value of city land sale or transfer3

The Chemical Bank project, which recently received approval of both a Brownfield designation
and a Public Act 210 Commercial Rehabilitation to date, has not been designated as a

 

1 
ordinance

2 

3 Comminity Bene?ts webpage on the City?s website.

Tier 1 CBO project, and therefore not subject pursuant to the CBO Ordinance a Tier 1, or a
CEO eligible project. Tier 1 includes the de?nition of a project de?ned as:

?Tier 1 Development Project means a proieci in the City that is expected to incur
the investment Million Dollars 000, 000) or more during the construction
of facilities. or to begin or expand operations or renovate structures, where the developer of the
project is negotiating public support for investment in one or both of the following forms: (1)
Any transfer to the developer of City-owned land parcels that have a cumulative market value of
One Million Dollars ($1,000, 000) or more (as determined by the City Assessor or independent
appraisal), without open bidding and priced below market rates (where allowed by law); or (2)
Provision or approval by the City of'tox abatcnients or other tax breaks that abate more than
One Million Dollars Citv taxes over the term of the abatement that inure
directir to the Dercioocr. but not including Neighborhood Enterprise Zone tax abatements.4

According to the Brown?eld Plan for the Chemical Bank Project, which entails the new
construction of the new headquarters for Chemical Bank, the project required the following:

PROJECT INVESTMENT ESTIMATES

Capital Cost Total Cost

Hard Cost $71,000,000 to $72,000,000
Soft Cost $33,000,000

Total Capital Cost $104,000,000

Given the total capital costs of $104 millon for the project, given that this exceeds the $75
million threshold, it appears that this amount quali?es the Chemical Bank Project for a CEO
process under the ?Tier 1 Development Project? de?nition in the Community Bene?ts
Ordinance. Even if the project were to be determined to have a CEO de?ned investment of $72
million, this would only be $2 million below the established Tier 1 project designation
threshold. It has been the past practice of many developers with such a close investment
threshold to voluntarily enter into the CBO process. This was not the case with Chemical Bank.
However, the CBO ordinace does include an exemption provision, ?Section 14-12-5.
Exemptions. The requirements of this ordinance may be waived by resolution of the City
Council upon submission by either the Planning Director or the Developer (identi?/ing) reasons
that the requirements of this ordinance are impractical or infeasible and identifying how the
Developer will oth-erwise provide community benefits.? This provision was not acted upon as
well.

Therefore, it appears that designating the project for a waiver pursuant to the ordinance?s
provison, is the only alternative to a CEO designation available for the Chemical Bank project,
given the project?s $75 million investment.

Next in line for Chemical Bank, is the pending approval of a PA 210 Certi?cate, which unlike
its recently approved Brown?eld project and its PA 210 District approvals, PA 210 certi?cates

are subject to the provisions of the CBO Ordinance.

Due to this fact, it is important to ?nalize the CBO status of the Chemical Bank project.

 

4 Sec. 14-12-1. Purpose; Title

Finally, the Questions to the Administration are:

1. Why wasn?t the Chemical Bank project designated for the CBO process by the
Administration?

2. Since the project wasn?t designated designated for the CBO process, why wasn?t a
waiver proposed?
