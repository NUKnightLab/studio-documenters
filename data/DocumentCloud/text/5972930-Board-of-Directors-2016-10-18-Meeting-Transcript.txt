MS. DARLING:

So we are working with

2

Treasurer Summer's office and all of your

3

offices, actually, to make sure that these dates

4

work for everyone.

5

They are the dates we are working for right now.

6

They could change pending on all of your

7

schedule, but we wanted to put them out there.

8

And Patty will be confirming with your offices

9

if they don't work.

10

They are not confirmed.

We will make sure that they get moved

11

for ones that do work for you.

12

the dates that we have been working from.

13

they are very tentative and certainly subject to

14

change, but I wanted to let you know.

15

All right.

But these are

We will move on to a very

1

as a full-time member of our team and we are

2

really pleased about that.

3

all got a chance to work with him and talk to

4

him, and I know you will continue to enjoy

5

working with him and appreciate his expertise.

6

He has already, of course, made himself

7

indispensable and we are excited to have him as

8

a member of our team.

9

And I know you have

Also, as you know, we engaged the audit

10

firm of Prado & Renteria as the CIT's

11

independent auditor for 2015 and 2016.

12

reason for our meeting today on our agenda is to

13

finalize our 2015 financial statements and

14

approve the -- approve the audit as done by

15

Prado & Renteria.

16

The main

I do want to thank Yesenia Hernandez

17

and Hilda Renteria who have been incredibly

18

responsive and helpful on a very tight timeline

19

so that we can present this so our board today.

20

And I appreciate their work and am looking

21

forward to having a fulsome discussion of their

22

work.

23
24

As you know, last time we talked about
how we are continuing and interested in hiring

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 5

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

additional positions to the Trust by the end of

2

the year, especially a program analyst and

3

probably one or two additional interns.

4

Karwowski, our intern for the summer, has

5

continued with us on a very part-time basis.

6

She has been a great help.

7

we have plenty of work, so we are currently

8

interviewing some additional members to join our

9

team.

10

Nicole

And we realize that

I was lucky enough to be invited to the

11

U.S. Infrastructure Law forum, which is an

12

invite-only conference of about 50 members of

13

the infrastructure law community, really some

14

top-notch talent of a lot of expertise.

15

was very pleased to be invited from our friends

16

from Mayer Brown and was able to learn about

17

best practices and issues facing infrastructure

18

and peek REITs in the U.S.

19

And I

It was the first time they had done a

20

United States infrastructure law forum.

21

had done a North American law and done this same

22

forum in Europe, and this is the first time they

23

did a U.S. one.

800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

learn when faced with some of the same issues

2

that we are dealing with on our smart lighting,

3

RFP, and procurement, they were issues that have

4

been dealt with many times over.

5

able to really get a good feel that we were

6

absolutely on the right track with our

7

procurement and giving a lot of comfort and

8

excitement that we are on the right track with

9

our work.

10

And so I was

Also, we are going to talk today, based

11

on the timing of Yesenia and Hilda's schedule,

12

we are going to move into the audit first.

13

then I will talk to you about the procurement of

14

employee benefits for our employees.

15

kind of put a pin in that until we get past our

many years of our relationship.

Today we are presenting the results of

3

the financial statement audit for the year

4

ending December 31st, 2015.

5

includes just two items.

6

audit highlights, so that will be on page 8, and

then required communications.

Our presentation

The first item is

So on page 9, we are presenting that
the auditor's opinion on the financial

10

statements is unmodified, meaning a clean

11

opinion.

12

financial statements, we are presenting 2014

13

balances so that you can have something to

14

compare the results of 2015 to.

15

And in regards to highlights on the

So in terms of your statement of

16

financial position, your total assets increased

17

by 89 percent.

18

your assets is represented by cash.

19

And the majority, 91 percent of

Your liabilities increased by

20

45 percent compared to 2014.

21

those liabilities are represented by accounts

22

payable and accrued expenses.

23
24

And 71 percent of

Your net assets increased by a total of
315 percent compared to 2014.

In 2015, you have

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

two categories of net assets, unrestricted and

2

temporarily restricted.

3

net assets represent funding that you are

4

required to follow, like the grant agreement

5

requirements that you have with the City in

6

spending that money.

7

Temporarily restricted

And the next slide, we present the

8

statement of activities.

Your total revenue

9

increased by 23 percent.

And the majority, as

10

you know, 93 percent of your revenue comes from

11

City of Chicago grants.

12

financial statements, you indicate that that is

13

the case for 2015 and 2014, that the majority of

14

the funding comes from the City, and that if you

15

were to stop receiving funding from the City,

16

you will need to find other funding sources for

17

the organization.

18

And note five to the

Total expenses increased by 15 percent.

19

And salaries, benefits, and consultant fees

20

account for 79 percent of your expenses which is

-- salaries and benefits is typical in a

22

nonprofit organization.

23

for most of the expenses of the organization.

 10

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

there were no significant issues discussed with

2

management, other than the regular communication

3

that happens in an audit.

4

In terms of written communication

5

between our firm and management, we have

6

presented a standard client representation

7

letter that will be issued to us where

8

management will be representing that they are

9

responsible for the financial statements and

10

that they have disclosed everything to us that

is important to the audit.

And, finally, all significant

transactions have been recognized in the

financial statements of the Trust.

item that we need to communicate is we are

So if you have any questions about the

financial statements, we will be happy to answer

those questions at this point.

you all very much.

session for anything?

that.

it.

benefits, these documents are fresh off the

2

press from our insurance broker.

3

just share with you what we were thinking.

4

I wanted to

As you know, we are currently

5

recruiting new members to our team.

6

order to attract and to keep good talent, we --

7

we know we need to offer a full suite of

8

benefits.

9

And then in

In April of this year, you authorized

10

us to begin a 401(k) plan, which has been

11

operating as planned, and has been both very low

12

cost and easy to administer and a benefit to our

13

employees.

14

vision, and dental benefits so I wanted to share

15

with you the quotes that we have received.

16

We also need to offer health,

We are a very small organization, as

17

you know, and so we are somewhat restricted in

18

what kind of plans we can offer.

19

are looking at a PPO, Blue Cross Blue Shield

20

plan, and high-deductible health savings plan to

21

offer to our employees.

Right now we

22

You can see from the pricing there

23

approximately what it would cost per -- per

24

employee.

We are comparing two vendors right

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 13

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

now.

But from what we can see, the prices for a

2

company of our size where the coverages are

3

almost identical -- because the quotes are from

4

the same carriers -- we have been able to find

5

plans that should fit our needs.

6

So this is a budgeted line item that

7

would be included in a budget we have already

8

approved for 2016.

9

tentative 2017 budget.

And I shared with you a
It also has a line item

10

in there for employee benefits.

11

something that is -- that is new.

12

So this isn't

You can see the dental quote and also

13

the vision.

14

not dissimilar to non-profits of our size and

15

coverages that are somewhat similar to what the

16

City of Chicago offers.

17

questions on it.

18

These are very standard programs,

MR. FALK:

I'm happy to answer any

Clarify for the Board the

19

distinction between the Trust's proposed

20

contribution to the total premium expenses and

21

the employee contribution.

22

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

Right now we have not --

23

have not finalized that.

But our goal is to

24

have the Trust, again as budgeted, cover

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 14

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

approximately 85 to 90 percent of the coverage,

2

which is similar to what the City of Chicago

3

offers its employees.

And so we would like to

4

stay similar to that.

And, as mentioned, this

5

is what we budgeted for.

6

that up.

7

Thanks for bringing

Project updates.
MS. DARLING:

I think you all are aware that

21

our team has been absolutely consumed by

22

preparing two things for today.

23

working on getting our RFP ready to put on the

24

street for smart lighting and we've been working

We have been

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 15

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

to complete the audit.

2

you a brief update on where we are on the smart

3

lighting procurement.

4

So we are going to give

When we last spoke in July, you

5

approved the short list of nine respondents to

6

our RFQ for smart lighting.

7

fully engaged in an iterative process with those

8

nine respondents and we've been working to meet

9

the following goals, as you can see in the

10

And so we have been

slide.

11

We want to release the RFP by the end

12

of the month.

13

have a data portal and we've been posting draft

14

RFP documents on that data portal in an effort

15

to get feedback from the short list of

16

respondents.

17

reasons.

18

sure we have project feasibility.

19

to put out an RFP that the City's needs cannot

20

be met by the vendor community.

21

What we have been doing is we

And that was done for a number of

First and foremost is we want to make
We don't want

So this ensures and gives the vendors

22

an opportunity to respond to us and tell us what

23

works and what doesn't, to work on both the

24

technology aspects and the project

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 16

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

implementation and make sure that our analysis

2

and feasibility study that we did is accurate.

3

That has been well worth our while.

4

We have been very pleased with the

5

results.

We have gotten very positive and

6

helpful feedback that we can -- and many

7

questions, which we have been able to answer to

8

the end vendor community.

9

helped us refine our project scope.

And it's really
And our

10

goal is to make sure that we shorten the

11

timeline.

12

A lot of times the projects can -- the

13

RFPs can be out on the street for months and

14

months while the City answers questions and does

15

amendments.

16

the timeline as short as possible so we can move

17

to get this project on the street as quickly as

18

we can.

19
20
21

Our goal is to limit that and make

MS. HUBBARD:

All of the nine pre-approved

vendors received the RFP?
MS. DARLING:

That is correct.

But they are

22

encouraged to form teams.

23

be a short-list respondent to be on a team.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

And you don't have to

That was the list that you gave

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 17

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

us at the last meeting?

2

MS. DARLING:

That's correct.

3

MR. RAMIREZ:

Sorry.

Have any of them

4

announced an intent to work together yet that

5

you are aware of, or is that not the right stage

6

yet?

7

MS. DARLING:

No, they have not told us they

8

are team members, and they are not, at this

9

point, required to do so.

So there is -- you

10

know, we have encouraged them to form their

11

teams because we have let them know the -- our

12

intent is to issue the RFP in very short order.

13

So we would expect they will move quickly

14

because there will be a tight timeline to

15

respond to the RFP.

16

happen, but we have not been informed as to who

17

is on the team.

So we expect that to

18

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

19

MS. DARLING:

And the last thing is we are

20

also hoping for expedited contract negotiation.

21

So we released the contract terms and

22

conditions, which are very similar to the City's

23

typical boilerplate.

24

Chicago contract, not a CIT contract.

This will be a City of

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 18

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

So while we are conducting the

2

procurement, the actual contract will be with

3

the City of Chicago.

4

that's -- that we can cause that to be very,

5

very expedited.

And we are hoping that

6

You know, the whole point in doing this

7

is we want to make sure we have a project that's

8

plausible and practical, and we think we have

9

accomplished that through this process.

10
11

It's,

as I said, been very worthwhile.
Then I think I'm going to turn it over

12

to George and Tom to talk a little bit about the

13

LED, lighting public demonstration, and what's

14

going to be happening in likely early December

15

where we will display a proof of concept of the

16

lighting spec.

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

Early on, we committed as

18

part of the project goals to have public

19

engagement in this process because we recognized

20

that this represents a significant change in the

21

way that Chicagoans will experience the

22

nighttime within the city limits, so we want to

23

get this right.

24

lighting moniker was really about not the lights

necessarily, but how smart we are in choosing

2

the lights for the City.

3

And we have been working very hard on a

4

number of aspects.

5

have been directly involved in is developing the

6

specifications for the LED luminaries that are

7

going to replace our current lighting and the

8

technology that is going to be provided in

9

conjunction with this lighting.

10

The two primary ones that I

And we have formed these subcommittees

11

that have expert-matter experts.

12

been talking to other municipalities and

13

manufacturers and the guys who are writing the

14

current specifications nationwide and

15

internationally, and we are trying very hard to

16

get this right.

17

And we have

Chicago is recognized as having some of

18

the largest lighting infrastructure in the

19

nation, maybe the world.

20

looking here to see what Chicago is going to do,

21

so there comes a responsibility of getting it

22

right.

23
24

And so people are

We have come up with a lighting

But once this lighting specification is

somewhat codified, but before we prove it in the

market, our first level of public engagement

will be a proof-of-concept demonstration.

This

is where the City will procure luminaries that

they feel approximate the light levels that we

are specifying.

we are specifying as part of this project.

This is a proof of concept.

We have

It's not one of the vendors.

MR. MARQUISOS:

We are doing this

independently.
MS. HUBBARD:

We are saying this is what we

11

want, whatever vendor is successful, this is the

12

type of lighting we are using.

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

Theoretically, if we like

14

what we have specified, the vendor will be

15

offering their recommendation on the products

16

that closely meet those specifications.

17

would expect that what we put up on our own will

18

be duplicated or closely approximated by what we

19

end up choosing as the luminaires for the City.

20

So we

21

clear, currently Chicago turns on their lights

22

every night at dusk, and all the lights go on

23

pretty much equally across whole city.

1

more specifically to the context of lighting.

2

Instead of just one 250-watt bulb doing wherever

3

it's located, an alley, a street, or arterial,

4

we have specified light levels for eight

5

different contexts.

6

required in a viaduct or in an alley or in a

7

residential street with two-sided poles or

8

one-sided poles.

9

So a different light is

So we were trying to define light

10

levels per context.

11

different luminaries for different context, and

12

that is appropriate, right.

13

goals is to put light where it's needed and to

14

try to keep it out from where it's not.

15

that's part of this.

16

So this may result in

Because one of the

And

So we are demonstrating what we think

17

is the most prevalent, common context, and

18

certainly the one that's going to be open for

19

the most public input and that is what's the

20

light in front of my house.

21

residential streets, and we are going to be

22

putting them up and we are going to see what

23

they look like.

24

MR. O'SHEA:

So these are the

George, we will have the ability

 23

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

2

to increase the wattage in high-crime areas?
MR. MARQUISOS:

So that's a very good

3

question and that kind of goes to the next

4

piece, which is the technology piece.

5

So in addition to kind of having the

6

ability to put light more accurately where it's

7

needed, we now have the ability, because they

8

are solid-state lights, to get information from

9

the fixtures as to when they are working and

10
11

when they are not.
And so this technology, this central

12

lighting management network that we are going to

13

be implementing across the city, will give CDOT

14

real-time information about when lights are

15

operating or not.

16

function, to be more responsive.

17

citizens have to call 311 and then people go out

18

and verify whether the outage is real or not and

19

then, ultimately, it gets put on a list and gets

20

fixed at some point, as quickly as possible, but

21

it's not instantaneous.

22

there aren't people who are inclined to call,

23

then those lights can remain out for a while.

24

So this new system is going to be --

And that's the primary
Right now,

again, create a much more responsive environment

In addition to that, all of the light

fixtures that we will be acquiring through this

come with dimmable drivers.

7

ability to specify luminaries that have excess

8

lighting capacity and we can quote/unquote dim

9

them down to the normal levels if we so chose.

10

So we have the

levels might be required, we want to be able to

boost levels at a certain time should the

necessity arise.

I am not going to commit at this stage

that we are doing that citywide.

16

received pricing on it.

17

out as to what all the ingredients of that

18

capability will cost, and we will have to make

19

some tough decisions as to how much of that and

20

where to have that capability.

21

We haven't

Our RFP will prove that

But it certainly will be bought as part

22

of the overall procurement.

Every luminaire

will have a dimmable driver, and every luminaire

MS. DARLING:

If I can add to that, as George

3

referenced, a lot of this will be budget-driven.

4

We certainly have our own financial analysis of

5

what we think the lights will cost.

6

will be, as George said, proved out in the

7

responses to the RFP and the pricing that we

get.

12

and thoughtful about the budget.

13

But we will have to be cognizant

CHAIRMAN LINGENFELTER:

It sounds like the

14

infrastructure -- if we decided five years from

15

now to set these blocks in Alderman O'Shea's

16

ward, we want to have brighter lights and we can

17

figure out the funding, you can upgrade this

18

because the infrastructure lets you do that?

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

That's fair.

And,

20

ideally, we would be forward-thinking enough

21

where we identify areas where we would have

22

built-in capacity within the LED that we are

23

putting up that we could allow for boosting.

24

But we have to make those decisions once we find

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 26

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

out what is the incremental increase in cost and

2

are we going to do that citywide or are we going

3

to do that in certain areas.

4

where there really is not going to be much need

5

for boosted light levels in which case it would

6

be foolish to kind of spend the money to have

7

extra LEDs to do that.

8
9

MS. DARLING:

There may be cases

Certainly our goal at this

point, due to the fact that the LED lamps last

10

10 to 15 years, we certainly -- once we install

11

them, we want them to last for the whole

12

lifespan and not replace them or change them out

13

any earlier than their natural lifespan.

14
15
16

Anything you want to add, George or
Tom?
MR. MARQUISOS:

I guess I will bring up a

17

topic that's been kind of circulating and the

18

whole question, we will be demonstrating to the

19

public the, quote/unquote, typical LED lighting.

20

So this is what you are used to before with high

21

pressure sodium; this is what you are likely to

22

get with smart lighting when smart lighting is

23

done and 85 percent of the city's lighting has

24

been converted to LED.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 27

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

There is this whole question of what is

2

the color of the light going to be and it seems

3

to be a very big question these days.

4

various concerns and reasons, there is dark sky

5

people and there is health people and there is a

6

lot of people who are advocating for certain

7

types of lights.

8

choosing color.

9

And for

And there are tradeoffs by

So what we are specifying as part of

10

this in initial demonstration is we are going to

11

be demonstrating 300 Kelvin-degree temperature,

12

which is a warmer white LED than we are

13

currently accustomed to.

14

currently.

15

will be kind of, again, soliciting some feedback

16

on that as well.

17

We have 4,000 up

We will be putting up some 3,000 and

But the overall demonstration is to

18

look at the levels of light and the dispersion

19

and then the ancillary decision as to the color.

20

Just to be clear, 3,000 Kelvin will be

21

the fixtures that we are demonstrating in these

22

four geographic areas.

23

MR. RAMIREZ:

Did you say 3,000 or 3,700?

24

MR. MARQUISOS:

3,000.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 28

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

MS. DARLING:

Our hope is they will be

2

contiguous to the already existing 4,000 Kelvin

3

lights because we are -- we want people to have

4

the opportunity to look at both.

5

MR. FALK:

My recollection is that we've had

6

public comment at at least two prior meetings by

7

some public advocates who are concerned about

8

blue light, if I recall correctly.

9

no blue light being proposed?

10

MR. MARQUISOS:

So there is

So blue is a spectrum.

It's

11

a piece of the light spectrum and it is a

12

shorter wavelength.

13

above has more blue in it -- so the lower you go

14

temperature-wise, the less -- shorter

15

wavelengths you are releasing.

16

And the 4,000 Kelvin and

So the concern associated with short

17

wavelength blue spectrum light is theoretically

18

diminished when you go to a warmer white light.

19

So that's one of the reasons 3,000 is being

20

looked at.

21

migrating and moving towards 3,000 worldwide.

22

And so we wanted to see what the actual

23

difference is, so it's part of the reason we

24

chose to put it up in this demonstration.

It seems like the industry is

MS. DARLING:

Any other questions?

2

MS. BARRETT:

I had to step out for a second,

3
4

so apologies if you just covered this.
The idea of this type of transaction

5

is, of course, shared risk.

Because population

6

and economic and corresponding crime concerns

7

evolve over time and will evolve over the life

8

of this contract, how does that dynamic of an

9

evolving city not just be something that the

10

city has to absorb the risk on, but that is a

11

shared risk?

12
13

If you need to adjust --

MR. MARQUISOS:

The risk of adjusting light

levels should context change?

14

MS. BARRETT:

Yes.

15

MR. MARQUISOS:

I guess when we say one of

16

our goals is future ready, we are also -- we are

17

thinking about -- it's hard to predict the

18

future and there has been a lot of talk about

19

smart cities and sensors playing an integral

20

role in how we respond and live in our

21

environments.

22

fixtures that have the kind of accepted highest

23

level of input ports.

24

So we will be specifying light

So should additional sensors or

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 30

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

monitors or anything be needed in the future,

2

hopefully, we have what it takes to add them

3

cost effectively to what we are buying.

4

also -- again to reiterate the point, every LED

5

fixture will come with a dimmable driver and

6

will have the ability to adjust light levels

7

should the need occur because of a changing

8

context.

9

MS. BARRETT:

But we

But I hear you saying that if

10

there needs to be a boosting of capacity, that

11

would be the City's responsibility?

12

a scope change.

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

It would be

It really comes down to, it's

14

pretty simple, right, these are LEDs.

15

are light-emitting diodes.

16

you want more light, you need more

17

light-emitting diodes.

18

So they

And at some point if

So the question is how many of them are

19

you willing to buy at the juncture, upfront, at

20

a cost.

21

you are going to need most of the time, the

22

normal default levels that we are all proving

23

out as acceptable and this is the new lighting

24

of Chicago, then that is a cost.

And if you are buying what you think

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 31

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

1

If you want to say I want the capacity

2

to increase that, that's an additional cost.

3

want the market to tell us what that additional

4

cost is and we can make an educated decision as

5

to how much we are going to spend on it.

6

MS. BARRETT:

Thank you.

7

MS. DARLING:

And if I could just take a

8

quick second to acknowledge George and all his

9

work on this project because he has

We

10

quarterbacked this project from the beginning

11

when he first joined us and actually slightly

12

before that when he was at the BBC.

14

manage both the light spec committee and the

15

tech spec committee to make sure that we are

16

getting this right on behalf of the City has

17

been Herculean.

18

But the

And it is -- there is a lot of jokes

19

around our office about how many people it takes

20

to change a light bulb.

21

is an incredibly complex project, and we are

22

changing the face of the City of Chicago that

23

will effect every resident and every visitor to

24

our city.

But the truth is, this

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

extraordinarily seriously.

been led by George's great work on really

helping us, hopefully, master this project and

5

make sure that we are doing it right and serving

the City for years to come.

18

clear on that.

19

And so

This is a CID

So we are just translating what -- we

20

have some very knowledgeable people who have

21

been involved in Chicago's lighting for decades

22

now and they know the issues directly from their

4

One of the three ESCOs has not received their

5

final payment.

6

approved and ready to go, we are waiting for the

7

final lien waiver from them, and that will

8

conclude the whole project.

9

Everything

Although the pay application is

The good news is that we were able to

10

bring this project in on budget.

And we had

11

some surplus funds that are currently in escrow

12

that will be utilized over the next 14 years to

13

continue the monitor and verification.

14

annually, these ESCOs will be paid to go out and

15

verify that the savings are, in fact, being

16

maintained and the buildings are, in fact, being

17

operated as efficiently as they are today.

So

18

And so we are pleased that, you know,

19

the final accounting is done and we still have

20

money left over to pay for the M and V that is

21

scheduled in the upcoming years.

22

The other good news is that we have

23

received a fair amount of generous support from

24

various agencies that incentivize energy

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

 37

Report of proceedings - October 18, 2016

efficiency programs, primarily the Department of

Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

3

collectively today we have received $1,188,492

4

in energy efficiency incentives for this

5

program.

6

And

There is still an opportunity to

7

receive a little bit more as they -- that they

8

are still kind of negotiating what they are

going to distribute and when downstate.

But I

10

think right now that million one is in pocket

nice -- that was never really counted on.

13

it's a nice benefit for doing this kind of work.

14

So that's a really
But

I think overall the feeling has been

15

positive regarding retrofit one.

And to that

16

effect, 2FM has started conversation about doing

17

retrofit two.

18

and asked if we would be interested in going

19

another time, and we are looking at a laundry

20

list of buildings, some of which had been

21

analyzed in the previous round but dropped out

22

because they didn't quite meet the criteria.

23

And we are looking at now because the

24

technologies advanced since 2012.

So they have approached the Trust

coming up with a new list of buildings that

City and Trust.

it to see if we can't duplicate this.

MS. DARLING:

We would love to help implement

So I think part of the value

7

add that the CIT provides here is the

8

aggregation of projects and work with the sister

9

agency and the City.

Part of the retrofit one

10

was a relatively small financial project, even

11

though it was a large project that covered many,

12

many buildings, but it wasn't very extensive.

13

And part of what we are seeing in the

14

private finance world is they want to do

16

the value that CIT can provide is we can

17

aggregate those projects.

18

working with 2FM and the City of Chicago, of

19

course, on the city projects, we also have been

20

in contact with the senior people at the Chicago

Park District and MPEA, who have quite a large

project on deck.

financeable and feasible deal to do, and that's

the kind of value that we want to provide at the

CIT.

MS. BARRETT:

I think recognizing and sharing

5

kudos on this as well is important.

This is not

6

what people expect from a public sector

7

innovation like this is to save money and

8

deliver it under budget.

9

important is it to the Trust's future

So I'm wondering how

10

initiatives that we do some communications about

11

that success.

12

MS. DARLING:

I absolutely think that we will

13

be continuing to talk about it, especially as we

14

ramp up to retrofit two, to be able to speak

15

positively about the effects of retrofit one,

16

and also make sure that we are engaging our city

17

partners to talk about the benefits that have

18

been provided.

19

sure that we do that.

20
21

So absolutely, and we will make

percent of the funding came from the City.

1.2 million is obviously way more than 7 percent

of our P&L.

6

MS. DARLING:

That

Is that -- are we counting that

Yes.

And George can probably

7

address this first and foremost.

But the --

8

most of the money goes back to the City because

9

the City is the applicant to the grantors, you

10

know, which primarily are DCEO and Illinois

Clean Energy.

12

MR. FALK:

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

What is the Trust's net?
The Trust's net is just shy

14

of $100,000.

15

agreement that the City would recoup managerial

16

costs up to this level and anything above and

17

beyond that would revert to the Trust.

18

is a -- kind of memorandum of understanding.

19

It's 98,000.

So there was an

So the State recently

closed out its 2015 grant year and released some

2

funds, but we have not received those from the

City of Chicago.

4

That concludes our project updates.

And so at this point, we would have public

comment.

I think Patty had a -- an available

I think public comments is limited to
three minutes per person, and we are going to

Sir, do you want to begin?

Please introduce yourself.
MR. HARRIS:

My name is Anthony Harris.

14

the current president of the Chicago

Astronomical Society.

16

the Board for this opportunity to address my

17

concerns regarding the new LED streetlights.

18

And I would like to thank

I prepared a little statement.

But,

19

actually, all the actions that George -- if

20

those actions are followed, it's really

21

wonderful.

22

very well, very accurately.

I'm

He has really got the science down

My fear and my concerns when I travel
the country, I see a lot of really bad lighting.

Bad lighting that's not following good science.

2

In fact, I just got back from Yellowknife,

Canada, to view the Aurora Borealis.

Yellowknife, Canada, makes a lot of money off of

5

people flying up there to see the Aurora

Borealis.

industry and yet they have got their lighting

8

wrong.

9

It's a serious part of their tourist

And when I talk to people there, they

10

all thought these LEDs were going to make it

11

better.

12

brighter and so much bluer that they wind to

13

possibly poisoning their own industry.

14

But the new LEDs they have are so much

So, you know, seeing a situation like

15

that where it's so clear -- and Chicago,

16

obviously, doesn't have tourists flying in to

17

see sky, but it would still be nice if we could

18

aim our lights down where we need them and have

19

a warmer color so the nights are more beautiful.

20

We can maybe see some stars and we don't have

21

that ghastly blue illumination so we all look

22

like the walking dead.

23
24

So anyhow, I just want to thank George
very much for the work he has been doing.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

really am hopeful that this is going to make me

bring back some stars to Chicago and make our

city a much more beautiful, habitable place.

4

Thank you very much.

MR. MARQUISOS:

Thank you for your comments.

By the way, we are -- the lights you will be

seeing are full cutoff, so there will be no

Did our stars die?

looked right into my eyes because they didn't
