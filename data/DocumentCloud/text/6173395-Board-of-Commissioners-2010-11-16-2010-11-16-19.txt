in quality, structured programs throughout the calendar year. Through the After School Program

recreational, arts and theater activities. In 2010, 200 CHA youth were served by DFSS’ Out of

 Learn & Earn
In 2010, the Learn & Earn program served nearly 700 CHA youth ages 13 to 15 at City Colleges
sites throughout Chicago. In 2011, the Learn & Earn program will continue to provide 700 CHA
youth with academic enrichment and career exploration activities during the summer months.
Learn & Earn consists of two components: (1) an educational session conducted by an
educational provider and (2) a youth career development session delivered by participating
agencies. Participating youth receive a weekly stipend of $100, based on attendance. The
program runs for six weeks, five days a week for six hours a day.
Golden Diner
The Golden Diner provides full course meals that meet the recommended dietary allowances for
older adults to help them stay healthy and addresses isolation by providing the venue for
socialization and physical activities for seniors to engage in before and/or after meals are served.
In 2010, the CHA Golden Diner program served senior residents at 25 CHA senior buildings,
providing approximately 10,000 meals through each month.
Homeless Prevention Program
DFSS will provide homeless prevention services to CHA residents facing eviction from a CHA
public housing family development unit or a resident under the age of 62 living in a CHA Senior
building. The program is voluntary; CHA residents that choose to participate will be offered
services including, but not limited to: crisis counseling; emergency shelter/interim housing
placement; and relocation, transportation and emergency assistance. In 2010, (through
September 30th), DFSS conducted approximately 60 home visits, providing counseling and
referral services to 20 CHA residents facing eviction.
Early Childhood/Family Initiative
The Early Childhood/Family Iniatiative involves the provision of early childhood and family
literacy services to CHA families, specifically those with toddlers through children age 10.
Operation Warm
In 2011, DFSS will contribute to Operation Warm, a national non-profit organization, to
distribute free winter coats to CHA children and youth. In both 2009 and 2010, Operation Warm
provided approximately 10,000 coats that DFSS and CHA distributed to CHA children and youth
at a service fair held at the UIC Forum. The events were held in coordination with FamilyWorks
agencies and other organizations offering assistance with day care, job readiness and job
opportunities, health care, youth enrichment activities, literacy, substance abuse treatment and
other services.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Officer, or his designee, to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Department of
Family and Support Services in an amount not to exceed $3,012,660 for the period of January 1,
2011 through December 31, 2011 to provide supportive services to Chicago Housing Authority
(“CHA”) residents.
