COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM
FISCAL YEAR 2009 PRELIMINARY BUDGET
Transmitting a Communication, dated October 16, 2008 from
WARREN L. BATTS, Chairman, Cook County Health and Hospitals System
Please accept the Cook County Health and Hospitals System Board’s budget recommendation for the
County’s Health and Hospitals System for Fiscal Year 2009. The budget recommendation was approved
unanimously by the new System Board.
It is important to highlight that the System Board’s recommended budget is a transition budget in its
effort to rebuild, re-engineer and reform the County’s health care system. The System Board has been in
operation for just over three months. The Directors have met every week as a board or committee since
July to lay the groundwork for meaningful and lasting long-term reform. This budget represents the first
step in this process.
The recommended budget reflects four principal goals of the Board:
•
•
•
•

Improve existing revenue streams, as well as identify new revenue sources,
Seek operational efficiencies and economies,
Add the necessary core functions and capacities that are absent or inadequately staffed; and
Most importantly, deliver critical quality health care services to the uninsured and underinsured
residents of Cook County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 22, 2008
Each of these goals will take time to accomplish in addition to dedicated resources and qualified
personnel. They are interrelated in many ways. For example, institutional capacity for financial and
operational analysis, both of which have been woefully lacking, are necessary to identify operational
efficiencies and economies. Improved efficiency, and the resources thereby freed up, will be necessary to
ensure that critical services are available to all residents of Cook County who seek them from the System.
Meeting critical capital needs and improving our IT systems are required to accomplish all of our
responsibilities.
In broad brush, the budget was put together in the following way: First, the costs of inflation and Countynegotiated collective bargaining agreements were included. This circumstance alone accounts for nearly
60% of the recommended budget increase. Next, the most critical institutional capacity deficiencies and
service needs were identified and explicitly budgeted for, with new sales tax revenues. Finally, goals for
operational efficiencies and economies were established and identified as the source of funding for further
necessary capacity additions and the rebuilding of essential services.
As required under the Ordinance establishing the System Board, we have begun the strategic planning
process for the County’s health care system and the nationwide search for a permanent System Chief
Executive Officer. Both will be completed in the middle of the budget year and will significantly impact
the direction the System takes over the coming years.
However, the System cannot wait. Accordingly, the System Board has constructed a budget with
maximum flexibility, yet as realistic as possible at this time in the reform process. We have not asked for
everything we believe we need we are holding ourselves and our administrators to the task of finding the
additional resources to meet our needs from internal savings and improved revenues.
The budget submitted will be a living, breathing document. Over the course of the next fiscal year, the
System Board will expect the System management to identify opportunities for significant efficiency
improvements and revenue enhancements and the System Board will direct resources saved or obtained to
meet the additional System needs that have not been explicitly budgeted for. The process for
accomplishing this has already begun so that operational improvements can be realized as quickly as
possible.
Perhaps the most important number shaping this budget is a number that appears nowhere in the
document. Just last week, the U.S. Census Bureau released a new estimate of the number of uninsured
persons in Cook County - 784,930, or 16.9% of the population. The Cook County health care system sees
only a fraction of these persons each year, but serves as the ultimate safety net for all of them. In
addition, we have learned of unmet needs throughout the system, especially southern Cook County. We
know that the resources we have asked for in this budget are inadequate to these tasks, but nonetheless it
is our responsibility to provide quality health care services in an efficient and effective manner with our
limited resources.
Respectfully,

Warren L. Batts
Chair,
Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS)
Board of Directors
