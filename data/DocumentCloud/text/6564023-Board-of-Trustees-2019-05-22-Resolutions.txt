 Resolution Authorizing the Chief Financial Officer to
Declare the Official Intent of MetroHealth to Reimburse Expenditures
From Proceeds of Tax-Exempt Obligations
ADOPTED: May 22, 2019
RESOLUTION 19297
WHEREAS, The MetroHealth System (“MetroHealth”) intends to finance certain capital projects
from time to time (each a “Capital Project” and collectively, the “Capital Projects”) on a long-term
basis with proceeds of tax-exempt obligations;
WHEREAS, MetroHealth may pay for certain costs of such Capital Projects (“Project Costs”) with
funds of MetroHealth, or an affiliate of MetroHealth, prior to the time tax-exempt obligations are
issued to finance such Project Costs;
WHEREAS, United States Treasury Regulations Section 1.150-2 (the “Reimbursement
Regulations”) prescribe conditions under which proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations
(“Tax-Exempt Obligations”) can be used to reimburse advances made for certain expenditures
paid before the issuance of such Tax-Exempt Obligations, will be deemed to be expended (or
properly allocated to expenditures) for purposes of Sections 103 and 141 to 150 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), so that upon such reimbursement the proceeds
so used will not further be subject to requirements or restrictions under those sections of the Code;
WHEREAS, certain provisions of the Reimbursement Regulations require that there be a
Declaration of Official Intent not later than 60 days following payment of the expenditure expected
to be reimbursed from proceeds of such obligations, and that the reimbursement occur within
prescribed time periods after the expenditure is paid or after the property is placed in service; and
WHEREAS, this Board has determined to designate the Chief Financial Officer of MetroHealth
as a person authorized to declare official intent in compliance with the Reimbursement Regulations
with respect to future capital expenditures;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Trustees of MetroHealth as follows:
Section 1. MetroHealth hereby authorizes its Chief Financial Officer (or chief executive
officer or other person who carries out the duties and obligations of the Chief Financial Officer, if
the Chief Financial Officer is for any reason unavailable), in his sole discretion after consultation
with counsel, to (a) execute certificates in substantially the form of Exhibit A (the “Declaration of
Intent Certificates”) on behalf of MetroHealth for Project Costs which are reasonably expected to
be reimbursed from proceeds of Tax-Exempt Obligations, to the extent that such Project Costs are
paid prior to the issuance of the expected Tax-Exempt Obligations, (b) make appropriate
reimbursement and timely allocations from the proceeds of Tax-Exempt Obligations to reimburse
such prior expenditures, and (c) take any other actions as may be required under the
Reimbursement Regulations to satisfy the requirements for the reimbursement to be treated as an
expenditure of such proceeds for purposes of Section 103 and 141 to 150 of the Code.

 Section 2. The Declaration of Intent Certificates are intended to be a declaration of
MetroHealth’s official intent to reimburse the expenditure of Project Costs paid prior to the
issuance of Tax-Exempt Obligations, and any interim borrowing to be incurred by MetroHealth,
with proceeds of such debt, for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.150-2.
Section 3. This resolution shall be effective with respect to all future Capital Projects of
MetroHealth and shall take effect immediately.

Form of Declaration of Intent Certificate
I, Craig Richmond, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, HEREBY
CERTIFY as of the date set forth below with respect to the costs described on Exhibit A hereto
(“Project Costs”) to be financed with the proceeds of bonds, notes or other tax-exempt obligations
(collectively, “Tax-Exempt Obligations”) as follows:
(a)

MetroHealth reasonably expects to reimburse such Project Costs from proceeds of
Tax-Exempt Obligations.

(b)

That maximum principal amount of Tax-Exempt Obligations expected to be issued
to finance the Project Costs is $_____________________.

(c)

The Project Costs to be reimbursed with the proceeds of Tax-Exempt Obligations
will be “capital expenditures” in accordance with the meaning of Section 150 of the
Internal Revenue Code of1986, amended (the “Code”).

(d)

No reimbursement allocation will employ an “abusive arbitrage device” under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.148-10 to avoid the arbitrage restrictions or to avoid
the restrictions under Section 142 through 147, inclusive, of the Code, or any
successor provisions;

(e)

The proceeds of Tax-Exempt Obligations used to reimburse MetroHealth for the
Project Costs, or amounts corresponding to such amounts, will not be used in a
manner that results in the creation of “replacement proceeds”, including “sinking
funds”, “pledged funds” or funds subject to a “negative pledge” (as such terms are
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.148-1) of such Tax-Exempt Obligations
or other issues of debt obligations of the MetroHealth System, other than amounts
deposited into a “bona fide debt service fund” (as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.148-1); and

(f)

All reimbursement allocations will occur not later than 18 months after the later of
(i) the date the expenditure from a source other than Tax-Exempt Obligations is paid,
or (ii) the date the financed Project is “placed in service” (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.150-2, or any successor provisions) or abandoned,
but in no event more than 3 years after the expenditure is paid.

(g)

This certification is intended to be a declaration of The MetroHealth System’s
official intent to reimburse such expenditures, for purposes of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.150-2.
