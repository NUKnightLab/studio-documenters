NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING

A public hearing will be held by the City Planning Commission in the Committee of the Whole
Room, 131}] ?oor of the Coleman A.YoungMunicipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue. Detroit.

Michigan 48226, on
THURSDAY. MAY 2.. 2019 AT 5:15 PM

to consider the request of Parkstone DeveIOpment Partners on behalf of Wilbur Block, LLC to
amend District Map No. 7 of the Detroit Zoning Ordinance to show a SD2 (Special DeveIOpment
District, Mixed Use) zoning classi?cation where a M4 (Intensive Industrial District) zoning
classi?cation is currently shown for the properties generally bounded by Baltimore Avenue on
the north, the Lodge Expressway on the east, I-Iolden Avenue on the south, and Lincoln Avenue
on the west and more commonly known as 6302, 6310, 6320 Lincoln and 1262, 1240 and 1234
Wilbur Street.

The petitioner is proposing a mixed-use development to include approximately 43 apartments
and over 5,000 square feet of retail space.

The existing and proposed districts are generally described in the Zoning Ordinance as follows:

M4 INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
This district will permit uses which are usually objectionable and, therefore, the district is
rarely, if ever, located adjacent to residential districts. A broad range of uses is permitted in
this district. New residences are prohibited with the exception of loft conversions of existing
buildings and of residential uses combined in structures with permitted commercial uses.
These requirements are to protect residences from an undesirable environment and to ensure
reservation of adequate areas for industrial development.

SD2 SPECIAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT, MIXED-USE
This district is designed to encourage a complementary mixture of more intensive
pedestrian- and transit-oriented uses that may be compatible with a neighborhood center or
with a location along major or secondary thoroughfares. Parking requirements are reduced
in certain circumstances to promote use of transit and non-motorized transportation; shared
parking and a district approach to parking are encouraged to lessen demand for off-street
parking spaces. Certain establishments that serve alcohol for consumption on the premises
are permitted without a spacing requirement in order to attract increased pedestrian traf?c to
the area

Approval of a rezoning requires the approval of the City Council after receipt of a report and
recommendation by the City Planning Commission. This Zoning Ordinance map amendment

request is being considered consistent with the provisions of Article 111, Division 3 of Chapter 6]
of the 1984 Detroit City Code, the Detroit Zoning Ordinance.

You may express your views on this proposal by attending this hearing, by authorizing others to
represent you, or by writing to this of?ce prior to the hearing, 2 Woodward Avenue, Suite 202,
Detroit, Michigan 48226 (FAX: 313-224-4336). So that all who are affected have a chance to

case that they were not noti?ed.

With advance notice of seven calendar days, the City of Detroit will provide interpreter services
