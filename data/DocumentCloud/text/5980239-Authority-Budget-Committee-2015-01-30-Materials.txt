Call to Order and Roll Call
The Budget Committee of the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority met on
Friday, December 5, 2014, at 300 West Adams, Main Building Conference Room - 2nd
Floor, Chicago, Illinois. Authority Chair Peter M. Ellis called the meeting to order at
10:10 a.m. Authority General Counsel Lisa Stephens called the roll. Other Authority
members and designees present were Jennifer Greene for State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez,
Patricia McCreary for Clerk Dorothy Brown, Hon. Abishi Cunningham, Sheriff Tom
Dart, State’s Attorney Ramon Escapa, Rick Krause for Director S. A. Godinez, Felix
Gonzalez, Col. Marc Maton for Director Hiram Grau, Acting Director Bobbie Gregg,
John Harvey, Cynthia Hora for Attorney General Madigan, James Hickey for
Superintendent Garry McCarthy, Director Michael J. Pelletier, Rebecca Janowitz for
President Toni Preckwinkle, Randall Rosenbaum, and Jennifer Vollen-Katz. Also in
attendance were Authority Associate Director Wendy McCambridge, Authority Program
Supervisor Ron Reichgelt, Authority Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman, Authority
Special Projects Manager Mike Carter, Sharon Sidell representing Be Well Partners in
Health, and other Authority staff members and guests.

 1. Minutes of the October 10, 2014 Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Hora called for a motion to approve the minutes of the October 10, 2014
Budget Committee meeting. Mr. Gonzalez seconded the motion and it was approved by
unanimous voice vote.

2. Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) FFY10 and FFY12 Plan Adjustments
Associate Director McCambridge, referring to the memo in the materials dated December
5, 2014 and regarding the FFY10 and FFY12 JAG Plan Adjustments, said that the revised
meeting materials indicate that staff recommends designating $247,140 in FFY12 funds
to the Cook County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) for its Mental Health Discharge
Coordination Program and $59,790 in FFY10 funds to the Lake County Circuit Court
Clerk’s Office (LCCCCO) for its Data Exchange Development / National Information
Exchange Model (NIEM) -Based Data Exchange Program. The original version of the
meeting materials included designations to the Village of Addison and the Chicago
Housing Authority, but those two items will not be discussed at this meeting and were
removed from the final draft of the materials. The information regarding the Lake County
designation is in a separate stapled document that was distributed to the board members
at their places.
CCSO – Mental Health Discharge Coordination Program
Associate Director McCambridge said that the CCSO requested $247,140 for a program
beginning on January 1, 2015. The CCSO’s Mental Health Discharge Coordination
Program is a mental health discharge coordination from the Cook County Department of
Corrections (CCDC). The CCDC had piloted the Be Well Partners in Health (BWPH)
program in June of 2013 for 10 weeks. The CCDC wants to make some changes to the
program and fund it for a full year, expanding it to a five day per week program.
Sharon Sidell, Executive Director of BWPH, said that when this program began, it dealt
with people who were pre-bond and who had not yet been incarcerated. If this project is
approved, it would also include some portion of the population that would be discharged
from jail. BWPH is a network of services involving over 50 agencies including mental
health and chemical dependency support agencies, hospitals, community health centers,
etc. BWPH’s role is to provide intensive service for people who are transitioning out of
jail and into the community, with the goal of preventing them from being incarcerated.
Ms. Vollen-Katz asked how many people the program currently serves.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
December 5, 2014
Page 2

 Ms. Sidell said that the program is not currently operating, but the proposed program
would serve nearly 800 people per year.
Ms. Vollen-Katz asked if there was a mechanism for tracking those 800 individuals in
terms of rates of re-arrest or re-incarceration and, if so, for what period of time.
Ms. Sidell said that BWPH tracks these people for a minimum of six months after they
are engaged. BWPH would work with the Authority to track the proposal from a quality
standpoint and BWPH will work with an evaluator from the University of Illinois at
Chicago (UIC) who will track data.
Ms. Vollen-Katz asked what sort of justice system contact would be tracked; all of it or
just re-arrest or re-incarceration for those who have matriculated out of the program.
Ms. Sidell said that all of it would be tracked. BWPH is also looking at hospitalizations
and hoping to keep people out of hospitals as well.
Ms. Sidell, in response to a question by Mr. Harvey, said that it would be safe to assume
that most of these people would have primarily been served in the state-funded mental
health system 30 years ago.
Ms. Jacobs requested more detail about the target population; who are they, what is their
eligibility criteria, and how are they connected while they’re in jail?
Ms. Sidell said that these people are seriously mentally ill. There are about 15 definitions
for all of the diagnostic categories. Historically, when dealing with people on the
boundary coming into the system, they are evaluated by some very talented CCSO staff
members to determine whether they are mentally ill, whether by self-reporting, their own
assessment, or by family. BWPH has not yet begun to work with the people in jail facing
discharge, but those people will get attention and assistance as they transition out.
Sheriff Dart said that the program works like a funnel. 200 or so people are dropped off
every morning in the main jail. Prior to them getting to bond court, mental health workers
assess incoming people; there is some self-reporting, but staff also review previous
incarceration periods and types of mental health issues that they have. CCSO staff work
with the public defender’s office at the evaluation point and then incoming people are
identified by health professionals after that. Some of them may have to be found eligible.
CCSO evaluations will be sent to BWPH. For those who are kept in CCSO custody,
CCSO staff members have been doing the discharge for the last year or so. People who
are diagnosed as mentally ill get funneled in from the back end. For the last three years,
the CCSO has been improvising in terms of finding resources, finding housing, finding
medical providers for these people and it has been very difficult.

 Ms. Jacobs said that she did not see in the proposal the explicit goal of reducing the
lengths of stay for these people. She asked if that would be an anticipated outcome.
Sheriff Dart said that the majority of the people in CCSO custody are in for minor things.
When staff started to poll the population, they found that lengths of stay were longer
because with all of the issues that these people have, such as not having places to live for
extended periods of time, showing up of a court date is not really high on their lists of
things to do; they have probation violation issues and things like that. They spend
extended periods in custody on insignificant charges, so their lengths of stay are much
higher than we had imagined for that population. Given everything that the CCSO has
already done and this program’s particular impact, lengths of stay should decrease.
Ms. Janowitz said that this program is very important because it involves very seriously
mentally ill people. With proper diagnoses and support, we hope that these people will
never go back to jail. There are other efforts that will support this program and encircle it;
programs for people whose illnesses are not so acute, but who have ongoing substance
abuse and mental health issues. The public defender’s office does a great deal of work
with people as they come into bond court to make sure that the judges have a great deal
more information about them. There is a group of people who may spend a very long
time in jail and who have very extensive records, but when the records are examined,
they add up to virtually nothing. These are not the people of whom the public should be
afraid; they’re the people who sit next to you or on top of you on the “L” – they’re not
going to mug you, their stuff will fall on you. From the Cook County Board’s
perspective, this is a very important effort, but it is part of a larger effort. There are many
people coming through the jail right now who will have most of their services provided
through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but for an individual with an
Axis-1 level diagnosis appointments might not be enough; residential treatments might be
in order.
Mr. Rosenbaum asked what happens if there is a criminal charge. Three things can
happen; there is an assessment, the state’s attorney declines to prosecute, or the person
gets released as a condition of bond. Would this program be applied after a guilty plea, as
a condition of probation, or as a combination of everything?
Sheriff Dart said that the CCSO has not seen the dismissal of charges yet, but there is the
mental health court where a charge can be thrown out later on. The mental health court is
great, but it handles about 200 cases a year while the jails hold thousands of people with
mental illnesses on any given day, so it cannot properly address the scale of the problem.
The CCSO has tried to engage the judiciary with very, very modest luck. The CCSO is
flexible in terms of whether this program is implemented at the outset as a condition of
bond or in terms of probation afterwards; these would all be very valuable and the CCSO

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority

 hopes to get more buy-in from the judiciary, which has been very difficult. He said that
he has been working on this issue for five years and mostly it has been the CCSO and its
resources making some of these things happen. The way the system works, mentally ill
people are often just dumped into jails. Identification can be done for housing purposes
and what treatments they need while they are in CCSO custody. There is virtually no
discharge plan at all. The CCSO is open to any of the different way that this could work;
it would be great if it was woven into bond court or probation so that people stay
engaged.
Ms. Janowitz said that most of these charges are dropped; not because judges intervene,
but because they are the kinds of charges that nobody will pursue.
Sheriff Dart said that they are discharged for the wrong reasons.
Ms. Janowitz said that the public defender would have to say that they are discharged for
the right reasons because the charges are not sustained.
Sheriff Dart said that it is not as if two intelligent people enter the room and say that this
is not what should be done with our resources; it’s because people don’t show up for
court, the victims don’t come in, etc.
Ms. Janowitz said that the county is trying to articulate that response through programs
like this; people should not be picked up on these charges, they should be diverted.
Sheriff Dart said that that has been his position for years.
Ms. Janowitz said that there has been an enormous movement, supported by the CCSO,
in terms of the Discharge Lounge and the work that Treatment Alternatives for Safe
Communities (TASC) has undertaken. Most of the charges involved here are not for
things that we have to worry about.
Sheriff Dart said that he couldn’t agree more. The percentage of the average jail
population that is mentally ill is in the 60’s. That is a ridiculously high number and those
people are filling up the jail. By comparison, the percentage in jail for violent offenses is
in the 20’s or low 30’s. The people we’re talking about are the one we always have the
same discussion about. These are not terrible people, they’re guilty of crimes of survival;
they’re just trying to get through the day.
Authority Chairman Ellis said that when he first took the role as Authority Chairman,
Sheriff Dart raised this issue. The statistics are staggering and the results are even worse.
It is very commendable to see all of the different areas working together, as everyone
recognizes the problem.

 LCCCCO Data Exchange Development / NIEM-Based Data Exchange Program - Child
Support Information Data Exchange (CSIDE)
Associate Director McCambridge said that the Data Exchange Development Program,
also known as the Illinois Child Support Information Data Exchange (CSIDE), requested
$59,789.88 for its program with a start date of January 1, 2015. This data exchange
project would allow real-time transfer of child support court orders in the LCCCCO to
the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. This project would use
technology tools of the Global Standards Package / National Information Exchange
Model (NIEM). Primary benefits of the CSIDE project are increased collections;
improved access to current case information; faster case intake; and potential for
automated case initiation, paper reduction, and error reductions. This is a pilot project and
once completed it can be replicated statewide. Lake County will serve as the
implementing agency and then DHFS will take ownership and responsibility for the
project and implement it statewide. Associate Director McCambridge described the
program’s budget details as described in the Grant Recommendation Report in the
meeting materials.
Ms. Hora requested that she would like to receive the meeting materials earlier. This
document was distributed the day before the meeting and she would have liked to have
had her assistant who handles child support issues provide input.
Associate Director McCambridge apologized and said that there was a piece of
information that staff was waiting to receive prior to making the designation
recommendation, but that information did not arrive until the day before the meeting.
Authority Special Projects Manager Mike Carter said that it was his understanding that
the project manager for CSIDE has been working with the Attorney General’s Office
(AGO) on this project and discussions have taken place.
Motion: Ms. Hora moved to approve the JAG FFY10 and FFY12 plan adjustments. The
motion was seconded by Ms. Greene and approved by unanimous voice vote.
At this point, Sheriff Dart left the meeting and was replaced by his designee, Kathryn
Dunne.

 3. Grants to South Suburban Major Crimes Task Forces (SSMCTF) SFY15 Plan
Introduction
Associate Director McCambridge, referring to the memo in the materials dated December
5, 2014 and regarding the SFY15 SSMCTF Plan Introduction, said that these funds were
earmarked to be provided to the SSMCTF as a line item appropriation. The Authority
was named as the state agency to administer these funds. Staff requests that these funds
be awarded to the SSMCTF and be available by January 1, 2015. The intent of the
program is to continue to operate the SSMCTF which is responsible for the investigation
of homicides and other heinous crimes within the 58 member communities which are
located in two counties, Cook and Will. These funds will allow the task force to update
computer and communication capabilities, to continue to operate a central headquarters
facility, and it will allow for training to be increased to improve the abilities of the task
force to meet real and mandated training needs. Associate Director McCambridge
described the program’s budget details as described in the Grant Recommendation Report
in the meeting materials.
Associate Director McCambridge, in response to a question by Ms. Hora, said that there
are times that the Authority pays for audits in grant proposals.
Ms. Hora asked if legal fees are normally covered by grants. She said that if the purpose
of the grant is for training and equipment, then legal fees and audits seem like odd things
for the grant to pay for.
Associate Director McCambridge said that the grant would also support general office
operations, so that’s where legal fees and audit fees would come into play. The Authority
is only acting as a pass-through agent for these funds.
Col. Maton said that the SSMCTF is a fairly large group. Three years ago they passed
legislation to require lead homicide investigators to get certification every year. Funding
for the SSMCTF is made up from contributions from Illinois agencies, many of which are
cash-strapped. The South Suburban chiefs approached the Illinois legislature and asked
for this funding to support their operations, which was granted in a line item. Originally,
that grant was given to the Illinois State Police (ISP), so this isn’t a new grant to the
SSMCTF; it’s about three years old. It was determined that it was a conflict of interest for
the ISP to be the granting agency for a task force while also serving on that task force’s
advisory board, so the request was made to have the Authority be the granting agency
moving forward for as long as the legislature identifies funding for this project.
Motion: Ms. Greene moved to approve the GSSMCTF SFY15 plan introduction. The
motion was seconded by Ms. Dunne and approved by unanimous voice vote, with an
abstention by Ms. Jacobs.

 4. Violence Against Women Act – Arrest Grant (VAWA A) FFY14 Plan Adjustment
Associate Director McCambridge, referring to the memo in the materials dated December
5, 2014 and regarding the FFY14 VAWA A Plan Adjustment, said that at the October 10,
2014 Budget Committee meeting, staff provided information regarding the recent award
of the VAWA A funds. In that proposal, the Authority laid out a plan to utilize the
existing structure of the Illinois Family Violence Coordinating councils (IFVCCs) to
accomplish work related to the IFVCC Integrated Protocol. The Integrated Protocol
initiative has as its goal the statewide adoption and implementation of protocols for law
enforcement, prosecution, and victim services on domestic violence, elder abuse, and
abuse perpetrated against women with disabilities. These funds will allow this work to
continue and to expand.
Associate Director McCambridge said that the first grants developed protocols and
training primarily for law enforcement. This next three-year period seeks to expand by
providing training to first responders and court personnel on these protocols and also to
incorporate evaluation work. Until now, there has not been a very strong component of
evaluation for the VAWA A program. The Authority will provide some evaluation work
to measure the effectiveness of the protocol trainings that have occurred to date. More
technical assistance will be provided to different circuits in this program that may not be
having as great a result as the others. Best practices and other information will be shared
so that all of the circuits will be on the same page regarding the protocols.
Associate Director McCambridge said that there are 20 grants being recommended for
designation totaling $247,820. Those 20 grants will go to the circuits and there will also
be statewide grants given to Macon Resources (also known as Blue Tower Training) and
to the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board’s (ILETSB) Executive
Institute. Blue Tower Training has provided support for these protocols, provide input
into training, and have expertise in aging protocols and disabilities. ILETSB has been
instrumental in developing trainings for law enforcement personnel and will build on the
work that they performed under the previous grant toward first responder and court
personnel applications. Associate Director McCambridge called attention to the line item
designations listed in the Grant Recommendation Report in the meeting materials.
Ms. Greene requested more information about the Illinois Law Enforcement Leadership
Institute on Violence.
Associate Director McCambridge said that she would provide a list of that organization’s
members and information about its history. The program director for this program is in
the Authority’s Springfield office and was unable to attend this meeting.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
December 5, 2014
Page 8

 Ms. Hora asked how many agencies have adopted the protocols across Illinois; how many
counties, law enforcement agencies, etc.
Associate Director McCambridge said that she would provide that information.
Authority Chairman Ellis asked the committee if it felt that enough information had been
provided regarding this program to comfortably vote on it or if the committee would
rather get more information and re-assess it at the next Budget Committee meeting.
Ms. Hora said that she did not feel comfortable voting on it. She said that if protocols are
developed, but nobody is looking at them or adopting them, then she has concerns about
providing training on something that law enforcement or prosecution agencies haven’t
accepted.
Associate Director McCambridge, in response to a question by Mr. Gonzalez, said that
the Exeter Group is the fiscal agent that had been chosen by the circuit court. They
provide support to organizations the write grants and provide fiscal support and
information for other grant use across the state.
Mr. Gonzalez noted that the Exeter Group is set to receive the largest award from this
allocation. He asked how their designation would break down.
Ms. Greene said that the Exeter Group covers six circuits, so it breaks down to about the
same amounts as the other individual circuits; they are just the fiscal agent.
Director Cutrone said that the grant as described here follows the program that was in the
Authority’s application to the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). Basically,
staff is asking that the committee implement the Authority’s grant application to OVW.
Ms. Greene said that she supported voting on this program without the information that
she had requested.
Ms. Greene, addressing Ms. Hora earlier question, said that the protocol for law
enforcement and prosecution is something that’s existed for a while. She said that the
Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (CCSAO) has contributed to the protocol
implementation, but hasn’t completely adopted it; things are different for a county like
Cook, which is a large county, but Cook County has certainly adopted components of the
protocols. Cook County has adopted this as a sort of format as opposed to a wholesale
application of the protocols.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
December 5, 2014
Page 9

 Ms. Hora said that she understood that. She said that her concern was that people aren’t
even looking at these protocols as a model and making adjustments and modifications for
their particular counties. It might not be financially prudent to put money into something
that isn’t being used by the agencies.
Associate Director McCambridge said that she could find out who has been trained in the
protocols and the number of people that have been trained, but she might not be able to
find out to what extent the protocols have been implemented. This is where evaluation
comes into play; we’re going to ask, “How have you implemented the protocols? Where
have you implemented them? How are they working? How can you say that they’re
working?”
Authority Chairman Ellis asked if there were any time considerations that the committee
should be aware of if a vote on this is put off until the next Budget Committee meeting.
Associate Director McCambridge said that a delayed vote would just delay staff being
able to process the grants and have all of the circuits start their programs on time, with
the start date being March 1, 2015. It is anticipated that the next Budget Committee
meeting will be in late January, 2015, so it would just delay the circuits in terms of their
abilities to start work on their grant applications. These grants are fairly small amounts of
money; however, these funds support salaries of part-time coordinators in each circuit.
According to the program director, these coordinators do more work than what they’re
being paid for; this is a labor of love for them.
Ms. Jacobs said that it would be useful to hear from the coordinating councils regarding
what this training is; how it affects the local practices and policies; how it affects
outcomes that they are seeking and are interested in. It would be useful to hear what
resources are lacking and what additional resources could do for cash-strapped agencies.
We need a holistic view of what these services and draining actually do.
Director Cutrone said that he and Associate Director McCambridge have been meeting
with the IFVCC steering committee and have planned a strategic planning meeting for all
of the councils on this. The meeting would probably be in April or May of 2015.
Authority Chairman Ellis said that he did not want to delay the vote, but also did not want
to have information coming in to the committee after the vote has been taken, as that
seems backwards. He said that he was sensitive to the fact that people are working on
these programs even without proper funding, but we need to do the job of getting
information that some of the committee members have requested beforehand in order to
make informed decisions.

 Associate Director McCambridge, in response to a question from Mr. Harvey, said that
this is not an annual award from OVW; it is part of a three-year award.
Mr. Harvey said that in Madison County, the bulk of the work is done by the domestic
violence agency. They would be happy to share the successes of these protocols. The
trick is to ask people to document their experiences in some relatively easy format. This
work is largely unfunded and particularly with elder abuse and domestic violence, there is
a lot of work, mostly being done by advocates. There’s a court administrator in Madison
County who schedules the meetings, but the committee meetings are staffed by
advocates, so we can’t buy that, but some expectation of documentation to indicate where
they are with things and what training is received would be appropriate. He said that he
would vote for this program provided that the grantees generate consistent documentation
that can be gathered and stored in one place.
Director Cutrone said that staff had tried to anticipate questions about this program. The
program’s director was unable to attend this meeting.
Motion: Col. Maton moved to approve the VAWA A FFY14 plan introduction. The
motion was seconded by Ms. Dunne and approved by voice vote with an abstention by
Acting Director Gregg and a no vote by Ms. Hora.

5. Violence Prevention Programs - Violence Prevention Grants (184 VPG) and
Community Violence Prevention Programs (318 VPP)
Community Violence Prevention Programs (CVPP)
Associate Director McCambridge, referring to the memo in the materials dated December
5, 2014 and regarding the Violence Prevention Grants (184 VPG) and Community
Violence Prevention Programs (318 VPP) fund, said that staff recommends that the funds
described in the memo be used to support the Safe From the Start (SFS) program. She
said that information about SFS had been presented to the Budget Committee at its April
9, 2014 meeting and at its June 27, 2014 meeting. SFS itself was approved at that
meeting. At that time, staff anticipated that the Authority would receive funding for SFS
via the Budget Implementation Bill (BIMP), but that did not pass. The Authority had
enough money in its Fund 184 to support half of this program. Staff simply requests that
the program and the individual grantees’ designations remain the same, with the
exception of the Macon County Child Advocacy Center, which will no longer be funded;
staff just requests that these grants be funded using a different stream of money; money
that the Authority received from the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) for
violence prevention programming.

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
Budget Committee Meeting
December 5, 2014
Page 11

 Ms. Hora asked if any thought had been given to continuing SFS after the year.
Associate Director McCambridge said that staff would look for recommendations for
SFS to be included in the SFY16 budget.
Associate Director McCambridge, in response to questions from Ms. Hora, said that these
funds, originally intended to support CVPP programs, were available because the original
program cost estimations from the grantees was more than what was actually needed, so
staff wants to apply those remaining fund to SFS.
Director Cutrone said that staff had worked this out with the Governor’s Office of
Management and Budget (GOMB). Staff had issues with CVPP funding ending before
we expected it to. At some point the Comptroller’s office told the Authority that they
would no longer issue warrants from Fund 318 for these grant programs. About that time,
the Authority received its second infusion of funds from IDHS. GOMB had worked that
out with IDHS. The interagency agreement governing the second infusion from IDHS
was broadened specifically to accommodate the SFS grants as described here.
Ms. Jacobs said that, having a bit of knowledge about the backgrounds of the programs
that these funds were pulled from on IDHS’s end, this is really unfortunate. Unless
something changed, these funds were pulled from crisis intervention programs across the
state that assist schools and law enforcement and that work with families in crisis. She
said that she thought that these funds were pulled from the Comprehensive Community
Based Youth Services (CCBYS) program. The SFS programs presented here are critical,
but so were the CCBYS programs.
Director Cutrone clarified that the first $5 million that the Authority received from IDHS
was out of the CCBYS line item. That money is gone. The second $2.3 million is out of a
more general line item in IDHS’s budget. The Authority is very aware that there were
many worthy potential recipients of these funds that will not receive full funding.
Associate Director McCambridge said that the original funding stream supported four
programs and SFS is the only one of those four that will still receive funding. IDHS is not
the only agency that is not receiving funding. Staff decided that SFS was worth saving
because it had been researched every year from implementation. SFS started under the
Illinois Violence Prevention Authority (IVPA), which worked with UIC to establish a
long-standing evaluation relationship. It would be difficult to find another program that
has been researched in the way that SFS has. SFS should be funded as long as the
Authority is able to fund it.
Mr. Harvey said that the Chicago Reader did a great story about SFS and it was an
excellent example of a little money going a long way.

 Ms. Jacobs said that her comments were not a criticism of SFS. She said that her concern
was that CCBYS programs were also very important in helping families, law
enforcement, and youths from being arrested whenever possible.
Ms. Hora said that she had concerns about giving money to the Phoenix Crisis Center
(PCC). She said that she has had contact with PCC through another grant program and
PCC had significant deficiencies in their 2011 audit and she said that she was not sure if
those had been corrected. PCC seems to be very unstable in that in the past three years it
has had three, possibly more, executive directors. One very competent executive director
came from an agency that she had started in Belleville, Illinois, and she quit after four
weeks. There is speculation as to whether the building that they are in is in the process of
being sold. The AGO is not funding PCC this year.
Associate Director McCambridge said that staff shared Ms. Hora’s concerns about PCC
and that PCC’s funding will end as of December 31, 2014. Staff has talked to PCC and
staff shares concerns about PCC’s revolving door of executive directors and some other
issues that have come up. PCC has failed to come forward with a plan as to how they
would continue and they have been inconsistent with different coordinators.
Ms. Greene said that the memo shows $123,475 being designated to PCC.
Authority Program Supervisor Shai Hoffman said that the actual budget for PCC under
consideration is closer to $30,000.
Director Cutrone said that these amounts were previously designated to carry these
programs through December 31, 2014. They have, or should have, spent whatever portion
that was going to be spent. There is a relatively small amount of money that will allow
PCC to operate through December 31, 2014, at which point funding to PCC will be
terminated.
Ms. Hora said that she was concerned that if she votes for this, the vote would be to
continue the designation until June or July of 2015.
Associate Director McCambridge said that she would like to amend on the floor that the
information for the PCC line item be changed. The designation would be for $30,000 and
that its grant would end on December 31, 2014.
Motion: [Unidentified] moved to approve the Violence Prevention Grants (184 VPG)
and Community Violence Prevention Programs (318 VPP) fund designations. The motion
was seconded by [Unidentified] and approved by unanimous voice vote, with abstentions
by Ms. Greene, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Harvey, Ms. Jacobs, and Ms. Hora.

Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended consequences)
Through information gathered from an initial assessment with the IJIS Institute in June 2013, it was recommended that a new countywide records management system be implemented throughout DuPage County. A professional service was retained to assess the needs
and develop a request for qualification to ultimately procure a report management system. Once a system and vendors were
established and retained, the Implementing Agency created an RFP for the services of a Project Manager to oversee the development
and implementation process of the new county-wide records management system. Due to delays with the RFP selection process and
unforeseen technical delays (from the vendors), the development process of this new system is still in the works and needs to be
extended to fully implement the new system.
When the Village of Addison stakeholders originally applied for funding the total cost of the program was unknown. Since the market
cost for the project was unknown only $125,000.00 was requested. Subsequently the Village of Addison received 3 responses to a
Request for Proposal (RFP). Every response exceeded the amount that was originally requested. The most responsive RFP which also
happened to be the lowest bid was accepted. The vendor bid was in the amount of $212,676.00. $87,676.00 is the monetary difference
between the grant amount and the minimum bid.
Under agreement #410500, performance period April 1, 2014 – September 30, 2014, the Village of Addison was awarded $125,000.00
to hire a project manager to develop the countywide record keeping system that was mentioned above. The grantee failed to submit a
request for amendment, to extend the end date, on time. Agreement # 410500 ended with only $17,723 spent. The $17,723.00
covered the following services; project management of RMS, CAD, Integration project-scope, development of a website, funding and
requirements identification. A new grant agreement was started in order to use the balance of the $125,000 which is $107,277.00.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize what will
be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):

The purpose of the Family Violence Coordinating Councils, at both the state and local/circuit level, is to establish
a forum to improve the institutional, professional and community response to family violence including child abuse,
domestic abuse, and elder abuse; to engage in education and prevention; the coordination of intervention and services for
victims and perpetrators; and, to contribute to the improvement of the legal system and the administration of justice.
Through the local and state councils, we are ready to begin a process of reflective evaluation and strategic
planning that includes dialogue and facilitated exploration, involving scenario based conversations for individual,
organizational, and system learning; sensing the emerging issues; and fashioning desired outcomes. We are dedicated to
finding ways to assist local councils in their efforts to take the next steps to higher development. IFVCC’s greatest
resource continues to be our relationships with our partners and stakeholders, the value we place on our interdependence,
the meaning we gain from deep connections through our work together, and our mutual commitment to a world free of
family violence.
The goal of a strategic planning meeting is to bring IFVCC stakeholders from across the state together to in order
to develop a statewide strategic plan, including:
• A vision statement,
• A mission statement,
• Clear objectives,
• Viable strategies,
• And action plans to implement those strategies.
The strategic planning meeting will be a one day meeting, held in the second week in May 2015 in a central
Illinois location (either Springfield or Bloomington). It is estimated that approximately 50-60 statewide stakeholders will
attend the meeting.

Note – This designation was previously awarded to Cook County at the December 5, 2014 Budget Committee meeting.
This designation is an administrative procedure to change the implementing agency from Cook County to the Be Well
Partners in Health Coordinated Care Entry.
Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended
Background
In June of 2013, a 10 week pilot program was implemented at the Cook County Department of Corrections (DOC) that
partnered staff at the DOC and Be Well Partners in Health Partnership (BWPH) in a coordinated effort to connect
detainees with serious mental illnesses with resources in their communities.
Be Well Partners in Health is a Coordinated Care Entity (CCE) selected by the State of Illinois to provide services to
adults with mental illness who may also have concurrent medical, substance abuse or developmental disabilities issues.
The goal of BWHP is to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits while improving the quality of
care rendered to adults with serious mental illness (SMI). Currently, BWPH is the only CCE exclusively focused at
providing services to persons with SMI and is the only CCE actively engaged with treating the incarcerated mentally ill
population in Illinois. A pilot project was conducted at the Cook County Department of Corrections (DOC), which
focused on persons who were charged with non-violent crimes, who had been diagnosed with a mental illness and who
qualified for EM/I Bond. The pilot lasted onsite for two and a half months, with an additional six months of follow-up
services for persons enrolled in care coordination.
The program was designed to address the increasing amount of inmates who are diagnosed with or self-identify serious
mental illness. An estimated 33% of the population at the DOC suffer with a SMI, and more than 70% of these individuals

9/08/2014

 JAG FFY12
January 30, 2015

have a co-occurring substance abuse disorder (SUD). These individuals have proven more likely to be re-incarcerated and
serve more time than individuals without SMI who received similar convictions. Studies have shown that those
individuals with SMI and co-occurring SUD who receive comprehensive care are far less likely to return to jail (Loveland
and Boyle, 2007).
The pilot program was conducted on two afternoons each week in Division V of the DOC and was limited to persons with
active healthcare insurance who were court ordered/discharged to electronic monitoring (EM). A full report of the pilot
projects’ findings and outcomes is attached, but a brief synopsis and the most salient findings resulting from this pilot
project were as follows:
Enrollment:
•

Enrollment was limited to individuals who were released with EM/I Bond eligibility and had active
insurance.
Program Operation:
• Operating the program 2 days a week did not afford the opportunity to provide comprehensive care
coordination in the community.
• Persons who experienced the best outcomes were those that were moved from CCDOC for a brief
psychiatric hospitalization, were subsequently referred for residential treatment (mental health and
chemical dependency), and then were moved into the community.
Outcomes:
• Individuals immediately engaged in care with consistent and supportive follow through were able to
sustain gains and have not been re-hospitalized or re-incarcerated.
• Observable impediments were as follows:
- The great majority (77%) of persons with mental illness who would have qualified for care
coordination were uninsured; making it difficult to provide suitable services;
- Persons who were able to leave the jail on EM and arranged to participate in care coordination
seldom followed through;
- Persons who received intensive care coordination post discharge (brief hospitalization and
residential treatment) with ongoing care coordination showed a high rate of success as measured
by absence of recidivism (hospital or CCDOC).
**Based upon this limited data, the Be Well Team believes that by extending the length of time care coordinators
are available (5 days a week as contrasted with two days a week) and the intensity of service delivery, many
unnecessary cases of re-incarceration would be avoidable.
After a complete and thorough review of the enrollment requirements, pilot project outcomes, and program model, and
with input from DOC’s mental health staff, Be Well Partners in Health has incorporated data-based research and made
modifications to their program design. This program has proven successful, and expanding these efforts is critical to the
continued reduction in recidivism with this high-risk population with serious mental illness.
With this proposal, Be Well Partners in Health’s program seeks to modify and expand efforts to use the DOC as a care
coordination site. Through rigorous assessments, coordinated care planning, planning implementation, and continuous
monitoring/evaluation, this comprehensive care management (CCM) program offers the opportunity to connect

9/08/2014

 JAG FFY12
January 30, 2015

individuals with SMI to comprehensive treatment services in the community as they leave the DOC, thereby reducing
recidivism and the cost to taxpayers had they been incarcerated.
Every incarcerated individual costs the State of Illinois an average of $16,000 per year at an Illinois Department of
Corrections facility. The proposed project, which would provide care coordination services over one year, serves 780
individuals. If successfully involved in care coordination, this project could save taxpayers upwards of $12,232,860
(**calculation below). The cost to assist each person to a more successful and independent life through a CCM program
is $427 per person, not including fees charged by community service providers to insurance providers for potential
services rendered. The financial benefits increase as the years without periods of incarceration continue.
**[ $16,000 x 780 = $12, 480,000 vs. $427 x 780 = 333,060 ($88,548 offered as an in-kind contribution)]
Goals, Objectives and Performance Measures (Goals are broad statements of what will be achieved. Objectives are
specific, measurable outcomes of the project. Objectives have a timetable for completion. Provide any available data to
illustrate your program’s past/current performance.)
*All goals and performance measures include pilot program results for due consideration.
GOAL 1: Interview and assess individuals with mental illness that are being discharged from the Department of
Corrections, both from the alternative programs and the DOC’s general population.
Pilot Program Data:
 During the course of the 10 week pilot program, more than 100 individuals were interviewed: 32 met program
eligibility (noting the requirement for insurance coverage above) and 20 were enrolled in the program.
 On average, 32% of women coming into the DOC each day that were screened for SMI were determined to need
some form of comprehensive care management. However, on some days that percentage rose to 60% of females.
In addition, on average, women were more likely to be placed on EM than males and were more likely to be
receptive to receiving coordinated care management services outside the Jail. During the pilot, 11 of the 20
individuals enrolled were women, who ranged in age from 17 to 60 years old, none of whom have returned to the
Jail.
 On average, approximately 20% of men coming into the DOC each day that are screened for SMI were
determined to need some form of coordinated care management. This number rose to as high as 55% of males on
occasion. During the pilot, 9 of 20 individuals enrolled were men, who ranged in age from 17 to 62 years old,
none of whom have returned to the DOC.
Proposed Program’s Modifications
Individuals with SMI in the general population of the DOC were not included in the pilot; this would be a new
CCM program component. Through the pilot and other related projects, it is evident that the discharge process is
a significant opportunity to engage individuals in the continuum of care. It is estimated that, on average, 20% of
individuals discharged from the Cook County DOC each day are suffering from some degree of SMI.
GOAL 2: Implement comprehensive care management by completing a person centered assessment, plan of care, and
arrangement of needed services within a provider network with ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

9/08/2014

 JAG FFY12
January 30, 2015

Pilot Program Data:
 During the pilot, a number of participants were initially interested in participating in the program; however, after
a few days in the community they declined to continue. Although these individuals did receive immediate and
regular contact from their care manager, it was determined that daily contact in the first few weeks of
engagement is imperative. The pilot study was limited to 2 days a week; thus continuing and intensive follow-up
was not possible.
Proposed Program’s Modifications
For those participants at discharge from the DOC who were admitted to the hospital and then transferred to
treatment, all performance indicators were met. Under a 5 day model, BWPH anticipates that care management
can be successfully accomplished for persons receiving care in the community as well as those in residential
placement.
Activities & Tasks
Through this project, certain individuals with SMI’s released from the DOC, either from the general population or as part
of the EM program, will be discharged into the Be Well Comprehensive Care Management Program utilizing BWHP
network of providers. This comprehensive network includes medical, mental health, substance abuse, and social service
providers. The assigned care manager will coordinate and manage the individual’s care from the point of initial
enrollment. The program will take place 5 days a week over a 12 month period.
1) Enrollment: Electronic Monitoring/DOC Discharges
Two (2) staff members will be assigned to work with the women’s Electronic Monitoring (EM)
program/discharge planning and two (2) will be assigned to work with the men’s EM program/discharge
planning. Staff will be equipped with laptop computers, Internet access, and phones to use in the designated
evaluation areas. Individuals who have judicial orders to EM or are from the DOC’s discharge group that have
been diagnosed as having or potentially having a SMI will be afforded the opportunity to participate. In the pilot,
participants were limited based upon funding source. In the proposed CCM Program, a broader number of
individuals with a SMI will be evaluated and given the opportunity to participate. Eighty percent (80%) of the
participants engaged will have some form of active insurance while twenty percent (20%) may have insurance
pending or will need assistance obtaining appropriate coverage.
2) Comprehensive Care Management
The care manager (CM) will engage the enrolled individual in Comprehensive Care Management after all initial
assessments and evaluations are completed. An initial person-centered plan of care will be developed and
implemented with the individual. The CM will be in contact daily for the first few weeks, then weekly (or more
often based on the plan of care, for 6 months.) The CM will arrange for needed services to support the individual.
The CM will assist in linking the individual to a medical home (FQHC) and arranging an initial healthcare visit.
They will also assist the individual who is not insured or enrolled in CountyCare to enroll in a Medicaid plan. Be
Well network providers will serve these individuals while insurance is being activated. In addition, for those
needing safe and suitable housing, the CM will assist in locating this with the individual through network
resources. Each CM will complete all required documentation and will be responsible for ongoing care plan
development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, with adjustments made as needed to the plan of care.

9/08/2014

 JAG FFY12
January 30, 2015

The care management team will convert a minimum of (65) cases per month to active care management. Over the
course of one year the team will have engaged clients in care management for a total of 780 cases (4 Care
Managers). Based upon the budget section of this proposal, the care coordination fee per case will cost $427
(excluding direct care services) as opposed to the cost of re-incarceration.
Each CM will be spending some portion of the day in the community engaging with participants, and some
portion on site at the CCDOC conducting evaluations and/or developing care plans. Detailed accounting of each
staff member’s activities will be maintained and submitted on a monthly basis.
3) Staffing
All staff will be full time employees of Be Well Partners in Health; however, they may be subcontracted from
participating network organizations. The professionals selected will represent diverse skill sets including
medicine, community mental health, substance abuse, and housing. Preference will also be afforded to social
workers who are familiar with the communities where most participants reside. In the pilot project staff members
conducting screening evaluations, licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) were not the same individuals
providing care coordination activities. Based upon the pilot program findings, it was viewed as more desirable for
the individual conducting the preliminary assessment with the participant to be the same individual providing
community-based care management.
4) Evidence Based/Promising Practices
Over time, policy and funding decisions on the provision of behavioral health care have resulted in the
criminalization of SMI. Corrections facilities, both jails and prisons, have become defacto mental health
facilities. The Cook County Department of Corrections is no exception and is now generally viewed as the largest
mental health facility in Illinois and one of the largest in the United States. This program seeks to reverse that
trend by including the DOC in the developing care management system. While care management is a relatively
new policy concept, it has shown promise in reducing criminal justice system involvement and recidivism among
those with SMI.
The presence of an active SUD or have a history of involvement with the criminal justice system are moderately
valid predictors of future involvement in the criminal justice system for individuals with SMI (Hall et al., 2012.)
Recidivism rates can be substantial for those individuals (Cloyes et al., 2010; McCoy et al., 2004). Individuals
with an SMI who have become involved in the criminal justice system usually require intensive and assertive
outreach services for 6-12 months after they have been released from incarceration (NFCMH, 2004).
Limited research has found that individuals with SMI and co-occurring SUD who received comprehensive care
coordination or intensive case management services tended to have lower recidivism over time as compared to
individuals who did not receive addiction treatment. Results of the Arkansas Partnership Program (Cimino and
Jennings, 2002) and Project Link (Lamberti et al., 2001; Weisman, Lamberti, and Price, 2004) found a significant
inverse relationship between intensity of professional services received and involvement with the criminal justice
system for individuals with SMI.
There is growing consensus for coordinating mental health services with the courts or correctional agencies to
meet the needs of individuals with an SMI who have become involved in the criminal justice system, but these
innovations have only recently been introduced and require more development, testing and evaluation (Ventura et
al., 1998).

This program seeks to implement a comprehensive care management (CCM) model. Be Well Partners in Health
Care Plans are evidenced-based, client oriented and outcome driven. This is consistent among all Be Well
network providers. The Pilot program also used the IRONS evaluation tool.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize
what will be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?): In response to the significant number of homicides
occurring in Chicago during recent months, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH), on behalf of the City of
Chicago (including the Mayor’s Office, Chicago Public Schools (CPS), and Department of Family and Support (DFSS))
and in partnership with the US Department of Justice, Chicago Police Department (CPD), Thresholds, and Chicago
Citizens for Change (CCC), is implementing a 24-month Crisis Response and Recovery pilot project. CRR is designed to
help residents of six CPD districts with high homicide rates that are experiencing resultant trauma and cyclical violence.
The six districts include 4, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 25 (see attached District Map, p. A7).
CRR proposes to improve outcomes for survivor families through the following activities: 1) develop unified
protocol for and subsequently train crisis response and recovery providers, including police, emergency medical services
(EMS), hospitals, medical examiner (ME), schools, court officers, and mental health and social service providers; 2)
increase access to immediate crisis response services for survivors; 3) enhance ongoing coordinated, trauma-informed
community support and mental health services for survivors; and 4) assess protocol for citywide implementation and
sustainability.
Central to the success of this program is its ability to implement crisis response and recovery protocol and ensure
that it is effective. Once procedure and protocol are developed, the project partners must build system capacity through
effective delivery of training to ensure uniform implementation.
CDPH respectively requests $197,264 in funding from the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) to
support efforts to develop CRR protocol and to ensure police, EMS, court officers, and other agencies with a role in
homicide response receive critical training on the protocol. Funds will support CDPH participation in protocol
development as well as development, coordination, and implementation of a comprehensive training program on protocol
during the two-year project period. In addition, resources will sustain efforts to expand the CRR network of traumainformed responders through training.

Rev. 1/7/2014

 Death Penalty Abolition Fund SFY15
January 30, 2015

Once CRR protocol has been developed, CDPH’s Training Coordinator will work with the partnership to develop
the training program and materials to ensure all partners and other first responders and key service providers are fully
equipped to implement protocol uniformly. As a result of receiving CRR protocol training, participants will achieve the
following learning objectives: effective police communication with crisis response dispatch when a homicide occurs;
knowledge of procedures for deployment of crisis responders at the time of a homicide; standards for providing crisis
response services, including immediate response as well as ongoing support to families; effective communication with
survivor families; overview of trauma responses, Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and complicated grief and traumainformed crisis response; ability to make successful referrals for support services; and others.
In addition to development of the comprehensive CRR training program, the Coordinator will assist in creation of
training tools such as presentations, manuals, and other learning materials. In addition, under guidance from the Program
Director, the Coordinator will work with a videographer to develop a series of training videos that will augment the CRR
training program. Use of training videos will reduce the amount staff time required for training on an ongoing basis. In
addition, CPD officers have specified a preference for training videos as a learning tool in trainings previously conducted
by members of the CRR partnership.
The Training Coordinator will schedule and coordinate all CRR trainings in collaboration with CRR partners to
ensure at least 3,000 (1,000 in Year 1 and 2,000 in Year 2) unduplicated crisis responders, service providers, and
representatives from other agencies involved in homicide response and follow-up receive training on protocol during the
two-year project period. This will include comprehensive trainings for police and other first responders, as well as basic
introductory trainings as part of recruitment effort to the comprehensive training program. Under direction of the Program
Director, the Coordinator will work closely with CRR partners to support implementation of and assist in conducting all
CRR protocol trainings.
The Training Coordinator will also maintain correspondence with all agencies and individuals who have received
training and will coordinate refresher trainings as needed. Throughout the project, the Coordinator will work closely with
CRR partners and assist in refining and updating the training. This work will include ensuring trainings are tailored to
specific audiences, e.g., police, hospital staff, court officers, as new groups are recruited. Additionally, this will include
revising trainings in appropriate formats, including webinars, so that refresher trainings as well as basic informational
trainings introducing CRR to new audiences can be easily accessed through the Web.
The Training Coordinator will tailor training materials as needed and promote training for external agencies that
are involved in homicide response and follow-up, such as hospitals and trauma centers, Medical Examiner’s office staff,
State’s Attorney prosecutors, and social services providers. To recruit new agencies for CRR, the Coordinator will
conduct communications and marketing efforts using posters, distribution of informational brochures and palm cards at
public meetings and via online forums. A graphic designer will be enlisted to assist in the development of marketing
materials and help to ensure they are targeting appropriate audiences for the training program, such as police and first
responders and social services providers. The Coordinator will meet with at least three agencies external to CRR during
the two-year project period to receive basic informational training in order to expand the CRR network.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize what will
be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):

The Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (CCSAO) Victim Witness Assistance Program requests funds to
support a Homicide Response Liaison position. This position will coordinate services and facilitate confidential
communications between CCSAO and external agency agencies, law enforcement and community members.
This position is needed due to the addition of external victim service agencies that provide immediate practical
and emotional support to persons impacted by homicide. These external agenices respond at the request of law
enforcement and provide supportive services to famlies in the early aftermath of a death by homicide. Two
primary agenices have been identified to provide these services: Chicago Citizens for Change in the City of
Chicago and Association for Individual Development in suburban Cook County. The addition of external
advocacy and victim service agenices contracted to provide crisis support and potentially longer term advocacy
during the pendency of cases increases the number of stake holders working with famlies impacted by
homicide. In order to provide consistent and coordinated care and in an effort to avoid confusion and further
trauma to families once cases enter the crimial justice system, the CCSAO proposes the development and
implementation of an additional position within the Victim Witness Unit designated to interface with the
external agencies and to insure seamless service delivery to famlies. On cases where police suspend or continue
investigations, we anticipate an increase in advocacy on behalf of the family. This requires that meetings be
scheduled with internal CCSAO personnel and additional explanation of the CJS process be provided to
families and advocates.
The Homicide Response Liaison will meet with external agencies on a regular basis in order to insure clear and
consistent communication, to address existing problems, and to surface new collaborative issues and service
gaps. Working on the front end with external advocacy agencies and monitoring the work with families as
cases enter the criminal justice system, the Homicide Response Liaison will be best positioned to advise the
Victim Witness supervisors of potential and necessary changes to Victim Witness operations and to assist in
their implementaion. The Homicide Response Liaison will operate in the Chicago-Cook County metropolitan

Rev. 1/7/2014

 DEATH PENALTY ABOLITION FUND SFY15
January 30, 2015

area. This Liaison will serve to help victims of homicide in all of the communities in the Chicago Cook County
metropolitan area.
While there are points of overlap with the services provided to homicide survivors between the Victim
Witness Unit and external advocacy agencies, the Victim Witness Unit is in the unique and statuatorily-required
position to provide the most accurate and timely information to homicide survivors as cases journey through the
court system. In addition to working for the prosecutor’s office, Victim Witness personnel have long established
relationships of trust with all allied agencies involved in the journey of a case through the criminal justice
system. These include the Cook County Sheriff’s Department, Facilities Management, Cook County Clerk’s
Office, and Probation. The addition of the Homicide Response Liaison will help to keep institutional
boundaries and lines of communication clear with extenal advocacy agenices at a macro systems’ level, in an
effort to decrease the confusion and additional trauma experienced by families as a case proceeds through the
criminal justice system. In addition, the Homicide Response Liaison can continually update Victim Witness
staff on the evolving operating processes and procedures with the external advocacy agencies during their start
up phase. Having a Victim Witness staff person designated to work with the external advocacy agencies not
only builds excellent working collaborations but assists in generalizing these good working relationships
throughout the Victim Witness staff and office.
The Homicide Response Liaison will also carry a small caseload of homicide cases and will provide direct
services to victims in those cases. The Homicide Response Liaison will follow cases in which charges were not
immediately approved and/or which present with issues which require internal VW personnel familiar with the
external advocate and/or pre charging history of the case. The majority of the homicide cases will still be
handled by the Victim Specialists in the CCSAO Victim Witness Unit since the Homicide Liaison will mainly
be focused on acting as a liaison between the external agencies and the CCSAO. Specialists provide services to
victim sub-populations such as survivors of homicide, victims of gang related crime, domestic violence victims,
victims of hate crime, gay, lesbian and transgender victims, sexual abuse victims, child sexual abuse victims,
Spanish and Polish-speaking victims and victims of traffic-related crimes. Most carry caseloads of
approximately 300 cases. The CCSAO has approximately 500 homicide cases charged for 2014 in Cook
County. Most cases are in the criminal justice system for an average 3-4 years.
Table of goals, objectives, and performance measures

Goal 1: To establish working relationships with external advocacy agencies providing crisis response to

In 2003, the State’s Attorney’s Offices’ current victim witness program was evaluated to determine program
effectiveness in serving the victims of crime. Researchers determined that when victims are involved in the
legal process, direct contact with court personnel (such as a Victim Witness Specialist) was a key component to
the program’s success. This study showed that victims were more satisfied with their experience with the court
process because of the program’s involvement and focus on maintaining contact with the victim and educating
the victim on the criminal justice process as well as providing the supports and services they needed at the time.
The Homicide Response Liaison will follow these same strategies in using the same promising practices in an
effort to provide external agencies and families of homicide with the supports and services they need.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize what will
be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):

The Juvenile Methamphetamine Transitional Aftercare Program provides aftercare services to juveniles who complete the
Franklin County Methamphetamine Treatment Program. The goal of the Juvenile Methamphetamine Transitional
Aftercare Program is to reduce the recidivism of methamphetamine use by the youth who complete the Methamphetamine
Treatment Program. The Transitional Aftercare Program will provide services to 16 juveniles during the funding period
of October 2014 – September 2015. The services will include placement in a transitional living facility and/or halfway
house, as deemed appropriate. The Transitional Aftercare Program will enhance the re-entry and case management
services with focus on developing a support network in the youth’s local community. The Educational/Vocational
Training Component will provide opportunities for the development of skills that are necessary to sustain an independent,
positive lifestyle while maintaining sobriety. Additional support activities will include necessary supportive supplies and
transportation.
The Franklin County Methamphetamine Treatment Program is funded by the Illinois General Assembly as a response to
the growth of methamphetamine addiction, abuse, and use by juveniles. At the time of its inception, the Franklin County
Methamphetamine Treatment Program was the county’s only facility to treat juveniles addicted to methamphetamine. Dr.
Alex Stalcup, M.D. assists the Wells Center in developing and providing Substance Abuse Treatment specific to
methamphetamine. The Treatment Program consists of up to 180 days in secure detention followed by six months of
intensive supervision once released back into the community. Youth who are eligible for admission into the program
must be adjudicated on a detainable offense or as an “addicted minor”. The Methamphetamine Treatment Program is
located in the Franklin County Juvenile Detention Center and serves 41 counties in Southern Illinois.

 RSAT FFY11
January 30, 2015

However, funding for the existing Aftercare portion of the Methamphetamine Treatment Program is not sufficient to meet
all the needs of each individual youth. This is especially critical for those youth who cannot or should not return to the
same household in which they resided prior to entering the Treatment Program. Sober housing is essential, in particular
for individuals returning to the community from the criminal justice system. Sober housing that allows the youth to live
with parents or other sober relatives is ideal. No one should expect the youth to get and stay sober if methamphetamine is
persistent in their environment. Treatment professionals agree that regardless of service models or level of client
involvement, the success rate of long term sobriety is directly proportional to a supportive, positive living environment.
If, upon discharge from the Treatment Program, a youth’s only option is to return to a detrimental home environment,
then there is a higher likelihood the youth will use again. An alternative living arrangement is needed to afford the youth
with the greatest opportunity to successfully put into practice the Relapse Prevention techniques learned while at the
Treatment Program.
The funding provided through the Illinois General Assembly does not provide resources for aftercare services. No
General Revenue funds are allocated for Transitional Residential Aftercare placement. Current funding levels provide for
approximately 80% of the Treatment Program’s budgetary needs. Current funding resources are insufficient to meet the
entire cost of the counseling staff.
Treatment data from a number of sources was reviewed. This included state data from the Department of Human
Services, Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse (DASA) along with federal data from the Department of Health and
Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). While most residential
substance abuse treatment programs in Illinois include Relapse Prevention Therapy, only 10% of the facilities operate a
halfway house or transitional living setting for substance abuse clients.
Statistical data regarding long term follow up of clients completing residential substance abuse programs is very limited.
Nearly every youth entering the Treatment Program grew up in a family with a history of alcohol abuse and/or illicit drug
use. Most have a family background described as dysfunctional. Most have at least one parent involved in illegal drug
use. Many also reside in families with histories of physical and/or emotional abuse. Based on local assessment,
approximately half of the clients currently in the Treatment Program are identified as in need of alternative living
placements upon discharge.

Total number of clients served by program- 13
Average # of participants each month –3.4
Number of new admissions-11
Number of successful program completions-3
Number of unsuccessful program discharges-8

*Discharges are a result of client’s failure to follow guidelines in the aftercare program, early termination from probation
or clients being sent to Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice.
In 2014, the FCJDC Meth Program observed a decrease in success rates for clients completing the aftercare phase of
treatment. While some factors may be attributed to this decrease, it is difficult to say with any precision why this occurred.
With a smaller population of youth served yearly we are certainly more likely to see larger variations of success rates
from one year to the next. In 2014, there were no significant changes in treatment programming (in-custody or aftercare).

2

 RSAT FFY11
January 30, 2015

There were no changes in personnel or management and no significant changes within the facility where these clients
received treatment. All clients in 2014 received the same treatment as clients in the previous years.
Some speculations as to why we saw a decrease in success rates could include factors such as trending behavior among
peers within a group, lack of alternative placement resources for clients returning to environments nonconductive to
sobriety, lack of compliance from clients and families. A few of our clients received unsuccessful completions of aftercare
simply because they refused to maintain contact with counselors once they returned home. Another client was
unsuccessful because his parole violated him for smoking marijuana and sent him to DJJ, even though we attempted to
intervene and treat the client’s use episode. In light of the recent decline in success rates, the FCJDC Meth Program has
developed and begun to implement some new strategies to ensure every effort is being made to achieve success. One
example is a CIM refresher for clients who have had multiple use episodes or a major relapse. This is a 10-20 day intense
treatment curriculum, held in the non-secure side of the detention facility that reviews and highlights all important aspects
of Craving Identification and Management (CIM). The goal would be to get a client who has relapsed back on track, using
the same approach they are already familiar with, and without starting them all over in another residential or inpatient
treatment program. Another example includes initiating an incentive component to the aftercare phase of treatment to
encourage and reward effort and achievement toward sobriety.
Additional ideas are being explored to continue the quality improvement of the FCJDC Meth Program.
Goals for the Program (Goals are a broad statement of what will be achieved.)
Goal 1: To reduce the recidivism of methamphetamine use by the youth who complete the Methamphetamine
Treatment Program.
Goal 2: To provide aftercare services, including a supportive living environment which is conducive to long term
sobriety, to the youth discharged from the Methamphetamine Treatment Program.
Goal 3: To identify and link the youth who are discharged from the Methamphetamine Treatment Program to local
continuous services, providing youth with support beyond the aftercare programming.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Evidence Based / Promising Practices (Describe briefly any EBP/PP incorporated within your program strategy)
The Franklin County Methamphetamine Treatment Program’s general treatment model focuses on teaching drug using
youth to identify drug cravings, to recognize situations that trigger drug cravings, and then to resist those cravings
through socially appropriate actions. The treatment approach is an adaptation of the Craving Identification and
Management (CIM) addiction treatment model created by Dr. S. Alex Stalcup, Medical Director of the New Leaf
Treatment Center in Lafayette, California. CIM is an evidence-based treatment model that combines several treatment
components, including control of exposure to environmental cues, establishment of a daily schedule, the use of
behaviors that dissipate craving (tools), and treatment (with medication when appropriate) of mental health and
withdrawal symptoms. A component to the CIM model is Aftercare planning and services. The activities and services
provided through the Transitional Aftercare Program is part of the overall CIM evidence-based treatment model.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATIONS
On October 22 and 23, 2013, the Authority convened the Victim Service Ad Hoc
Committee (VSAHC) to review past priorities and define new ones for the use of STOP
VAWA funds. The VSAHC recommended that FFY14 - FFY16 VAWA funds be used
principally to continue to support programs previously funded through VAWA. The
following are continuation designations for previously funded VAWA programs which
staff deem successful. The designations recommended in this memo and future
designations will be consistent with the priorities set forth in the VAWA FFY13 – FFY16
Multi-Year Plan.
Services to Victims of Domestic Violence
Life Span: The Targeted Abuser Call (TAC) Program - The Target Abuser Call (TAC)
Program is a multi-disciplinary approach that addresses high-risk domestic violence
cases. The TAC Program increases victim safety while holding more offenders
accountable. This innovative project creates a comprehensive, cooperative prosecutionbased team to strategically address the problems women face in the criminal justice
system. Under this the program, two Life Span Court advocates dedicated to the TAC
program will be preserved for the purpose of providing court advocacy to victims of
domestic violence. This program has been receiving a VAWA grant for the past several
years and this year their application was denied. They are requesting a bridge grant for
the victim service segment of the program only and only for one year. The designation
will use $81,474 in FFY11 prosecution ($55,030) and discretionary ($26,444) funds.

Domestic Violence / Sexual Assault Services
Illinois Coalition Against Domestic Violence (ICADV) and Illinois Coalition Against
Sexual Assault (ICASA): In the past, the Authority has designated all of each federal
fiscal year’s allocated Service Provider funds to ICASA and the ICADV in equal
amounts. These funds were then subcontracted to their program agencies for service to
underserved areas or victim groups. Staff recommends that the Authority continue
designating the service provider funds in this manner and that designations of FFY14
Service Provider funds in the amount of $669,681 are made to both ICASA and ICADV.

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly summarize what will
be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):

The Target Abuser Call (TAC) Program is a multi-disciplinary approach that addresses high-risk domestic
violence cases in the City of Chicago’s Centralized Domestic Violence Court and in the 6th District of the
Circuit Court of Cook County, located in Markham, Illinois. The TAC Program increases victim safety while
holding more offenders accountable in misdemeanor, preliminary felony, and Class 4 felony domestic battery
cases. This innovative project creates a comprehensive, cooperative prosecution-based team to strategically
address the problems women face in the criminal justice system.
Under this the program, two Life Span Court advocates dedicated to the TAC program will be preserved for the
purpose of providing court advocacy to victims of domestic violence. The TAC court advocate will continue to
work with project team members to provide services to victims of domestic violence pursuing criminal charges.
These services include Illinois Domestic Violence Act advocacy, safety planning, providing specific referrals
for collateral services, and providing information and support to victims of domestic violence at the centralized
domestic violence misdemeanor courthouse at 555 W. Harrison, and at other Cook County suburban
courthouses.
The TAC program has been previously funded through a discretionary grant through the Office of Violence
Against Women (OVW) but did not receive funding this year. The program partners will apply again next year
for funding. This is a one-time bridge grant to maintain the program during this lapse period.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Goals for the Program (Goals are a broad statement of what will be achieved.)
Goal 1: : More victims of domestic violence will successfully participate in the criminal prosecution of the abuser.

Goal 2: Intense supervision and monitoring of court orders will be used to increase abuser accountability

Program Summary (State the intent of the program, the target population and intended consequences. Briefly
summarize what will be done. Who will do it? How it will be done? Where? When?):

The Illinois Coalition Against Sexual Assault (ICASA) is requesting STOP VAWA funds to support the continuation of
14 satellite offices of sexual assault programs and two developing sexual assault crisis centers. In order to broaden the
availability of sexual assault crisis services throughout the state, ICASA has used VAWA funds to support these satellite
programs since FY96. The support to new centers has occurred more recently to establish rape crisis centers where none
previously existed. The satellite offices and new centers are located in previously unserved geographical areas or
underserved neighborhoods.
Services provided by satellite programs include a minimum of a 24-hour hotline and 24-hour access to individual medical
and criminal justice advocacy. The primary focus of these offices is to provide crisis counseling and advocacy services.
Additionally, some of the satellite offices provide on-going counseling, educational programs and professional training.
The grantees that are primary offices of rape crisis centers each provide the full range of rape crisis services. This includes
hotline, medical and criminal justice advocacy, counseling, professional training, prevention education, institutional
advocacy and information and referral. The prevention services are not supported with these
funds. ____________________________________________________________________________________________
______
Goals for the Program (Goals are a broad statement of what will be achieved.)
Goal 1: Developing, enlarging, or strengthening victim services programs, including sexual assault, domestic

violence, and dating violence programs, developing or improving delivery of victim services to underserved
populations, providing specialized domestic violence court advocates in courts where a significant number of
protection orders are granted, and increasing reporting and reducing attrition rates for cases involving violent
crimes against women, including crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence.

RECOMMENDED DESIGNATION
Services to Chicago Victims of Violent Crime
Between Friends: The Rogers Park Community Council Services to Chicago Victims of Violent
Crime program was ended December 31, 2014. This program provided direct services to
Chicago domestic violence victims and their non-offending family members. Services provided
included criminal justice support, information and referral services, legal advocacy, and other
services. Between Friends has agreed to continue providing these services in the Roger’s Park
service area, and hire those staff members from Roger’s Park Community Council affected by
the closing of the program. The program will need a designation of $32,298 for the expanded
staff and service area to continue for another eight months. Staff recommends using $32,298 in
lapsing FFY12 VOCA funds, which will expire September 30, 2015, for this program.

SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE FUNDS

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Program Summary (State the problem and supporting data; identify target population and intended consequences)
Domestic violence victims face numerous challenges in: 1) overcoming the emotional and psychological effects of abuse
on themselves and their children, 2) taking legal action against their abuser, and 3) transitioning to a new life
independent from their abuser. As the numbers reported above show, tens of thousands of domestic crimes are
reported to the police in Cook County each year. In addition to the immediate trauma caused by abuse, domestic
violence contributes to a number of chronic health problems, including depression, alcohol and substance abuse,
sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and often limits the ability of domestic violence victims to manage other
chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension.
Between Friends' Court Advoacy Program assists approximately 500 victims of domestic violence in obtaining civil
Orders of Protection each year. The core services provided through this program help victims of domestic violence to: 1)
increase their safety, 2) be aware of and have full access to the legal remedies available through the criminal justice
system, 3) understand their rights under the Illinois Domestic Violence Act, and 4) obtain information about other social
services in the community. In its provision of direct services, Between Friends responds to the specific needs of domestic
violence victims in Cook County's Districts One and Three, and works to assist them in overcoming systemic, institutional
and individual barriers.
Currently, Between Friends' VOCA-funded programs include the Court Advocacy and Counseling and Support Services
Programs. This requests will increase our VOCA-funded programming to include an additional Court Advocate. We strive
to ensure that anyone who needs help receives it, including members of underserved populations. Thus, both of these
programs are offered free of charge to anyone, regardless of race, age, income, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
The Court Advocacy Program offers court assistance to victims of domestic violence who seek criminal and civil Orders
of Protection at the downtown Chicago Courthouse and at the Rolling Meadows Courthouse; services are offered in
English and Spanish at both locations. This bilingual capability allows us to help a large number of underserved people,
including immigrants, Spanish speakers, and those with limited English proficiency.
Court Advocacy services include the provision of information packets to victims regarding their rights under the Illinois
Domestic Violence Act, assistance with filling out complex legal forms, court accompaniment, follow-up services, referral
services, informing victims of the VOCA victims' compensation program, and advocacy on behalf of victims with other

service providers. The Court Advocates also provide information and training about Between Friends' services to police
departments, judges, and court personnel.

Section IV.
The Court Advocacy Program benefits victims of domestic violence by increasing access to legal information and
remedies. This program provides the information, resources, and support that domestic violence victims need to take
legal action against their abusers and hold them accountable for their crimes. Through court advocacy services, victims
are able to obtain assistance with civil or criminal court Orders of Protection, personal advocacy with police, childcare,
crisis counseling, referrals, transportation, and assistance with victim compensation. Accessing these types of services is
a critical first step for victims in reclaiming their independence and establishing self-sufficiency.
