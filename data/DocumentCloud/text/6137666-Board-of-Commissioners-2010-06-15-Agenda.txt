ITEM #11
APPROVED AS AMENDED
COMMISSIONERS BUTLER AND PERAICA VOTED "NO".
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 7, 2010 from
JAYE M. WILLIAMS, Chief Financial Officer, Bureau of Finance
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for one (1) year, Contract No. 05-41-479 with
Government Payment Services, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana, to continue a program utilizing credit cards as
payment of cash bail for detainees at the Department of Corrections, Clerk of the Circuit Court ePlea and
traffic fines, Highway Department, Sheriff's Office for administrative tow and merit board application
fee, and Department of Revenue Individual Use Tax payments and FY 2010 vehicle licenses.
Reason:

The contract between Cook County and Government Payment Services, Inc. was initially
approved by the Board of Commissioners on June 21, 2005. The contract period was for a
two (2) year term, with an option to renew for an additional three (3) years. At the conclusion
of the initial two (2) year contract term the Board of Commissioners approved a renewal of
the contract and extended it for an additional three (3) years, ending on June 22, 2010.
The Bureau of Finance will be leading the effort on greater collaboration on the purchases of
services that multiple departments across the County utilize. We are working on developing a
Countywide Committee to develop a comprehensive plan for credit card payment acceptance.
This extension allows sufficient time to work with the Cook County State's Attorney’s Office
on the County’s credit card service options and technology system integration and interfaces
related to implementation of a “Countywide Credit Card Service” initiative. The expiration
date of the current contract is June 22, 2010 with an extension of one (1) year option if the
project is not completed.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: June 23, 2010 through June 22, 2011, with the
option of a one year additional extension if needed.

007-260, Professional and Managerial Services to Account 007-240, Printing and Publishing to process
vehicle license application production associated with the Cook County Wheel Tax Ordinance.
Reason:

Due to time limitation and the labor intensive nature of the Vehicle License project, we are
compelled to look to outside sources to implement and expedite the process of renewal
application production. By improving our vehicle license application process for FY2010,
we will save over $10,000.00 on our postage and produce an improved application design.
Some of the benefits in the FY2010 Vehicle License project are purchases that can be made
via online, real-time system update, and improved processing fulfillment.

ITEM #14 cont’d
1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 4, 2010, it became apparent that an infusion of funds, into the receiving account, would be
needed to meet current obligations. The balance in the account on May 4, 2010 was
$23,952.00 and 30 days prior it was approximately $47,382.00. Other budgeted expenditures were
paid out of this account.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
The account was identified based on the department's reduction of anticipated usage. There were
no other accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 520830.
There will be no other direct impact to other areas.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The Professional Services account was budgeted for temporary services for assistance of clerical
support. Though, the department reduced the need by reviewing internal staffing functions, reassignments and improved business processes.
The receiving account is the most appropriate budgetary account for this type of vehicle license
expenditure which relates to the production process of printing vehicle license applications.
Additionally, our initial funding request for Printing and Publishing was reduced, thus resulting in
an unexpected shortfall in this account. Most importantly, the Wheel Tax Ordinance generates
approximately $2 million in revenue per year and we are working towards improving on our
compliance efforts as well to improve our revenue stream.

2010 Budget by the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The Club's Skills Mastery and

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
ITEM #25
APPROVED
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 13, 2010 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $16,000.00 from Account
260-353, Books, Periodicals, Publications, Archives and Data Services to Account 260-444, Maintenance
and Repair of Automotive Equipment for maintenance of Cook County owned vehicles.
Reason:

The transfer is needed because we require maintenance for our aging fleet. This account was
originally budgeted for $15,000.00. In error, $3,500.00 of FY2009 expense was encumbered
against FY2010 which in effect, reduced the budget to $11,500.00. Most of this was then
used for maintenance on four automobiles. There are eight other older autos that have been
taken in for estimates. The estimates came in at a total of approximately $10,000.00. In
addition, we are asking our drivers to be more diligent about oil changes and expect this
expense to run approximately $3,000.00 for all of our autos. Therefore, I am requesting a
transfer of $16,000.00 to cover the cost of repairs to eight of our vehicles, oil changes and a
small amount for any other issues that may arise. We did not anticipate requiring this much
maintenance when we originally budgeted for this item.

To Account:

1. On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds in
order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what was
the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May12, 2010, it became apparent that the Maintenance and Repair of Automotive Equipment
Account 260-444 would require an infusion of funds in order to meet outstanding obligations. At this
time, the balance in the account was $1,107.40. The balance 30 days prior was $1,107.40.
2. How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts that
were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 260-353 was identified as the source of transferred funds because early in FY2010, this
office received approximately $16,000.00 in credits from one of our vendors. The credits were for
adjustments to our account stemming from 2008 activity. The $16,000.00 is over what we placed in
the budget for this item and we do not anticipate needing these additional dollars. No other accounts
were considered.
3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in the
account that funds are transferred from.
None.
4. If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

When this office completed the budget for FY2010 we anticipated requiring the same budget dollars as
FY2009. This office received approximately $16,000.00 in refund checks in early FY2010 for this
account which we do not anticipate a need for. Also, at the end of FY2009, there was a positive variance
in this account and we do not anticipate requiring more budget dollars than we actually spent in 2009.

Reason:

Additional funds are needed to purchase the previously approved trucks. The original
estimated cost of $85,000.00 was for gasoline engine trucks, however, upon further review of
the dimensions and specifications we realized that the trucks are much smaller and do not
provide access to a standard dock. As a result, we are reverting to purchasing the type of
trucks we are replacing due to high mileage and high maintenance that meet our needs.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
On May 13, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the account was $85,000.00 and 30
days prior to that it was $85,000.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will be needed for the moving
of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne Warehouse, which is no longer
anticipated to take place in FY 2010, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-521 Account.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will
be needed for the moving of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne
Warehouse. The move to the Hawthorne Warehouse is currently behind schedule due to funding
issues encountered by the Bureau of Capital Planning and Facilities Management. Hence, the
availability of funds for transfer in FY 2010. However, we will be requesting funds in FY 2011 to
complete the move to the Hawthorne Warehouse.
