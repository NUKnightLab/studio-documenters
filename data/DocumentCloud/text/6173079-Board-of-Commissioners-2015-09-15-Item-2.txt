GENERAL BACKGROUND/EXPLANATION
The CHA advertised the RFP on April 9, 2015, to solicit vendors to provide, design, and implement an
optimal background screening program to perform criminal, tenancy and credit background checks. The
RFP was advertised in the Chicago Sun Times, Extra, and the Chicago Defender. Additionally, 71 Agencies
and 211 Section 3 Business Concerns received notification of the solicitation. The CHA also directly
solicited 35 firms, posted the solicitation announcement on the CHA website and in the CHA Supplier
Portal. A Pre-Proposal Conference was held on April 16, 2015 with representatives from five firms in
attendance. On May 13, 2015, the CHA received six proposals; all six were deemed responsive. An
Evaluation Committee consisting of five CHA staff members evaluated the six responsive proposals;
responses to Section 3 and M/W/DBE requirements were evaluated by DPC Compliance staff, and
Respondent pricing was evaluated by DPC Procurement staff.
After the Evaluation Committee completed its review of the six proposals, the total points awarded each
Respondent resulted in four firms falling within the competitive range and moving forward with oral
presentations, which were held on June 26 and 29, 2015. Based upon the evaluations of the written
proposals, oral presentations, and the overall proposed fee, including the Best and Final Offer, Screening
Reports, Inc. received the highest combined number of points during the evaluation process for the
criteria scored and is recommended to provide the best overall service and value to CHA.
Based upon the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Officer,
or his designee, to enter into a firm fixed rate contract with Screening Reports, Inc. to perform criminal,
tenancy, and credit background checks for a base term of three years in an amount not-to-exceed
2

 $2,460,030 and one two-year option period in an amount not-to-exceed $1,640,020, for a total amount
not-to-exceed $4,100,050.
CONCLUSION
The Board action recommended in this item complies in all material respects with all applicable Chicago
Housing Authority Board policies and all applicable federal (HUD) procurement laws.
The Deputy Chief Housing Officer for HCV concurs with the recommendation to execute a firm fixed rate
contract with Screening Reports, Inc. to perform criminal, tenancy, and credit background checks for a
base term of three years in an amount not-to-exceed $2,460,030 and one two-year option period in an
amount not-to-exceed $1,640,020, for a total amount not-to-exceed $4,100,050.
The Chief Executive Officer recommends the approval to execute a firm fixed rate contract with
Screening Reports, Inc. to perform criminal, tenancy, and credit background checks for a base term of
three years in an amount not-to-exceed $2,460,030 and one two-year option period in an amount notto-exceed $1,640,020, for a total amount not-to-exceed $4,100,050.
