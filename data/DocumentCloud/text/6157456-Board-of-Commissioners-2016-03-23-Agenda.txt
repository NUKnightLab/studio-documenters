PROPOSED ORDINANCE
AN ORDINANCE
CONVERTERS

PROHIBITING

THE

SALE

OF

SECONDHAND

CATALYTIC

WHEREAS, since 1975, all motor vehicles produced in the United States are required to have a catalytic
converter as part of the exhaust system. The catalytic converter is an emissions control device containing
precious metals, such as platinum, palladium or rhodium, that act as catalysts. A catalytic converter is
vehicle emissions control device that converts toxic pollutants in the exhaust gas of motor vehicles into
less harmful fumes; and
WHEREAS, with the price of precious metal skyrocketing, such as platinum, which is $936.10 an
ounce, palladium, which is $536.30 an ounce, and rhodium which is $760 an ounce, thieves have
acquired an interest in stealing catalytic converters, which they then pawn or sell to junk peddlers,
secondhand dealers, motor vehicle repair shops, and recycling facilities for a fraction of the converter's
cost. Stolen catalytic converters typically reap the thief a profit of $100.00 to $150.00, while, depending
on the make and model of the vehicle, it costs the vehicle owner between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00 to
replace; and
WHEREAS, vehicles that sit higher from the ground, such as trucks, pick-up trucks and SUVs, are
particularly vulnerable to catalytic converter theft because thieves can access the converter simply by
sliding underneath the vehicle without having to jack it up. With just a few cuts of a battery-powered
saw, a catalytic converter can be removed from a vehicle in less than a minute; and
WHEREAS, catalytic converter theft typically happens to vehicles that are parked for prolonged periods
in large parking lots, such as shopping centers, mass transit commuter lots or company parking lots.
However, vehicles parked on City streets are not immune from such theft, as police blotters are riddled
with reports of stolen catalytic converters; and
WHEREAS, because catalytic converters are not marked with the vehicle's VIN number, they are not
readily traceable to the vehicle's owner, making them easy fodder for theft and illegal resale; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Commissioners seeks to deter catalytic converter theft by making it more
difficult for thieves to sell stolen catalytic converters in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, by implementing a ban on the sale of secondhand catalytic converters, Cook County would
effectively become a dry County in the resale market of catalytic converters.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Chapter
58 Offenses and Miscellaneous Provisions, Article II Offenses Involving Property Rights, Section 58-48
Special Handling of Catalytic Converters, is hereby enacted as follows:

BOARD AGENDA

The vendor has met the Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Ordinance.
The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.
Summary: A contract with Capita Technologies, Inc. is requested to develop and implement a new
comprehensive case management information system for the Adult Probation Department and the Social
Service Department to track probation and pretrial operations as well as related cashier and contract
monitoring. The case management system is necessary to replace the departments’ outdated case
management system, PROMIS (Prosecutor’s Management Information System), which resides on the
Cook County mainframe. PROMIS was designed in the 1970s and is antiquated, limited in its
functionality, and cumbersome to use. Also, it is no longer supported by the company that designed it.
The two departments currently supervise about 40,000 probationers and pretrial defendants. The Adult
Probation Department also completes approximately 33,000 pretrial bond assessments per year and over
3,000 presentence investigations. The new system will help to improve supervision of probationers and
pretrial defendants, upgrade the quality of information provided to the court, and enhance public safety.
Specifically, the new system will achieve the following: increase efficiency in case management tasks;
reduce redundancy in data entry; improve quality assurance, program evaluation, and workload
management; improve financial auditing and contract monitoring processes; enhance security and data
tracking; and increase the departments’ ability to integrate with other systems within and outside of Cook
County government.
Capital funding in the amount of $2,000,000.00 was requested and approved for this project in FY2013
and $1,325,000.00 in FY2015. Most of these funds will used to pay for system development and
implementation and the first year of support and maintenance. The remainder will likely be used for
system enhancements in future years. Support and maintenance for the second and third years, which
total $694,695.64 of the total contract amount, will be paid through budgeted operating funds.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposal (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Capita Technologies, Inc. was selected based on established evaluation
criteria.

Summary: On 2/5/2013, the Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a ten-month contract with
Heartland Human Care Services, Inc. to manage the Cook County Juvenile Detention Reduction Project
(DRP), to serve court-involved, moderate and high-risk youth who may be in jeopardy of imminent
referral to the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center due to non-compliance with court orders.
The DRP augments the court’s nationally recognized Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative by
expanding the continuum of community-based services that judges and probation officers may use to
divert keep at-risk minors from detention. Both the Initiative and the DRP allow minors to remain in their
communities and engaged in pro-social interventions. The project currently provides services to youth
living in targeted Chicago communities. The contract provides a wide range of interventions and
mentoring, including educational, therapeutic and recreational programming, which responds to the
needs of the juveniles who are referred to participate in this project. Heartland partners with 14
faith-based and other community organizations to facilitate direct access to services and care. Since the
beginning of the project, more than 2,500 referrals have been processed for DRP services.
This contract was renewed with the approval of the Cook County Board in 2014 and 2015. A Request for
Proposal (RFP) is now in development to provide DRP services countywide.
This is a Sole Source Contract pursuant to Section 34-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.
