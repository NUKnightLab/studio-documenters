requesting authorization in accordance with Section 30 of the 2003 Cook County Budget Resolution to
apply for a grant from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in the initial
amount of $650,000.00 under the joint application process for the Community Health Centers and Public
Housing Primary Care programs. The application will be made on behalf of four health centers in the
Ambulatory and Community Health Network of Cook County - Cottage Grove Health Center (Ford
Heights), Englewood Health Center, Robbins Health Center and Woody Winston Health Center
(Phoenix) and will provide funding for primary and preventive health care services in medicallyunderserved areas. The grant will fund 11.5 full time equivalent personnel.
In order to comply with HRSA regulations, the grant application will be made in conjunction with a CoApplicant Board, a majority of whose members are patients of the four health centers. The
responsibilities of the Co-Application Board will be set forth in an agreement between the Bureau and the
Co-Applicant Board.

The Bureau is contemplating including additional health centers in future applications under these
programs, which could lead to additional grants in future years in the amount of $650,000.00 annually.
Qualification of the Ford Heights, Phoenix and Robbins health centers under these programs will make
pharmaceuticals purchased for those centers eligible for discounted pricing under the Section 340B drugpricing program. The Bureau estimates this could save $1.5 million annually.

Appeals; William Motto - Assistant State' s Attorney; Andrew Przybylo - Secretary to

Board of Appeals

Your Zoning and Building Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Tuesday, March 11, 2003 at the hour of 11 :00 AM. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois for the purpose of conducting a meeting to consider
the following:

932

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Pursuant to the Cook County Zoning Ordinance, Article 13.3.5, the Cook County Board of
Commissioners shall consider the decision of the Zoning Administrator per Appeal Docket Nos.
001-02-2020, 001-03-2002 and 001-04-2002 in unincorporated Barrington Township. The Zoning
Administrator's decision aggrieved the applicant seeking permit applications to build single-family
homes on parcels deemed "environmentally sensitive" by the Cook County Comprehensive Land
Use and Policies Plan.
On January 15, 2003 the Zoning Board of Appeals overturned the ruling of the Administrator,
citing a Supreme Court case limiting the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Chairman Silvestri stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the
Administrator's appeal under the new Cook County Comprehensive Zoning
Silvestri asked Kellie Peterson, Zoning Administrator, to explain her
"environmentally sensitive" provi sion of the Ordinance, as it relates to the
Township area.

decision of the Zoning
Ordinance. Chairman
determination of the
property in Barrington

Kellie Peterson stated that pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan that the County Board adopted in 1999,
the land that the applicants are seeking is in an "environmentally sensitive" area, which requires that the
applications go through a Planned Unit Development process, followed by a final decision of the Cook
County Board. The applicants were aggrieved by her decision and an appeal was made to the Zoning
Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals disagreed with Ms. Peterson and overturned her
decision. Ms. Peterson commented that the Zoning Board of Appeals essentially said that the applicants
could file under individual single-family permit applications.
Chairman Silvestri iterated that today' s meeting is based on the Comprehensive Land Use Plan adopted
by the County Board in 1999 and the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance that was approved in 2001.
Commissioner Quigley stated that he supports the decision of the Zoning Administrator Peterson and that
he was a sponsor of the adopted Comprehensive Land Use Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
Commissioner Hansen requested the definition of "environmentally sensitive".
Chainnan Silvestri asked Ms. Peterson to explain "environmentally sensitive" properties.
Ms. Peterson stated the Comprehensive Land Use Plan defines "environmentally sensitive" areas as flood
plain properties, wetland properties and mature vegetation. She said she used the definition in reviewing
the applications for the Barrington Township area.
Chairman Silvestri asked Alex Seith, Chainnan of the Zoning Board of Appeals, for a definition of an
"environmentally sensitive" area.
Chairman Seith commented that an "environmentally sensitive" area is a parcel that exhibits one or more
of the following characteristics: a portion of a parcel lies within the jurisdiction of wetlands, under the
jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or lies within the regulated flood plains designated on
the maps adopted by the Board.
Commissioner Murphy asked the committee to consider the concerns of Commissioner Goslin and the
Supervisor of Barrington Township regarding the flooding issues in and around these properties.

933

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Chairman Silvestri said the Zoning Ordinance clearly states that any land that is designated
"environmentally sensitive" must go through the Planned Unit Development process. The issue before us
today is whether or not the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals was correct in overturning the
decision of the Zoning Administrator who believed the project would have to come in as a Planned Unit
Development because the area is "environmentally sensitive".
Commissioner Hansen requested a legal opinion regarding the letter from the Department of the Army
dated January 23, 2003 to Eugene R. Dawson, Barrington Township Supervisor, stating that the property
is under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.
William Motto, Assistant State's Attorney, suggested that a motion should be made to incorporate the
letter from the Department of the Army into the record.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to accept the letter from the
Department of the Army. The motion carried. (The referenced document is on file in the County
Clerk's Office).
In response to Chairman Silvestri's invitation, William Hennessey, attorney for the applicants,
commented on various concerns he has with the adopted Land Use policies that are in opposition to his
clients' application.
Commissioner Peraica inquired about the 60-day window for an appeal. He stated that the Department of
the Army issued a letter on January 23, 2003 regarding the applications. He said theoretically, someone
could still file an appeal and if the appeal is successful, the commissioner asked what affect would it have
on today's proceedings.
Assistant State's Attorney Motto responded that this decision was changed as a result of an appeal. Then
certainly this matter should come back to the Board for reconsideration in light of any changed
circumstances including this decision.
Commissioner Hansen observed that the committee- is faced with differing opinions from two County
entities. He noted that the filing of an appeal has nothing to do with findings under the appeal, and at the
proper time the Board should sustain the position of the Zoning Administrator. Commissioner Hansen
continued to state his concerns with the motion to defer the matter.
Commissioner Daley asked Mr. Motto if he had concerns about remanding the matter back to the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
Mr. Motto responded that he doesn't have a concern about deferring the matter, but a concern to remand it
back so the new Army Corps letter is officially a part of the records of the Zoning Board of Appeals. He
said that the Zoning Board of Appeals might want to reconsider their decision considering the new
evidence provided in the Army Corps letter. He said the new information could very well change their
decision regarding the applications and if that is the case then there would not be an appeal before the
County Board. He further stated any new evidence should be presented to the Zoning Board of Appeals,
which is allowed to consider new evidence under the rules.
Chainnan Silvestri asked if Mr. Motto was trying to preserve a record and Mr. Motto responded in the
affirmative.
Chairman Silvestri further stated that the County Board has four options: defer, remand, concur or
reversal.

934

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003

Commissioner Peraica, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to stay the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals and remand the matter to that body for reconsideration and to report back to the
Zoning and Building Committee by April 18, 2003. The motion carried.
Commissioner Quigley voted no on this matter.
Chairman Silvestri asked the Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals, Andrew Przybylo to schedule a
meeting of the Zoning Board of Appeals fo r the review of the new evidence. Chairman Silvestri also
stated the motion is to stay the ruling of the Zoning Board of Appeals and to remand the matter to the
body for reconsideration based on new evidence, and report back to the committee on April 18, 2003.

matter for several months.

Michael LaMont responded yes, and in total it's about eleven percent below the equipment budget.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if this request is for additional equipment, not originally intended to be
purchased or was it part of the original project?
Michael LaMont stated that the plan was always to purchase the necessary equipment over and above the
equipment brought over from the old hospital.
Michael LaMont stated that $148 million was originally budgeted for equipment for the new hospital, so
far only $133 million has been spent for equipment.

No. 258043. The motion carried.

contract?
Michael LaMont responded that this amount is for increased services that were not initially planned for in
1999. He stated that there are several reasons for these services: it took longer to have the equipment
installed in the hospital partly because of the lawsuit by GE, which set everything back several months;
and there were some equipment that had to be rebid for various reasons.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003

Your Department of Corrections Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, March 12, 2003 at the hour of 10:00 A.M . in the Board Room, Room
569, of the County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois for the purpose of discussing the
issue of the alleged beating of 49 inmates by the Special Operations Response Team ("SORT") at Cook
County Jail.
In her remarks regarding the alleged abuse of inmates at Cook County Jail, Chairman Steele stated that
there have a been a series of articles in the newspaper pertaining to the alleged abuse, which calls for
members of the County Board to take a serious look to determine the true facts. Chairman Steele
indicated that commissioners are interested in gathering infonnation about the total operation of the Cook
County Jail for the sake of both the inmates and the employees who work at the Jail.

The chairman commented that on February 13, 2003 she personally went to the Jail and talked to guards
regarding the allegations recently publicized in the newspapers. Some of the guards report that the
allegations are not true while others say they are true. The chairman stated that the reason for the joint
meeting is to clear the air and gather facts so commissioners can make an informed decision relative to
what steps the County Board should take in regards to these allegations.
Mr. Coldren, President of the John Howard Association stated that he feels that the issue before the
committee is one of accountability. Mr. Coldren said he lays the blame on society in terms of how we
pennit these things to continue to happen for many years. He recommended an independent external
investigation of the allegations, and recommended an independent "Inmate Advocate Office" that would
be located within the County Jail.
Charles Fasano, Director of the Prison and Jails Program at the John Howard Association, stated that jails
are temporary detention centers. He remarked that the buildings have serious maintenance problems that
need to be addressed. He continued to say that there should be a re-examination of the SORT Team. He
stated that he has looked at various facilities and long-term solutions such as: reducing the population
level ; reducing the level of crowding; making the length of stay shorter; providing proper staffing and
oversight; and adequate programming. These are going to be the only remedies to solve the problems at
the jail.
Harriet McCullough, Executive Director of Citizens Alert stated that the County needs to find out if the
allegations of the 49 inmates are in fact true, and recommended an external investigation.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that the County needs to seek the truth as to what happened that
eveni ng at the County Jail. He asked the John Howard Association, based upon the facts of the case, if
they were in a position to offer an opinion as to whether police action was necessary to maintain order or
if there was an overstepping of the police in trampling the rights of the detainees?
Charles Fasano stated that unfortunately the John Howard Association has not obtained sufficient
information to give an informed conclusion as to which of the two scenarios is the more likely. He stated
that they have received conflicting information from both the Sheriffs police and the inmates, and neither
side has sufficient information to conclude that one is likely to be true over the other. Further, he stated
that as a watchdog organization, the John Howard Association is not an investigatory body. He said that
the association does not have the power to go in and investigate concerns on a constant basis.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Mr. Fasano to explain the function of the Inmate Advocate Office that
would be established in the jail and if this would be a quicker and more accurate way of highlighting
these types of problems.

983

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Mr. Fasano responded that by having a full-time staff at the Jail at forty hours per week, the staff would
be in a position to receive and respond to the information more timely without having to contact an
outside organization.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the advocates would be employees of the County?
Mr. Fasano responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what recommendations he had to get the detainees to trial more quickly?
Mr. Fasano remarked that currently a study is being conducted that was initiated by Judge Paul Beibel and
includes taking a second look at case processing in the criminal courts. The first study was done in 1990
and this would be an updated version of that study. He stated that he assumes that one of the outcomes
would be specific recommendations on how to process cases more quickly while maintaining all of the
detainees' civi I and constitutional rights. Further, he stated that many of the recommendations from the
initial study have been implemented.
Commissioner Silvestri requested a copy of the Adjudication Technical Assistance Project Report from
1990.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the committee can talk about how to implement system changes, but it
would be a mistake to solve this case, lay the blame and fire the culprit. The commissioner said he
believes the County needs a system that is in place and deals with the culture of the Department of
Corrections and how the Board of Commissioners is responsible, from an oversight point of view.
Commissioner Quigley asked representatives of the John Howard Association to explain their
understanding of what other entities do to work with inmates. He also asked what percentage of inmates
are treated outside the jail from various treatment programs so that jail overcrowding can be reduced by
twenty-five per cent or more.
James R. "Chip" Coldren, Jr., responded that more community-based treatment options would reduce
overcrowding at the jail. He said this is not an immediate solution but is midterm to a long-term solution,
which requires a fair amount of development work in addition to public and judicial education.
Charles Fasano informed the committee that some models in different jurisdictions deal specifically with
individual special populations. He said that some of what is occurring at the County Jail is a home-grown
problem.
Commissioner Quigley commented that it seems that there are spikes in the jail population in regards to
the actual structure of the jail. He stated that last year Sheriff Sheahan discussed using outdoor tents as
one way to solve overcrowding, but being realistic, with Chicago's winter weather tents might not work.
The commissioner asked if there are other alternatives to traditional heavy brick walls with guard towers
where less risky inmates can be detained?
Charles Fasano responded that the jail recently converted the old central kitchen facilities into a dormitory
that initially housed three hundred and is now double-bunked where it holds six hundred inmates. He
said the old Cermak Hospital was turned into a one hundred twenty bed inmate drug unit, and
unfortunately there is not enough staff to support these programs. In conclusion he said that the John
Howard Association recommends the expansion of programs like the ones operated by the Department of
Community Supervision and Intervention, electronic monitoring and day reporting.

984

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Commissioner Hansen asked the John Howard Association to comment on "parole holds".
Charles Fasano responded that for the past year, there have been a number of status hearings on the Duran
case where there has been participation from the Illinois Department of Corrections. They have been able
to address some of the overcrowding concerns by accelerating the handling of parole hearings, and one
thing that continues to complicate the matter is that inmates in this category are not there solely because
of parole holds, but also because they have managed to acquire a new charge that puts them in the
dilemma where they cannot be released. Further, he stated that the number has been reduced from 1,500
down to approximately 600.
Commissioner Hansen recommended that the County attempt to derive better statistical evidence using
records from both the Department of Corrections and those available in the Office of the Circuit Court
Clerk to determine where the growth indicators are by type.
Chairman Maldonado asked how the SORT Team receives orders?
Charles Fasano responded that the SORT Team is a separate unit in the County Jail headed by its own
Superintendent who officially reports to the Executive Director at the jail. Members of the SORT Team
ultimately report to that Superintendent and to individual supervisors, but they are different because they
have specialized training and limited functions. They are answerable not to the Superintendent running
the divisions of the jail, but to the SORT commanders.
Chairman Maldonado asked who initiates an investigation of any incident that might occur at the County
Jail to the Internal Affairs Division?
Charles Fasano responded that there is no one method on how an investigation is initiated. An
investigation can be requested by an inmate or anyone in the chain-of-command who alleges some kind of
improper action or problem by an inmate, staff or it can be initiated by a concern with the facility itself.
Chairman Maldonado asked is there a formal procedure that inmates follow when requesting an
investigation?
Charles Fasano responded that he is not familiar with the any procedures that inmates would follow.
Commissioner Maldonado asked when an investigation is concluded by Internal Affairs, to whom is the
report filed?
Charles Fasano stated that it would depend on what the findings are. If the findings are that inmates may
have committed criminal acts while in jail, then the report would be forwarded to the State's Attorney 's
Office for consideration of possible prosecution. If it was a matter of potential discipline against a
Department of Corrections employee, the report would be forwarded to the Director's office to determine
whether the recommendation would be something within the Director's authority or if it would need to go
to the Merit Board.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the report is first forwarded to the Inspector General 's Office under
the Sheriff and then with recommendations to the Executive Director of the Department of Corrections or
with recommendations to the Cook County State's Attorney's Office?

985

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Charles Fasano stated that he is not sure whether the Inspector General's Office is part of the process
before recommendations from the Director.
Commissioner Suffredin asked Harriet McCullough what she sees as the best mechanism for the County
Board to follow to give the commissioners input in the FY2004 budget?
Harriet McCullough remarked that it is important to receive relevant facts from all sides and observers in
addition to seeing what can be done about bridging the facts to determine what is correct rather than just
looking at cost factors.
Commissioner Suffredin asked if the John Howard Association has any contracts with the Cook County?
Charles Fasano said that the Association does not currently have a contract with the County Jail , but in
the past they have had a contract with the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center where they provided
technical assistance regarding another class action lawsuit.
Commissioner Peraica stated that even a single instance of abuse on a fellow citizen, even those that are
inmates or detainees in our jails must be prevented. The commissioner concluded his remarks by saying
that those who are guilty of abusing prisoners must be punished and dealt with.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Law Enforcement and Corrections Committee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, March 12, 2003 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room
569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois for the purpose of discussing the issue of
the alleged beating of 49 inmates by the Special Operations Response Team ("SORT") at Cook County
Jail.
Chairman Maldonado gave an opening statement regarding the alleged abuse of inmates at Cook County
Jail. He stated that he and the commissioners have gathered in the conviction that an open forum where
all sides of the story could be heard is the most fair, the most informative, and the most productive way to
examine the alleged charges and discuss possible reforms. He further stated that at today's meeting the
committee would be focusing on the February 27, 2003, Chicago Tribune article concerning a suspected
cover-up of alleged mass jail beatings that occurred in 1999. Chairman Maldonado stated that Sheriff
Sheahan had been invited to attend the meeting, but instead will address the Finance Committee meeting
this afternoon. The chairman remarked that at today's meeting, the first in a series of public forums, the
committee will hear from two representatives of the John Howard Association, James Coldren, President
and Charles Fasano, Director of Prison and Jails Program. The second speaker will be Harriet
McCullough, Executive Director of Citizens Alert.
In conclusion the chairman stated that he is looking forward to hearing testimony from each of the
distinguished speakers and working with them to bring the best possible reforms to the Cook County Jail
system.
Mr. Coldren, President of the John Howard Association stated that he feels that the issue before the

of parole holds, but also because they have managed to acquire a new charge that puts them in the
dilemma where they cannot be released. Further, he stated that the number has been reduced from 1,500
down to approximately 600.
Commissioner Hansen recommended that the County attempt to derive better statistical evidence using
records from both the Department of Corrections and those available in the Office of the Circuit Court
Clerk to determine where the growth indicators are by type.
Chairman Maldonado asked how the SORT Team receives orders?
Charles Fasano responded that the SORT Team is a separate unit in the County Jail headed by its own
Superintendent who officially reports to the Executive Director at the jail. Members of the SORT Team
ultimately report to that Superintendent and to individual supervisors, but they are different because they
have specialized training and limited functions. They are answerable not to the Superintendent running
the divisions of the jail, but to the SORT commanders.
Chairman Maldonado asked who initiates an investigation of any incident that might occur at the County
Jail to the Internal Affairs Division?

989

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Charles Fasano responded that there is no one method on how an investigation is initiated. An
investigation can be requested by an inmate or anyone in the chain-of-command who alleges some kind of
improper action or problem by an inmate, staff or it can be initiated by a concern with the facility itself.
Chairman Maldonado asked is there a formal procedure that inmates follow when requesting an
investigation?
Charles Fasano responded that he is not familiar with the any procedures that inmates would follow.
Commissioner Maldonado asked when an investigation is concluded by Internal Affairs, to whom is the
report filed?
Charles Fasano stated that it would depend on what the findings are. If the findings are that inmates may
have committed criminal acts while in jail, then the report would be forwarded to the State' s Attorney' s
Office for consideration of possible prosecution. If it was a matter of potential discipline against a
Department of Corrections employee, the report would be forwarded to the Director' s office to determine
whether the recommendation would be something within the Director's authority or if it would need to go
to the Merit Board.
Commissioner Maldonado asked if the report is first forwarded to the Inspector General 's Office under
the Sheriff and then with recommendations to the Executive Director of the Department of Corrections or
with recommendations to the Cook County State' s Attorney's Office?
Charles Fasano stated that he is not sure whether the Inspector General's Office is part of the process
before recommendations from the Director.
Commissioner Suffredin asked Harriet McCullough what she sees as the best mechanism for the County
Board to follow to give the commissioners input in the FY 2004 budget?
Harriet McCullough remarked that it is important to receive relevant facts from all sides and observers in
addition to seeing what can be done about bridging the facts to determine what is correct rather than just
looking at cost factors .
Commissioner Suffredin asked if the John Howard Association has any contracts with the Cook County?
Charles Fasano said that the Association does not currently have a contract with the County Jail, but in
the past they have had a contract with the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center where they provided
technical assistance regarding another class action lawsuit.
Commissioner Peraica stated that even a single instance of abuse on a fellow citizen, even those that are
inmates or detainees in our jails must be prevented. The commissioner concluded his remarks by saying
that those who are guilty of abusing prisoners must be punished and dealt with.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
257218

BOARD OF REVIEW, by Thaddeus Makarewicz, Secretary of the Board, transmitting a
Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 01-41-549 with
RONAN POTTS, L.L.C., Chicago, Illinois, to monitor and keep the Board of Review
apprised on a regular basis of all legislation, bills, amendments and regulatory activity now
pending or proposed, or which may be proposed in the State of Illinois.
Reason:

Ronan Potts, L.L.C. will be able to maintain a close liaison and frequent
communication with authorized representatives designated under Lobbying
Services Agreement, Section 5, for authorized representation during legislative
periods or on priority items.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $38,500.00. Contract period: January l, 2003 through November
30, 2003. (050-260 Account). Requisition No. 30500001.

*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 1123/03.
*Deferred at the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee meeting of
02/06/03.
Thomas Jaconetty, Chief Deputy Commissioner, Board of Review stated that he is the person who
personally and primarily monitors the services rendered by Ronan Potts, L.L.C. and the process of
legislation in Springfield. He said that Ronan Potts, L.L.C. has represented the Board of Review since
1999 and since that time there has been very significant legislation involving the property tax appeal
process and the entire system that began as early as 1995. Ronan Potts, L.L.C. was brought on because of
their widespread experience in this field. They provide weekly and monthly reports and from the time a
bill is initiated in Springfield, one of the principles of the firm contacts Mr. Jaconetty to learn of the
Board 's position on the bill. This is then coordinated with the Illinois State Bar Association's State and
Local Taxation Section Counsel, the Chicago Bar Association Committee for Real Taxation and
Assessments and Appeals along with his connections with the Civic Federation and the Taxpayer
Federation as the Board of Review tries to monitor all the legislation in Springfield.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding the amount of contact he has with Ronan
Potts, L.L.C. when the State Legislature is not in session, Thomas Jaconetty responded that he personally
meets with the principles of the firm at least twice per year when the legislature is in session. He said the
firm has a good internal tracking system where they have time periods when they want to get together to
talk about the Board of Review's current agenda, what happened last year that might come back and this
typically happens during the summer months when the legislature is not in session.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the Board of Review has a list of priority items?
Mr. Jaconetty mentioned that the firm would work on all items that affect the assessment, collection and
appeals process. He said the Board of Review is an integral component of this process. With the advent
of the Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) since 1995, there are about 10 bills in Springfield that directly
affect the Board of Review because the Board is the named party that must defend the assessments before
the Property Tax Appeals Board. He said the Board of Review is the party that has brought these matters
before the Circuit and Appellate Courts so legislation in this area will be the primary focus. Secondly,
any legislation that deals with the defense of appeals or the process of appeals before the Board of Review
is also an issue.

992

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003

Commissioner Claypool reiterated statements he made at a previous meeting regarding the issue of
contracting for lobbyists. The commissioner stated that he believes there are two diametrically opposed
and philosophical dimensions at work. He said he thinks the Board, as keepers of the purse, has to
ultimately decide if it is only going to pay for its own lobbyists and that any other agency or constitutional
officers have to send staff to lobby on their own behalf, if they so choose, but not at taxpayers' expense.
The commissioner said alternatively, the Board has to accept the fact that these are individually elected
office-holders who are entitled to their own representation in Springfield and if there are budgeted funds
for this purpose then contracts are fine. Commissioner Claypool concluded by saying that he supports
Commissioner Peraica's earlier points, and one way or the other, the Board has to decide which way it
wants to go, which is something that should be decided in next year's budget.
Commissioner Sims said that the elected officials have a right to their constitutional powers and the
Board approves their budgets. She suggested that the County Board could put a cap on the amount paid
for lobbyist services.
Commissioner Hansen said that he believes that the biggest problem with the lobbyists is the lack of
knowledge by the County as to what some of the lobbyists are doing for other offices. Some have
coordinated very well, and some have not. It may be that an office needs special expertise with regard to
the voluminous statutes and amendments. Whether the County needs additional lobbyists in the number
that we have now is open to question. The commissioner said that maybe the County needs two or three
lobbyists because of certain areas of expertise. These lobbyists could be assigned to the County while
adequately representing the individual constitutional officers. He further suggested that this is an area
that should be looked at because while we may save a million dollars by blowing something due to
inattention in Springfield, we may loose $10 million.
Commissioner Daley suggested that it might be a good idea to have someone working the floor of the
House and the Senate to voice the county's position, which may be a way to answer some of the
commissioners ' concerns.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved approval of Communication No.
257218. The motion carried.
Commissioner Peraica voted present on the above item.
257753

OFFICE OF THE ASSESSOR by Terry A. Steczo, Deputy Assessor for Administration and
Taxpayer Services, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the
BOWMARK CONSULTING GROUP, Springfield, Illinois, for informing, monitoring and
formulating strategies and changes on legislative and executive issues.
Reason:

The Bowmark Consulting Group will monitor and review mttlatives in the
Illinois Legislature that relate to the Assessor's Office and report the potential
impact to the office as well as other legislation being introduced. The Bowmark
Consulting Group will recommend strategies and interact with legislators in areas
where proposed legislation would impact on the operations and also advise and
assist in intergovernmental activities/projects.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $42,000.00. Contract period: February 18, 2003 through February
17, 2004. (040-260 Account). Requisition No. 30400030.

*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 2/20/03.

993

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003

Chairman Suffredin called upon Teny Steczo, Deputy Assessor for Administration and Taxpayer
Services to explain the requested contract.
Mr. Steczo explained that this is the fourth year Bowmark Consulting Group will represent the Assessor's
Office in Springfield. The firm does a remarkable job of trying to identify the different bills that impact
the office and the Cook County tax base. They have an excellent reputation of interacting with the
members of the General Assembly. They also know the procedures for both the legislature and the
comm1ss1ons.
Commissioner Collins asked if the Assessor's Office has other similar contracts?
Mr. Steczo informed the committee that the Assessor's Office does not have other similar contracts.
Commissioner Peraica asked the name of the principle contact at Bowmark Consulting Group, and the
number of items the Assessor's Office has on its legislative agenda this session.
Mr. Steczo stated that Mark Strawn is the principle contact. In regard to the number of items on the
Assessor's legislative agenda it is difficult to say because when it comes to the Assessor's Office or
revenue in general, we have to be vigilant which is where the lobbyists come into play.
Chairman Suffredin commented that currently there are about eleven bills dealing with the Property Tax
Appeals Board (PTAB) and Mr. Strawn has been working diligently with them. The chairman said these
bills go all across the place from abolishing PTAB to expanding the size of it, giving Cook County more
appointments, and allowing it for residential property owners only. The chaim1an said he hopes to have a
future meeting to discuss PTAB and increased senior assessment freezes that deal with homeowners'
exemptions and other similar matters, which are in the group of bills previously distributed.
Commissioner Peraica asked the difference between the legislative agenda for the Assessor's Office and
items of interest to the Board of Review.
Mr. Steczo responded that there might be some nuances that appear for example, exemptions, which the
Assessor's Office deals with, or certain assessment procedures that affect the Assessor's office directly
but in terms of creating the assessment, there would be a difference. Mr. Steczo concluded by saying that
as it comes to appeals, there would be some commonality.
Chairman Suffredin said that since the last meeting and the passage of the new contract language, he has
personally talked with all of the lobbyists who have agreed that while they have principle responsibilities
for issues that directly relate to the office that hired them, they are all working on other county bill issues
as they are directed by the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
Commissioner Daley suggested that when the County Board is in opposition to a bill, commissioners
should contact state representatives and senators very early to kill an issue because once it leaves
committee it is very hard to defeat.
Commissioner Silvestri asked what type of analysis does the Assessor's Office do on the effectiveness of
a contract like this? How do we know that Bowmark has assisted the County in fighting off negative
legislation or promoting a positive agenda for the Assessor's Office and ultimately for the Board?

994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003

In response to Commi ssioner Silvestri 's question, Mr. Steczo said that the Office is in daily contact with
Mr. Strawn and we provide information relating to different issues that impact the Assessor's Office as
well as provide directions relative to certain positions, and we communicate with the County lobbyists
and the leadership in Springfield.
Commissioner Silvestri requested that representatives from the various county offices that have lobbyists,
periodically report to the County Board on what the lobbyists have done on behalf of the County so that if
for no other reason, commissioners can be reassured that these contractual dollars have been well spent.
Commissioner Collins commented that she would like to see that the County has its own office space in
Springfield with a coordinator so that everyone would know that the County speaks with one voice.
Commissioner Murphy stated that she supports Commissioner Collins comments regarding the need for
the County to have its own office space.
Chairman Suffredin also informed the committee that currently County representatives share space with
the City of Chicago and this is one of the issues that will be discussed in the future as the Board evaluates
the legislative process.
Commissioner Daley commented that all county lobbyists should keep the Board informed so
commissioners can contact the various state representatives and senators.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved approval of Communication No.
257753. The motion carried.
257754

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF JUDGE by Timothy C. Evans, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook
County, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to renew Contract No. 02-41-333 with
SHEA, PAIGE & ROGAL, INC., LaGrange, Illinois, to provide legislative consulting
services.
Reason:

The services under this contract consist of monitoring and researching legislative
initiatives and providing advice on matters affecting the Circuit Court of Cook
County.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $75,000.00. Contract period: March 1, 2003 through February 29,
2004. (310-260 Account). Requisition No. 33100019.

*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 2/20/03.
Chairman Suffredin asked Melanie Wheeler, representing the Office of the Chief Judge to inform the
committee as to how the firm of Shea, Paige & Rogal, Inc. interacts with the Office of the Chief Judge.
Melanie Wheeler commented that the firm has represented the Office of the Chief Judge since 1997 on
legislative matters and works directly with the Chief Judge. They represent the Chief Judge regarding
initiatives and keep the Chief Judge informed on matters or concerns before the state legislature.
Commissioner Daley inquired as to whether the recently approved language regarding lobbying efforts
will be included in the contract.

995

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Chairman Suffredin responded that the resolution instructed the Purchasing Agent to include that
language in all contracts.
Commissioner Silvestri asked about the effectiveness of the firm in dealing with the state legislature.
Ms. Wheeler responded that any initiatives that the Chief Judge has instructed the firm to investigate or
monitor are reported directly to the Chief Judge who is happy with the services he has received thus far
which is the reason he is asking to renew the contract.
Commissioner Silvestri reiterated his previous statements from the last meeting regarding the need for the
Board to consolidate lobbying efforts into a more centralized function by next year. Additionally, there
should be a standard, uniform contract for lobbying services.
Chairman Suffredin stated that one of the issues previously discussed is the attempt to coordinate lobbyist
activities. The chairman remarked that the County Board needs a strategic plan. He is now working daily
with all of the lobbyists in an attempt to monitor various enactments. The Chairman concluded by saying
that the County has a lot of capable staff and there must be a way for the County to be more efficient.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the Chief Judge's Office has other similar contracts to which Ms. Wheeler
responded in the negative.

Vice Chairman Silvestr i, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved approval of Communication No.
257754. The motion carried.
258041

RECORDER OF DEEDS, Eugene "Gene" Moore, transmitting a Communication:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with FLETCHER,
TOPOL, O ' BRIEN & KASPER, P.C., Chicago, Illinois, for consulting services and lobbyist
strategies.
Reason:

Fletcher, Topal, O' Brien & Kasper, P.C. will provide the Recorder of Deeds'
office with legislative consulting services and lobbyist strategies, including a
weekly written report to the Recorder of Deeds as to the existence and status of
all legislation.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $55,000.00. Contract period: January 1, 2003 through October 1,
2003. (527-260 Account). Requisition No. 35270015.

*Referred to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee on 2/20/03
03/06/03.

Commissioner Silvestri asked if the office has prepared an analysis of the effectiveness of the firm of
Fletcher, Topal, O ' Brien & Kasper, P.C. in either initiating things on behalf of the Recorder's Office or
fighting back attacks on the Office?
Casey Griffin, Deputy Chief Recorder responded that the Office works daily with the firm when the state
legislature is in session. He stated that currently the Recorder's Office has 18 bills that affect the office,
one of which is HB2206 which gives an increase in fees of $10.00 so that every recorded document
would be assessed this fee . Mr. Griffin explained that $1.00 of the fee would go into the County' s fund
and $9.00 would go to subsidize rent from the state. This bill would greatly impact the Recorder' s Office
and raise fees over 37%.

996

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 18, 2003
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the Recorder's Office has taken a position on HB2206?
Mr. Griffin stated that the Office supports subsidized housing but feels there are better vehicles for the
state to raise the money. The Office is opposed to the bill and with the help of Michael Kasper and
Fletcher, Topol, O'Brien & Kasper, P.C., the bill is currently stalled in the Intergovernmental Relations
Committee.
Commissioner Daley asked if the County has taken a position on the bill?
Chairman Suffredin commented that the County has not taken a position on the bill. The chairman further
stated that this is the final week for committee action in Springfield and what he would like to do at the
next meeting of the committee is to put a small number of bills that are still live on the agenda so the
committee could take an official position. There is also HB 300, which is related to HB2206 and deals
with collecting fees for the electronic sale of data and that bill has left committee and is on the floor of the
House. He believes there may be two other bills that directly relate to the operation of the Recorder's
Office that the Board should take an official position on. HB 2206 creates a state program comparable to
the Section 8 federal housing rent subsidy program, which is a difficult issue to oppose, which is why no
one from the County has put in opposition to the bill.
Commissioner Daley suggested that when the County Board is in opposition to a bill, commissioners
should very early contact representatives and senators to stop a bill while it is still in committee.
Commissioner Daley continued by stating once an issue gets out of committee it has wings and may
continue to have wings.
Chairman Suffredin commented that he had distributed a User File of 299 County bills, 227 in the House
and 72 in the Senate, which have been identified by the President's staff and county agencies have
identified as having some direct impact on the operation of county government. Tim Casey who heads
the county's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs is in Springfield where he meets weekly with all county
lobbyists to give them various assignments. One of the problems the county has had this session is that
there have been nearly 7,000 bills that have been introduced since January 13 and a number of them have
been stopped. It is his understanding that HB 2206 is going to be shelled and allowed to go as an empty
vehicle as the sponsor continues to negotiate. He said the county would then have a chance to go back to
committee on this bill. On issues that look controversial, Tim Casey has been working with the President
and the Speaker's Office to try to shell the bills. The chairman concluded by saying that it is his intention
to have substantive discussion on key pieces of similar legislation at the next meeting.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the lobbyist firm filed an objection slip with the legislature?
Mr. Griffin responded that the firm did file an objection with Jake Keller, who represents the Illinois State
Recorders.
Commissioner Gorman commented that the Board needs to streamline lobbyist efforts and asked if funds
for this contract were allocated in the FY 2003 budget?
Mr. Griffin responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica asked if the office explored contracting with the firm on a per project basis rather
than on an annual basis?
Casey Griffin said that it is very difficult to determine when, how much or how often legislation will be
introduced in Springfield.

have some of those reappropriated dollars sent to the County once the Transportation Act is reauthorized.
