Fund Counsel, Mary Pat Burns, addressed the Board with respect to the draft
Ethics Policy. She informed the Trustees that she and the Executive Director
collaborated on the revised Ethics Policy and that it was being presented for
comment and/or adoption. She explained that Board adopted the Cook County
Ethics Policy as its own in 2005, but that the Cook County Ethics Policy did not
apply directly to the Funds or the Trustees. She further explained that as such it
would be difficult for the Trustees to apply it. She went on to explain that the
Fund Investment Policy references the Ethics Policy and that it may be confusing
because of the references to the County instead of the Fund.

finalize the document and re-present it at the next regular Board meeting.

and present it at a later Board meeting.
