BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF COOK COUNTY
PRESIDENT
VETO
Transmitting a Communication, dated May, 10, 2010 from
TODD H. STROGER, President, Cook County Board of Commissioners
Please be advised, that in accordance with the authority granted to me by Section 2-6008 of the Counties
Code and for the reasons stated herein, I hereby veto substitute New Item #6 passed by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010 wherein the County Board mandated a salary and hiring freeze
through November 30, 2010 for all County Offices.
In accordance with Section 2-6008, I hereby transmit my veto of substitute New Item #6 approved on
May 4, 2010 and request that this veto message be placed on the County Board Meeting Agenda for the
next meeting of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, May 18, 2010.
The substitute New Item #6 passed on May 4, 2010 by the Cook County Board of Commissioners
requires the following: (1) hiring freeze on vacant positions, i.e., any position (not otherwise excluded)
that is or becomes vacant during the effective period of the Ordinance shall remain vacant; (2) prohibits
salary increases for current County employees (excluding positions under the jurisdiction of a judicial
mandate and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System) without County Board approval; (3) requires
Board approval for any hiring, transfer, reclassification of positions, and salary adjustments that would
increase the expenditure amounts of budget lines for costs related to current staff; and (4) in the event of
an emergency request to hire, transfer, reclassify or institute a salary adjustment, Board approval is
required.
This May 4, 2010 Ordinance passed by the County Board violates the statutory and Constitutional
authority of the President of the Cook County Board and the Office of the Chief Executive; furthermore,
this Ordinance passed by the Cook County Board is an unconstitutional attempt to alter the form of
county government.

2

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

The Illinois Constitution states that the Chief Executive Officer shall have those duties and powers
provided by law and those provided by county ordinance. Illinois Const. 1970, Article VII, Sect. 4(a).
Under Illinois Statute, the County Board President, i.e., the Chief Executive Officer, has the power to
appoint all officers and employees of the county of Cook, except those whose election or appointment is
otherwise provided for law. 55 ILCS 5/3-14001.
The power to hire and fire employees affected by the May 4, 2010 Ordinance vests with the President and
the passage of an Ordinance instituting a hiring freeze and requiring Board approval prior to hiring or
appointing an individual to a vacant position, transferring a current employee to a different position or
reclassifying an employee is unconstitutional. The actions by the Board of Commissioners on May 4,
2010 alters the current “form of government” that provides the President with the authority to hire and
fire and institutes a change without referendum approval in violation of the Illinois Constitution. Illinois
Const. 1970, Article VII, Section 6(f).
This is not the first attempt by the County Board of Commissioners to limit the statutory and
Constitutional authority of the President; however, like previous cases, this alteration is being attempted
in an invalid manner and is in violation of the law. Under a previous administration, the County Board
of Commissioners passed a resolution that allowed the Commissioners to hire certain staff and approve or
disapprove the expenditures made in connection with the compensation of the employees affected by the
employee resolution. See, Dunne v. The County of Cook et al., 164 Ill.App.3d 929 (First District, 1987).
In Dunne, the Appellate Court affirmed the Circuit Court’s finding that the power to hire and fire the
employees in question was vested in the executive officer of Cook County by statute and the resolution
approved by the Board was a change in the form of county government, without referendum approval, in
violation of the Illinois Constitution. Dunne v. The County of Cook et al., 164 Ill.App.3d 929 (First
District, 1987). Like Dunne, on May 4, 2010, the County Board of Commissioners violated the statutory
and Constitutional authority of the chief executive officer when it prevented, prohibited and limited the
hiring authority of the President on multiple levels.
The May 4, 2010 action by the County Board in passing substitute New Item #6 changes the form of
County government without a referendum and in violation of the law. This action by the County Board is
in violation of both statutory and Constitutional authority. For this reason, I urge you to reconsider your
support of substitute New Item #6.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

WHEREAS, Cook County government is one of the largest employers in the State of
Illinois, with an estimated headcount of nearly 24,000 full time equivalent (FTE)
employees on the payroll in Fiscal Year 2010; and
WHEREAS, personal service costs comprise over $2 billion of Cook County’s annual
operating budget; and
WHEREAS, over 75% of Cook County’s workforce is covered by various collective
bargaining agreements, which provide for contractually obligated levels of compensation
and often include annual increases to adjust for the cost of living, thus adding to the
budgetary impact of each position; and
WHEREAS, FTE positions have declined by 9% since 2004, yet personnel-related
expenses continue to rise due to scheduled salary adjustments and rising health care
costs; and
WHEREAS, while facing increasing payroll costs in challenging economic times, it
becomes necessary for the government of Cook County to limit the number of newly
hired staff in an effort to contain costs.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County that any expenditure under personal service account budget lines beyond what is
needed for costs related to current staff in their current positions at their current salary is
hereby disallowed without Board approval, effective immediately through November 30,
2010, for all branches, departments, agencies, and elected offices of Cook County
government, excluding only those positions under the jurisdiction of a judicial mandate,
and the Cook County Health & Hospitals System; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that such restriction shall apply to all expenditures
related to any requested hiring, transfers, reclassification of positions, and salary
adjustments that would increase the expenditure amounts of budget lines for costs related
to current staff in their current positions at their current salary; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that in the event of an emergency request to hire,
transfer, reclassify or otherwise adjust a salary, the Elected Official, Bureau Chief or
Department Head shall present on the agenda at the next regularly scheduled Board
meeting, the rationale and justification for the emergency request for action, including but
not limited to job title and compensation, for approval by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that all positions not so excluded that are or shall
become vacant during the effective period of this Ordinance, shall remain vacant until
such time as the freeze is rescinded.
Effective date: This Ordinance shall be in effect upon adoption.

A RESOLUTION TO CREATE AN AD HOC COMMITTEE TO ANALYZE THE
COST OF SHAKMAN COMPLIANCE OPTIONS (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article
VII, Section 6 (a) of the 1970 Illinois Constitution, and as such may exercise any power
and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners and other departments and
constitutional offices of the county of Cook have been under a federal Shakman Consent
Decree in regards to political influence in the hiring, firing, promotion, and/or demotion
of county career service employees; and
WHEREAS, the cook county taxpayers are forced to bear an unnecessary financial
burden of approximately ten million dollars for the cost of, including but not limited to,
Shakman administrators, salaries, support staff and lawsuit payouts; and
WHEREAS, we can no longer afford to pay the cost for unfair employment practices
therefore it is essential that we move forward to comply with the consent decree by
seeking employment and recruitment alternatives that would minimize political influence
and ensure greater transparency and public trust.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and the Cook County
Board of Commissioners create an ad hoc committee made up of one Commissioner from
the Workforce, Job Development & Training Committee, one Commissioner from the
Finance Committee and representatives from the following: Civic Federation, Cook
County Sheriff’s Office, Cook County Comptroller, Cook County Forest Preserve
District, Cook County Human Resources, Cook County Recorder of Deeds and industrial
engineers, to retrieve information from all departments on current expenditures pertaining

7

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

to the cost associated with remaining under the Shakman Decree, including but not
limited to monitoring, lawsuit payouts, cost of investigations, staffing and salaries.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the ad hoc committee conduct an in-house
feasibility study for the following: (1) cost analysis of entering into an agreement with an
independent recruiting agency either on an as needed basis or contractually, (2)
comparative analysis of the cost of hiring an independent recruiting agency verses the
cost of remaining under the Shakman consent decree, and (3) an estimate of future
workforce needs taking into account retirement, budgetary constraints, and other factors
that influence the size of the workforce. The findings from the feasibility study shall be
tendered to the Cook County Board of Commissioners no later than September 1, 2010.

relationships in film; and

her own specials and as a guest on numerous other programs; and

Broadway history for “Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music,” which played for 333 days and ended on
her 65th birthday in 1982; she won a Tony Award for this show; numerous other awards have been

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 12, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into contracts with Noresco, LLC, Des Plaines,
Illinois and Johnson Controls, Inc., Arlington Heights, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Request for Proposals (RFQ/RFP) process for engineering services for the Cook County
Guaranteed Energy and Emission Savings Initiative for the Department of Corrections Campus and
Stroger Hospital of Cook County Campus Project respectively.
Reason:

This contract provides for a full range of energy services and energy-related capital
improvements designed to reduce air emissions within the public sector. These services will
include the evaluation of the County's facilities and vehicles to reduce energy costs, water
usage, improve energy efficiency practices and reduce air pollution emissions. Noresco, LLC,
and Johnson Controls, Inc., will be required to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from natural
gas, gasoline, coal, oil, and direct power generation and indirect emissions derived from the
use of purchasing of electricity. These companies are required to reduce air pollution
emissions from those sources a minimum of 10% of the previous year's levels for the years of
2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The Department of Environmental Control is in a joint venture with the Office of Capital
Planning and Policy for this Guaranteed Energy and Emission Savings Initiative.
The Initiative will be funded by the projected guaranteed savings and selected capital
improvements by municipal financing.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Bond Issue (20000 Account).

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 14, 2010 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a professional services contract with
Infrastructure Engineering, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, for the parking lot and entrance control at the
Hawthorne Warehouse project. The project consists of resurfacing approximately 220,000 square feet of
parking lot for approximately 500 parking spaces, design of a security guard station with entrance control,
and lighting, signage and landscaping. This project was originally approved and under contract in a

70

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

previous Capital Improvement Program, but cancelled by the Board of Commissioners due to funding
issues in February 2009. As of November 2009, the project was reapproved by the Board of
Commissioners in the 2010 Capital Improvement Program. The vendor has agreed to hold their fee to the
original approved contract value minus work completed.
Reason:

This firm is being recommended because they were the previous vendor who was selected
through the issuance of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process. They began work based
upon Board authorization prior to the project being cancelled. The firm previously completed
22% of the design documents which includes: site visits, meetings with Cook County
agencies, coordination with the City of Chicago Department of Buildings, Topographical
Survey, Program Analysis Report and Schematic Design Drawings prior to the project being
cancelled last year. In addition, this vendor is recommended because reissuing the Request
for Proposal would cause a lengthy seasonal delay in the completion of the project and it is
beneficial to the project to maintain the inherent ‘lessons learned’ and program continuity.
The parking lot is in disrepair and is presenting unsightly conditions. The intent of the project
was for the paved lot to be completed before the start of heavy construction traffic caused by
the work performed from the renovation portion of the warehouse interior and the exterior
wall repair projects.
The Hawthorne Warehouse is located in a high crime area and the safety and security of the
grounds would be significantly improved with the addition of the high mast lighting and
entrance control. This is especially critical during election periods as the grounds are
accessible 24 hours per day.
This is categorized as a renovation project.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $284,302.70. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
This project was included in the 2010 Capital Improvement Program projects approved by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners on November 19, 2009.
Vendor has met the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Ordinance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT
PROPOSED CONTRACT ADDENDUM
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 30, 2010 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to extend for two years (2), Contract No. 08-41-269
with On-Line Information Services, Inc., Mobile, Alabama, to provide online docket/document access,
handle electronic transmission, and provide tools for review of court documents filed in all divisions and
districts for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court.
Reason:

In order for the Clerk's Office to start the e-Filing project, we went through the lengthy
process of obtaining approval for the pilot project from the Administrative Offices of the
Illinois Courts (AOIC). As part of that process, the Clerk's Office submitted an Amended
Application for Approval of the Electronic Filing Pilot Project for the Circuit Court of Cook
County. In this document, the Clerk's Office laid out the details involved in the project,
including the role of a Clerk's e-Filing vendor. We outlined the details explaining the role the
vendor would have, types of software that will be used, authentication of filing participants,
testing phases, specified quality assurance controls, modes of interfacing with the Clerk's
Office systems, fee management, and so forth. The current vendor has met all the
requirements that were necessary for us to continue with the pilot project, including obtaining
the General Administrative Order (GAO) from the Office of the Chief Judge. If we were to
contract a new vendor, we'd have to go back to the drawing board to ensure that a new vendor
can provide the service in compliance with the guidelines approved by the AOIC. If a new
vendor cannot meet the same requirements, then we'd no longer be in compliance with the
Amended Application. If we were forced to file a new amended application to the AOIC, the
process will take approximately 2 years, which would essentially halt our e-Filling project
completely until such time.
Before the GAO was issued by the Chief Judge’s Office, they reviewed the vendor's process,
to ensure that the process would ensure privacy of information and non-violation of fee
agreements. A new vendor would require approval from the Chief Judge's Office which
would take a minimum of 6 months to 1 year approval process. Testing, training, and
integration would have to be performed by Clerk's Office employees with a new vendor.
Finally, we are waiting for approval from the AOIC to extend e-Filing into other areas of
law. If we were to switch vendors at this point, the AOIC would certainly postpone granting
this approval while they vet the new vendor, which is time we simply don't have. The five
year extension is needed to fully implement the e-Filing project in the entire Clerk's Office.
The expiration date of the current contract is June 6, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract extension: June 7, 2010 through June 6, 2012.
The Chief Information Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(z)(1) Amendment or suspension of rules,

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 15, 2010 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $100,000.00 from Account
335-240, Printing and Publishing to Account 335-120, Overtime Compensation for Circuit Court Clerks'
overtime compensation.
Reason:

Funds are needed to accommodate necessary overtime expenses for court clerks when court
proceedings extend beyond regular working hours, as well as for court clerks working the
bond courts on weekends. Accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime account to
employees that retired/resigned during the fiscal year.
This issue was mentioned during the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office Budget Presentation,
when questions were raised by one of the Commissioners. In response, the Acting Chief
Human Resources Officer explained that the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was addressing
the need to reduce the amount of overtime by changing shifts for court clerks. He also
explained that making changes such as these and adjusting the positions must be done in
compliance with the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office Collective Bargaining Agreement. In
three (3) operational areas, court clerk positions were posted with adjusted work schedules
with hours from noon to 8 p.m. establishing work weeks of Tuesday through Saturday and
Wednesday through Sunday.
These adjustments were posted for bids in late February and, consistent with the Collective
Bargaining Agreement, the jobs should be awarded within the next thirty days. By adjusting
work schedules during the February posting and adding more positions for adjustment later in
FY 2010, the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office anticipates significant reductions in overtime.
Because of the time it takes to implement these types of changes, there remains a need for
additional funds for overtime compensation at this time.
In addition, accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime account to employees that
retired/resigned during the Fiscal Year.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and
what was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
The Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was aware of the need to address consistent accumulation
of overtime by court clerks who are required to remain in court while court calls are pending
either during lunch or after regular work hours. Overtime is also accrued on Saturdays and
Sundays and holidays by court clerks who are required to work bond court. As a result,
additional funding is needed to compensate court clerks for the overtime hours worked.
On March 31, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of
funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the account was $6,854.15
and 30 days prior to that the balance in the account was $56,232.47.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 240-Printing and Publishing was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account received reimbursement for the printing costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation
Tickets) for the City of Chicago Police and the various Suburban Police Agencies.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from Account 335-240.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Printing costs for Personal Issue Tickets are now being appropriately charged to the using
agencies (City of Chicago Police and Suburban Police Agencies), hence, the availability of funds
for transfer.

CORRESPONDENCE REGARDING STATUS OF ORDINANCE NOS. 10-O-23 AND 10-O-24
Transmitting a Communication, dated May 17, 2010 from
CONSTANCE M. KRAVITZ, County Comptroller
LETTER
The Honorable Todd H. Stroger and
the Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 North Clark Street, Room 567
Chicago, Illinois 60602
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
New Item No. 4 (Ordinance No. 10-O-23) and New Item No. 5 (Ordinance No. 10-O-24)
approved by the Cook County Board of Commissioners on May 4, 2010 requires the
Comptroller to provide the County Board with specific information and reports regarding
contract payments and salary data in a specific time frame.
Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-23
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-23, the Cook County Comptroller is responsible for
providing to the Cook County Board of Commissioners various payment reports within 72
hours of any payments involving an expenditure of less than $100,000 that was approved by
the Purchasing Agent and of payments made pursuant to contracts for professional and
managerial services for Cook County, including the separately elected Officials, which
involve an expenditure of less than $25,000 that were approved by the Purchasing Agent.
The Comptroller has been diligently working with the Comptroller’s Accounts Payable
Department (A/P) and the Department for Management of Information Systems (MIS) to
produce an accurate and timely payment report. While the specific data related to contract
payments is generally included in our JD Edwards System, there is limited ability to pull a
canned report such as a check registry report. Additionally, the report that is extracted is not
in a sortable format and written duplications may occur when a Purchase Order (PO) has
multiple lines. The Office of the Comptroller has have been working with MIS to create a
special report that would address such issues.
Once these reporting issues are resolved, it is projected that the Comptroller’s Office will be
able to issue such reports within the 72 hour timeframe. The Office of the Comptroller prints
checks weekly, on Thursdays and as a result, it is anticipated that the report pursuant to
Ordinance 10-O-23 would then be available the following Monday or Tuesday.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-23 will be resolved in
a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple of
weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

Status of Ordinance No. 10-O-24
Pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24, the Cook County Comptroller in partnership with the
Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources is required to make detailed specific Human
Resource Activity Reports as outlined in the Ordinance.
I have been working with the Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources and the Director of
MIS to determine the most efficient process to determine an accurate and timely Human
Resource Activity Report. The applicable parties are meeting to determine how each of the
parties database systems capture employee information and whether a new report should be
created to address the human resource activity information requested by the Cook County
Board of Commissioners pursuant to Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
The Office of the Comptroller will continue to work with MIS and the Bureau of Human
Resources to create a special report that would address and report the information requested
under Ordinance No. 10-O-24.
It is anticipated that the reporting issue as it relates to Ordinance 10-O-24 will be resolved in
a timely manner; however; the parities will need additional time, approximately a couple of
weeks to derive a useful report that will meet all the Ordinance requirements.
Very truly yours,
Constance M. Kravitz

SUBJECT: ILLINOIS NOT-FOR-PROFIT DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT

of the Circuit Court of Cook County has collected fees from civil filings for disbursement to the Dispute

85

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook
County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 2009 total $266,976.00.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 2009, the sole qualifying applicant
under the requirements set forth in said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook County

Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), any funds

OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER (IN ACTIVE)
STATE OF ILLINOIS CAPITAL LITIGATION TRUST FUND
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 13, 2010 from
ABISHI C. CUNNINGHAM, JR., Public Defender
and
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
Pursuant to 725ILCS124, the costs of legal defense in cases involving the death penalty should be paid
from the State of Illinois Capital Litigation Trust Fund maintained by the Cook County Treasurer.
Although the state approved trust fund grants of $7.9 million approximately $1.6 has been received
through April 2010 for the Offices of the Public Defender, Chief Judge and State’s Attorney.
In December 2009, the Chief Financial Officer for Cook County agreed to advance fund the Office of the
Public Defender and the Office of the Chief Judge in order to pay our outstanding obligations. The
County will be reimbursed when the funds are received from the State of Illinois. The State’s Attorney’s
Office already has a process by which its capital litigation expenses are paid from a County account and
the County is reimbursed when funds from the State of Illinois are received.
The purpose of this letter is to respectfully request the County allow the Office of the Public Defender and
the Office of the Chief Judge to continue to use the accounts that have been established by the County to
pay our service providers. Both officers agree not to exceed the approved grant amounts of $2.7 million

86

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 18, 2010

for the Office of the Public Defender and $2.0 million for the Office of the Chief Judge. Absent State of
Illinois funding, the County must unfortunately bear the costs of litigation for indigents, in capital cases,
as it did before the advent of the fund.
