R. Warsing introduced a new SSA initiative – Lincoln Square PaintWorks
o SSA funds will be mixed with property owner buy-in and crowdfunded dollars to pay for
1-2 public murals per year
o Observations from Commission:
 Local artists ought to have preference
 Property owners ought to have substantial feedback when selecting an artist
 Minimum ‘showcase periods’ should be imposed on property owners who are
selected for PaintWorks murals
 Commission should weigh long-term visibility when selecting sites; sites facing
likely future development should not receive murals
 This initial $3,000 should be set aside for murals specifically, as opposed to arts
in general. Future, non-mural projects can be sought separately.
o Program approved – C. Dallas (motion), M. Prest (second)
R. Warsing and R. Flores discussed the ‘Strategic Plan,’ the first phase of a long-term SSA Master
Plan. Specific areas of study and a draft RFP will be brought to a future meeting. Basic elements
of the Plan should include:
o An assessment of community goals and strategies.
o An inventory of the SSA’s current resources and assessment of its future capacity.
o Demographic and market analyses of Lincoln Square.
o A reevaluation of the SSA’s current branding.
After discovering just before this meeting that the Chicago Sculpture Exhibit was still accepting
sponsor applications, R. Warsing asked the Commission if SSA #21 should spend a portion of its
Streetscape Elements budget ($3,500) to enroll.
o The Commission determined that the asking price was too high and that funds would be
better spent elsewhere, at least for this year.
o SSA #21 should revisit the issue after its Strategic Plan produces better guidance. Future
enrollment in the CSE would need to be part of a comprehensive vision.
Announcements
o G. Petersen, C. Dallas, Z. Maiorca, and S. Young need to submit new applications soon.
o City and County ethics forms need to be submitted by May 1
o The next SSA Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 25, 9:00am, at the LSRCC office.
Meeting adjourned at 10:15am
