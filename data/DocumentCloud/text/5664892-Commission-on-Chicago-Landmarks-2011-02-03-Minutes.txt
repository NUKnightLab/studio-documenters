 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
February 3, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on December 2, 2010, at 1:30 p.m. The meeting was
held at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Rafael Leon (only for item 1725 N. Fern Court)
Ben Weese
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Dijana Cuvalo
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1060 W. Addison
(Wrigley Field – 44th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of one 32’-long and one 20’- long section of the 2’10½”-high, infield brick walls with two “removable” sections of concrete
walls clad with salvaged brick; the two sections of wall are located behind
third base and are proposed to be modified to allow an alternative field
configuration to accommodate football games.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, bricks will be salvaged from the existing wall and used
to clad the new removable wall sections which will match the
appearance of the existing walls [this portion of the infield wall is nonhistoric]. The masonry joint widths, mortar color, and profiles shall
match the existing wall; and,
2. The exposed concrete portion of the two removable walls, meant to
match the limestone courses of the existing wall, shall incorporate
scored joints and shall have an integral color with a smooth finish to
match the color, joint pattern, color, texture, and finish of the
limestone of the existing wall. Historic Preservation staff may request
a color sample of the concrete for review and approval.

 2.

1725 N. Fern Court
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed conversion of a 2- unit residential building (coach house) into a
single- family residence with new garage doors, curb cut and 2 new
second- floor window openings.

Action:

Approved 3 – 0 (Mr. Torrez recused) with the following conditions:
1. The proposed divided-lite windows shall be simulated divided- lite
clad-wood windows with a substantial exterior muntin profile.
Proposed window details and dimensions shall be submitted with the
permit application for Historic Preservation Staff review and
approval; and,
2. The applicant shall provide manufacturer “cut-sheets” for the proposed
garage doors and front door with the permit application for Historic
Preservation staff review and approval.

3.

915 N. Dearborn
(Washington Square District – 42nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new 16’-4”-tall trellis and masonry wall spanning between the
rear of the main house and the historic coach house of a corner 3-story
single- family residential building.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The design of the proposed new trellis structure shall be further

studied and resubmitted for Historic Preservation staff review and
approval. The revised design shall take into consideration the
following: (a) the height of the top of the trellis shall be reduced
relative to (i) its visibility from the public way and its relationship to
the rear of the building and (ii) the eaves of the coach house (a height
comparable to the height of the transom bar of the first- floor windows
was suggested at the meeting); and (b) the trellis should be set back
(an additional approximately 1’ to 2’) further from the south property
line, as also discussed at the Committee meeting;
2. The 2nd-floor trellis may be redesigned to have a solid roof provided
that the size of the structure is reduced to be only the two bays closest
to the rear façade of the main house; and two additional support
columns are added at the rear of the structure, so that it is supported
independent of the masonry wall; and,
3. The height and design of the proposed new masonry wall along the
north (interior) property line, located between the main house and the
coach house, shall be further studied so that the wall does not replicate
the historic features of the house and/or coach house or confuse the

 historic features with new ones. The height of the new wall shall be
restudied in relationship to the lower height approved for the trellis.
4.

1348-50 E. Hyde Park Blvd.
(Kenwood District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Reconstruction of the parapet (18” increase in overall height) at
the front (primary) facade of the building without a permit to install roof
flashing.

Action:

The Committee believed (voted 2 to 1) that the visual impact of the
additional 10” in parapet height is minimal, given the overall scale, mass,
and design of the existing 4-story building, the Committee therefore found
that the current height of the parapet does not have an adverse effect on
the significant historical and architectural features of the building and
landmark district and approved the project subject to these conditions and
Historic Preservation staff review and approval:
1. New limestone quoins shall be installed in the ten areas of the added

courses between the existing quoins and limestone coping on the
parapet to match/continue the original design. The new quoins shall
match the existing limestone quoins in proportion, color, texture, and
bond pattern; and,
2. New mortar should match the existing mortar in color, composition,
and joint profile.

5.

4315 S. Wabash
(First Church of Deliverance – 3rd Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Proposed relocation of original carved oak double doors (3 sets)
in the entrance lobby for permanent display; and installation of new codecompliant glass double doors installed without a permit.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. As proposed, the original carved wood entrance double doors (3 sets)
shall be installed for permanent display in the entrance lobby as shown
in the drawings dated 10/29/10, and intended to keep the individual
sets of doors together and as close to their original locations as
possible; and,
2. As proposed, the existing door handles may remain in place. Details
for the proposed mounting system for the rear or sides of the door that
does not harm the carved front side of the doors, shall be reviewed and
approved by staff prior to order and installation.

 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
February 3, 2011
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on January 6, 2011, at 1:00 p.m. The meeting was
held at 33 N. LaSalle Street, Room 1600.
Present:

Ben Weese
Phyllis Ellin
Ed Torrez

Staff:

Brian Goeken, Deputy Commissioner, Historic Preservation Division, Department
of Zoning and Land Use Planning
Beth Johnson
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1307 N. Damen
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed replacement of vinyl siding with engineered wood siding (LP
Smartside Siding) and alterations to the front elevation of a noncontributing building (built c. 1990s) single- family residence

Action:

Given the specific circumstances and conditions of the project and the
property (a non-contributing building, built ca. 1990), the Committee
voted unanimously that the project would not have an adverse effect on
the significant historical and architectural features of the landmark district,
subject to the following conditions and Historic Preservation staff review
and approval:
3. As proposed, the new glass doors shall have horizontal muntins. The
muntins shall (a) either be “true” divided- lite muntins or dimensional
muntins on both the exterior and the interior sides of the door,
consistent with landmark standards; and (b) shall have a substantial
profile. Details of the door and the muntins shall be provided with the
permit plans;
4. The mortar for the new limestone veneer shall match the color of the
stone; and,
5. Regarding the new siding on the front elevation; the embossed-grain
engineered wood siding is approved as proposed in this very limited
instance and circumstances.

 2.

228 W. St. Paul
(Old Town Triangle District – 43rd Ward)
Proposal:

Violation: Construction of a visible roof- level deck and pergola on the
rear of a 3-story multi- family residential building

Action:

The Committee voted unanimously that the project, given the particular
conditions and circumstances of the property, would not have an adverse
effect on the significant historical and architectural features of the
landmark district and approved the project, subject to the following
condition and Historic Preservation staff review and approval:
1. Due to its height projecting above the historic rooflines of the building
and its high level of visibility along Willow Street within the landmark
district, the pergola structure at the top of the deck/stairs shall be
eliminated. As proposed, the existing roof-top deck, constructed
without a permit, is to also be removed.
