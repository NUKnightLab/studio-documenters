and hold a public hearing on its intent to adopt a levy in excess of 105% of the
amount extended or estimated to be extended in the prior year.

Board Rule 5- 14 delegates to the Chief Financial Oi?cer the authority to
annually determine the estimate of property taxes to be levied as required

necessary to be raised by taxation upon the taxable property in the district as
de?ned in Section 18-60 of the Code is $2,283,700,000 and certi?es that this
