 Background
The Notices of Funding Availability (NOFA) for the grants were released on May 31, 2018 (ROSS)
and October 31, 2018 (FSS). The CHA’s Revenue and Partnerships and Resident Services staffs
collaborated on the applications which were submitted to HUD on July 30, 2018 (ROSS) and
November 26, 2018 (FSS) respectively.
On February 12, 2019, the CHA received official written notice of a $717,750.00 grant award from
HUD’s ROSS Service Coordinator for Fiscal Year 2018. The grant will fund three (3) ROSS Service
Coordinators for the existing CHA Victim Assistance Program (VAP) for a period of three (3) years.
On February 14, 2019, the CHA received official written notice of a $819,137.00 grant award from
HUD’s FSS Program for Fiscal Year 2018. The grant will fund fifteen (15) FSS Coordinators for a
period of one (1) year.
HUD’s award letters to the CHA required that the CHA execute and return the Grant Agreements
within 72 hours of receipt. The CHA executed and returned the Grant Agreements to HUD on
February 12, 2019 (ROSS) and February 14, 2019 (FSS) in accordance with HUD’s requirements.
This is part of CHA’s 2019 Budget. Treasury will perform draws in compliance with HUD
requirements.
