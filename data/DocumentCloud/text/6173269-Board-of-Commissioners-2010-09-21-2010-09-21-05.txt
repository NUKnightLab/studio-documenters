GENERAL BACKGROUND
The Office of Information Technology Services is responsible for ensuring that the Chicago Housing
Authority (“CHA”) continuously provides a systematic and effective program for managing the life
cycle of the CHA’s records and storage to support the agency’s operations. Prudent business practices
dictate having storage and service agreements in place to ensure critical business records are maintained.
Storage is a critical factor in the lifecycle, and retention.

 The CHA issued a Request for Proposal (“RFP”) # 09-00341 on June 2, 2009. This RFP competitively
solicited qualified firms and/or individuals who could provide Offsite Record Storage Services to the
CHA. On June 25, 2009, six (6) responses were received. Of the six received, one was deemed
nonresponsive, due to a failure to accurately respond to the specified scope of services and provide
documentation as requested in the RFP. Out of the five companies that submitted a proposal only three
(3) made the competitive range which was determine at 80 and above. The three (3) companies in the
competitive range were R4 Services LLC, GRM and Iron Mountain. After meeting with each company
for discussions and completing the second round of evaluations, it was determined that R4 Services LLC
was the most responsible respondent and its proposal was the most advantageous to CHA, and was
awarded a contract for offsite record storage services.
In September 2009, the CHA entered into a storage contract with R4 Services LLC for offsite record
storage services for an amount of not-to-exceed $64,500.00 for a one (1) year base term, with three (3)
one (1) year options. R4’s best and final offer for the first one-year extension option was $64,500.00.
R4 Services has performed according to the contract and has provided reliable and quality services to
CHA during the base year contract. CHA has been satisfied with the services provided and desires to
exercise the first (1) year option with R4 Services.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive Officer or
his/her designee, to exercise the first one (1) year option with R4 Services LLC for the period of
September 21, 2010 through September 20, 2011 for an amount of not-to-exceed $64,500.00 to provide
offsite record storage services. The Contract’s new aggregate amount will be $129,000.00.
