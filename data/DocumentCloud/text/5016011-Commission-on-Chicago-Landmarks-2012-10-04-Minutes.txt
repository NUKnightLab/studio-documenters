1958 W. North
(Milwaukee Avenue District – 32nd Ward)
Proposal:

Installation of 20’-long x 15’-tall sign on the North Avenue façade at the
third-floor of an existing 3-story corner building.

Action:

The Committee unanimously adopted the following findings and
preliminarily disapproved the application:
A) Find that, pursuant to the Milwaukee Avenue Designation Ordinance
designating the Milwaukee Avenue District a Chicago Landmark on
April 9, 2008, the significant historical and architectural features of the
district are identified as all exterior elevations, including rooflines,
visible from the public rights-of-way; and,
B) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance,
preliminarily find that the proposed sign would not meet the
Commission’s guidelines, standards, and criteria because the sign
would adversely effect, obscure, and damage significant historical and
architectural features of the building and the district.
As Mr. Cho indicated at the meeting, he will be withdrawing the permit
application and will look at other signage options with Cindy Roubik of
our staff. The withdrawal of the permit application needs to occur
immediately. Otherwise, pursuant to Section 2-120-790 of the Municipal
Code of Chicago, within ten days of receiving notice of preliminary
disapproval the applicant may request in writing an informal conference to
further discuss and reach an accord regarding the application. If the
Commission does not timely receive a written request to hold an informal
conference, a public hearing on the sign application must be held and
concluded within 90 days after the Commission has preliminarily

 disapproved the permit, pursuant to Section 2?120?800 of the Municipal
Code of Chicago.
