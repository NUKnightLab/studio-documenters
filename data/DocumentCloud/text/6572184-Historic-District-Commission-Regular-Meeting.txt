PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

SCOPE: REHAB BUILDING
EXISTING CONDITIONS
As per the applicant:
The Royal Palm Hotel was constructed in 1925 for local hotel magnate Lew Tuller. Built
at a time when Detroit was experiencing explosive growth, the Royal Palm Hotel was part
of a grandiose plan on the part of Tuller and other Detroit builders to duplicate the character
and real estate market of New York City. Designed by Louis Kamper, the Royal Palm
Hotel contains thirteen floors and is faced primarily in orange brick on the two primary
facades (east and south) and beige brick on the two secondary facades (west and north).
The building exhibits the typical high-rise arrangement of a vast expanse of plain brick,
punctuated by window openings and—on the Park and Montcalm facades—is relieved by
decorative Italian Renaissance-inspired detailing. Limestone is used on the east and south
facades on the lower two floors while stone detailing appears around the paired windows
on third floor and on the upper two floors. Iron railings appear at the paired windows on
the twelfth floor and at the fifth floor in the central bay. The center window on the third
floor of the Park Avenue façade has a console-supported stone balconette with an iron
railing. There is an elaborate cornice made of glazed terra cotta that runs from the
Montcalm façade around to the Park Avenue façade and turns the corner onto the north
façade, terminating after one bay on the north façade. The west façade lacks the cornice
entirely although the orange brick wraps the corner onto the west façade and runs for one
bay—the remainder of the west façade is faced in beige brick.
PROPOSAL
The current project proposes a complete rehabilitation of the property. Specific work items
proposed for this project include the following:
Masonry Restoration
• All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be removed and replaced with
new material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the
remaining adjacent materials and new brick will match the existing as closely as possible
in size, color, texture, and compressive strength. Any salvaged brick will be reused where
replacement is needed before new brick is used.
• At the west elevation, first story, remove the existing paint. If the paint cannot be safely
removed, the brick will be repainted a color to match the brick

 Exterior Doors
• At the first story, east elevation, remove the existing non-historic-age wood double doors
and replace them within the existing frame with a new set of paired wood doors to match
the existing
• At the first story west elevation, remove the existing non-historic wood entry doors with a
new wood door with sidelites to match the look of the existing
Exterior Awning/Canopy
• At the first story, east elevation, replace the non-historic fabric awning over the entry door
with an arched glass and metal unit. See the attached drawings for details
• At the first story west elevation, remove the existing non-historic-age glass and metal
canopy above the entry doors and install a new canopy. The new canopy will be an arched
metal frame with black metal panels overhead. See the attached drawings for details
Exterior Signage
This project proposes that signage may be added at the following locations:
• A blade sign on the east façade in the southeast corner of the building and a hanging blade
sign on the south façade will both be re-introduced per historic precedent. Note, that details
regarding design, materiality, dimensions and mounting method has not been provided.
• The signs currently painted on the brick at the top of the building will be repainted to reflect
the historic name for the hotel (Royal Palm Hotel). Note, that details regarding design,
materiality, dimensions and mounting method have not been provided.
• A plaque style sign will be installed on the Park Avenue façade adjacent to the main entry
doors. Finally, above the door on Montcalm, there will be revised applied letters with the
new Restaurant name. Note, that details regarding design, materiality, dimensions and
mounting method have not been provided.
Exterior Metal Railings and Flagpoles
• This project will retain all the decorative metal railings and flagpoles. These railings and
flagpoles will be retained, cleaned, and painted. Any broken or missing pieces shall be
repaired or replaced to match the original as closely as possible.
Windows
• Nearly all the windows in the building non-historic aluminum units. These windows will
be retained as-is.
• The windows on the north facade at the 1st floor are original metal units. They will be
removed and replaced with removed and replaced with aluminum units that match the
historic windows as closely as possible in re: to muntins, head, sill, panes, jambs, sash, and
overall depth.
• Replace the column of steel windows (12 total) on the west façade with aluminum units
that match the historic windows as closely as possible in re: to muntins, head, sill, panes,
jambs, sash, and overall depth
• At west elevation, punch in two columns of new windows openings and install new
aluminum windows in each opening
• Replace the steel frame windows in the penthouse with aluminum units that match the
historic windows as close as possible in re: to muntins, head, sill, panes, jambs, sash, and

 overall depth.
Storefronts
• At the first floor, each bay window currently has a large non-historic flowerbox under each
window unit. These flowerboxes will be removed both to facilitate repair of the masonry
façade beneath and to install new flowerboxes that will match the current flowerboxes.
New flowerboxes that match the current flowerboxes will be installed.
Exterior Roof Scope
• The roofing system will be replaced with a new membrane roofing material. The penthouse
will be retained and repaired as necessary and new mechanical units will be added to the
roof; they will be placed around the penthouse as per the attached. Details regarding the
dimensions of the units have not been provided. Please see the attached sightline study
regarding the visibility of these rooftop mechanical units.
Lighting
• Replace the existing sconces at the first story with new up/down sconces. Please see the
attached for details re: the fixtures
• Historically, the building had gooseneck light fixtures that shone down on the painted signs
at the top of the building. It is proposed that these lights will be reintroduced with new
gooseneck fixtures—they will be added above the painted signage on the north façade, the
west façade and on the south penthouse.
• New lighting will be added underneath the canopies.
Metal Guardrails
• At south and east elevations, repair decorative metal guardrails
STAFF OBSERVATIONS AND RESEARCH
• The applicant proposes to replace original windows, to include the 12 existing steel
windows at the west elevation and the remaining wood windows at the rear/north elevation.
The application provides photos which depict the level of deterioration at the windows.
• All of the original windows at the building’s primary elevations (south and east) have been
replaced with non-historic aluminum units. The remaining original windows are at tertiary
elevations and include the 12 steel casement windows at the west elevation and the few
wood units at the north elevation. It is staff’s opinion that the existing steel casement
windows and original wood units are not character–defining
ISSUES
• None
RECOMMENDATION
As noted above, it is staff’s opinion that the remaining existing steel casement windows and
original wood units are not character–defining. In staff’s opinion, the work as proposed will not
result in the removal of historic materials that characterize the property. Staff therefore recommends
that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) for the proposal because it
meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. However, staff does recommend
that the Commission issue this COA with the following conditions:

 •
•

The applicant shall provide details of all proposed new signage to staff for review and
approval. If staff determines that the signage does not conform to the Standards, they will
forward the work item to the Commission for review at a future meeting
The applicant shall afford staff the opportunity to review and approve the final proposed
new storefronts and exterior doors to staff for review and approval. If staff determines that
the new storefronts and exterior doors do not conform to the Standards, they will forward
the work item to the Commission for review at a future meeting.

RE: Royal Palm Hotel - HDC Submission
Dear Ms. Ross:
Kraemer Design Group (KDG) is writing to submit information to the Detroit Historic District Commission (HDC), on
behalf of Midwest Lodging Group regarding the proposed rehabilitation of the Royal Palm Hotel (RPH) located at
2305 Park Avenue. The proposed exterior work at the RPH will include: masonry cleaning and restoration of the
exterior; removal of the flowerboxes below each storefront bay window on the ground level; new flowerboxes
replaced at each storefront bay window; new exterior doors; new canopies over both the Montcalm entrance and
the Park Avenue entrance; new signage in keeping in character with the historic signage; cleaning and repair of the
iron and metal railings and flagpoles; and new windows in a few, select locations; new roofing and new rooftop
mechanical equipment; and new exterior lighting.
The Royal Palm Hotel was constructed in 1925 for local hotel magnate Lew Tuller. Built at a time when Detroit was
experiencing explosive growth, the Royal Palm Hotel was part of a grandiose plan on the part of Tuller and other
Detroit builders to duplicate the character and real estate market of New York City. Designed by Louis Kamper the
Royal Palm Hotel contains thirteen floors and is faced primarily in orange brick on the two primary facades (east and
south) and beige brick on the two secondary facades (west and north). The building exhibits the typical high-rise
arrangement of a vast expanse of plain brick, punctuated by window openings and—on the Park and Montcalm
facades—is relieved by decorative Italian Renaissance-inspired detailing. Limestone is used on the east and south
facades on the lower two floors while stone detailing appears around the paired windows on third floor and on the
upper two floors. Iron railings appear at the paired windows on the twelfth floor and at the fifth floor in the central
bay. The center window on the third floor of the Park Avenue façade has a console-supported stone balconette with
an iron railing. There is an elaborate cornice made of glazed terra cotta that runs from the Montcalm façade around
to the Park Avenue façade and turns the corner onto the north façade, terminating after one bay on the north
façade. The west façade lacks the cornice entirely although the orange brick wraps the corner onto the west façade
and runs for one bay—the remainder of the west façade is faced in beige brick.
Originally, the building contained 15 hotel rooms on each floor although the layout has been altered on some floors
since then. The Royal Palm Hotel has two primary facades along Park Avenue and Montcalm with the two secondary
facades facing onto two parking lots, one to the north and one to the west. The building is currently vacant awaiting
remodel, and both restaurant spaces on the ground floor are also vacant.
The following is a detailed description of the proposed work and its historic implications:
Masonry Restoration
The brick, terra cotta, and limestone masonry on the exterior of the building are all in good condition overall. The
masonry will be cleaned and inspected for damage. All damaged, deteriorating, or spalling masonry units are to be
removed and replaced with new material to match original units. Missing units are to be replaced to match the
remaining adjacent materials and new brick will match the existing as closely as possible in size, color, texture, and
compressive strength. Any salvaged brick will be reused where replacement is needed before new brick is used. The
cleaning will be done according to the Secretary of Interior Standards, and NPS Technical Preservation Briefs 1, 2 &
6.
1st Floor Storefront Flowerboxes

1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 Currently there are no storefronts on the ground floor as they were replaced with bay windows during a previous
renovation by prior owners. Each bay window currently has a large flowerbox under each window unit. These
flowerboxes will be removed both to facilitate repair of the masonry façade beneath and to install new flowerboxes
that will match the current flowerboxes. The bay windows will remain in place.
Exterior Doors
The double doors on the Park Avenue entrance are wood with glazed units with decorative stainless-steel push bars
across each door. These doors are not historic and are in fair condition. Above the doors there is a large iron fanlight
with metal radiating muntins. The doors from Park Avenue into the main lobby will be replaced within the existing
frame with units that complement the historic character of the building without appearing falsely historic. The Town
Pump Tavern entry and doors are not historic and thus the doors on Montcalm Street will be replaced with new
wood units to complement historic character of the building without appearing falsely historic.
Exterior Awning/Canopy
There is a non-historic fabric awning over the Park Avenue entrance that will be removed and replaced with an
arched glass and metal unit. The glass and metal canopy above the Montcalm Street entrance will be removed and
replaced with a new canopy, made of contemporary materials, to complement the historic character of the building
without drawing attention away from the existing historic material or appearing falsely historic. The new Montcalm
canopy will be an arched metal frame with black metal panels overhead. Please see the attached drawings for
additional details.
Exterior Signage
Historically, there was a blade sign on the east façade, right near the southeast corner of the building as well as a
hanging blade sign located over the Montcalm entrance. Historically there was painted signage on the brick at the
top of the building. Currently there is signage on the awning that covers the main Park Avenue entrance and applied
letters at the Montcalm entrance.
This project proposes that signage may be added at: A blade sign on the east façade in the southeast corner of the
building and a hanging blade sign on the south façade will both be re-introduced per historic precedence. The signs
currently painted on the brick at the top of the building will be repainted to reflect the historic name for the hotel
(Royal Palm Hotel). A plaque style sign will be installed on the Park Avenue façade adjacent to the main entry doors.
Finally, above the door on Montcalm, there will be revised applied letters with the new Restaurant name.
Exterior Metal Railings and Flagpoles
This project will retain all the decorative metal railings and flagpoles. These railings and flagpoles will be retained,
cleaned, and painted. Any broken or missing pieces shall be repaired or replaced to match the original as closely as
possible.
Windows
Nearly all the windows in the building were replaced in 2005 and they are in good condition. The 2005-era windows
on floors 2-13 are single-hung aluminum units. The windows that were replaced in 2005 will be cleaned and retained
as is.
There are a few areas with older windows that are in poor condition: the windows on the north facade at the 1st floor
are original and are in poor condition, there are two windows in the previous laundry room space that are boarded
over and are in poor condition, and there are a whole column of windows on the west façade that are also in poor
condition. Finally, there are currently steel frame windows in the penthouse in very poor condition.
The first-floor storefronts were removed by a previous owner and were replaced with recessed metal bay window
units with faux copper hoods; these are in good condition.

1420 Broadway   Detroit, MI   48226   p 313 965 3399   f 313 965 3555   www.thekraemeredge.com

 The steel windows in the penthouse will be replaced with new aluminum units to complement the historic character
of the building. The windows that were not replaced in 2005 will be removed and replaced with units that match the
historic windows as closely as possible, these include: the column of windows on the west façade, the two windows
in the laundry area (which will become the new fitness area), and the 1st floor north facade windows. Note that the
replacement windows are all located on secondary facades (the west façade and the north façade).
On the west façade, two new columns of windows are proposed: one column to each side of the center column of
existing windows. Please see the attached drawings for additional details.
Finally, several new punched openings are proposed on the west façade to accommodate louvered panels and fans
for the venting the mechanical equipment. Please see the attached elevations for details.
The bay window units will be retained, inspected, cleaned, and repaired if necessary.
Exterior Roof Scope
The roofing system will be replaced with a new membrane roofing material. The penthouse will be retained and
repaired as necessary and new mechanical units will be added to the roof; they will be placed around the
penthouse. There will be no roof screen. Please see the attached sightline study regarding the visibility of these
rooftop mechanical units.
Lighting
There are currently sconces on the building. These will be replaced with new up/down sconces. Historically, the
building had gooseneck light fixtures that shone down on the painted signs at the top of the building. It is proposed
that these lights will be reintroduced with new gooseneck fixtures—they will be added above the painted signage
on the north façade, the west façade and on the south penthouse. New lighting will be added underneath the
canopies as well. Please see the attached historic photograph.

The items listed above provide a synopsis of the proposed scope of work for the rehabilitation of the Royal Palm
Hotel. Further detail is provided in the attached drawings, photos, and documentation. Please contact Brian Rebain
at Kraemer Design Group if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
Kraemer Design Group

Light fixtures: all non-historic light fixtures found throughout the building will be removed and replaced
with new units. The notation on the drawing that was submitted —stating that the light fixtures would be
removed, rehabilitated, and re-installed—that were submitted on 10/28/19 is incorrect.
Windows: Kraemer Design Group proposed removing and replacing all twelve windows found on the
west façade due to the extreme deterioration of these units. We have included additional photographs of
these windows. We are also including additional detail photos of the window units on the north façade at
the first and second floor that we intend to replace.
Exterior Doors: The Park Avenue set of double doors will be removed and replaced with new door units
and new hardware, but they will be fitted within the exiting frame. The door on Montcalm will be replaced
with a new unit and new hardware and the glazed panel in the door will be a divided light to match the
sidelights.
Window boxes: The existing window boxes are constructed of black painted panels with wood blocking.
These will be replaced with new black painted units that will match existing boxes. The existing
dimensions vary for each window box unit—please refer to the drawings—but they will be replicated with
new materials to be the same size as what currently exists.
Canopies: We are providing additional details in the attached renderings and drawings.
Rooftop Mechanical: We are submitting additional information about the rooftop mechanical units.
Attached here you will find cut sheets of the units our client intends to install.

We trust this information addresses your concerns and we look forward to hearing from you on this. Thank you in
advance for your time and consideration of these additional HDC materials.
Sincerely,

Cassandra M. Talley
