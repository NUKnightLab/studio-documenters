Call to Action

 

 
    

HAZARD LEVEL These are high?consequence antibiotic?resistant threats because of
. i signi?cant risks identi?ed across several criteria. These threats may not be
. currently widespread but have the potential to become so and require urgent
9 public health attention to identify infections and to limit transmission.

3 Clostridium dif?cile (C. dU??cile), Carbapenem?resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), Drug?resistant Neisseria




     

 

 

HAZARD LEVEL These are signi?cant antibiotic?resistant threats. For varying reasons 
Si?lous low or declining domestic incidence or reasonable availability of therapeutic
agents), they are not considered urgent, but these threats will worsen

and may become urgent without ongoing public health monitoring and
prevention activities.

Multidrug?resistant Acinetobacter, Drug?resistant Campylobacter, Fluconazole?resistant Candida (a fungus),
Extended spectrum B?lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs), Vancomycin?resistant Enterococcus
(VRE), Multidrug?resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Drug?resistant Non?typhoidal Salmonella, Drug?resistant
Salmonella Typhi, Drug?resistant Shigella, Methicillin?resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Drug?resistant
Streptococcus pneumonia, Drug?resistant tuberculosis (MDR and XDR)

 

 

HAZARD LEVEL These are bacteria for which the threat of antibiotic resistance is low, and/

or there are multiple therapeutic options for resistant infections. These

bacterial pathogens cause severe illness. Threats in this category require
9 monitoring and in some cases rapid incident or outbreak response.

 

Vancomycin?resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA), Streptococcus Group A,
Clindamycin-resistant Streptococcus Group

The Chicago Department of Public Health

(CDPH) commits to working with state, 
local, academic, and clinical partners to

establish regional standards for infection 2 

control and antibiotic stewardship by 2020.
