STAFF REPORT 7/24/2019 MEETING
APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6330
ADDRESS: 479 W. WILLIS
HISTORIC DISTRICT: WILLIS SELDEN
APPLICANT: THOMAS ROBERTS

PREPARED BY: J. ROSS

PROPOSAL

The building located at 479 W. Willis is a four-story apartment building with a basement-level living space
located within the Willis Selden Historic District. The resource is clad with brick and displays stone
detailing. Windows are vinyl, with the exception of the casement windows and transoms on the front
elevation, first story and nine windows at the rear elevation. Scarring at the front elevation parapet
indicates that a cornice once existed at this location. The existing main entrance includes exterior concrete
stairs with brick low walls on each side. The stair landing is quarry tile, surrounded by four brick piers, and
covered by a masonry and brick balcony. The entry door and windows on either side have arched tops with
surrounding stone work to match the quoins at the corners of the building. On either side of the covered
entry are two floating concrete benches over which one can view the exterior stairs down to the basement
apartment units.
Please note that the Commission approved an extensive proposal for the rehabilitation of the building at the
July 10, 2017 regular meeting. With the current submittal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s
approval of the following new work items as per the attached drawings, specs, and narrative:


At the front elevation, install two new tenant mailboxes under the existing covered porch.
Specifically, a cluster box unit would be installed on each side of the main entrance, approximately
3” above the existing concrete bench/sill and will be mounted to the inside of the masonry piers and
wall surface. One of the cluster box units will include an intercom system. Each of the units will be
mounted in a larger perforated metal panel (with a dark bronze finish) that is topped with a metal
coping/drip edge. Please note that a color sample has not been provided with the current proposal.

STAFF OBSERVATIONS
Please note the following:



The proposed new mailboxes will be highly visible from the public right-of-way when viewing the
building’s primary elevation at an oblique angle.
The applicant has noted that he desires to locate the mailboxes/intercom on the porch (rather that
installing the mailboxes in the front yard area/detached from the building) because the equipment
will “…provide fall protection for the open stairs below each side of the entry porch.”

It is staff’s opinion that the front porch is a highly-visible, distinctive feature of the building. Although the
work is reversible, it is staff’s opinion that the proposed equipment/enclosure of the porch openings will
negatively impact its historic character. More appropriate balustrades and railings could be proposed to
meet code requirement die fall protection.
APPLICABLE ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7) Relationship of Materials. A majority of buildings are faced with brick and feature stone or cast stone
trim. Single-family residential buildings are generally faced with brick and feature wooden brackets,

 bay windows, vergeboards, timbering, porch supports, dentils, entablature, or other classically inspired
elements, and other details depending on style. A small number of single-family residential buildings
feature wood clapboard siding. Stone or stone facing defines the foundations of buildings at 643-647
and 748 West Alexandrine Avenue, 481 Brainard Avenue, 3957 and 4107 Cass Avenue, and 500 West
Willis Avenue, the lower levels of buildings at 4120 Cass Avenue, 3761 Second Avenue, 495-497
West Willis Avenue, and the entire primary façade of buildings at 624 and 627 West Alexandrine
Avenue and 3977 Cass Avenue. The buildings at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass
Avenue Methodist Church, 3900 and 3977 Second Avenue, and 4100 Third Avenue are composed
primarily of stone. Sash windows are historically wood but have, in many cases, been replaced with
windows of more modern materials. Stone is used for window sills on a majority of buildings within
the district. While roofs within the district are generally flat and not visible, pitched roofs typically
feature visible slate or asphalt shingles. Buildings at 686 Selden and 711 West Alexandrine Avenue
feature clay tile roofs. The building at 3901 Cass Avenue, commonly known as Cass Avenue
Methodist Church, features a copper roof on its tower.
(8) Relationship of Textures. On a majority of buildings within the district, the major textural effect is that
of brick with mortar joints juxtaposed with cast stone or limestone trim. Patterned brickwork is used to
create subtle detail on commercial and apartment buildings, such as spandrels and rectangular panels,
and more pronounced textural interest where it exists on the upper stories of buildings, such as at 461
West Alexandrine Avenue, and in an arcaded cornice on the building at 711 West Alexandrine
Avenue. Where they exist, detailed wooden vergeboards, gables, brackets, and dormers create
considerable textural interest on all single-family residential buildings in the district. Rough-cut stone
with thick mortar joints creates considerable textural interest on buildings where it exists, while other
buildings feature smooth stone with thin mortar joints. In general, asphalt shingle roofs do not
contribute to textural interest.
(9) Relationship of Colors. Natural brick colors in shades of brown, red, and buff predominate on wall
surfaces, while natural stone colors in shades of gray, red, and brown also exist. Although most roofs
are flat and therefore not visible, sloped roofs typically feature gray asphalt, while some feature red or
green clay tile or slate in contrasting colors of gray, red, or green. Wooden architectural details are
frequently painted in bold colors, appropriate to the architectural style of the buildings, which contract
markedly with brick facing. Brick apartment buildings are generally unpainted, with gray stone trim
contrasting with brown or buff brickwork. Brick on commercial buildings is frequently painted in
shades of yellow or orange. The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis,
are always acceptable for that building and may provide guidance for similar buildings.
RECOMMENDATION

As noted previously, it is staff’s opinion that the front porch is a highly-visible, distinctive feature of the
building. Although the work is reversible, it is staff’s opinion that the proposed location of the equipment
/enclosure of the porch openings will negatively impact its historic character, subject to the conditions
below. Staff recommends that the Commission approve the installation of new mailboxes and intercom at
the property because it meets the Secretary of the Interior’s Standard for Rehabilitation Standard Number 6.
Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration
requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture,
and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be
substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. However, staff does recommend that the
Certificate of Appropriateness be issued with the following conditions:

  The new mailboxes shall be detached from the building and located/sited in the front
yard area. The applicant shall provide a site plan and final proposal for the location of the mailboxes
within the front yard area to HDC staff for review and approval prior to the issuance of the permit. If
HDC staff determines that proposed location does not conform to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards
for Rehabilitation and/or the Elements of Design, she shall forward the application to the Commission for
review at a monthly meeting.
 The 6-7/16”(H) x 10-3/8”(W) x 3-1/2”(D) intercom may be installed separately from the
mailbox/clusterbox units, surface-mounted, at the front elevation of the building. The applicant shall
provide a dimensioned drawing which depict the location of the intercom to HDC staff for review and
approval prior to the issuance of the permit. If HDC staff determines that proposed intercom installation
does not conform to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and/or the Elements of
Design, she shall forward the application to the Commission for review at a monthly meeting.
