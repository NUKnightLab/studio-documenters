PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AN ORDINANCE AMENDMENT CHANGING THE MID-YEAR BUDGET REVIEW
TO A QUARTERLY BUDGET REVIEW
WHEREAS, by changing the mid-year budget review to a quarterly budget review, prior to budget
transfers, the County Board will have more time to evaluate current and proposed programs; and
WHEREAS, as part of this early budget analysis County offices, departments and agencies will be
required to submit quarterly reports to the Board of Commissioners for review; and
WHEREAS, the concept of these quarterly reports is to detail each office or agency’s mandatory
obligations and the programs associated with their established obligations; and
WHEREAS, the quarterly reports should also detail each office or agency’s discretionary programs, what
they cost, where the money comes from, and who they serve; and
WHEREAS, recognizing that under the leadership of Finance Committee Chairman John P. Daley these
quarterly reports were a part of the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution, this ordinance is designed to
formalize and mandate these quarterly reviews so the Cook County Code of Ordinances does not conflict
with the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution; and
WHEREAS, to ensure that these quarterly reports are uniform and relevant the County Board will
establish specific criteria to which reports must, at a minimum contain all the information that was
required in the “Mid-year budget review” ordinance.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that, Chapter
34 Finance, Sec. 34-5 of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 34-5. Mid-year Quarterly budget review.

successes in Cook County, including: Old Cook County Hospital, Chicago; Pickford Theatre Building,
Chicago; South Water Street Market, Chicago; Landmark protection for Wrigley Field, Chicago;
Landmark protection for the Michigan Avenue Streetwall, Chicago; Berwyn Bank, Berwyn; River Forest
Women’s Club, River Forest; and the Frank Lloyd Wright designed Glasner House, Glencoe; and
WHEREAS, as President of Landmarks Illinois, Mr. Bahlman served on various task forces and boards,
including the Pullman Task Force, the Elawa Farm Steering Committee, the Glessner House Board, the
Lincoln Bicentennial Commission for the State of Illinois and the Illinois Main Street Council; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Bahlman created a Preservation Heritage Fund Grant Program, which has awarded
more than $370,000 to 14 Cook County properties since 2004; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONDEMNING HUMAN TRAFFICKING
WHEREAS, HR 3887, as introduced and passed with only two dissents in the U.S. House of
Representatives, introduces a cohesive legal framework for fighting trafficking by combining and

fraud and coercion” part of aggravated trafficking rather than a requirement for all convictions; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 makes exporting sexual exploiters to other countries (“sex-tourism”) as significant
a crime as importing victims for sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, HR 3887 as drafted and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, will assist many
victims of trafficking and the sex trade in Cook County; in Chicago alone, 16,000 – 25,000 women and
girls are involved in prostitution every year; this bill will enhance legal options on a federal level to help
stem a significant piece of why so many women and children are forced into the sex trade in Chicago and
Cook County: the pimps and traffickers; and
WHEREAS, in October of 2007, the Cook County Commission on Women’s Issues released the report,
“The Realities of Trafficking” in Cook County that documented the scope of the problem in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, sixty-two percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois were first pimped out before
they were 18 and one third of women and girls in prostitution first become involved before age 15; many
adult women in Illinois are also trafficked and pimped by third parties who financially profit from
keeping them in prostitution; the majority of these adult women would face violence if they did not give
the money they make in the sex trade to these third parties; and

WHEREAS, pimps and traffickers do not always use force, fraud or coercion to bring adult women into
prostitution, but pimping and trafficking is always unlawful, and it is virtually always practiced on
previously harmed, notably vulnerable and objectively disempowered women; and
WHEREAS, seventy-five percent of women and girls in prostitution in Illinois are survivors of sexual
assault, most of multiple rapes and sixty-six percent are victims of incest; and
WHEREAS, fifty percent of women and girls in prostitution are homeless; often trading sex is the only
means of survival for these women and girls; pimps and traffickers often exploit these economic
hardships to maintain adults and children in prostitution; many traffickers and pimps profit from the
commercial sexual exploitation while the women and children trafficked remain poor.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does
hereby condemn the trafficking of human beings and support efforts to prosecute those who profit from
the exploitation of women and children; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby
commend the U.S. House of Representatives and the Cook County delegation for their leadership in
expanding federal anti-trafficking legislation so that it more accurately represents the experiences of
victims in Cook County and expands the ability of federal prosecutors to bring domestic traffickers to
justice; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County does hereby urge
United State Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to support HR 3887 and the United States
Senate to pass the measure without modification; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be forwarded to United States
Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama.

Pursuant to this program addendum, the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical School will provide a
maximum of four (4) surgical pathology fellows to be assigned concurrently to the hospital for rotation.
They may consist of a post graduate 5th year fellow, or a post graduate 6th year fellow and depending
upon prior pathology residencies, they may be a post graduate 4th year fellow or a post graduate 7th year
fellow in the clinical rotations of surgical pathology, which will allow students to gain training and
education. In addition, Stroger Hospital of Cook County receives reimbursement from the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services as a teaching hospital with an approved graduate medical education
program in the amount of $12,357.00 for each fellow. Therefore, based upon the estimated fiscal impact
of $308,971.00 less $49,428.00 of projected revenue, the net estimated fiscal impact is $259,543.00.
