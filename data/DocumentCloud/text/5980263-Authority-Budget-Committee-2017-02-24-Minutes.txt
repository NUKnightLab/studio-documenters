1. Minutes of the November 17, 2016, Budget Committee Meeting
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the minutes of the November 17, 2016, Budget
Committee Meeting. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion.
Ms. Wolff said Page 4 of the minutes indicated Ms. Hora had abstained from the motion
to approve recommended FFY15 Victim Assistance Discretionary Grant Training funds
to the Illinois Attorney General’s Office and that Page 5 of the minutes indicated Ms.
Greene had abstained from the motion to approve recommended FFY13, FFY15, and
FFY16 Violence Against Women Act funds that included recommended designations to
the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and, in both instances, the term recused
should have been used in place of abstained to indicate that the decision not to vote was
based on potential conflicts of interest and not for any other reason.
The motion, including the amendments requested by Ms. Wolff described above, passed
by unanimous voice vote.

 2. Justice Assistance Grant Matching Funds Policy Discussion & Vote
Executive Director John Maki called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017,
regarding a recommendation to no longer require matching funds from JAG program
grantees.
Authority General Counsel Weis described the Authority’s existing JAG match policy.
She said that the policy has many inconsistencies and she said that the federal
government does not require matching funds for JAG grants. She said the newly
established competitive grant process would effectively ensure the local buy-in that
matching funds were intended to encourage and, therefore, matching funds would no
longer be necessary. The elimination of matching funds would apply to all future
designations.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended elimination of the matching
funds requirement for JAG grants. Ms. Smith seconded the motion and the motion passed
by unanimous voice vote.
3.A. Justice Assistance Grant Designation Reductions
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
FFY12 and FFY13 JAG Plan Adjustments. He called attention to the table in the memo
describing returned FFY12 and FFY13 funds and the staff recommendation to make
those funds available for reprogramming.
Motion: Ms. Wolff moved to approve the recommended FFY12 and FFY13 JAG
designation reductions. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
3.B. Justice Assistance Grants: Recommended Designations
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
FFY14 JAG Plan Adjustments. He described a recommended designation of $98,862 in
FFY14 funds to St. Clair County pursuant to a solicitation of applications for funding to
support Illinois Partnerships to Reduce Violent Crime programs.
Motion: Ms. Paziotopoulos moved to approve the recommended FFY14 JAG
designation. Ms. Wolff seconded the motion and the motion passed by unanimous voice
vote.

 Associate Director Givens described a recommended designation of $331,569 in FFY14
funds to the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) to support substance abuse
treatment programming at an adult transition center.
Rick Krause, representing IDOC, said the funds would support treatment at a 50-bed
treatment center in conjunction with a work-release program.

recommendation. Ms. Paziotopoulos seconded the motion and the motion passed by
unanimous voice vote.
3.C. Justice Assistance Grant Notices of Funding Opportunity
Associate Director Givens called attention to a memo dated February 24, 2017, regarding
JAG notices of funding opportunity. He called attention to a table on Page 1 of the memo
describing the planned release schedule. The schedule included:




A funding opportunity for Comprehensive Law Enforcement Responses to
Narcotics programming using $4.2 million in available FFY14, FFY15, and
FFY16 JAG funds. This initiative would support police-led diversion/deflection,
multi-jurisdictional large-scale narcotics trafficking enforcement, and multijurisdictional narcotics prosecution units.
A sole-source funding opportunity using $946,000 in available JAG funds to
support the Authority’s Research and Evaluation work.

A general discussion ensued regarding the merits of the proposed programming.
JAG Program Supervisor Greg Stevens said that the notices of funding opportunity would
be designed to maximize the use of available funds among the three recommended
programming areas:




Narcotics Enforcement.
Narcotics Prosecution.
Law Enforcement Diversion and Deflection.

Mr. Delfino said that a primary responsibility, with regard to the new competitive
awarding structure, is to ensure a degree of equity in allocating resources among law
enforcement, defense, and prosecution, as any significant imbalances would create their
own problems.
