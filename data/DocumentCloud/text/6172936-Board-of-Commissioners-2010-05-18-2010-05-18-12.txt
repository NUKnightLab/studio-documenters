EXPLANATION
The Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago (the “Boys and Girls Clubs”) is a not-for profit organization
that provides youth programs in areas of the City that need safe havens for children. The Boys and
Girls Clubs have worked with the Chicago Housing Authority (“CHA”) for over 50 years at
properties such as Henry Horner, Robert Taylor, Lathrop Homes, and Washington Park. This lease is
needed in order to continue the youth programs and services that are provided to the children in
Lathrop Homes in the facility located at 2915 N. Leavitt, Chicago, Illinois and commonly known as
The Cotter Club.
In the Lathrop Homes community, youth programs are in dire need in order to foster the positive
behavior of its youth. The Boys and Girls Clubs’ continued use of the Cotter Boys and Girls Club
facility will ensure the delivery of these much needed summer and after-school programs.
The Boys and Girls Club will provide an annual report that will highlight the number of participants
and success of their programs, and they will contract for a preventative maintenance on an annual
preventative maintenance schedule. The annual report and preventative maintenance schedule will
be provided to the Chicago Housing Authority on an annual basis or upon request. All utilities will
be contracted for and paid for by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.
Based upon the foregoing, it is recommended that the Board of Commissioners authorize the 1)
submission of a disposition application to HUD for the property located at 2915 N. Leavitt, Chicago,
Illinois and (2) enter into a long-term lease with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago for this
property for a base term of one (1) year with four consecutive one-year options on the same terms
and conditions, with a monthly rent in the amount of $100.00.
