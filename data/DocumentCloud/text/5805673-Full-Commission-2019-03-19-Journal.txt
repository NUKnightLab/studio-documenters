Chair Bell called upon Commissioner Anderson, who gave the following invocation:
“Heavenly Father, we come to you today asking for your guidance, wisdom and
support as we begin this meeting of the Wayne County Commission. Help us to engage in
meaningful discussion; allow us to grow closer as a group and nurture the bonds of the
community. Fill us with your grace, Lord God, as we make decisions that might affect the
citizens who have given us this opportunity to serve them in our elected capacity. We pray for
those who are without homes to shelter them, without food to nurture their bodies, without
hope that their lives will improve. We ask your blessing and protection for our soldiers who are
apart from their families while protecting our nation as well as our first responders who protect
us in our communities. We ask that you continue to remind us that all that we do here today,
all that we accomplish, is for the pursuit of truth, for the greater glory of You, and for the
service of humanity. We ask these things in Your name, Amen.”

Resolutions in Memoriam

By Commissioner Scott in memory of Mamie Posey Moore

2.

By Commissioner Scott in memory of Dr. Ivan L. Cotman

3.

By Commissioner Baydoun in memory of Abdul Hassan Essaili

4.

By Commissioner Baydoun in memory of the victims of the New Zealand attack

Commissioner Baydoun requested his remarks be included in the Journal; his remarks are as
follows:
“Last week, 51 innocent people were indiscriminately massacred at two mosques in New Zealand. This heinous
act of terrorism was carried out by a vile individual who was inspired by the xenophobic and islamophobic
rhetorics that are so rampant today. The senseless killing of innocent people in any house of worship is the
ultimate form of terrorism and it must be condemned in the strongest terms by everyone. When we go into a
mosque, a church or a temple, the last thing we need to worry about is being massacred by right wing extremists,
regardless what religion they claim they belong to. There is no religion that can justify the killing of innocent
people. So, those vile individuals do not belong to any religion or the human race for that matter.

My friends, thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need action. As we have seen recently, xenophobic,
islamophobic and anti-Semitic remarks have inspired and continue to inspire the extremist elements to carry out
121

 these heinous acts of terrorism against innocent people. We all must come together to eradicate the seeds of
hatred that are being planted every day. Spewing hateful remarks at Jews, Christians, Muslims, immigrants and
all minorities to score political gains must be rejected and condemned by everyone. Therefore, I am asking all of
you, my colleagues to join me in condemning the terrorist attacks that took place in Christchurch, New Zealand
last week.
And since Wayne County is a welcoming county and we represent 1.8 million people, please also join me in
calling on all elected officials in all levels of governments and the power brokers of our society to reject hate,
bigotry, anti-Semitism, islamophobia and xenophobia. And to work diligently to protect the 1st Amendment rights
of all faith traditions. We call on everyone to embrace inclusiveness, religious tolerance and unity. Let us stand
united together as Americans here in our country to help end this madness. I would like to ask my colleagues on
the commission to extend our sincere condolences to the people of New Zealand and to add this in the county
record.”

remarks added to the Journal.
