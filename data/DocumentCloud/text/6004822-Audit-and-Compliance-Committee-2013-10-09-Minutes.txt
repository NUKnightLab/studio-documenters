**Report from System Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer (continued)
Chairman Muñoz requested an update on information technology security. Dr. Bala Hota, System Chief
Information Officer, noted that the former System Information Security Officer had spearheaded that effort,
and had a pretty well-established road map that he developed last year, prior to his leaving the organization;
staff is in the process of executing their tasks relating to the project. Additionally, Dr. Hota noted that the
equipment relating to the project has been placed in the budget.
Dianne Willard, CCHHS Compliance Officer, and Natasha Lafayette-Jones, Director of Health Information
Management, provided additional information regarding the Professional Coding Reviews. Following the
presentation of the information, Chairman Muñoz suggested that further thought be given to the idea of
presenting the internal coding data in a format similar to McKesson’s presentation of the external coding
data. Ms. Lafayette-Jones stated that the information presented in the McKesson data is relating to their
internal review; however, the information presented on the System’s internal coding was the product of an
external review – similarities and differences between internal and external reviews are like an apples to
oranges comparison. In response to Chairman Muñoz’s question regarding whether the System does the data
points for each coder internally, as well, Ms. Lafayette-Jones responded affirmatively. She stated that the
administration started that program shortly after the last Committee meeting; they are fine-tuning the data
and will bring it back for the Committee’s review at the next meeting.
