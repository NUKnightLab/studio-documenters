CLERK OF THE CIRCUIT COURT – TRANSFER OF FUNDS. Transmitting a
Communication, dated April 15, 2010 from Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the Circuit
Court:
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling
$100,000.00 from Account 335-240, Printing and Publishing to Account 335-120,
Overtime Compensation for Circuit Court Clerks' overtime compensation.
Reason:

Funds are needed to accommodate necessary overtime expenses for
court clerks when court proceedings extend beyond regular working
hours, as well as for court clerks working the bond courts on weekends.
Accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime account to
employees that retired/resigned during the fiscal year.

This issue was mentioned during the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office
Budget Presentation, when questions were raised by one of the
Commissioners. In response, the Acting Chief Human Resources
Officer explained that the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was
addressing the need to reduce the amount of overtime by changing
shifts for court clerks. He also explained that making changes such as
these and adjusting the positions must be done in compliance with the
Clerk of the Circuit Court Office Collective Bargaining Agreement. In
three (3) operational areas, court clerk positions were posted with
adjusted work schedules with hours from noon to 8 p.m. establishing
work weeks of Tuesday through Saturday and Wednesday through
Sunday.
These adjustments were posted for bids in late February and,
consistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the jobs should
be awarded within the next thirty days. By adjusting work schedules
during the February posting and adding more positions for adjustment
later in FY 2010, the Clerk of the Circuit Court Office anticipates
significant reductions in overtime. Because of the time it takes to
implement these types of changes, there remains a need for additional
funds for overtime compensation at this time.
In addition, accumulated comp-time was paid out of the overtime
account to employees that retired/resigned during the Fiscal Year.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations? What was
the balance in the account on that date, and what was the balance 30 days
prior to that date?
The Clerk of the Circuit Court Office was aware of the need to address
consistent accumulation of overtime by court clerks who are required to
remain in court while court calls are pending either during lunch or after
regular work hours. Overtime is also accrued on Saturdays and Sundays
and holidays by court clerks who are required to work bond court. As a
result, additional funding is needed to compensate court clerks for the
overtime hours worked.
On March 31, 2010, it became apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that
time, the balance in the account was $6,854.15 and 30 days prior to that
the balance in the account was $56,232.47.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified?
List any other accounts that were also considered (but not used) as the
source of the transferred funds.
Account 240-Printing and Publishing was identified as the source of the
transferred funds as the account received reimbursement for the printing
costs of Personal Issue Tickets (Traffic Citation Tickets) for the City of
Chicago Police and the various Suburban Police Agencies.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations
that will be deferred, delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in
available spending authority that will result in the account that funds are
transferred from Account 335-240.
None.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this
account was originally budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated
surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Printing costs for Personal Issue Tickets are now being appropriately
charged to the using agencies (City of Chicago Police and Suburban Police
Agencies), hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 05-18-10.

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Tuesday, July 13, 2010.
