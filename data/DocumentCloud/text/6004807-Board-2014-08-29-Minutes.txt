Approval of proposed CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget (continued)
Chairman Hammock provided an overview of some of the questions and issues raised by speakers at the two public
hearings that were recently held regarding the proposed CCHHS FY2015 Preliminary Budget (Attachment #3).
During the discussion of the information on CountyCare FY2015 Projections (slide 11 of the presentation), the
subject of expected reductions to Disproportionate Share (DSH) payments was discussed. Mr. Galeener stated that
DSH payments were originally scheduled to begin declining this fiscal year, however federal legislation has since
delayed those reductions twice; now the first year of DSH reductions are expected to occur on October 1, 2016,
which will be federal FY2017. In response to a question regarding the size of the reduction that is expected at that
time, Mr. Galeener stated that he can provide that information. Director Lerner noted that this calls into question
the need for a multi-year budget plan and would suggest, if not already in progress, to begin to work on that.
Chairman Hammock concurred; he stated that as soon as this budget effort is concluded, he expects to begin
looking at a longer-term, hopefully three years plus, timeframe where the financial inevitabilities will be reviewed
and discussed.
Director Muñoz, seconded by Director Collens, moved to approve the CCHHS Proposed
FY2015 Preliminary Budget and to recommend and submit the CCHHS Proposed FY2015
Preliminary Budget to the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and to the
County Board of Commissioners, for approval by the County Board. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #4)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests presented
for the Board’s consideration. The Board reviewed and discussed the requests.
With regard to request number 1, Director Muñoz inquired whether there is a mechanism for management to
internally review the program. Ms. Besenhofer responded that, at the very least, there is to be a quarterly business
review; there are certain key criteria and key performance indicators that need to be covered within that business
review. She suggested that this could be turned into a report back to the Board, to reflect where progress is being
made. In addition to that suggestion, Director Muñoz suggested that IllliniCare representatives should also present
themselves to this Board, so that this Board can question them as well regarding ongoing performance. Director
Velasquez stated that, within that same report, it should include a monitoring of the personnel being hired, in a
sense of diversity of staff. Ms. Besenhofer responded that that is one of the key performance indicators - not only
to see how IlliniCare is doing from a key performance perspective, but regarding their subcontracted staff that they
are bringing in, as well. Chairman Hammock stated that the Third Party Administrator is required to provide
information utilizing some very expanded metric capability; the administration has been asked to sort out exactly
what the Board needs to see; it is expected to be seen very soon, and on a regular basis. He concurred with the
recommendation to meet with representatives from the entity.
Director Collens, seconded by Director Muñoz, moved the approval of request number 1, under
the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
With regard to request number 2, Director Velasquez inquired whether the vendor provides the liability insurance.
Ms. Besenhofer responded that she will review the contract language, and will provide a response.

Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
Director Gugenheim inquired whether any provisions exist to waive parking fees for truly indigent patients. Ms.
Besenhofer responded in the negative. She stated that she can ask the parking management company to do a study
about indigent patients and how they can better service them, and follow-up further regarding the subject of
waiving parking fees for indigent patients.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request number
2, under the Contracts and Procurement Items. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Report from Chairman of the Board
Chairman Hammock stated that there are three distinguished Directors whose terms have concluded and who will be
rotating off the Board. There is a nominating committee process that was well established by the Ordinance that
created this Board; that group has met and has proposed some highly qualified people to President Preckwinkle. The
President is currently in the process of considering those candidates and will be making her recommendations,
probably towards the end of September. Those current Directors have been asked to continue to serve until the new
Board Members are seated, which should occur in the early part of October. He added that, with regret, Reverend
Calvin Morris has resigned from the Board. He stated that the Board plans to recognize the long and distinguished
service of all four of those Directors at an upcoming Board Meeting.

FILLING THE GAP FOR THE UNINSURED (708) 531-0680 I FAX (708) 531?0686 I 

 

I am Victoria Bigelow, the President of the Access to Care program. I am here to thank
the Health Hospitals System Board for keeping the Access to Care program funded at
the same level as before, and to urge the Cook County Commissioners to do the same.

There is a terrible testament to the economic conditions of today. Many people have lost
their jobs and with them, their health insurance. We serve the newly uninsured as well as
our traditional base of clients. Our patients have chronic disease and are on average 52
years old. They are the ones whose care would be terminated if Access to Care ceased to
exist. They are not eligible for CountyCare. referrers them to us and we

hope that they will join the program.

 

We have supplemented the county contribution with grants from townships and
municipalities, from 5 private foundations, one of whom gave us $500,000 this year, and
with the proceeds of our annual dinner dance, which usually nets $100,000. Patients also 
pay. There is a $20 per person enrollment fee, plus they pay co?payments to the provider
of the service at the time of the service. They pay the doctor they pay the lab $5 per
specimen drawn, they pay $5 per x-ray, and they pay Walgreens $15?40 per prescription. 
These can be substantial co-payments at this income level. Many people have several
diagnoses which require several prescriptions.

Our biggest contribution come in in?kind donation from the private sector of medicine.
Physicians participate for only $68 per patient per year.

Access to Care urges you to keep us in the budget at least at'the same amount as last year.
We hope to be a partner with Cook County for many years to come.

My Reality

 

In my country, I worked for more than twenty years in the administration of a high-quality
private hospital. Although the services were expensive, I never had to pay for them. My family in i
general had free medical services (sometimes even home visits) at any time. The medications, coulii
get with the medical laboratory representatives, who also make donations to hospitals. i

I came to this country in 2001 and I started to get sick unlike I never had in Mexico. I had to go
to Stroger Hospital and since 2002, began the battle until today. 

Initially, I was diagnosed with cancer in my right breast which spread to include to my 
nodes. They performed a mastectomy and in 2003 they had to remove my nodes, which previents
me from being able to move my arm in a normal way. I received chemotherapy and treatment with i

medications until the year 2011when was discharged.


The joy only of being able to say I was cured lasted for a year, because in 2012 they found 
in my nodes on my left side and again I had to start with chemotherapy and the aggressive
medications. In 2013, according to the tests that they did, it appeared that the tumors are shrinking and
I started to calm down. It became a worse nightmare, since on February 14th of this year, studies
showed the tumors have become immune to the treatments and have grown much more than how they
were in the beginning. Worse yet, the cancer began to invade the liver. Since February 28th they started
administering weekly chemotherapy along with the usual medications and in addition, with
anticoagulants. It is a very strong treatment and not easy to cope with.

 

Being able to count on the care that Stroger Hospital has given me, has been a blessing. I do not
have any kind of medical insurance. I have been separated from my husband for eight years. My
mother, who is 75 years old, has damaged knees and walks very little. And, although she is an adult, my
daughter is still in school studying; she depends on me. I do not know if I have had the best care,
because I do not have the economic ability to be asking for other medical opinions. But to this date they
have followed up on my health problems.

I am a person who follows my treatment plan closely. I always do everything I am told and 
have never missed an appointment. But for about ten years, my quality of life has diminished. I am
always feeling weak, tired, with a lot of pain, and problems with my appetite and sleeping, since I hav
had five surgeries. have received chemotherapy and treatment with medications for the third time
and the side effect from all these procedures, are very severe and some have affected some organs in

(D

my body.

In all these long years that I have not had to think about or to count how many times I've been in
the aforementioned hospital, and how many long hours I have invested. have treated very good, good
and also badly. I have experienced failures and medical errors. Sometimes the interpreters do not know
how to interpret. Yet for all this, I am very grateful to this aforementioned hospital for the attention
offered to me, since there are highly-trained personnel (although sometimes those who take care of us
are practitioners with very little experience) and impressive machinery and medical equipment. But

 

Page 8 of 72

 

there are many of us with health problems and the population is so high that the hospital serves, that it

is normal that in order to manage quantity, at times quality is sacrificed.

A person who has gone through and continues going through treatment for cancer, even if they

want to feel strong and live a normal life, always lives with worries and suffering, which is why they
need financial assistance. In my case, I alone support my home. wish we could have priority when
dealing with the cost, in order to feel a sense on tranquility, and not add another concern which
worsens our health.

I feel very grateful for Dr. Thomas Lad who is the doctor who has treated me all these years. I

praise his work and wish him many blessings. Also I want to mention a huge thank you to CHERRY EVANS

who is my nurse in chemotherapy because she is a person who gives us careful attention, with much
respect, consideration and above all, love. In all these over ten years that have been coming to this

hospital, I have met and been treated by many people, but no one who can match her care. She is like

an ?Angel?.

Roughly, this is my story like each ofthe many patients have their own. That the name of all those people, I want to thank Stroger Hospital for all the help and services that

have been given.

Mi realidad.

En mi pais, trabaj? por mas de veinte anos en la administracion de un
hospital privado de alta calidad. Aunque los servicios eran caros, yo nunca
tuve que pagar por ellos. Mi familia en general tenia m?dico servicios
gratuitos (a veces hasta a domicilio) a cualquier hora. Los medicamentos, los
podia conseguir con los representantes de los laboratorios de medicinas,
quienes siempre hacen donaciones a los hospitales.

Llegu? a este pals en el 2001 empec? a enfermarme como no me
sucedia en Mexico. Tuve que acudir al Hospital Stroger desde el afio 2002,
empezo la batalla hasta hoy en dia.

Inicialmente, fui diagnosticada con Cancer del seno derecho que
abarcaba ya hasta los ganglios. Me realizaron una mastectomia tuvieron
que remover los ganglios en el a?o 2003, lo cual me impide el movimiento
normal del brazo. Recibi quimioterapias tratamiento con medicamentos 
hasta el ano 201 1 fui dada de alta.

8610 me duro el gusto un a?o e1 decir que estaba sanada, ya que en el
2012 me encontraron cancer en los ganglios del lado izquierdo 
nuevamente a empezar con quimioterapias los agresivos medicamentos 
lo que en el 2013 segL'in los estudios que me practicaron arrojaron que los
tumores estaban disminuyendo yo empece? a tranquilizarme, se volvio una
peor pesadilla, pues e1 14 de febrero de este a?o, los estudios arrojaron que
los tumores se han hecho inmunes a los tratamientos crecieron muho mas
que eomo estaban al principio, peor aun, el Cancer empezo a invadir e1
higado. Desde el 28 de febrero me empezaron a administrar quimioterapia
cada semanajunto con los medicamentos de siempre mas aun con
anticoagulantes. Es un tratamiento muy fuerte nada facil de sobrellevar.

Contar con la atencion que me ha dado el Hospital Stroger, ha sido Lina
bendicion. No cuento con ningfm tipo cle aseguranza, estoy separada cle mi
esposo desde hace ocho a?os, mi madre de 75 a?os que tiene danadas sus
rodillas ya camina muy poco mi hija, que aunque ya es mayor de edad,
esta estudiando; depenclen de mi. No s? si he teniclo la mejor atencion, pues

Page 10 of 72

 

 

no tengo la capacidad econonica para estar picliendo otras opiniones
m?clicas, pero hasta la fecha me han dado seguimiento a mis problemas de
salud.

Soy una persona muy apegada a los tratamientos. Siempre hago todo lo
que me dicen nunca he faltado a una cita, pero desde hace diez a?os, mi
calidad de Vida es muy baja, ya que siempre me siento d?bil, cansada, con
muchos dolores, problemas para alimentarme para dormir, pues me han
practicado cinco cirugias, he recibido quimioterapias tratamiento con
medicamentos por tercera vez los efectos secundarios de todos estos
procesos, son muy severos algunos me han afectado algunos organos del
cuerpo.

En todos estos largos a?os en que no he tenido la precaucion de contar
cuantas tantas veces he estado en dicho hospital, cuantas tantas horas de
eSpera he invertido, he recibido muy buenos, buenos malos tratos. He
experimentado fallas errores m?dicos, algunas veces los interpretes no
saben traducir. Ann con todo esto, doy muchas gracias a dicho hospital por
la atencion que me brinda, ya que tambie?n cuenta con personal muy
capacitado (aunque algunas veces quienes nos atienden son practicantes con
poca experiencia) una impresionante maquinaria equipo m?dico, pero
habemos tantas personas con problemas de salud es tanta la poblacion que
el hospital atiende, que es normal que por manejar cantidad, algunas veces
se sacri?ca la calidad.

Una persona que ha pasado sigue pasando por tratamiento de cancer,
aunque quiera sentirse muy fuerte hacer una Vida normal, siempre vive con
preocupacion angustia, por lo cual necesita ayuda economica. En mi caso,
yo sola mantengo mi hogar. Me gustaria que pudi?ramos tener prioridad en
la situacion de los costos, para poder sentir tranquilidad en ese sentido no
sumar otra preocupacion mas que hace que empeore nuestro estado de salud.

Page 11 of 72

 

 

Yo me siento muy agradecida con 61 Dr. Thomas Lad quien es el m?dico
que me ha atendido por todos estos a?os. Alabo su trabajo le deseo muchas
bendiciones. Tambi?n quiero hacer mencion de un enorme agradecimiento a
CHERRY EVANS quien es mi enfermera de la sala de quimioterapia, ya
que es una persona que nos da una atencion cuidadosa, con mucho i?espeto,
consideracion sobre todo, con mucho amor. En todos estos mas de diez
a?os que tengo asistiendo a este hospital, he conocido me han atendido
muchas personas, pero no hay quien iguale su atencion. Ella es como ?un
angePi

A grandes rasgos, ?sta es mi historia asi como cada uno de los tantos
pacientes que atienden tiene la suya, por eso es que a nombre mio de todas

esas pei?sonas quiero dar las gracias al hospital Stroger por toda la ayuda 
los servicios que nos ha dado.

Caring. Committed. Connected.

Remarks to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
In Favor of CountyCare
August 29, 2014

Good morning! My name is Deila Davis, Director of Government Affairs, at Access Community

Health Network. On behalf of the thousands of families serve, thank you for the opportunity

share remarks in support of Cook County?s CountyCare initiative.

Access Community Health Network (ACCESS) is the largest Medicaid provider in the state, and

has been a strong advocate for CountyCare since it first received its waiver in 2012. ACCESS

operates 32 health centers across Cook County - reaching as far south as Blue Island and as far

north as Arlington Heights. Our expansive geographic footprint enables us to provide high

quality primary and preventive care to thousands of families who live in medically underserved

communities.

As an early promoter of CountyCare, ACCESS worked rapidly to assist patients and communiti
members to complete their applications and help eligible patients get the healthca re coverag
they deserve. Currently, ACCESS serves more than 22,000 CountyCare patients alone and
represents CountyCare?s largest provider group outside of the Cook County Health and

Hospitals System.

One of those patients is Rev. Debra Davis.

?CountyCare is nothing to sweep under the rug,? said 62-yea r?old Rev. Debra Davis, an

associate minister at First Church of Deliverance in Chicago, during an interview with a local

newspaper.

Page 13 of 72

Rev. Davis, who seeks care at our ACCESS Blue Isla nd Family Health Center, has been an
outspoken proponent of CountyCare. Rev. Davis had been without health ca re since leaving her
job earlier this year, and she felt that ?taking more than one medication would be better

managed under a doctor's supervision."

Rev. Davis, who lives on Chicago?s South Side, signed up for CountyCare at Blue Island

Family Health Center and now calls that health center her primary medical home.

was concerned because after I became unemployed, I couldn't afford the COBRA insurance,
and was too young for Medica re," she shares. ?My eyes lit up when heard about CountyCare,
and I quickly applied for coverage. I have high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and

borderline diabetes, among other issues, all of which are now being addressed by my new

physician.?

ACCESS understands the health needs of the patients we serve. We have learned that our
CountyCare patients are among our most needy patients, who often have complex health care
needs which have been neglected for far too long. As health ca re coverage options continue to
provide more choice to residents, we are proud to support CountyCare as it continues to

build into a long?term health plan of choice.

 Expenditure and Position Variances
Proposed FY15 budget increases by 9% compared to FY14 year-end estimate
•
•
•
•
•

Increase mainly due to increasing membership in CountyCare ($73M)
Additional costs allocated to mail-order pharmacy ($17M)
Increases in employee health benefits, malpractice premiums and property insurance ($14M)
Pharmaceutical supply and equipment increases ($14M)
Miscellaneous increases in supplies and services ($8M)

Proposed FY15 budget re-allocates existing costs and positions to improve cost allocation and
transparency
•
•
•

Decline in Health Administration expenses reflects realignment of pharmacy positions and supply
costs to Stroger, Provident and Cermak.
Decreased CountyCare positions reflect realignment of personnel to Ambulatory Services.
Decreased positions in Public Health reflects transition of services to Ambulatory Services to
improve coordination and service delivery.

Plan (FHP) members starting on October 1, 2014. The County MCCN agreement also requires us to 

1 provide Medicaid-defined Service Package 2 (SP2) benefits for all eligible members starting on

I September 1, 2014.

With these expanded populations and addition of SP2 benefits, requests an amendment to the I
liliniCare agreement to accommodate these new populations and bene?t requirements by modifying the I
contract?s scope of work, terms, and not?to-exceed amount. 
TERMS OF REQUEST:
i The services to be provided by liliniCare remain the same: managed care administrative and clinical
support services, contracted clinical services, and clinical and pharmacy claims payment pass through.?

convenience to patients who use multiple services.

0 Eleven mid-level managers have been selected for Leadership Development Program. This is the third
cohort to go through the program in our ongoing efforts to develop and retain effective leaders and to better
prepare our staff for the new health care environment.

Legislative Update

The Medicaid statute prohibits federal reimbursement for services provided to a person who is an ?inmate of a
public institution.? Longstanding Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations exclude county
jail inmates from Medicaid coverage.

Rep. Alcee Hastings has authored an amendment to the Social Security Act to remove limitations on
Medicaid benefits for individuals in custody pending disposition of charges and is seeking co-sponsors.
Page 70 of 72

A few key points of the bill:

The bill only covers individuals who are in jail pending disposition of charges?they are innocent until proven
guilty and should retain their insurance coverage while in temporary custody

The bill will help counties/public health systems provide Medicaid benefits for needed mental health and
substance abuse treatment for inmates.

National Association of Counties policy calls for counties to be able to bill Medicaid?and other federal
health insurance programs?for services furnished to otherwise eligible persons in county custody pending
disposition of charges.

The extension of health benefit coverage to pre-trial jail inmates would benefit the Health System and Cook
County government and therefore we support this legislation and will with our partners to help move this
forward.

excellent physicians and teachers.

running a 1 hour conference for house staff and interviewed Dr. Mba plus prior and current trainees of his. Even though
the research is ongoing, with additional ?Great Attendings? and hospitals to visit, Dr. Mba was so impressive that he has
been invited to speak at the annual meeting committee of the Society of Hospital Medicine, in the spring of 2015 on the
topic: ?Clinical Reasoning: How some doctors' think and the rest of us try
