information on where TRAC funding has gone over the past 5-10 years.
Ms. Gallucci said yes and noted that staff will put together an analysis
Mayor Michael Summers asked if the Miller Road project is on NOACA’s longrange transportation plan (LRTP). Ms. Gallucci said not yet. Mayor Summers
asked how the project emerged on the TRAC list. Ms. Gallucci said the project will
not happen unless the NOACA Board approves it. She said the project was not
included in the LRTP because it was not deemed necessary until the
redevelopment of the property (formerly the VA Hospital) came into play. The
modeling done for the project demonstrates there will be a need for the interchange
only if the development occurs . She said sometimes projects or components of a
project will come up later because of a new development and will go through

 NOACA’s process to be amended to the LRTP at that time. She mentioned that
ODOT has requested a letter of acknowledgement or support from NOACA that
states the study has been done.
Mayor Summers asked who put the Miller Road project on the TRAC list.
Ms. Gallucci said the City of Brecksville submitted an application that NOACA will
rank along with other projects and TRAC will evaluate and determine whether to
fund the projects. Mayor Summers expressed some concern that anyone could
supersede NOACA’s process and put projects on the TRAC list. Ms. Gallucci
stated that NOACA informed ODOT that the project has yet to be approved by the
NOACA Board.
President McCall asked if there have been any projects in the past that made it on
the TRAC list, but not included in NOACA’s LRTP. Ms. Gallucci stated that since
she has been at NOACA, all TRAC projects in this region have been put in the
LRTP.

stated that NOACA has been working on a region wide application for charging
stations and is looking to get a Volkswagen Mitigation Grant. She said she did not
believe DMTF could be used for electric charging stations.
Mayor Summers asked if the Great Lakes Hyperloop will enhance NOACA’s
competitive position. Ms. Gallucci said yes. She noted that if Pittsburgh is added
to the corridor, it will enhance freight. She said an analysis was done that showed
the NOACA region is more effective at freight transportation than any other area.
She mentioned that Pennsylvania is working on its own hyperloop and NOACA is
looking to develop a connection to it.

Regional Strategic Transit Plan and the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
(GCRTA) Strategic Plan. Ms. Gallucci said there is a lot of coordination. She mentioned that
NOACA’s plan will cover all five counties and will include some of the work being done by
GCRTA.
Dr. Caver stated that NOACA and GCRTA have a space on each other’s plan and the two
planning groups are working together.
Mr. Collier asked how iterative NOACA’s plan will be with respect to updates and how will
NOACA’s plan incorporate other things that will evolve.
Ms. Gallucci stated that NOACA’s Regional Strategic Transit Plan will be very iterative. She
noted that the plan will provide recommendations and scenarios that can be undertaken by
the region, such as working better together, shared scheduling, shared procurements, and
possibly a merger into a true five-county system that includes recommendations, and the
Transit Council could work on different pieces of it. Ms. Merlone mentioned that the plan is
funded with a grant from ODOT’s Office of Statewide Planning and Research.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-028: Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study Contract Amendment
Ms. Kathy Sarli stated that Resolution 2019-028 has two parts: 1) Amend the contract with
Transportation Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the Great Lakes
Hyperloop Feasibility Study; and 2) Extend the contract term to October 31, 2019.

seconded by Mayor Michael Dylan Brennan.
County Executive Budish asked how would freight impact people traveling by Hyperloop.
Ms. Gallucci stated that freight and passengers would be in two separate pods. She noted
that timing and frequency of travel would not be affected.

3076b

1-7

 County Executive Budish stated that high speed rail was discussed by the state legislature
years ago and one of the concerns at that time was mixing freight with passengers on the
same track or tube, which would have had a significant negative impact.
Ms. Gallucci stated that there would be no stops; however, there would be interchanges.
County Executive Budish asked if there has been any coordination with the Cleveland Port
Authority on the Hyperloop. Ms. Gallucci said there will ultimately be coordination with the
ports, but at this time, the focus is on the feasibility study. County Executive Budish
commented that the Cleveland Port Authority might be another source of revenue for the
Hyperloop.
Councilman Miller asked the projected construction start date and completion date for the
Hyperloop. Ms. Sarli stated that HTT is projecting that construction could begin in 5 years.
She noted that most of the Hyperloop will probably run underground instead of in a tunnel.
She mentioned that that there is no commercial Hyperloop just yet, but noted there is a test
track in Toulouse, France and a commercial track will be completed in Abu Dhabi in October
2020.
The Board voted, Commissioner Lennon voted no, and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-029: LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multi-use Path TLCI Study
Mr. Lane provided background on the LOR Avon Citywide Bicycle and Multi-use Path TLCI
Study. He stated that the Avon received $30,000 in TLCI funds in March 2018 and Sheffield
requested $15,000 from the 2019 TLCI funding cycle for an adjacent study, but was not
recommended for funding as an independent project. NOACA staff met with the communities
to get a better understanding of the regional context of needs. Mr. Lane stated that the total
cost of the study area extension is $20,000, so NOACA would increase its funding
commitment to this project by $15,000; Lorain County Metro Parks would provide the local
match of $5,000; the existing Avon TLCI consultant contract would be modified in scope and
cost; and communities would partner in performance of the study. Mr. Lane noted that the
increase would be funded utilizing savings from other TLCI projects and there would be no
impact to other projects funded through the TLCI program or TIP.
Mr. Lane stated that upon Board approval, staff will amend the existing Local Public
Agency (LPA) agreement and consultant contract for additional scope and funds, and
continue to work with the communities and the consultant to ensure the completion of the
TLCI study.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to approve Resolution 2019-029. The motion was
seconded by Engineer Ken Carney. The motion passed by voice vote.
Mayor Hunter thanked everyone who helped to move the project forward.
Resolution 2019-030: CUY North Royalton State Road Sidewalks Phase I TLCI
Implementation
Mr. Lane stated that the City of North Royalton submitted to NOACA a request to have
$100,000 in TLCI funds transferred from State Road Sidewalks Phase II to State Road
Sidewalks Phase I. Mr. Lane mentioned several factors that were not taken into consideration
when the sponsor was developing the estimate for Phase I. Mr. Lane noted that the transfer
would increase the funding for Phase I to $208,900 and reduce the funding for Phase II to $0.
3076b

1-8

 He stated that following Board approval, NOACA will coordinate with North Royalton and
ODOT to reprogram the funds.
A motion was made by Mayor Robert Stefanik to approve Resolution 2019-030. The motion
was seconded by Commissioner Lennon.
Councilman Miller asked if staff knew the reason why the cost of Phase I came in so much
above the informal estimate.
Mr. Lane stated that the cost came in a little bit over the project engineer’s estimate and the
sponsor did not consider certain ODOT requirements and construction details of sidewalks.
Mayor Stefanik stated that the City of North Royalton did not take into consideration the piping
in several large ditches, which have to be covered up per ODOT’s specifications.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-031: Project Planning Reviews (PPRs)/Intergovernmental Review
and Consultation (IGRC); 4th Quarter State Fiscal Year 2019
Mr. Ed May provided background on PPR and reviewed the following project:
•

Major Rehabilitation of US-20 in Madison Township - This project consists of the
following road improvements: pavement replacement, minor widening (increased
lane width), drainage replacement and a sidewalk. The total cost of the project is
$16 million and no NOACA funds will be used.

Mr. May reviewed project comments from staff and advisory councils. He noted that following
Board approval, the project will be incorporated into the LRTP and the SFY 2018 - 2021 TIP.
A motion was made by Mayor Brennan to approve Resolution 2019-031. The motion was
seconded by Mr. Richard Heidecker.
Engineer Andrew Conrad asked if there was a significant history of head-on collisions on US20 in Madison Township. He also asked the reason for recommending rumble stripes.
Mr. Dave Short said there has been a history of head-on collisions in the area and noted that
minor widening may prevent that from happening. Mr. Short noted that recommendations
submitted to ODOT will be considered.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-032: Plan and TIP Amendments; 4th Quarter State Fiscal Year 2019
Mr. May presented the following projects to be amended to the Plan and TIP for the 4th quarter:

Mr. May stated that any additional funds made available in SFY 2020 will be expended. He
noted that following Board adoption, staff will manage the SFY 2020 program to ensure the
expenditure of all available funding allocations.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to approve Resolution 2019-033. The motion was
seconded by Mr. Collier. The motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-034: Functional Classification Amendments
Ms. Kathy Sarli presented information on two functional classification amendment requests
submitted to NOACA:
•

State Road (SR 94) - Downgrade from minor arterial (FC=4) to major collector
(FC=5) - the total mileage is 1.46 miles

•

Auburn Road (CR 4) - Downgrade from a major collector (FC=05) to a local road
(FC=07) between the Portage County Line (Harner Road) and Washington
Street (CR 606)

Ms. Sarli stated that NOACA is recommending changing SR 94 to a major collector, which will
stay on the federal-aid system, and recommending changing CR 4 to a local road, which was
mistakenly classified by ODOT as a major collector. Ms. Sarli provided an overview of the

Accessibility for Independence as the Coordinated Public Transit-Human Services
Transportation Plan for Northeast Ohio. Ms. White provided background on the Coordinated
Plan; discussed the public outreach that was done; and reviewed the goals for the future and

Transit Administration (FTA) Section 5310 program funds for the Cleveland Urbanized Area
(UZA). Currently, NOACA directs at least 60% of the funds to transit agencies and up to 40%
of the funds to other specialized transportation providers. NOACA will use the Coordinated
Plan as an evaluation tool to prioritize Section 5310 funding and guide current and future
regional needs.
Ms. White stated that following Board approval, the Coordinated Plan will be submitted to
ODOT and FTA.
A motion was made by Commissioner Lundy to approve Resolution 2019-036. The motion

to assist Mayor Summers.
The Board voted and the motion passed by voice vote.
Resolution 2019-037: Transportation Conformity Analysis for 2015 Ozone National
Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) Designation
Mr. Tim Kovach stated that NOACA is required to complete a conformity determination within
one year of nonattainment designation for NAAQS. The determination must receive final
approval from the United States Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) by August 3, 2019,
and must demonstrate that emissions from NOACA’s transportation plans and programs will
not prevent the region from meeting federal air quality standards. He noted that emissions
cannot exceed budgets set in State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the NAAQS. Mr. Kovach
mentioned that an interagency consultation (IAC) call with local, state, and federal partners
occurred on February 12, 2019. NOACA coordinated with the Akron Metropolitan Area
Transportation Study (AMATS) and the Erie Regional Planning Commission (ERPC) on the
conformity determination and based on follow-up discussions, all partners agreed that
NOACA could advance the conformity determination based on existing emissions analyses.

May and June, and following NOACA Board approval, all final documents will be forwarded
to ODOT, FHWA, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) for final
approval.
A motion was made by Mayor Hunter to approve Resolution 2019-037. The motion was

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-038: SFY 2019 Overall Work Program Completion Report

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve NOACA’s State Fiscal Year 2019 Overall Work Program
(OWP) Completion Report. The activities outlined in this work program occurred between July 1, 2018
and June 30, 2019. ODOT requires a Board-approved Completion Report by September 30, 2019.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommended this action.
BACKGROUND
NOACA’s many accomplishments during SFY 2019 were achieved through the leadership of its Board of
Directors, the dedication of its Committees, and the contributions of staff.
Federal law requires that metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) develop a unified planning work
program each year that describes all federal-aid planning activities. In Ohio this work program is called
the Overall Work Program (OWP). NOACA develops its OWP consistent with federal and state
transportation and environmental planning guidance.
The completion report outlines staff activities as outlined in the SFY 2019 Overall Work Program (OWP).
It also includes a year-end funding table. The report was prepared for NOACA funding agencies, the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
The SFY 2019 OWP comprises 31 projects comprising 114 individual work products. NOACA spent 83
percent of funding in SFY 2019 to achieve an average project completion rate of 97 percent. Unspent
Consolidated Planning Grant funds have been carried forward into the current fiscal year. A detailed
project level table is attached.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the 2019 OWP Completion Report will be forwarded to state and federal officials
for review.

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-039: Budget and Contract Amendment – Great Lakes Hyperloop
Feasibility Study

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve amending the total Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study
project budget from $650,000 to $750,000, and amending the Transportation Economics & Management
Systems, Inc. (TEMS) contract for The Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study in the amount of $84,600.
The Finance and Audit Committee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Board of Directors, through Resolution 2018-019, awarded a contract to Transportation Economics &
Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS) for the development of The Great Lakes Hyperloop Feasibility Study.
The Board of Directors also, through Resolution 2019-028, increased the contract to TEMS from $550,092
to $585,485 for the extension of the corridor from Youngstown to Pittsburgh. Since the last Board meeting,
The Richard King Mellon Foundation has granted NOACA $100,000 for further analysis of the Cleveland to
Chicago and Pittsburgh corridor, which includes the analysis of an additional representative route to the
Pittsburgh airport, station analyses in Cleveland, Chicago and Pittsburgh, modal split refinement, and
project meetings.
A time extension to December 31, 2019 is needed to complete the additional work and outreach efforts.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This project was budgeted for expenditure in FY 2019 for $650,000 and is funded through revenues now
totaling $750,000 earmarked for the Hyperloop initiative from various partners of NOACA (Cleveland
Foundation - $200k, ODOT - $250,000, Ohio Turnpike - $100,000, the RK Mellon Foundation - $100,000, as
well as NOACA - $100K). This action would increase the consultant contract from $585,485 to $670,085, and
the total project budget from $650,000 to $750,000.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA will amend the budget, OWP and the contract with Transportation
Economics & Management Systems, Inc. (TEMS).

RE:

Resolution 2019-040: Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission Membership

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board is asked to approve ex-officio Board membership for the Executive Director / Chairman of the Ohio
Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission (OTIC).
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
At the May Governance Committee meeting, it was suggested that NOACA consider offering ex officio Board
membership to the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission. That conversation continued at the August
Governance Committee meeting, where the committee recommended this item to the Executive Committee.
Staff will present background information on the item, including impacts on general membership and board
structures of peer organizations relative to participation of tolling agencies on MPO boards.
Currently, besides the NOACA region, the Ohio Turnpike touches Toledo (TMACOG), Erie County (ERMPO),
Akron (AMATS) and Youngstown (EASTGATE). None of those metropolitan planning organizations have an
Ohio Turnpike presence on their policy boards. However, NOACA is uniquely situated as an MPO relative to
the OTIC because, in addition to the Ohio Turnpike running through portions of Cuyahoga and Lorain
counties, its headquarters are located in the NOACA region (Cuyahoga County). Moreover, OTIC is a partner
with NOACA on the Hyperloop feasibility study, and has provided funding for the project.
Providing ex-officio membership to the Executive Director / Chairman of the OTIC membership will give the
NOACA Board and the OTIC the opportunity to further engage in discussions of mutual interests, but will not
affect the Board voting structure since the seat is non-voting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
If the resolution is approved by the Board of Directors, the Executive Director/Chairman of the OTIC will
become a nonvoting, ex officio member of the Board without further action needed. In addition, however, in
order to more formally memorialize this appointment in the Code of Regulations, Section 4.2(g) of the Code

5 - 11

 of Regulations will be amended and forwarded to NOACA’s five member Counties for ratification prior to
January 1, 2020. Ratification of the amendment of Section 4.2(g) is recommended, but not necessary to
appoint the Executive Director/Chairman of the OTIC to the NOACA Board.

WHEREAS, the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) is the Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) for the counties of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina, and the City
of Cleveland; and the areawide water quality management agency for the same region; and
WHEREAS, the Ohio Turnpike is a major interstate highway carrying multi-state traffic through the
region and runs through two counties in the NOACA region; and
WHEREAS, the Ohio Turnpike & Infrastructure Commission (OTIC) is headquartered in the NOACA
region, and; and
WHEREAS, Many NOACA area roads and bridges provide connectivity to and from the Ohio
Turnpike, and Turnpike traffic significantly affects other NOACA area roadways; and
WHEREAS, NOACA has partnered with OTIC on an important transformational project, specifically
the Hyperloop, which may utilize the Ohio Turnpike as Right-of-Way; and
WHEREAS, the stated mission of the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission is, “To be the
industry leader in providing safe and efficient transportation services to our customers, communities and
partners.”
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the Northeast Ohio Areawide
Coordinating Agency, consisting of 45 principal officials serving general purpose local governments
throughout and within the counties of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, and Medina and the City of
Cleveland that:
Section 1. The NOACA Board of Directors hereby appoints the Executive Director / Chairman of
the Ohio Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission as an ex officio member of the NOACA Board, and the
NOACA Code of Regulations will be amended to include the Executive Director / Chairman of the Ohio
Turnpike and Infrastructure Commission as an ex officio member of the NOACA Board of Directors. This
change requires the approval of the five counties of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina, from
whom ratification is sought prior to the next regularly scheduled Governance Committee meeting on
November 8, 2019. If written concurrence is not received by that date, the Governance Committee will
consider whether an extension to the ratification period is warranted, otherwise this change to Article IV of
the NOACA Code of Regulations will be void and of no effect.

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-041: NOACA Board Membership by Population

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve revisions to NOACA’s Code of Regulations regarding Board
composition, as recommended by the Governance Committee. Specifically, this resolution would amend
Section 4.2 of NOACA’s Code of Regulations to provide for the assignment of membership on NOACA’s
Board of Directors based on the population of its member Counties, which membership will be automatically
adjusted at each decennial census.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
At the May 10, 2019, meeting of the NOACA Governance Committee, a motion was passed directing the
Board to address the allocation of seats based on population as suggested by NOACA’s Code of Regulations.
Specifically, the Code states, in relevant part, as follows, in Article IV, Section 4.2:
The Board of Directors shall consist of representatives from the five-county area. The
goal for representation is to bring to the Board’s discussions and decision-making the
principal elected officials and regional administrators of the NOACA area concerned with
transportation and environmental planning, while assuring to the area’s citizens an
approximation of equal representation by population. Board positions shall be
granted based on requirements of this section and individual Board members shall be
specified annually at the first meeting. Each County shall be responsible for assuring
appropriate representation according to this section, recognizing the goal for
representation, dues procedures, and compliance within each County and the Agency’s
mission.
The remainder of Section 4.2 consists of a list of the specific members of the NOACA board, indicated by
position or title, including the voting representative of the Ohio Department of Transportation, resulting in a
Board of 44 members. The representative of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, which is an ex officio
position, is not included in the 44 member total. This specific list of board members was added to the Code
of Regulations in 2009, and was intended to reflect board representation assigned by population across the
five NOACA member counties.

5 - 15

 As previously noted, the language in Section 4.2 expressing the goal of representation by population is
inconsistent with the specific list of board members in Section 4.2(a)-(f). This appears to have been a result
of a math error made when board seats were assigned in 2009.
The Board previously approved amendments to the Code of Regulations that would have addressed these
issues, but they were not successfully ratified. Subsequently, it was the consensus of the Governance
Committee and Board not to pursue the matter further noting that the next decennial census would provide a
more opportune time to resolve the issue. As we now prepare for the upcoming 2020 Census, it would be
proper to move forward to correct the Code of Regulations. Specifically, add two seats to correct the math
error, mandate the three member minimum per county, as well as adopt a formula to appropriately adjust
membership to reflect changes in population as reported in each decennial census.
To this end, at its most recent meeting on August 23, 2019, the Governance Committee passed a resolution
recommending that the Board of Directors approve an amendment to Section 4.2 of the Code of Regulations.
The specific changes are delineated in the attached document.
These amendments to Section 4.2 are intended to be effective upon publication of the results of the 2020
decennial census.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact for this item.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
If the resolution is approved by the Board of Directors, the amendments to Section 4.2 of the Code of
Regulations will be forwarded to NOACA’s five member Counties for ratification prior to January 1, 2020.

 APPENDIX II
Method of Seating NOACA Board of Directors Membership
At the January organizational meeting in the calendar year following the release of each
Decennial Census, Board of Directors’ Membership will be reconstituted based on the following
method that is predicated on the Code of Regulations, which guarantees each County at least
three seats on the Board of Directors.
1) Number of members for each County will be initially determined by the results of this
formula (rounded to two decimal places), which ensures that each jurisdiction will have
no fewer than three seats. The formula is implemented via an Excel spreadsheet.

𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , 3�

for i = 1,…,6

Subject to

6

� 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ≤ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖=1

Where:

𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = Desired voting membership total for the Counties
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 = Desired voting membership for County 𝑖𝑖
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

= Total Census population for the five Counties

= Census Population for County

𝑖𝑖 in progression

2) The results from step 1 are rounded to zero decimal places and summed. If the sum is
greater or less than the desired total, proceed to step 3.
3) The necessary reduction or addition will be made by the greatest mantissa method. The
mantissa is the remainder of a decimal number. In the greatest mantissa method, the
largest remainder receives an extra unit, followed by the next largest and so on until the
desired resulting total is reached. The three seat minimum would be maintained for
each county.

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-042: Project Planning Review for 1st Quarter State Fiscal Year
(SFY) 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve projects proposed for 1st Quarter SFY 2020 to acknowledge
that the projects have successfully completed project planning review (PPR).
The Transportation Subcommittee and the Planning and Programming Committee have recommended
this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federalaid transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and
federal requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board (including committees, subcommittees, and
councils, which provide intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC)) and public involvement. The
end product of PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing
the project to proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
The first quarter PPR covers a roadway project in Solon and bridge projects in Fairview Park and
Cleveland in Cuyahoga County and a transit project in Lake County.
Detailed information about the projects can be found at:

 As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPRs is
included on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained
from the public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed
projects are posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board approval, the project sponsors will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with project sponsors to address any planning issues identified during PPR prior to
amendment to the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-044: Facility Planning Area (FPA) Revision Request: Transfer of
one (1) parcel from the Lorain County FPA to the Avon Lake/Lorain County Rural
Wastewater District (LORCO) Phase I FPA in Columbia Township

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the facility planning area (FPA) modification request by Lorain
County Rural Wastewater District (LORCO). Specifically, the item will transfer one (1) parcel (1.0 acre) from
the Lorain County FPA to the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I) FPA in Columbia Township.
The Planning and Programming Committee and Water Quality Subcommittee recommend this action.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN) 1200099000009 in
Columbia Township to connect to the LORCO sewer line along Hawke Road (Attachment A). The parcel
currently resides in the Lorain County FPA. In order to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, the parcel must be
transferred to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). Under the federal Clean Water Act, all sanitary sewer
connections must be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO. To allow for Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road to connect to LORCO’s sewers, an agreement was reached between Lorain County, LORCO, the City
of Avon Lake and Columbia Township in 2016. Under the agreement, upon a written request from a
landowner along Hawke Road to connect to LORCO’s sewer line, all parties agree to give their approval for
the FPA change to transfer the requesting parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. The
agreement also reaffirms Lorain County’s sewer planning authority as the Designated Management Agency
(DMA) for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road.
LORCO requested letters of support from the City of Avon Lake, Lorain County and Columbia Township on
April 1, 2019. Despite the agreement between these entities, comment letters are still required to fulfill the
notification requirements in Policy 4-6 of the 208 Plan. All affected jurisdictions submitted letters of support
for the FPA modification (attached).

5 - 35

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
NOACA’s approval of the boundary change will not result in any financial impact to NOACA.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, NOACA staff will submit the updated FPA boundary to Ohio EPA.

 Staff Comments:
Hawke Road is on the boundary between Eaton Township and Columbia Township in
Lorain County. It is also on the divide between the Avon Lake/LORCO Phase I (Phase I)
FPA and Lorain County FPA. Eaton Township is a member of LORCO and within the
Phase I FPA. Columbia Township is not a member of LORCO and within the Lorain
County FPA. LORCO has a sanitary sewer line that runs along Hawke Road and
Brokaw Road. Due to the current FPA boundary, only the properties along Hawke Road
in Eaton Township can connect to LORCO’s sewer. All sanitary sewer connections must
be within the FPA of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that treat the
wastewater.
In 2016, LORCO, Lorain County, City of Avon Lake and Columbia Township signed a
sanitary sewer service agreement for the Columbia Township parcels along Hawke
Road, which would like to connect LORCO’s sewers. The agreement stipulates that if a
property owner along Hawke Road requests in writing to be connected to LORCO’s
sanitary sewers, the affected jurisdictions would all support the proposed FPA
amendment to transfer that parcel(s) from the Lorain County FPA to the Phase I FPA. In
the agreement, Lorain County would remain as the sewer planning Designated
Management Agency (DMA) for all Columbia Township parcels along Hawke Road
regardless of the FPA.
LORCO received a request from the property owner of permanent parcel number (PPN)
1200099000009 to connect their planned home, currently under construction, to
LORCO’s Hawke Road sewer. The landowners included a Columbia Township building
permit application, a photo of the home at the time of the request, and a letter from
Lorain County Public Health that does not object to the connection of this home to
sanitary sewers (attached). The 1.0-acre parcel on which the home resides is within the
sanitary sewer service agreement area between LORCO and the affected jurisdictions.
The current FPA boundary has the parcel within the Lorain County FPA (Attachment A).
LORCO has requested an FPA modification to transfer this parcel from the Lorain
County FPA to the Phase I FPA (Attachment B). No prescription changes are
requested.
Even with the sanitary sewer service agreement between LORCO, City of Avon, Lorain
County and Columbia Township, NOACA’s FPA modification policy still requires LORCO
still must solicit support from the affected jurisdictions to satisfy the notification
requirements in Policy 4-6 of the Clean Water 2000 Plan (208 Plan). All affected
jurisdictions support the FPA boundary modification request.
Staff Disposition:
The staff recommends approval of the requested FPA boundary modification between
the Phase I FPA and the Lorain County FPA. LORCO has an existing sanitary sewer
along Hawke Road and Brokaw Road with the capacity to accept the flow from the
proposed development. The request also satisfies the provisions in the sanitary sewer
service agreement between the affected jurisdictions to provided sewers, upon request,
to the Columbia Township property owners along Hawke Road. Lastly, the request is
supported by all the affected jurisdictions and Lorain County Public Health.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution 2019-045: SFY 2021 – 2024 TIP Projects Recommended for NOACA
Funding

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve the projects to be funded with NOACA administered Surface
Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds and STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP)
for the SFY 2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program (TIP).
The Planning and Programming Committee supports this action. Also, the Finance and Audit Committee
recommended the TIP financial plan for NOACA administered funds at its August 23rd meeting.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
NOACA is developing its Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for State Fiscal Years (SFY) 20212024, which will be in effect from July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2024. The TIP will contain road, bridge,
public transit, and other transportation projects scheduled for implementation within NOACA’s five counties.
The TIP will include projects supported by NOACA administered funds and by other federal funds controlled
through ODOT, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), or by other governmental agencies.
NOACA’s estimated available budget for SFYs 2021 – 2024 is $119 million, which includes $108 million of
STBG funds and $11 million of TAP funds. The TIP universe of identified needs included approximately 700
projects totaling more than $1 billion needed for implementation through the next 2021-2024 TIP timeframe.
Given limited resources, the projects that are recommended for NOACA funding best represent priorities
contained in the AIM Forward 2040 long-range transportation plan while also aligning with established State
and Federal transportation performance management initiatives.
The methodology to filter and evaluate projects was recommended by Transportation Subcommittee and
Planning and Programming Committee. The projects were evaluated by staff against the recommended
regional significance and planning criteria and considering geographic equity and whether they are located in
an Environmental Justice, Urban Core, or Disadvantaged Community. The input received from committees
was utilized by staff along with other information and data points to develop the project recommendations for
NOACA administered funding. The projects recommended for NOACA Administered Funds are attached.

5 - 49

 FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended program of projects will commit a total of $119.8 million of NOACA STBG and TAP
funds for SFYs 2021 through 2024. The recommended program of projects was developed by staff and
recommended by the respective committees and incorporated into the final draft.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Following Board approval, staff will work with project sponsors to finalize project scope, schedule and budget
for incorporation into the draft 2021-2024 TIP, along with non-NOACA funded projects. The final draft TIP
will be presented to the Planning and Programming Committee for recommendation at its January 17, 2020
meeting.

MEMORANDUM
TO:

NOACA Board of Directors

FROM:

Grace Gallucci, Executive Director

DATE:

September 6, 2019

RE:

Resolution No. 2019-046: Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Program
Recommendations

ACTION REQUESTED
The Board of Directors is asked to approve Resolution 2019-046, which approves the regional priority
of CMAQ projects to be implemented in SFY2024-2025.
A summary of project applications were presented to the NOACA Air Quality Subcommittee and
Transportation Subcommittee at their respective meetings on June 21, 2019, and for recommendation
to the Planning and Programming Committee at their July 12, 2019 meeting.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION FOR CURRENT ACTION
The Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program provides funding for transportation
projects and programs that reduce congestion and improve air quality for areas that do not meet
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particular matter.
NOACA expects to receive approximately $30 million for SFY 2024-2025 based on historical
funding allocations.
NOACA announced the solicitation for new projects in April 2019 and applications were due
May 2019. NOACA received 10 applications totaling over $30 million. NOACA staff has
initiated evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in accordance with the statewide
program policy project scoring criteria. The criterion, developed by the eight large MPO’s
comprising the statewide program, includes:
1. Project Type (10 points)
2. Cost Effectiveness (20 points)
3. Other Benefits (10 points)
4. Existing Level of Service (15 points)
5. Positive Impact on Level of Service (15 points)
6. Status of Project (10 points)
7. Non-Federal Match Commitments (10 points)
8. Regional Priority (10, 7, 4, 2 points based on top four project priorities)
9. History of Project Delivery (up to -10 points)
Criteria # 8, Regional Priority, is the only one in which NOACA has the ability to control the
assignment of points. As previously directed by the Board, these points have
been applied strategically by staff to maximize CMAQ funding to the region.
5 - 59

 Based on that approach, staff is recommending that the bonus points be assigned to projects
that provide the greatest, furthest reaching benefits to the region’s air quality and multimodal
transportation system, but that also strategically address the mechanics of the scoring system.
Specifically, it would not be effective to assign bonus points to projects that would
already score well, for example bus replacements. In accordance with this approach, our
preliminary analysis demonstrates that bonus points would be assigned to the following four
projects:
10 points – REGIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS
7 points – GCRTA BLUE/GREEN RAIL LINE SHELTER IMPROVEMENTS
4 points – SOM CENTER RD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, WILLOUGHBY
2 points – RICHMOND ROAD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, BEDFORD
Proposed regional priority bonus points have been incorporated into the preliminary draft
evaluation scores for all projects. A summary of the recommendations with preliminary draft
evaluation scores is attached to this memo.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
A total of approximately $28.8 million for transportation projects that improve air quality and reduce
congestion in the NOACA region will be recommended by the Statewide CMAQ Committee for final
approval in November 2019.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
With Board with approval, staff will submit scored applications with funding recommendations to the
Statewide CMAQ Program Committee for evaluation in October 2019 with approvals expected in
November 2019.

RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF THE
NORTHEAST OHIO AREAWIDE COORDINATING AGENCY
WHEREAS, the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) is the Metropolitan
Planning Organization (MPO) for the counties of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, and Medina, and
the City of Cleveland; and the areawide water quality management agency for the same region; and
WHEREAS, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) allocates Congestion Mitigation and
Air Quality (CMAQ) funds to urban areas of Ohio for transportation projects and programs that reduce
congestion and improve air quality for areas that do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particular matter; and
WHEREAS, in November 2012, the statewide CMAQ program replaced the individual programs
historically administered by the eight largest MPOs; and
WHEREAS, these MPOs represent the greater regions Akron, Canton Cincinnati, Cleveland,
Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown; and
WHEREAS, in April 2019, NOACA announced the solicitation of applications for new projects
targeted for implementation for state fiscal year 2024 and 2025; and
WHEREAS, NOACA expects to receive approximately $30 million in SFY 2024-2025 for new
projects based on historical allocations; and
WHEREAS, NOACA staff has completed evaluation and scoring of each CMAQ application in
accordance with the statewide program policy project scoring criteria; and
WHEREAS, NOACA has the ability to control the assignment of Regional Priority points in the
denominations of 10, 7, 4, and 2 points to four regionally significant projects, as required by the statewide
CMAQ program policy; and
WHEREAS, options for the Board’s assignment of these points were presented to the Planning
and Programming Committee for recommendation; and
WHEREAS, the Planning and Programming Committee recommended that points be applied
strategically by staff to maximize CMAQ funding to the region; and
WHEREAS, staff recommended that the bonus points be assigned to projects that provide the
greatest, furthest reaching benefits to the region’s air quality and multimodal transportation system:
10 points – REGIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS
7 points – GCRTA BLUE/GREEN RAIL LINE SHELTER IMPROVEMENTS
4 points – SOM CENTER RD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, WILLOUGHBY
2 points – RICHMOND ROAD MULTI-PURPOSE FACILITY, BEDFORD
In accordance with this recommendation, bonus points would be assigned accordingly; and
WHEREAS, staff determined this recommendation in careful review of all projects against factors
associated with greatest regional air quality benefits and the limited amount of statewide program funding
available; and
