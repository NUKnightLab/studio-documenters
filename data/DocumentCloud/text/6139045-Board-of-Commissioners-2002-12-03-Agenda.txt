REAL EST ATE MANAGEMENT DIVISION
PROPOSED REA L EST ATE MATTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated November 20, 2002 from
JOHN W. DA VIS, Director, Real Estate Management Division
On December 18, 200 I, the Board of Commissioners approved a lease (the "Lease") for use by the Adult
Probation Department of 4,437 square feet (the "Prem ises") to be constructed on the second floo r of an
existing building. The landlord is Atlantic Mall Corporation (the " Landlord") and the building is located
at 3934 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois.
The Lease provides that the term of the Lease will commence 14 days after substantial completion,
estimated to occur on April I , 2002. The Lease a lso gives the Tenant the right to tem1inate the Lease if
the prem ises are not substantially complete by December 18, 2002, one year after approval of the Lease.
However, if the Landlord substantially completes the Premises during the thirty days after notice is given,
the termi nation is null and void.
While awaiting delivery of the Premises, the Adult Probation Department is occupying space on the first
floor of the building (the "Temporary Premises") on a month-to-month lease approved by the Board on
December 18, 200 I.
The Premises has not been substantially completed and, in fact, appears to be some weeks away from
completion. Further, the Adult Probation Department has concerns regarding maintenance of the
Temporary Premises that have not been adeq uate ly addressed by the Landlord. Representatives of the
Adult Probation Department have req uested that the County terminate the Lease in accordance with its
terms, and exercise the right to terminate the Temporary Premises lease on 30 days notice. Staff currently
occupy ing the Tem porary Premises w ill be relocated to existing locations.
Based upon the foregoing, respectfully requesting authority to serve the thirty (30) day termination notice
under the Lease, to terminate the Temporary Lease, and to serve any other notices and take any other
actions necessary to effectuate such terminations.

Commissioner Steele, seconded by Comm issioner Sims, moved that the communication be referred to the
Committee on Finance Real Estate Subcomm ittee. (Comm. No. 256335). The motion carried
unanimously.
