HARRIS & HARRIS (PROPOSED CONTRACT) FOR COLLECTION
SERVICES FOR DELINQUENT TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES. Transmitting a
Communication, dated November 17, 2005 from Dorothy Brown, Clerk of the
Circuit Court:
I am writing to inform you of an initiative for which I would appreciate your
consideration and support at the December 6, 2005 Board Meeting.
Specifically, I would like to request authorization from the Cook County Board
of Commissioners for the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court to engage the
firm of Harris & Harris for a two year period to perform accounts receivable
collection services for delinquent fines and fees due and owing to the Clerk's
Office. The goals of this initiative are to collect as much revenue as possible
and to bring past due accounts that are deemed uncollectible by an
independent qualified firm to closure.
The collection services provided by Harris & Harris will be performed on a
competitive basis with no cost to Cook County. All fees associated with the
collection of a past due fine or fee will be added in addition to the fine or fee
amount as permitted by Illinois Public Act 093-0836, which became law in
2004.
The scope of the collection services that Harris & Harris would be engaged to
perform would concentrate solely on past due Traffic fines and fees .
The horizon of time that will be addressed for the collection of past due fines
and fees will span in excess of ten (10) years.
Established in 1968, Harris & Harris has the resources necessary to perform
collection services for a court system the size of the Circuit Court of Cook
County efficiently and effectively, using state-of-the art technology as well as
industry standard collection procedures. The decision to select Harris & Harris
for this engagement was predicated on a due diligence review performed by
the Clerk of the Circuit Court of several firms who presented their services for
consideration.

RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING A NEW REAL ESTATE TAX BILL PUBLIC
SAFETY LINE ITEM (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed
Resolution sponsored by Gregg Goslin, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored
by Jerry Butler, Joseph Mario Moreno , Peter N. Silvestri , Deborah Sims,
Bobbie L. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
NEW REAL ESTATE TAX BILL PUBLIC SAFETY LINE ITEM
WHEREAS, Illinois Compiled Statutes Chapter 35 220/20-15 clearly defines
the purpose of the property tax bill as providing taxpayers with detailed
information about where and how their tax dollars are spent; and
WHEREAS, the number of line items on the Cook County property tax bill are
not reflective of the actual services rendered by Cook County government; and

 FINANCE AGENDA
JANUARY 4, 2006
PAGE12

WHEREAS, the tax bill currently has a separate "Cook County Health
Facilities" line-item on tax bills which could be utilized to reflect the true cost of
providing health services with a corresponding deletion of said Health Facilities
costs from the "County of Cook" tax line item; and
WHEREAS, in an effort to make transparent the cost of services for Public
Safety a new line item should be added to property tax bills specifically to fund
public safety services with a corresponding deletion of said Public Safety costs
from the "County of Cook" tax line item; and
WHEREAS, the Public Safety line item would be comprised of the same
agencies and departments as the Public Safety Fund in the County's tax levy
which accounts for approximately 38.6% of FY 2005 revenue; and
WHEREAS, the Public Safety line item should include the County's criminal
justice system: jails, courts and related services generally found under the
auspices of the Cook County Sheriff's Office, Clerk of the Circuit Court, the
Bureau of Public Safety and Judicial Coordination and the Office of the Chief
Judge; and
WHEREAS, this new line item would clearly show taxpayers the costs of
providing services such as the court system and corrections which the County
is required to provide; and
WHEREAS, the corresponding figure or cost of Public Safety would be
dedicated to providing these services and therefore cannot be diverted
elsewhere; and
WHEREAS, adding this new line item to Cook County Property Tax Bills is
consistent with the Illinois State Statutes' purpose of providing taxpayers with a
clear understanding of where tax dollars are spent.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board
encourages the County Clerk to create a new line item for Public Safety on the
Cook County tax bill initiating on the 2nd installment of the FY 2005 tax bill for
the benefit of all property taxpayers.
*Referred to the Finance Committee on 12/21/05.

* The next regularly scheduled meeting is presently set for Wednesday, January 18, 2006.
