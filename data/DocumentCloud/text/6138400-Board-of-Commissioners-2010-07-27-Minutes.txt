The Village of East Hazel Crest has identified that this commercial building and parking area has been
abandoned for more than a year and is currently blighted. With the recent road work improvements in
this area this property has been reduced and is deteriorating at a rate that makes it difficult to encourage
new development. The Village of East Hazel Crest would like to secure this property, make the necessary
improvements and remarket it in an effort to add to its business tax income. East Hazel Crest is a small
land locked community with a small business base. This particular property would benefit by the addition
of adjoining property (requested in a second No Cash Bid application) if it were combined to make a
more marketable site. It would assist the Village in maximizing the sales tax potential.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will file for and maintain tax exempt status for the requested property
until that time a developer is located.
There is no Third Party Request, proposal or agreement by a developer, organization or other private
party for this no-cash bid request.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010
The Village of East Hazel Crest will retain the legal services of Hiskes, Dillner, O'Donnell, Marovich &
Lapp, Ltd, attorneys for the Village, to obtain the tax deed and the Village will bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The Village of East Hazel Crest will also annually report to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development informing and updating the County as to the status of the parcel of property for five (5)
years or until the intended development is completed, whichever comes last.

Submitting a request from
DAVID WEBB, JR., Mayor, City of Markham
Re: No Cash Bid Request Package for the City of Markham
The City of Markham, Illinois would like to take advantage of the no-cash-bid process of the Cook
County Board in acquiring various contiguous tax delinquent parcels from 161st Street to 162nd Street
between Dixie Highway and Leavitt Avenue.
I therefore respectfully request that the Cook County Board consider and approve the City of Markham’s
request for participation of the following seven (7) parcels sought to be acquired. The parcels are listed
by Volume and Property Index Numbers (PINs) as follows:

In further support to this request, please find submitted herewith a certified copy of Resolution No. 10-R429 passed by the City Council formally requesting participation in the No-Cash-Bid Program.
The City intends to offer the seven (7) properties acquired to a developer for commercial/industrial use.
Such development will serve to restore these properties as viable tax revenue-producing sources,
contribute to an increase of the tax base of the City and contribute to an increased flow of State sales tax
with its concomitant benefit to the City.
The City does not have a third party developer to transfer title at this time. The City will file for tax
exempt status on all properties because it will retain the PINs until the tax deeds are conveyed to a
developer.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010

Additionally, the City will benefit through the elimination of eyesores scattered around the requested
parcels and a hope for revitalization of the quality of life in the community. The proposed development
will also generate employment opportunities for City residents.
The developer (to be determined) will be responsible for all legal activity and expense necessary to obtain
tax deeds to the property and will bear all legal and other costs associated with the acquisition.
The City will submit to the Cook County Department of Economic Development annual reports on the
status of acquired property for five (5) years after acquisition or until development of those properties is
complete.

This request package contains one (1) PIN.
The property is a swath of green space that is situated in the heart of the City of Rolling Meadows’
downtown area. The property is sandwiched between the Rolling Meadows Shopping Center and Salt
Creek and leads directly into Kimball Hill Park to the north. The property was originally platted and
designated for storm water detention for the development of the shopping center. A large majority of this
parcel is located within the 100 year floodplain with much of that floodplain in designated floodway.
Consequently, this parcel is land-locked, inaccessible and undevelopable and will remain green, open
space. It is anticipated that the parcel will remain City property whether it be retained by the City of
Rolling Meadows or be conveyed to the Rolling Meadows Park District. The parcel itself will remain and
be maintained as green space and added to the Salt Creek green belt that traverses through the heart of the
City of Rolling Meadows.
The City of Rolling Meadows will file for tax exempt status for this property while the City retains the
property or the Park District when and if it is conveyed the property.
The City of Rolling Meadows will use its legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and bear all legal and other
costs associated with acquisition of the parcel.
The City of Rolling Meadows agrees to submit, to the Cook County Department of Economic
Development, No Cash Bid Reports on the status of the parcel for five (5) years as required by the Cook
County No Cash Bid Ordinance.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE JOAN PATRICIA MURPHY, ELIZABETH “LIZ” DOODY GORMAN
AND JOHN P. DALEY, COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
A RESOLUTION IN OPPOSITION TO THE USE OF THE AREA KNOWN AS THE
LUCAS BERG NATURE PRESERVE FOR THE DUMPING OF DREDGED SEDIMENTARY
MATERIALS FROM THE CAL-SAG CHANNEL AND CALLING FOR THE
UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE SITE
WHEREAS, the area now known as the Lucas Berg Nature Preserve located in the Village of Worth was
designed in the late 1970s and completed in the early 1980s by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) and named the Lucas-Berg Confined Dredged Material Disposal Facility (CDF) for
the disposal of maintenance dredging material from the Calumet-Sag Channel. It is owned by the
Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago and leased to USACE. The Metropolitan
Walter Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) transferred the property to USACE until such
time that the Corps determines that the land is no longer suitable for use in connection with the Cal-Sag
dredging project and transfers it back to MWRD; and
WHEREAS, the Lucas-Berg CDF, also referred to as the Lucas-Berg Pit, is located in a 74 acre former
tract located north of the Calumet-Sag Channel, between Southwest Highway on the west, Oketo Avenue
on the east and 111th Street on the north; and
WHEREAS, the neighborhood surrounding the Lucas-Berg Pit is densely populated and consists of
homes, schools, churches, public transportation, food establishments, and housing for the elderly; and
WHEREAS, the dumping of dredged sedimentary materials into the Lucas-Berg Pit would settle in
proximity to ground water and pose a potential hazard to the air and drinking water of the community;
and
WHEREAS, the Army Corps of Engineers’ environmental assessment study of the Cal-Sag Channel
dredgings identifies the existence of potentially hazardous pollutants which pose a threat to the Village of
Worth and its residents and could cause serious illness including mercury poisoning, lead poisoning,
anemia, brain damage, birth defects, kidney dysfunction, and lung impairments; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois House of Representatives adopted HR0655 on January 13, 2010 which states
opposition to the use of the Lucas-Berg CDF and the dumping of dredged sedimentary materials into the

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010
Lucas-Berg Pit because of the threat to human life and safety in the surrounding area and urges the
USACE to find an alternative and safe resting site for sediments dredged from the Cal-Sag Channel; and
WHEREAS, Worth residents successfully opposed a plan to turn the preserve into a landfill in the 1970s
and in response to their concerns in 2005 regarding the USACE plan to dump toxic dredged sediments
from the Cal-Sag Channel, the Worth Village Board formed the Life Safety Commission and the Lucas
Berg Nature Preserve Commission, so that the area known as the Lucas-Berg Nature Preserve would
remain dedicated to recreation and nature for the life safety and environmental sustainability of the
surrounding community and also in order to protect the fragile ecosystem and flaura and fauna that has
developed in the preserve for the last thirty years.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Cook County
Commissioners do hereby oppose the use of the Lucas-Berg Pit as a repository for contaminated dredge
material from the Cal-Sag project and insist on its removal from the USACE list of placement property
and call upon USACE to find an alternative site; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the text of this Resolution be spread upon the proceedings of this
Honorable Body and suitable copies be tendered to the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Village of Worth.
Approved and adopted this 27th day of July 2010.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH & HOSPITALS
July 14, 2010
The Honorable,
The Board of Commissioners of Cook County
ATTENDANCE
Present:

Chairman Butler, Vice Chairman Goslin, Commissioners Beavers, Claypool, Collins,
Daley, Gainer, Gorman, Moreno, Murphy, Peraica, Reyes, Schneider, Sims and Steele (15)

Absent:

Commissioners Silvestri and Suffredin (2)

Also
Present:

Patrick Driscoll, Jr. – Deputy State’s Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau; William Foley
– Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System; Michael Ayres –
Chief Financial Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System; Dr. Terry Mason –
Chief Medical Officer for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health & Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met
pursuant to notice on Wednesday, July 14, 2010 at the hour of 11:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room
569, County Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Chairman Butler acknowledged the presence of Chairman Warren Batts and the System Health Board
members David Ansell, David Carvalho, Heather O’Donnell and Sister Sheila Lyne.
Chairman Butler informed the committee that the meeting will begin by having a presentation from
William Foley, Chief Executive Officer, Cook County Health & Hospitals System.
Mr. Foley stated to the Committee that he was joined by Dr. Terry Mason, Chief Medical Officer for the
Cook County Health & Hospitals System and Mr. Michael Ayres, Chief Financial Officer for the Cook
County Health & Hospitals System. Mr. Foley thanked the Cook County Health & Hospitals Board of
Directors for attending the meeting and for their support of the strategic plan.
Mr. Foley stated that this strategic plan calls for a fundamental redesign of the County Health System and
it calls for a realignment of resources. On its own it is not a cost reduction plan; other initiatives are in
place addressing increased efficiencies and cost reductions across the System. Mr. Foley stated what you
will be able to see in the presentation is that this strategic plan is cost neutral; a major focus of the plan is
enhancing access of their services to the patients and this is not possible unless the System Board realigns
the resources that are currently in place. Further, Mr. Foley stated that this plan will be funded within the
resources that the System Board currently has. In some areas of the Health System the plan calls for a
discontinuation of services to allow the Health System to invest in other areas to expend access to
services. In conclusion, Mr. Foley stated that this strategic plan is a growth plan and the System Board
will demonstrate to the Commissioners that with the implementation of the plan the Health System will

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010
actually expand the ability to treat more outpatients, both primary care and specialty outpatients through
the clinics and Health System by about 50% over five (5) years. Mr. Foley informed the Committee that
this plan does anticipate health reform, which was passed March 2010; this reform caused the Health
System to take a step back and look at the plan and make sure that the Health System was positioning
itself for health reform. Mr. Foley stated that the plan will not please everyone and the Health System
had to make some tough decisions and choices in developing the plan. He believes that it is the best plan
for the purposes that the Health System is trying to achieve in terms of expanding access for the services
to the patients.
Mr. Foley gave the Committee an overview on the Vision 2015 Strategic Direction. The Health System
has been working on the strategic plan for about 14 months; during the process he stated that he believes
that they have engaged the various constituencies of the Health System within the County, within the
Health System, and within the community, and that other providers have very engaged in the process.
Mr. Foley informed the Committee that last summer the Health System conducted seven (7) town hall
meetings that were scheduled across the County geographically in order to achieve the most participation
in attendance. At the town hall meetings individuals were not only allowed to provide their input but also
had surveys and questionnaires that were distributed and the Health System Board was able to receive a
lot of input and information. The first round of town hall meetings were held to ask the public what their
perceptions were of the Health System in order to assist the Health System Board in developing the
strategies in the plan. The second round of town hall meetings occurred in the fall, when the System
Health Board presented the preliminary plan and strategies, and received a significant input again at the
meetings.
Mr. Foley informed the Committee that the strategic plan was approved by the Health System Board in
June and it is now before the Cook County Commissioners today. Early on in the process the System
Health Board did a detailed assessment of the County’s market demographic analysis to identify where
the healthcare needs are throughout the County. Mr. Foley stated that there are significant unmet needs
that exist throughout the County; there are large disparities in access to healthcare in the location of
healthcare services. The System Board’s resources are disproportionately centered on the inpatient
environment and cannot sustain the current service delivery model based on the changes in healthcare.
The cost structure requires significant realignment in order to drive efficiency. (See Attachment A).
Chairman Butler stated that the written statements should be entered into the record.
Chairman Butler asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers, in

Commissioner Daley asked if Dr. Mason or Mr. Foley would respond to the concerns that were voiced by
the various speakers.
Mr. Foley stated that the System Health Board believes that with the new plan more patients can be seen.
The outpatient capacity at Oak Forest Hospital will increase by more than four (4) times.
Commissioner Daley stated that he shares Mr. Foley’s concern and agrees that the strategic plan is very
good; he has always supported the healthcare budget. Further, Commissioner Daley stated that he is
concerned about the money; he asked Mr. Foley if he was confident based upon the votes that the System
Health Board would have support to bond this.
Mr. Foley stated that the System Health Board needs those capital dollars to build and expand the regional
outpatient centers and clinics, and for the investment in IT which is a large part of the capital plan.
Commissioner Sims inquired as to whether the System Health Board had applied for the (CON)
Certificate of Need.
Mr. Foley responded that the strategic plan needed to be approved prior to going to the State and applying
for any kind of Certificate of Need. Services can be suspended by notifying the State without a
Certificate of Need, which is another alternative that the System Health Board is looking at. In terms of
acquiring an official Certificate of Need from the State at this point the System Health Board would not
do that until they had an approved strategic plan.
David Carvalho, System Health Board Member, responded that a Certificate of Need is not necessary to
reduce beds, but a Certificate of Need is needed to add beds and to eliminate beds. But if you reduce beds

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010
within the parameters that they are referring to it would be fine. However, the important point here is that
this is not the implementation plan that was presented to the Commissioners, this is the vision.
Your Committee has considered the following item and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
307672

COOK COUNTY HEALTH & HOSPITALS SYSTEM, HEALTH SYSTEM’S FIVE
YEAR STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL PLAN. Transmitting a Communication from
Warren L. Batts, Chairman, and William T. Foley, Chief Executive Officer:
Pursuant to the Ordinance establishing the Cook County Health & Hospitals System, the
Board of Directors of the Health System respectfully submits the Health System’s FiveYear Strategic and Financial Plan to the Cook County Board of Commissioners for its
approval.
The Health System began the planning process for its Five-Year Strategic and Financial
Plan in May of 2009. This process entailed extensive community input and participation
from a variety of stakeholders. At the outset of the process, as well as while the Plan
evolved, the Health System conducted a series of Town Hall meetings for the public
throughout the County. The Health System also held a series of employee, staff and
physician Town Hall meetings at various System Affiliates. In addition, over 500 patients
and other stakeholders were interviewed regarding their assessment of the County’s
healthcare needs and the Health System’s current state.
System leadership and staff have been closely involved in all phases of the planning
process. Physicians and staff participated in four (4) Service Line Working Groups
established to make recommendations on the configuration of the delivery of healthcare
services in critical areas.
The Five-Year Strategic and Financial Plan presented for the County Board’s approval is
the culmination of this collaborative process. The ultimate goal of the Plan is to provide
more access and more care within available resources. The guiding principle of the
planning process was to create a healthcare delivery framework to provide for more
appropriate access to care for the vulnerable population in Cook County within available
resources.
In support of the Health System’s mission, the vision of the Five-Year Strategic and
Financial Plan is that the Health System will be recognized locally, regionally, and
nationally – and by patients and employees – as a progressively evolving model for an
accessible, integrated, patient-centered, and fiscally responsible healthcare system focused
on assuring high quality care and improving the health of residents of Cook County.
The Ordinance establishing the Health System provides that the County Board shall
approve each Strategic and Financial Plan if, in its judgment, the Strategic and Financial
Plan is complete, is reasonably capable of being achieved, and meets the requirements set
forth in the Ordinance. After the System Board submits a Strategic and Financial Plan to
the President and the County Board, the County Board shall approve or reject such
Strategic and Financial Plan within 45 days or such Strategic and Financial Plan is deemed
approved.
The Health System Board respectfully requests that this item be referred to the Health &

transmitted herewith for your approval is Change Order No. 1 in the amount of $281,286.00 to the
contract with Tilton, Kelly & Bell, L.L.C., Chicago, Illinois, for the Design and Construction
Administration Services Project at Hawthorne Warehouse. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable
Body approve this request.
Reason:

This change order provides for additional architectural and engineering services associated
with the increase in the project budget. The budget was increased during the 2010 Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) process to meet the need for additional program requirements,
expanded construction scope and specialized shelving equipment. In addition, floor loading
analyses were required, structural engineering and the need for customized environmental
control systems necessary to accommodate the storage of sensitive records.
The original project scope developed did not anticipate the density of storage systems
required to meet the requirements obtained through programming. The additional amount
added to their contract represents a 1.95% increase of the revised project amount, far
below industry standards.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010

Transmitting a Communication, dated July 6, 2010 from
DOROTHY A. BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $89,000.50 from and to the
accounts listed below, for the procurement of two (2) trucks that were previously approved by the Board
of Commissioners during FY 2010 Capital Equipment Budget approval, and to pay for seven (7) Digital
Microfilm scanners purchased on November 16, 2009.
Reason:

Additional funds are needed to purchase the previously approved trucks. The original
estimated cost of $85,000.00 was for gasoline engine trucks, however, upon further review of
the dimensions and specifications we realized that the trucks are much smaller and do not
provide access to a standard dock. As a result, we are reverting to purchasing the trucks that
meet our needs and replacing the current ones with high mileage and high maintenance cost.
Also, funds for the purchase of the seven (7) scanners were budgeted in FY 2008 in Capital
Account 579. Contrary to the submitted requisition, Purchase Order #165040 was issued
from Operating Account 530.
Upon submitting the invoices for payment (last invoice received May 10, 2010).
requests for payments were denied for lack of funds.

was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
As to the two (2) trucks, on May 13, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving account would
require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the balance in the
account was $85,000.00 and 30 days prior to that it was $85,000.00.
As to the seven Digital Microfilm scanners, on May 20, 2010 it became apparent that the receiving
account would require an infusion of funds in order to meet current obligations. At that time, the
balance in the account was $495.00 and 30 days prior to that it was $495.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds as the
account was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will be needed for the moving of
the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne Warehouse, which is no longer
anticipated to take place in FY 2010, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.
Account 530-Office Furniture and Equipment was identified as the source of the transferred funds
as the account was budgeted for the purchase of a Planetary Camera and Scanner that will no longer
be purchased, as the model is being phased out. Instead, the idea of outsourcing the specialized
scanning project is being considered, hence, the availability of funds for transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 529-521 and 529-530.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
Account 521-Institutional Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of various equipment that will
be needed for the moving of the Record Center from 2323 South Rockwell to the Hawthorne
Warehouse. The move to the Hawthorne Warehouse is currently behind schedule due to funding
issues encountered by the Office of Capital Planning and Policy. Hence, the availability of funds
for transfer in FY 2010. However, we will be requesting funds in FY 2011 to complete the move to
the Hawthorne Warehouse.
Account 530-Office Furniture and Equipment was budgeted for the purchase of a Planetary Camera
and Scanner that will no longer be purchased, as the model is being phased out. Instead, the idea of
outsourcing the specialized scanning project is being considered, hence, the availability of funds for
transfer.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010

CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated July 22, 2010 from
JOSEPH SOVA, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Raymond L. Harris, Sr.,
Bolingbrook, Illinois, for Specialized Consulting Services related to organized labor contract negotiations
and related communications.
Reason:

Mr. Harris has previously consulted and assisted the Bureau of Human Resources by
taking the lead of the re-negotiations for thirteen (13) collective bargaining agreements. Mr.
Harris’ substantive involvement in the stated re-negotiations has provided him with unique
insight into the operations of the Bureau of Human Resources and the needs and limitations
of the County as it pertains to collective bargaining. The Bureau of Human Resources is
presently re-negotiating approximately eighty-eight (88) collective bargaining agreements;
and, it is anticipated that Mr. Harris will take the lead on approximately one-third (1/3) of
said collective bargaining re-negotiations.
Furthermore, Mr. Harris possesses a unique work experience developed over nearly forty (40)
years in the local organized labor industry. Given Mr. Harris’ lengthy work experience, Mr.
Harris is clearly qualified to provide unique and specialized skills to the benefit of Cook
County. Lastly, the provision of Mr. Harris’ specialized skills as a consultant contractor
produces an economic benefit to the taxpayers of Cook County.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $60,000.00 $15,000.00. Contract period: September 1, 2010 through August
31, 2011 November 30, 2010. (490-260 Account). Requisition No. 00320017.

PRESIDENT’S OFFICE OF EMPLOYMENT TRAINING
GRANT AWARD
Transmitting a Communication dated June 10, 2010 from
ARTHUR L. TURNER, Director, President’s Office of Employment Training

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 27, 2010
requesting authorization to accept a grant in the amount of $30,700.00 from the Illinois Department of
Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO), for Workforce Investment Act (WIA) services to operate
a youth program in conjunction with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
This project was the result of a collaborative effort between the President’s Office of Employment
Training (POET) and DNR to provide eligible youth an opportunity to get a better appreciation of the care
and maintenance of our natural resources. The project focused on activities at Wolf Lake in Chicago,
Illinois. Funds for the project have been authorized for this purpose by DCEO.
These funds are for reimbursement of costs charged to the Work Investment Act (WIA) American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act I-YS grant. Costs were incurred against that grant due to a delay in
receiving the funding from DCEO.
I respectfully request approval of the funds, and request that the Chief Administrative Officer of the
Bureau of Administration, or his designee, be authorized to execute, on behalf of Cook County, any and
all documents necessary to further the programs approved herein, including, but not limited to,
subrecipient agreements, intergovernmental agreements, amendments and modifications thereto.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant Award: $30,700.00. Funding period: June 1, 2010 through July
31, 2010.
The Budget Department has received all requisite documents and determined the fiscal impact on Cook
County, if any.

Reason:

These vendors are grant partners for the Project Reclaim grant approved by the Illinois
Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) and by this Board. Each specific vendor, with
their unique skills and resources, will be able to provide all necessary resources to ensure all
grant goals are met. These goals are obtained by maintaining interagency information sharing
that tracks juvenile needs and services. Accountability-based programs will provide court
advocacy services, gang intervention, mentoring programs, English classes, youth support
groups, after school and summer youth programs, improved academic performance and
positive decision-making skills. Restorative justice programs will provide peer jury and peer
mediation, family group conferencing programs, viable alternatives to court prosecution and
conflict resolution for first time or early juvenile offenders, victim/offender conferencing, and
peace-making circles, all of which lead to the reduction of recidivism. Partners will also
provide risk and needs assessment, intensive one-on-one mentoring services,
counseling/therapy in individual, group and family modalities, and referrals to other mental
health and substance abuse providers. The State’s Attorney’s Office has identified areas in
need of services across Cook County by evaluating police and Juvenile Justice Enterprise
Management System (GEMS) reports as well as reports generated through computer mapping
of juvenile crime, and has identified these uniquely qualified partners in each of the areas.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funded amount: $330,000.00. Contract period: November 27,
2009 through November 26, 2010. (833-260 Account).
