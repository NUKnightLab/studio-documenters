Dr. Mildred Harris
Michael Ivers

The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolutions adopted.
Commissioner O’Keefe, Chairperson of the Finance and Audit Committee, then presented her
monthly report. Per Commissioner O’Keefe the Finance & Audit Committee held its regular
meeting on Wednesday, January 9 at approximately 1:15 p.m. at the 60 East Van Buren
Corporate offices. Miroslava Mejia-Krug, Chief Financial Offer, and staff presented the
Committee with the Treasury and Cash Flow Report for the month of December 2007.
There being no resolutions to approve, the Finance & Audit Committee report was accepted in
total.
Commissioner Ivers then presented the Operations and Facilities Committee monthly report. Per
Commissioner Ivers, the Operations and Facilities Committee Meeting was held on Wednesday,
January 9, 2008 at approximately 1:35 p.m. at the 60 E. Van Buren Corporate offices. Per
Commissioner Ivers, at the request of staff, Items B1 thru B3 were tabled at Committee Meeting
and approval deferred for today’s Board Meeting.
Commissioner Young then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Resolution for Item B1.
(Item B1)
The resolution for Item B1 approves a Contract Modification with The George Sollitt
Construction Company for additional work related to the general renovation of Trumbull Park
2

 Homes. This contract modification provides funding for the Contractor’s work to replace all of
the staircases in Buildings A1 through A7, located in the northwest corner of the Trumbull Park
Homes development. In many areas, the stairs have collapsed. In other areas, the stairs are
pulling away from the walls because the bolts anchoring the stair treads and/or the stairs are
corroded. Replacement of all the staircases, as opposed to only repairing them, will be more
cost-effective and will deliver a better value and longer lasting solution for the costs expended.
The Contractor will also construct new laundry facilities and office space. This work is intended
to provide adequate laundry facilities to meet the resident’s requirements for washing and drying
laundry, and additional office space.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-3
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9, 2008
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE MODIFICATION NO. G-14 TO
CONTRACT NO. 0617 WITH THE GEORGE SOLLITT CONSTRUCTION
COMPANY FOR ADDITIONAL WORK RELATED TO THE GENERAL
RENOVATION OF TRUMBULL PARK HOMES (IL2-025)”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer
or their respective designee to execute Contract Modification No. G-14 to
Contract No. 0617 with The George Sollitt Construction Company in the amount
of $3,388,794.00 for additional work related to the general renovation of
Trumbull Park Homes (IL2-025). The new total contract amount of Contract No.
0617 is $60,621,887.86.
This Contract Modification is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the
CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

The Motion to adopt resolution for Item B1 was seconded by Commissioner Amey and the
voting was as follows:
Ayes:
Martin Nesbitt

The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner Ivers then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Resolution for Item B2.
(Item B2)
The resolution for Item B2 ratifies Contract Modification with Friedler Construction Company
for additional work related to the renovation of Dearborn Homes, Phase 1. The contract
modification provides for installation of two valve vaults and 385 feet of ductile iron water pipe
to provide water service to 2920 and 2940 South State. The Contractor will also pressure test
and chlorinate said lines. This water service is required to provide water suitable for drinking as
well as washing, and it is also required to operate the boilers for heating the buildings. In
addition the Contractor will provide a step up transformer, a temporary building to enclose it,
conduit and additional services to provide temporary electric service to 2920 and 2940 South
State Street. This work is needed to provide a "bridge" source of electricity for the buildings for
tenant use, while permanent service is built for the entire Dearborn complex over the next year,
and electricity is required to operate common area requirements for the buildings, including
water pumps, elevators, control systems, emergency lighting, and security systems. During the
review of this Contract Modification, staff determined that this work needed to be started as
quickly as possible because of its impact on the plan to begin moving residents into these
buildings in January of 2008. Friedler was already performing as the general contractor at
Dearborn Homes and was in position to start the work immediately.

 RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-4
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9, 2008
entitled “RATIFICATION OF MODIFICATION NO. G-03 TO CONTRACT
NO. 7043 WITH FRIEDLER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY FOR
ADDITIONAL WORK RELATED TO THE FAMILY HOUSING
RENOVATION OF DEARBORN HOMES (IL2-009) – PHASE 1”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners ratifies Contract Modification No. G-03 to Contract
No. 7043 with Friedler Construction Company in the not-to-exceed amount of
$496,171.00 for additional work related to the Family Housing renovation of
Dearborn Homes (IL2-009) – Phase 1 at 2920 and 2940 South State Street. The
new total contract amount of Contract No. 7043 is the not-to-exceed amount of
$18,564,033.00. This Contract Modification is subject to the Contractor’s
compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and
bonding and insurance requirements.

The Motion to adopt resolution for Item B2 was seconded by Commissioner Ponce and the
voting was as follows:

The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner Ivers then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Resolution for Item B3.
(Item B3)
The resolution for Item B3 awards contract to Friedler Construction Company in the amount of
$24,070,263.00 for the renovation of one hundred forty-six units and associated site work at
seventeen buildings within Frances Cabrini Homes, subject to the approval of HUD, if required.
All units are to be completed by June 21, 2009. The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) in
area newspapers and on the CHA website. Of the six bids received and opened, Friedler
Construction Company was the apparent low bidder. Based on the pre-award survey meeting
and submitted materials, it was determined that Friedler met the requirements of the IFB.
Friedler’s original Lump Sum Base Bid Total of $24,200,800.00 has been reduced by
$130,537.00, the amount of Deductive Alternate No. 1. This Deductive Alternate is for the cost
of the appliances needed during the renovation. A contract with an appliance manufacturer will
permit the CHA to purchase the needed appliances directly at a considerable savings over the
cost bid by Friedler. The adjusted Lump Sum Base Bid Total amount is $24,070,263.00. This
adjustment to the Lump Sum Base Bid Total did not impact the determination of the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-5
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9, 2008
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXECUTE A CONTRACT WITH FRIEDLER

 Company in the amount of $24,070,263.00 for the renovation of one hundred
forty-six (146) units and associated site work at seventeen (17) buildings within
Frances Cabrini Homes (IL2-002), a Family Housing development, subject to the
approval of the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, if
required. This work is to be completed by June 21, 2009.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance
requirements.

The Chairperson thereupon declared said Motion carried and said Resolution adopted.
Commissioner Ivers then introduced a Motion for the adoption of the Resolution for Item B4.
(Item B4)
The resolution for Item B4 approves the Non-Residential Premises Use and Lease Policy. The
purpose of the Policy is to establish parameters for, and authorize, the use of non-dwelling units
and/or properties for public safety and anti-drug activities, resident services and property
management purposes. The Policy also sets forth parameters for use or leasing of NonResidential Premises to third parties who seek to use such premises for social or charitable
services, including but not limited to, family support, health, early childhood development,
education, recreation activities, youth development, and economic self-sufficiency. The Policy
applies to both new leases and renewals, and requires persons interested in leasing the premises
(or in renewing their leases) to submit applications and documentation. The Policy authorizes
the Chief Executive Officer, or its designee, to enter into non-dwelling leases on behalf of the
CHA that are in substantial compliance with the Policy. This authority extends to premises that
are currently available for non-residential use as of the date of adoption of the Policy, as well as
to premises that are hereafter approved for non-dwelling purposes by the Board (and if required,
by HUD). Licenses or other non-residential use agreements may also be used where appropriate,
provided that the parameters of such use agreements do not exceed those set forth in the Policy
for leases. Non-residential leases that fall outside the parameters established by this resolution
would require further Board approval under the Significant Actions Policy.
The Policy
authorizes a range of rents from $100 per month to fair market rent.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-6
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9,
2008, entitled “Recommendation to approve the Non-Residential Premises Use
and Lease Policy and to authorize entry into non-residential lease or other use
agreements in accordance with such Policy”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the Non-Residential Premises Use
and Lease Policy.

THAT,

the Non-Residential Premises Use and Lease Policy approved hereby supersedes
the policy adopted on December 18, 2001, as Resolution No. 2001-CHA-201, and
any and all conflicting language found in prior CHA policies pertaining to the
lease of non-residential spaces.

5

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer
or their respective designee to enter in non-residential leases, licenses or other use
agreements on behalf of the Chicago Housing Authority with respect to units or
premises available for non-dwelling use as of the date hereof, or hereafter
approved for non-dwelling purposes, provided that such leases, licenses or other
use agreements are in substantial compliance with the Non-Residential Premises
Use and Lease Policy approved hereby.

Commissioner Young then introduced an Omnibus Motion for the adoption of Resolutions for
Items C1 thru C4 discussed, voted and recommended for Board approval by the Tenant Services

(Item C1)
In October 2003, the Board authorized the CHA to negotiate and enter into a contract with
Brinshore-Michaels and/or BMT-I, LLC, the master developer for the Robert Taylor Homes to
provide Community and Supportive Services (CSS) to residents relocating to the Robert Taylor
mixed income community. In January 2007, the board authorized the CHA to exercise the third
one-year extension of the Contract, (the first of the new option periods authorized in February
2006) for the term of February 12, 2007 to February 11, 2008. The authorization of this one-year
option period and the additional funding is necessary to allow BMT-1, LLC to provide postoccupancy CSS to the 83 families who moved into the redeveloped Robert Taylor community in
FY2007 as well as approximately 500 families being screened for move-in at Taylor Phase C-2
in 2008. Based upon the availability of funding and BMT-1, LLC’s performance of the Contract
to date, the CHA desires to extend the Contract for a fourth year. Accordingly, the resolution for
Item C1 approves contract extension with BMT-1, LLC. BMT-1, LLC has met its contract
obligations and remains committed to servicing residents eligible to return to the Robert Taylor
mixed-income community to continue community and supportive services to families for up to
two years following the occupancy of units.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-7
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9,

Taylor mixed income community, and to increase the Contract’s funding by an
amount not-to-exceed $440,000.00 adding it to the carryover balance available at
the end of the current contract term. The Contract’s new aggregate total not-toexceed contract amount will be $2,601,416.00.

(Item C2)
In July 2002, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into an Agreement with Holsten for the
redevelopment of Hilliard Homes Phase I and II, including the Hilliard Family Buildings and the
Hilliard Senior Buildings. In March 2005, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into a twoyear Agreement with Holsten to provide CSS to Hilliard families in the amount of $800,000.00.
In April 2007, the Board authorized a one-year extension in the amount of $227,000.00. Holsten
has met its contractual obligations under the agreement, and is currently providing postoccupancy case management and community services to the 306 families residing at Hilliard.
The leasing phase for Hilliard was completed in December 2007, and the CHA has agreed to
provide one-year of post-occupancy services to Hilliard families. In order to fulfill its
commitment to provide one-year of post-occupancy services, the resolution for Item C2 approves
a contract extension with Holsten for an additional one-year term.
RESOLUTION NO. 2008-CHA-8
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated January 9,
2008, entitled "AUTHORIZATION TO EXTEND CONTRACT NO. 5093 WITH

Real Estate Development Corporation for the period of February 6, 2008 through

current contract term to continue providing community and supportive services to
CHA residents residing in Hilliard Homes. The Contract’s new aggregate total
not-to-exceed contract amount will be $1,254,000.00.

(Item C3)
In June 2005, the Board authorized the CHA to enter into a contract for redevelopment of
Cabrini Green Extension North with Parkside Associates, LLC. Parkside Associates is
responsible for the overall redevelopment process of Parkside and is also responsible for
preparing funding applications, obtaining financing, construction, and the coordination of
community and supportive services (CSS). In November 2005, the Board authorized the CHA to
negotiate and enter into a one-year contract with two one-year options with Holsten to provide
CSS for Cabrini Green residents desiring to move into Parkside. In March 2007, the Board
authorized the exercise of the first one-year option for the period of April 1, 2007 through March
31, 2008, continuing the provision of CSS to assist CHA families that have chosen to return to
Parkside. The resolution for Item C3 approves the second one-year option with Holsten to
continue providing CSS services to Cabrini Parkside families. Case management services have
been specifically designed to address site specific criteria and the barriers a family may face in
meeting the criteria allowing them to return to the Parkside development.
