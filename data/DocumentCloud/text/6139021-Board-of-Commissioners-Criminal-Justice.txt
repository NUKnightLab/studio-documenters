PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION CALLING ON PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD J. TRUMP TO SEND
FEDERAL RESOURCES TO FIGHT VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO
WHEREAS, at least 762 people were murdered in Chicago in 2016, which is nearly 300 more people
than were killed in all of 2015; and
WHEREAS, more than 4,300 people were shot in Chicago in 2016, which is about 1,400 more shooting
victims than in all of 2015; and
WHEREAS, Chicago had more people killed by gun violence in 2016 than New York and Los Angeles
combined; and
WHEREAS, minorities are most often the victims of the rising violence in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, the incoming presidential administration has indicated that it will send additional federal
resources to combat violence if leaders here request them; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government must be proactive in its anti-violence efforts by initiating the
dialogue with the incoming presidential administration to develop strategies and request the needed
resources to help tackle the epidemic of violence; and
WHEREAS, those resources should come in the form of economic investment in endangered
communities; and
WHEREAS, the federal government can assist Chicago police by utilizing federal law enforcement
officers to help local officers in curbing the violence and solving more homicides; and

 WHEREAS, it is vital that elected officials in their leadership capacities provide the crucial moral and
public support to law enforcement officials as they undertake the difficult and dangerous task of
combating the epidemic of violence; and
WHEREAS, these measures will have an immediate and significant impact on reducing the violence in
Chicago without utilizing the National Guard; and
WHEREAS, the issue of violence is not a political one, and every citizen of Chicago and Cook County
should have a right to be safe in their neighborhoods and live without fear of being shot and killed; and
WHEREAS, elected officials must make every effort to fight the violence in Chicago to prevent 2017
from seeing even more people killed.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Commissioners and President of the Board
that this Resolution serve as a formal request to President-elect Donald Trump to provide additional
