Re:

Discussion Draft: FY 2019 & FY 2020 Biennial Budget
and Five-Year Plan (FY 2019 thru FY 2022)

From: Nicolette N. Bateson, CPA, Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer

Background: The annual financial planning cycle has three key workstreams that are highly
interdependent: 1) preparing a budget and financial plan, 2) preparing a capital improvement
plan, and 3) developing customer charges. Contractual commitments to customers to provide
a notification of proposed charges defines a key target date that falls in late January. This year
that date is January 25, 2018.
The status of each key workstream is below.

1. Budget & Financial Plan: Discussion draft presented today for Audit Committee review.
Similar (but condensed) material will be presented to the entire GLWA Board at a
regular meeting next Wednesday, January 10, 2017 and to the customer community
next week at an annual “Charges Rollout #3 - Budget” meeting on Thursday, January 11,
2017. Staff considers the substance of the budget to be largely complete as a
“proposed” budget, pending any material requests from stakeholders and the impact of
the other two workstreams.
2. Capital Improvement Plan (CIP): This is in process. Last month, a sewer system CIP
presentation was given to the Board CIP Committee and to customers at an annual
“Charges Rollout #2 – CIP” meeting. The focus in January is on the water system CIP.
For purposes of the budget and financial plan, estimates have been utilized which we
believe to be appropriate proxies for the final CIP based on what we know to date.

3. Charges: This week the GLWA proposed budget and financial plan was “handed off” to
The Foster Group (TFG) to begin analysis that will result in proposed charges by the end

Page 5

 of the month. TFG is presenting a status report on charge development considerations
at today’s meeting.

Analysis: Headline news for our organization: for the first time as a new entity, we now have
twelve months of actual from our first full year of operations which ended June 30, 2017. This
data provides a springboard for better understanding and benchmarking the budget for the
current and future years. Due to the expanded need to present FY 2017 through FY 2018, we
have utilized 11 x 17 worksheets which are in an accompanying file. The more extensive fiveyear plan document will be compiled over the next few weeks.
Noteworthy items and topics for discussion as we proceed with the review of the materials
today include the following.
1. Proposed Overall Budget Adjustment: Keeping within the 4% commitment, a 2%
increase is proposed for FY 2019. Subsequent years are proposed at 4% driven by
capital needs, investment in technology, and targeted maintenance projects.

Achieving 2% was not easy. The operating units were initially asked to review their
expenses (and revenue opportunities) with a goal of a 0% increase. Two areas that are
newer, System Planning and Information Technology, also had the highest level of
increase in budgetary requests as they have been asked to establish new programs and
initiatives. Both areas, in addition to many other GLWA areas, scaled back staffing and
other requests to achieve the more realistic 2%. More information on the affected
areas is attached. Please note that the enclosed personnel worksheet is being updated
because of the budget reductions (the cells are highlighted in gray). A new worksheet
will be presented at the Audit Committee meeting

2. Likely Deferral of Borrowing until FY 2020: Based on cumulative optimization savings,
timing of capital project phases, and current cash balances, it appears that GLWA will be
able to not need to issue new bonds (other maximizing than State or Drinking Water
Revolving Fund Loans) for two entire fiscal years. That is a historic departure from prior
financial trends. It should be noted however, that we continue to monitor refunding
opportunities as well as the borrowing needs for DWSD. Those circumstances could
cause a shift in the plan but likely a lower level of borrowing.

3. Continuous Improvement in Cost Allocation: In December 2017, the Audit Committee
received a presentation that indicates that the nature of centralized and administrative
services would result in an increase to water operations. We suggest that it is
premature to shift the entire six to seven percent in one year as the data set is limited to
one year. Instead we have a proposed a budget with a three-year phasing of that

Page 6

 amount with the cost allocation being updated and revisited on an annual basis. This
approach also aligns with the Charges Stability Initiatives presented to stakeholders
earlier this year.

4. Policy Considerations: With the maturing of our financial operations, we can now focus
on financial policies that are supportable by data and analysis. One key area is defining
a target for net position (largely cash less payables) in the a) Improvement & Extension
Funds (I&E) and b) Construction Bond Funds. A demonstration of the following polices
is presented in the budget worksheet.
Policy proposal for Improvement & Extension Funds: Net Position sufficient to fund
the five-year capital plan commitments with a minimum ending balance equal to 1.75
times subsequent year needs but no less than $50 million.
The intent of the 1.75 is to ensure that the entity does not count on utilizing funds from
current year charges which may not be realizable or align with cash flow needs (reduces
risk) while maintaining a minimal balance. A minimum of $50 million may be low based
on the five-year plan, however we do not have a history (due to our short existence) of
actual to support a higher minimum. It is also recommended that any policy that we
establish should be revisited bi-annually to evaluate its effectiveness. As we review the
five-year plan, the significance of applying this policy and the use of I&E to lower
borrowing will highlighted.
Policy proposal for Construction Bond Funds: A Net Position no lower than six months
of subsequent twelve months projected spend calculated on a rolling monthly basis.
The intent of the policy is to introduce discipline to proactively manage GLWA’s
borrowing needs. With regular cash flow forecasting for capital projects (a new model is
being rolled out this month), the need for capital will be evident in advance of six
months. Six months was selected for the policy, however, to ensure that parties
consider the time to prepare for a transaction as well as to be prepared to execute a
transaction at the right time. Further, this will prevent over-borrowing (reduce debt
service) and optimize the planned use of I&E Funds.

5. Assumptions and Estimates: The preparation of this plan is dependent on our best
knowledge at the time and our ability to control the outcome of those items (the less
control we have, the more conservative the estimate). Assumptions and estimates
include the following.

Page 7

 a. Status quo in shared services with DWSD with one potential exception (increase
in analytical lab testing provided by GLWA).

b. DWSD budget and CIP development are underway. There are no known impacts
to GLWA.
c. No change in the budget related to ongoing implementation matters (including
water sales to GLWA by DWSD, operational and capital responsibility for certain
24-inch mains in the City of Detroit, finalization of debt allocation, treatment of
partial lease payment advanced, and any other related matters).
d. No change in operating or capital investment responsibility for the Northeast
Pump Station although an alternative operating agreement is being explored.

6. Operations & Maintenance Budget by Area and Group Analysis: The Financial Planning
& Analysis Team has drafted an 11 +/- page analytical review of the “Operations &
Maintenance Budget by Area and Groups” worksheet. That document is presently being
reviewed internally and will be distributed on Monday, January 8, 2018 with materials
for the Board meeting next week. It is anticipated that the Audit Committee meeting on
Friday, January 19, 2018 will serve as a venue to address budget and financial plan
questions and requests.

Proposed Action: Receive and file report.

Re:

Status Update- 2017 Wholesale Water Contract Reopeners

From: Jon Wheatley, Public Finance Manager

Background: The Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) model water contract provides for
designated reopener dates in year 2, year 5 and every 5 years afterwards, until the end of the
30 year term of the contract. As part of the reopener process, each customer has the
opportunity to discuss its maximum day and peak hour demands, which are included in Exhibit
B of the contract, and negotiate those values based on historical performance and projected
changes in its usage. The maximum day and peak hour demands in the model contract are
used in the determination of customer charges and represent about ninety percent (90%) of the
annual revenue requirement for each customer.
The GLWA water contract negotiation team is in the midst of reopener negotiations with 31 of its
78 model contract customers. The list of wholesale water customers scheduled for contract
reopeners is set forth in the table below.
Analysis: Between October 9 and December 13, 2017, the team met with 29 of the 30
scheduled reopeners plus one out-of-sequence reopener (Commerce Township). As of January
2, 2018, 30 contract amendments have been drafted and sent to the customer for its local
approval, of which 22 have been approved by the customer’s legislative body and 8 are on
agendas for approval before the deadline of January 12, 2018. Once the contract amendments
are approved by the customer and returned to GLWA, the contract will come before the GLWA
Board of Directors for approval.
Budget Impact: None.
Proposed Action: Receive and File Report.

NOTE: This count does not include separated, retired or inactive status.

Proposed Biennial Budget Analysis:
1. The following factors are driving the 5.8% increase in FY18 vs FY19 analysis:
- The FY 2018 budget does not reflect a pending budget amendment for FY 2018 approved merit increases, wage adjustments & staff promotions. Since the FY 2019 budgeted salaries are based on the actual current salary,
adjustments in salaries will show as increases with year over year analysis.
*Merit increase, assuming an 3% average increase. IMPACT: ~$1.8M INCREASE
*Other merit increases and promotions in FY18. IMPACT: $193K INCREASE
- Addition of new positions for FY 2019
*4 positions in Risk & Safety Management. IMPACT: $270k INCREASE
*7 positions in Water Systems Operations cost centers. IMPACT: $956k INCREASE
*13 positions in the Administrative and Other Services cost centers. IMPACT: ~$192k INCREASE
- Budgeting for a position in FY19 that was unbudgeted in FY18
*6 positions in the IT cost centers. IMPACT: $446k INCREASE
*General Counsel position not budgeted in FY2018. IMPACT: $150k INCREASE
2. The following factors are driving the 3.6% increase in FY19 vs FY20 analysis:
- Addition of new positions
*18 positions have been added to the IT cost centers. IMPACT: $1.8M INCREASE
*3 positions adding Org Dev cost center. IMPACT: $238k INCREASE
- Positions with partial year budgets in FY19 and full year budgets in FY20
*There are 22 positions that meet this criteria. IMPACT: ~$359k INCREASE

3. These positions reflect most of the cuts. There are still an estimated $618K in salary & wages cuts to be entered into BS&A by once the data entry freeze has been lifted.

MEMORANDUM
FY 2019 Charges Development
To:

January 4, 2018

Nicolette Bateson

From: Bart Foster
You have asked for a brief update on the development of recommended FY 2019 water and
sewer charges. With receipt of the preliminary proposed budget this week, we have all of the data
necessary to complete our analyses and recommendations over the next few weeks. We are
confident that we will be able to present proposed charges the Board of Directors on January 24,
and to Customers on January 25, as anticipated by the published schedule.
Our analyses in the coming weeks will include specific focus on the following topics:
• Evaluation of the preliminary five year financial plans in the preliminary budget, including
the overall revenue requirement increases, the proposed policy considerations, and the
adequacy to responsibly address capital and operating program requirements;
• Detailed review of the operating expense budget, and establishment of appropriate allocation
of operating costs to cost pools, including:
o Recognition of the administrative and centralized services cost allocation plan;
o Review of costs assignable to specific cost pools, such as CSO and OMID only.
• Incorporation of information from the new fixed asset inventory and valuation analysis into
capital revenue requirement cost of service allocations;
• Incorporation of the updated Water units of service into cost of service allocations, including:
o Results of the Units of Service (“UoS”) study for non-master metered customers and
GLWA Administration implementation plan of same;
o Updated customer demands from the contract re-opener negotiations;
o Results of the master meter inventory update, into cost of service allocations.
• Direct recognition of Flint and Highland Park in the water charges calculations, and
elimination of GCDC from the charge calculations;
• Development of phase 2 of the implementation plan for the FY 2018 Sewer SHAREs;
• Evaluation of customer collection performance and its impact on water and sewer charge
strategies;
• Review and incorporation of DWSD Local System revenue requirements.
We look forward to rolling out updates on the results of our analyses to the Audit Committee on
January 5 and 19, to the full Board on January 10 and 24, and to Customers at formal roll out
meetings on January 11 and 25.
