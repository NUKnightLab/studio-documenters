 GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Improvement Program, the Chicago Housing Authority executed Contract
No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux, Contract No. 9049 with Holabird and Root and Contract
No. 9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation. The aggregate value of these contracts is
an amount not-to-exceed $6,000,000.00. These Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (“IDIQ”)
task order contracts are to provide PDC services on an “as needed” basis. The PDC services
include Assessments, Design, Engineering, Construction Documents, Construction
Administration and Close-out services for a period of three (3) years beginning July 1, 2009
through June 30, 2012. The PDC services are performed as needed at Family, Senior, Scattered
Sites and Non-dwelling properties.
In February 2008, a task order contract was awarded for the performance of PDC services for the
Capital Maintenance Program. The term of the agreement with that PDC (hereinafter, the
“Capital Maintenance PDC”) was from March 1, 2008 through February 28, 2011. In September
of 2009, the Capital Maintenance PDC ceased its operations in Chicago, and the Capital
Construction Department (“CCD”) resolved all open items under its agreement.
To meet the CHA’s commitments under the Voluntary Compliance Agreement and
Memorandum of Understanding (“VCA/MOU”) with the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, it was necessary for the CCD to re-assign the majority of the Capital
Maintenance PDC’s projects to Harley Ellis Devereaux, Holabird & Root and Globetrotters
Engineering Corporation (the “IDIQ PDCs”). In first quarter of 2010, $3,200,000.00 of the
aggregate value of the IDIQ PDCs’ contracts has been allocated to the projects originally
intended for the Capital Maintenance PDC. Funding for these three (3) contracts cannot continue
to be used for work expected to be performed by the Capital Maintenance PDC without having a
significant negative impact on the ability of CCD to assign other vital design work to these firms.
To compensate for this impact, it is recommended that the remaining funding from the not-toexceed amount in the Capital Maintenance PDC’s contract be reallocated to the current IDIQ
PDCs. This amount is $3,545,693.56, and it would be distributed in the same percentages used to
allocate the $6,000,000.00 among the base contracts of the IDIQ PDCs.
Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to approve three Amendments to add
funding for PDC services to the following contracts: (1) Contract No. 9048 with Harley Ellis
Devereaux in an amount not-to-exceed $1,240,992.75 – for a new total contract value not-toexceed $3,340,992.75; (2) Contract No. 9049 with Holabird & Root in an amount not-to-exceed
$1,181,897.85 – for a new total contract value not-to-exceed $3,181,897.85; and (3) Contract No.
9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation in an amount not-to-exceed $1,122,802.96 –
for a new total contract value of $3,022,802.96. The aggregate increase to the three (3) contracts
is an amount not-to-exceed $3,545,693.56. The term of the contracts will remain unchanged.
Each Amendment is subject to the Contractor’s continued compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 resident hiring, and bonding and insurance requirements.
