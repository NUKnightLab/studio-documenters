1.

George Blakemore

Concerned Citizen

In response to comments made by Mr. Blakemore, in which he stated that, of the four Director positions whose
terms have expired and are up for the nomination process, one of them is held by Director Gugenheim and the
other three positions are currently held by Hispanics, Board Chairman Carvalho raised a point of personal
privilege. He stated that, with regard to his ethnicity, it is a common error to assume he is Hispanic; he stated that,
if he were Hispanic he would richly embrace it, but his ethnicity is of Portuguese, Italian and German origins.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, presented her report, which included information on the following
subjects: Comparison of Vacancies Filled - FY2013-FY2014; Positions Posted Through 6/30/14; FY2014 Posting
Activity; FY2014 Separations and Vacancies Filled; 2014 Processing of House Staff; CCHHS Labor Relations –
Labor Management Committee. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the presentation, Ms. Lopez noted that the title of slide four should be “Vacancies Addressed by Postings.”
During the discussion regarding filling vacancies, Board Chairman Carvalho stated that it is worth pointing out
that the System is not on auto-pilot, filling any vacancy just because the position is vacant. The right measure of
activity is not how many vacancies are filled; rather, it is how many vacancies were needed to be filled and how
many of those vacancies were filled. The administration is being strategic in filling vacancies; if the census is
down in an area or needs are located in a different area, the administration is not just filling a vacancy because
someone has left the organization or retired. Ms. Lopez concurred; she stated that, not only does the
administration determine the current needs, but they determine what the needs will be for the next three years –
what is the industry looking for, what are the competencies, minimum requirements, etc.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
During the update on Labor Relations, Ms. Lopez stated that she attended a negotiation session with SEIU
yesterday morning. One proposal currently being discussed is to consolidate three of the SEIU Local contracts
that cover Healthcare Professionals, Technicians and Technologists. Over the next three weeks, Ms. Lopez and
her staff will literally compare each of the three Collective Bargaining Agreements side-by-side, to look at all of
the provisions and then identify what is going to be in the best interests of the organization. She acknowledged
that Technologists and Professionals have different requirements. The administration wants to make sure that
they carve out appropriate caveats for those different professions, but she believes that consolidating the three
agreements will simplify matters, especially for managers who have to refer to more than one of these contracts
when managing their employees.
In response to Board Chairman Carvalho’s question regarding whether purely everything would be in one
document, and whether there would be the ability to handle jurisdictional issues, Ms. Lopez responded that it is
the administration’s goal to identify 1) what is needed as an organization; 2) what do the managers need to
simplify this; and 3) what is SEIU proposing. The administration has asked for three weeks to review all three
contracts; she noted that SEIU has already provided a template of a side-by-side comparison, but the
administration wants to look at it, as well. There are some provisions that are just the same in all the contracts those will be easy to agree to; as far as any differences in provisions, there are two meetings scheduled later in
August to discuss differences that are found or determined.
Ms. Lopez provided an update on nurse recruitment. She stated that, with regard to nurse recruitment for Cermak
Health Services, they are working with Employee Health Services to expand their opportunities for processing;
the System should be positioned to on-board six new nurses and one new patient care attendant at Cermak by July
28th. She noted that she did not currently have this information, but she will follow-up on the previous request
regarding the number of nurse vacancies that have been filled this year. Dr. Shannon added that there will be an
update on nursing provided as a Board Education item at the upcoming Board Meeting on July 25th.
Dr. Shannon provided additional information regarding recent activities involving the Labor Management Council
(LMC). He stated that, from the management side, the question regarding membership has been resolved – all of
the senior executives who have responsibility for approximately 90% of unionized labor members are included in
the LMC. With regard to membership on the labor side, Dr. Shannon stated that there is a facilitator assisting
with the issue, who is a labor management expert and consultant from Cornell University in New York City; that
facilitator is working with union leadership to try to determine membership for the unions.
Additionally, with regard to posting of vacancies, Dr. Shannon provided information that explained the critical
difference between internal and external postings. He stated that many people may not be aware that when the
System posts a position internally, the internal posting is only for the members of that particular union – it is not
an internal posting for all System employees. Once the position is posted externally, that position is able to be
seen by the rest of the world and by any System staff who are not a member of the union associated with that job
code. One of the questions that has been raised is - shouldn’t the System be trying to fill those positions with
internal staff before it begins searching outside of the organization? There have been discussions regarding the
challenges associated with that, as it relates to the time lag that exists; there is a group that is still having that
conversation, but it is just one of those wrinkles that comes up in the context of these meetings.
