NOACA Transit Council

FROM:

Kathleen Sarli, Director of Planning

DATE:

November 8, 2019

RE:

Project Planning Review (PPR)/ Intergovernmental Review and Consultation (IGRC);
3rd Quarter State Fiscal Year 2020

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and presentation.
BACKGROUND/JUSTIFICATION
Attached are PPR summary documents for the proposed project to be presented to the NOACA
Transportation Subcommittee, Planning and Programming Committee and Executive Committee for review
and recommendation.
NOACA’s Board approved Regional Transportation Investment Policy requires that all proposed federal-aid
transportation projects be processed through PPR in order to meet NOACA’s adopted goals and federal
requirements.
PPR consists of four levels of review: NOACA staff; Board, including committees, subcommittees, and
Councils; intergovernmental review and consultation (IGRC); and public involvement. The end product of
PPR is a Board resolution that certifies that the project has had thorough review, allowing the project to
proceed to the programming stages of the planning process.
As part of the PPR process, a detailed summary of the proposed improvement and staff and committee
assessment of the project are posted on NOACA’s website, www.NOACA.org. A link to the PPR is included
on the home page by clicking the ‘Comment on Projects’ button. Staff adds comments obtained from the
public, governmental organizations and NOACA committees as they are received. Proposed projects are
posted on the website for three months, allowing adequate time for review and comment.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
CONCLUSION/NEXT STEPS
Pending Board approval, the project sponsor will be notified that their project has completed PPR. NOACA
staff will work with the project sponsor to address any planning issues identified during PPR.

Attachments: Project Summary

Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Title: Improvements along Cleveland Avenue in Elyria
Sponsor: City of Elyria
Estimated Total Cost: $7,206,891
Proposed Source of Federal Funds: ODOT and NOACA
History/Background: The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) Safety program provides
funds to ODOT and local governments for highway safety treatments or corrective activity
designed to alleviate a safety problem or a potentially hazardous situation. The program is
funded at approximately $100 million annually. Priority is given to those projects with
recommended activities/countermeasures that improve safety at roadway locations with a high
frequency, severity, and rate of crashes.
There are two application cycles per year. Applications must be signed off by the respective
ODOT District Safety Review Team. A safety engineering study must typically accompany the
application unless the application is for preliminary engineering funds to complete the study.
The following project was selected for Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funding.
The NOACA Board of Directors adopted Resolution 2019-045 approving the projects to be
funded with NOACA administered Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funding and
STBG set-asides for Transportation Alternatives Projects (TAP) for the state fiscal year (SFY)
2021 – 2024 Transportation Improvement Program. The projects recommended for NOACA
funding included rehabilitation of Cleveland Street, in the City of Elyria.
Proposed Project: LOR CR-658 - 00.00 (CLEVELAND ST): PID No. 110986 - This project
involves rehabilitation along Cleveland Street, from East Bridge Street and Gulf Road to
Hawthorne Street in Elyria (maps and illustrations). The work will include full and partial depth
pavement repair, resurfacing, replacement of curbs, deteriorated culverts and roadway drainage
catch basins, and installation of a roadway underdrain system and conduit. The City will also
implement a road diet, reducing the number of lanes along Cleveland Avenue, from four (4)
through lanes to three (3) lanes (one lane in each direction and a center turn lane).
According to the sponsor, the number of curb cuts will be minimized, access point locations will
be controlled and bicycle lanes will be possible. The project will also include crosswalks, ADA
(Americans with Disabilities) ramps, intersection improvements, new sidewalk, lighting and the
creation of bicycle lanes. The project will also include pavement markings, signage and the
replacement of the traffic signal at the intersection of Olive Street and possibly Gulf Road. Traffic
calming measures will also be considered with the project including curb bump-outs and
contrasting pavements. The project will also involve improvements to the intersection at East
Bridge Street/Cleveland Street with four-leg non-circular roundabout.
The STBG funding is dedicated to the roadway rehabilitation component of the project. The HSIP
funding is dedicated to the road diet and roundabout components of the project.
The project’s estimated total cost is $7,206,891. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
preliminary development (PEPD) is $352,952. The estimated cost of preliminary engineering
detailed design (PEDD) is $173,842. The estimated cost of right-of-way (RW) is $300,000. The
PEPD, PEDD and RW will be funded with HSIP funds ($744,115) and local funds ($82,679). The
estimated cost of construction (CO) is $5,900,097. The CO will be funded with STBG funds
($3,329,686), HSIP funds ($1,255,885) and local funds ($1,314,527). The estimated cost of
construction engineering (CE) is $480,000. The CE will be locally funded.

5-3

 Staff Comment (Summary):
RECOMMENDATION:
o A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as wide
sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through the roundabout
intersection.
o Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in addition to
the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing pavement type tends to fade
over time, and ladder-style markings would maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility
crosswalk. (Example: see West 25th Street and Detroit Avenue intersection crosswalks).
o Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to improve the
safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are an FHWA Proven
Safety Countermeasure.
o The work summarized in this PPR will occur within two subwatersheds: 1) Black River
Mainstem and Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River. According to Ohio EPA’s 2018
Integrated Report (IR) Watershed Assessment Unit (WAU) summary, sampling results
along the Black River Mainstems subwatershed indicate that the river is in full and partial
attainment of its Aquatic Life Uses (ALUs). The WAU lists the causes of impairment as
due to nutrients and conductivity modifications associated with municipal point source
discharges. According to the 2018 IR WAUs, the Jackson Ditch-East Branch Black River
subwatershed's sampling sites are in full, partial and nonattainment due to
sedimentation/siltation due to natural causes (Black River falls) NOACA staff
recommends that ODOT maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to
keep nonpoint source pollutants from reaching the Black River. NOACA staff also
recommends that ODOT consider incorporating habitat restoration along the river
wherever possible.

DATE:

November 8, 2019

RE:

Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Update

ACTION REQUESTED
No action is requested at this time. This item is included for information and discussion only.
BACKGROUND
NOACA's Transportation for Livable Communities Initiative (TLCI) Program provides assistance to
communities for integrated transportation and land use planning and projects that strengthen community
livability. TLCI advances the goals of NOACA’s Regional Strategic Plan by:
• Developing transportation projects that provide more travel options
• Promoting reinvestment in underutilized or vacant/abandoned properties
• Supporting economic development
• Ensuring that the benefits of growth and change are available to all members of a community
• Enhancing regional cohesion
• Providing people with safe and reliable transportation choices
The TLCI Program has two components: The TLCI Planning Studies Program and the TLCI Implementation
Program. The TLCI Planning Studies Program assists communities to develop transportation planning studies
that facilitate and promote sustainable development, multimodal transportation, and complete and green
streets. The TLCI Implementation Program provides funding assistance for communities to implement priority
projects identified in TLCI or TLCI-like community developed plans.
An application round was opened for both planning studies and implementation projects on August 29, 2019.
On October 11, 2019, NOACA received 23 requests for funding: 7 planning study requests totaling about $1.1
million in funding and 16 implementation project requests totaling about $4.8 million in funding. All requests
are being evaluated based on the criteria established in the TLCI Policy. Projects requested for both the
planning studies and implementation projects are attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is $2 million in available funding for the 2020 TLCI program. The TLCI program is funded by an annual
set aside from NOACA’s Surface Transportation Block Grant (STBG) funds during the development of
NOACA’s annual Overall Work Program and biennial Transportation Improvement Program.
