Report from Chief of Human Resources (Attachment #1)
September 2015 Semi-Annual Report on the Employment Plan (Attachment #2)
Gladys Lopez, Chief of Human Resources, provided an overview of the Report from the Chief of Human
Resources, which included information on the following subjects:
Comparison of Vacancies Filled;
FY2015 Finance Sub-Activity;
Internal and External Vacancies Filled;
Hiring Waterfall and Snapshot through 9/30/15;
Licensed Nurse Vacancies Filled through 9/30/15;
FY2015 Separations and Hires;
CCHHS Turnover through 9/30/15;
CCHHS FY2015 Turnover by New Hires; and
FY2015 HR Goal: Improve/Reduce Average Time to Hire.
With regard to the information on Slide 2 of the presentation, Director Junge inquired as to what kind of
physicians are needed for the open positions. Ms. Lopez responded that she will provide that information. On the
subject of physician recruitment and hiring, she noted that a physician liaison was recently hired. This person will
work directly with the office of the Executive Medical Director, will be the conduit to help streamline some
processes and coordinate between the Human Resources Department and credentialing, and will also follow up
with the physicians.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
The Committee discussed the subject of the recent insourcing of a number of positions in the Finance Department.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired whether there is a method used to track whether or not savings are incurred
as a consequence of the insourcing; additionally, she asked whether there is a correlation between the insourcing
and added positions in the Finance Department and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Mr. Elwell responded that he
will provide information on the savings expected as a result of the insourcing, which he believes will be in the
amount of approximately $5 million. With regard to whether there is a correlation between the additional
positions/insourcing and the ACA, he stated that some of the additional positions, including pre-registration and
patient support center staff, are directly related to the ACA. With regard to the MANG Unit, a decision was made
to move to “one-stop shopping” for patients needing assistance with determining eligibility for various programs –
CCHHS used to have outside contractors and some of its own employees performing this function, and sometimes
a patient had to go to three (3) different people before they found a program for which they might qualify.
Director Richardson-Lowry indicated that, for public consumption purposes, when the administration takes in that
many new staff, the basis for that kind of large shift in internal staffing should be made a part of the record.
Director Richardson-Lowry inquired regarding training for newly hired nurses; with respect to existing nursing
staff, she asked whether the labor agreement includes a provision that requires ongoing training. Ms. Lopez
stated that the Executive Director of Nursing, Agnes Therady, has a team of nurses who manage the orientation of
nurses. She believes that they go through an extensive training period of perhaps six (6) to twelve (12) weeks,
depending on the unit. She was unsure whether there is a requirement in the Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA) for ongoing training, but noted that nurses are the only group in the organization who receive 100% tuition
reimbursement. She indicated that she will follow up with Ms. Therady regarding these questions.
Chairman Wiese requested that data comparing last year’s discharges to this year’s be provided. Ms. Lopez
responded that this can be provided in next month’s report.
Ms. Lopez provided additional information regarding Cermak separations (referred to on Slide 5). She stated that
the total number of separations as of September 30th is 55; through this time last year, there was a total of 34
separations at Cermak. For purposes of comparison, Cermak’s total number of approved vacancies was 578 in
FY2014; in FY2015 that number is 617. Ms. Lopez noted that managers at Cermak are identifying earlier on in
the process if candidates are going to be successful in their roles, so there is a higher number of separations within
the probationary period. Additionally, she stated that candidates often use Cermak as a way to get into the Stroger
Campus. The candidate applies and gets hired at Cermak quicker because there are fewer vacancies; after they
work at Cermak for six (6) months, they can transfer out to another position in CCHHS. Director Collens
inquired regarding the vacancy rate at Cermak, as compared to the rest of CCHHS. Ms. Lopez responded that she
will provide that information.
With regard to the subject of candidates using Cermak as a gateway to other positions in the System, Ms. Lopez
stated that the CBA contains a provision that allows the transfer to another position in CCHHS after six (6)
months. During negotiations, the administration reached out to representatives of the National Nurses Organizing
Committee (NNOC) to see if an agreement could be reached to have nurses stay at Cermak for at least one (1)
year before they transfer; NNOC was not willing to sign off on that change. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief
Executive Officer, stated that, on one hand, when recruiting for positions at Cermak, it would be ideal if the
administration could find candidates who had a burning passion to work with correctional populations; efforts are
made to identify candidates with that mission alignment. On the other hand, he wants this to be an organization
that fosters opportunities for professional development for anybody within the System.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
Director Collens inquired whether a premium is paid to nurses who work at Cermak. Ms. Lopez responded that
an extra dollar per hour was negotiated; that increase will go into effect with the new contract. Lilianna Kalin,
Labor/Employment Counsel, provided additional information regarding the negotiations. She stated that higher
numbers were discussed with the union, but for budgetary reasons it was left at that amount. In preparation for
negotiations for the next contract, staff are now gathering proposals from management and meeting with them to
discuss what would be the best, most effective CBAs for the operational issues that exist. Director Collens stated
that he hopes further thought will be given to negotiating a higher premium for the nurses that work at Cermak.
Carrie Pramuk-Volk, Employment Plan Officer, presented the September 2015 Semi-Annual Report on the
Employment Plan (Attachment #2). The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the review of the Report on the Employment Plan, Ms. Pramuk-Volk stated that, after the initial training of
employees for the Employment Plan, should any employees have questions, they can reach out to her or to a staff
member of the Human Resources Department. The initial training is face-to-face; subsequent annual training is
expected to take place electronically. Once the initial training of all employees has taken place, Ms. Pramuk-Volk
will be working on implementing additional processes relating to the Plan. In response to a question from
Chairman Wiese regarding metrics for her area, she stated that she is currently working to develop those. She
indicated that there are additional amendments to the Employment Plan currently being drafted, regarding the
development of policies and procedures around discipline, transfers, reclassifications, promotions and overtime, as
well as those to help streamline the hiring process, as well.

Semi-Annual Report
September 2015
Dear Dr. Shannon, Inspector General Blanchard and Ms. Robinson:
This is the second semi-annual report issued pursuant to Section IV.C.2. of the Employment Plan (Plan)
filed on October 23, 2014 on the heels of the Plan’s anniversary. This report will cover the six (6) month
period from March 1 through August 31, 2015, describing any auditing activities, violations of the Plan,
recommended remedial actions and corrective action by Cook County Health and Hospitals System
(CCHHS) when necessary and as appropriate. Due to the nature of activity during the past six months,
this report will focus on staff training activities and touch on some of the trends or recurring issues
identified through the minimal monitoring during this time period. In addition, several investigations
were started and/or completed during this time frame with reports pending.
EMPLOYMENT PLAN STAFF
Much of the activity reported here, particularly the training efforts, would not have been possible without
the addition of initially two employees in March, then a third in June, to my team. Dr. Shannon believed
it was important to provide me with staff to sufficiently oversee and execute the provisions of the Plan for
an organization of this size. Each of my Employment Plan Analysts as legal training along with significant
group training and investigative experience to draw from as they assist me in my monitoring, training,
auditing and investigating duties. Although this summer the focus was on training, they will begin to
engage in more of the auditing and investigative/reporting functions required by my office.

TRAINING
My first semi-annual report explained that I would roll out face to face training in three (3) phases: Human
Resource (HR) training which consists of a three (3) part series totaling approximately eight (8) hours of
training; Supervisor/Interviewer training which consists of a two (2) part series totaling approximately 3.5
hours of training; and the Employee training which has a compliance piece as well as an overview of the
hiring process as required by the Plan that lasts approximately one (1) hour. In total, there were 206 face
to face training session held between March and August.
HR remains 100% in compliance with the training mandate of the Plan which includes a requirement that
each HR employee receive training within 90 days from his/her start date. During this reporting period, I
conducted four (4) face to face HR training sessions over a period of seven (7) days for new employees
and contractors in HR.
Interviewer/Supervisor training is a constant, ongoing effort as new supervisors or interviewers are
identified, hired, or promoted into non-union positions which require them to participate in the hiring
process. I have personally trained 492 employees to be eligible to make decisions in the hiring process
since last autumn, several of which no longer work for CCHHS. During this reporting period, I conducted
a total of 24 face to face Supervisor/Interviewer training sessions, with two sessions scheduled for each
month to capture newly hired, promoted or transferred employees who are now eligible for this training.
In addition to the continued efforts to conduct face to face trainings for HR and Supervising/Interviewing
employees, in May, I rolled out a massive training effort to ensure that all CCHHS employees received
training as required by the Plan. This training consisted of compliance training (information about the
Shakman Consent Decrees, Cook County Ordinances requiring mandatory reporting of suspected or
identified unlawful political discrimination and political contacts) as well as an overview of what is
required of HR, my office, and all staff, applicants and candidates during the hiring process. Between midMay and mid-August, my office trained approximately 5,500 employees during 150 face to face training
sessions held at all three of the main CCHHS campuses (Stroger Hospital/Main, Provident Hospital, and
Oak Forest Health Center) on all three shifts (day, evening and night). In addition to the three main
campus training sessions, my staff and I traveled to many of the CCHHS ambulatory (ACHN) clinics
throughout Cook County to train staff face to face to ensure a minimal disruption to patient care. As of
August 31, 2015, 94% of the over 6,200 CCHHS staff had completed training with additional trainings
scheduled each month to capture new employees. This monumental achievement would not have been
possible without the direct support of Dr. Shannon, HR (by providing administrative support at the
beginning of the training roll out), and the Department Heads – who played roulette with the schedules in
order to accommodate this training effort.
Future State
Although this training initiative was monumental due to the immediacy of needing the employees trained,
I am pleased with the results of the face to face trainings. This training method was (and remains)
important to ensure accurate understanding of the massive changes and cultural shift that the Plan requires,
as well as to more efficiently address the many questions and concerns that implementing significant
hiring policy changes trigger for both the staff who may move through a hiring process, as well as the
supervisors and interviewers that have to implement the procedures. For the employees unfamiliar with
past Cook County hiring practices, it is important to explain in person why such regulation and detailed
procedures are necessary. There were some employees not very receptive to the information about the
Plan requirements, but the vast majority of employees, staff and supervisor alike, were grateful for the

Page 22 of 36

structure, able to applaud the subtle and not so subtle changes in HR and in hiring new or former
employees, and generally pleased with the progress CCHHS has made since the Shakman litigation began
in 1969 often sharing direct experiences which reinforced the development of some Plan provisions.
During the next reporting period, there will be several additional training initiatives to work on and
implement. Those include training all Supervisors on the Policies and Procedures Manual currently under
development which will non-hiring employment actions such as discipline, overtime, transfers and interim
assignments; continuing face to face trainings for all new employees on the Plan; and working with
Corporate Compliance to integrate the Plan training into the developing Learning Management System
(LMS). By integrating and utilizing the LMS, my office will more easily schedule, track and monitor
compliance with the training requirements of the Plan by allowing easier access to the managers and
employees to training schedules. The LMS will allow for more efficient tracking of employee compliance
with the training.
The final training initiative to begin during the next reporting period is to create online training modules
to meet the annual training requirements of the Plan. By incorporating the annual Plan training with
CCHHS annual training modules, we can minimize patient care disruption and allow for easy access to
the training materials. The current goal is to implement the online annual Plan training in autumn of 2016.
MONITORING/AUDITING ACTIVITIES
Due to the massive training initiative implemented this past spring and summer, I took a slight step back
from many monitoring efforts. It was important to sacrifice active monitoring for training, because
ensuring the staff was educated on the Plan and its provisions was considerably more important. My staff
and I believe we have provided a solid foundation from which HR will now be able to efficiently
implement many of the Plan provisions over which HR did not have direct control when initially
implementing the Plan in October and more fully in February as described in my first report.
My first report identified that HR was implementing many of the Plan provisions of which it has control.
This included notification to the Compliance Administrator (CA) of posted requisitions, validations,
upcoming interviews, meetings and selections, as well as hiring process results in the form of Decision to
Hire (DTH) packet. Initially, several provisions were not rolled out such as Veteran’s Preference during
application validation, Internal Candidate Preference for non-union positions, validating discipline for
current or former employees, utilization of an Ineligible for Hire list, and a slow roll out of the Actively
Recruited Positions process. HR has since rolled out Veteran’s Preference during application validation
(June 2, 2015), and fully rolled out the Actively Recruited Positions process for all eligible positions (end
of August 2015). CCHHS is much closer to implementing the Ineligible for Hire list and the Internal
Candidate Preference for non-union positions, but significant work is still needed before CCHHS can fully
implement the discipline validation provisions of the Plan.
The CA continues to monitor CCHHS’ efforts to implement and consistently adhere to the Plan provisions
and guidelines. However, my staff has also done a fair share of monitoring in spite of the significant
amount of time spent training. This was due to my belief that training not only occurs during a scheduled
training session, but also in real time while the procedures are occurring within HR and the departments.
I have broken down the amount of monitoring my staff has accomplished during this reporting period, and
I will supplement with some examples of common practices, mistakes, or issues that arose during our
monitoring efforts. I anticipate a more robust accounting of monitoring activities in my next report.

During the last six months, my staff has monitored 51 posted requisitions (“postings”), 76 validations
which include randomizations and Applicant Review Panel (ARP) meetings, 55 interview processes, 62
selection meetings, and reviewed or audited 35 DTH packets. The graph below identifies the ratio of
concerns or errors that may have been identified during each process. Whenever a concern, issue or error
was identified, if feedback and/or redirection was not given immediately to the employee, it was often
communicated shortly thereafter by telephone conversation, email or visit by me.

Identified Issue/Error

Posting
As the graph indicates, there were not a significant number of errors identified when simply reviewing
posting language. Many of the identified errors stemmed from inaccurately transferring the minimum
qualifications listed in the job description onto the posted requisition. Another frequent error was the
listed minimum qualifications did not match the prescreening questions that the applicants must answer
to move forward in the process. In one case when this occurred, the inaccurate significantly altered the
applicant pool because it required the applicants to have a certification that was not actually necessary for
the position. Another common result with this error was that the posting allowed for more applicants to
make it through to the validation process, thus not actually impacting the applicant pool. The safeguard
of the validation process and requiring that applications be reviewed by HR prior to moving a candidate
forward to interview ensures that the correct minimum qualifications were screened. In each of these
examples, as soon as the recruitment team was alerted to the error, we were able to determine the best
course. Often, the best course of action required a re-posting of the position for public solicitation of
applications to ensure the integrity of the Plan. And sometimes, we all agreed that the validation process
was able to cure the defect. In all of the communications with HR with these issues, the HR employees
were very receptive to the information and in formulating corrective action.

Page 24 of 36

Validation
The graph identifies that approximately one third (1/3) of the monitored validations had some concern,
error, or question that arose. Whenever there is a question about why an applicant was made eligible or
ineligible, or how a specific minimum qualification was assessed, the recruitment team member
overseeing that process was cooperative with my inquiry. A few examples of issues observed: applicants
moving forward in the process did not meet the minimum qualifications; HR failed to carry over applicants
from the internal application period to the external application period; and applicants validated out of the
seniority order. The Plan allows for me to make recommendations which modify the final interview lists
based on my review as long as I put those recommendations in writing. Each time I recommended that
an applicant be removed from an interview list or added to an interview list, HR was receptive and
complied with that recommendation. However, in some cases, after further discussion of the application
review concerns, deference was given to the recruitment team when their determinations were reasonable
and in line with accepted practices.
I mentioned in the preceding paragraph that sometimes HR failed to carry over applicants from the internal
application period to the external application period. This would occur when a position needed to be
posted publicly, but only internal applications were accepted for a period of time in accordance with a
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). During this “internal” posting period, often external applicants
would apply to the position, because our system does not allow us to filter out external applicants
efficiently. As a practice and internal policy, HR does not automatically disqualify those external
applicants who applied during the wrong posting period, but will leave their applications in an available
status to allow for review once the external posting period has begun. There are several technical (I.T.)
related reasons that this may occur, but when they are identified by my team, HR quickly corrects the
error and validates the applicants as required by the Plan.
Interview
Approximately half of the interviews monitored identified some error or concern about how the process
was implemented. In each case that a concern was observed, my analyst would either immediately work
with the interviewing panel to correct the error or concern, or bring the matter to me so that I could work
with the panel or work with HR on correcting the panel behavior. Monitoring the interviews and selection
meetings is an additional training avenue that we hope to utilize more often as it yields very immediate
and lasting results when corrections to the implementation of the interview process is necessary. The most
common concern identified during the interviewing process by my team was that panelists were rephrasing
the interview questions. The Plan requires that the interview panel ask each candidate the same, HR
approved interview questions during the course of that interview process. If questions are rephrased, it
can alter the meaning of the question, thus presenting information that cannot be compared to other
candidates’ responses or equally assess a particular qualification. The Supervisor/Interview training
session focuses heavily on the interviews and interview questions. So, although follow up questions are
highly encouraged, rephrasing or altering interview questions is prohibited.
When such interview question rephrasing occurs, this usually merits a follow up during another hiring
process or set of interviews to ensure that the issue does not persist. My staff and I have observed that
once this issue is identified in an active interview process instead of a training session, it is more easily
understood and results in changed behavior. For the most part, the interview panelists are very receptive
to the feedback and correct the errors in the future. There are even some hiring managers and panelists
that request the presence of my staff or I to attend the interview in order to give feedback and assist them
through a process that is often significantly different from what they are accustomed.

Selection Meeting
When my staff and I attend selection meetings, we usually assist the department in working through the
steps of the new process. There is a lot of paperwork that goes into the selection process, and we provide
guidance when in attendance, often solicited, sometimes not solicited but necessary to ensure proper
implementation of the Plan. Proper notice is one of the biggest issues we run into during selection
meetings, the second most frequent problem is that the panel will forget to take notes as required about
the selection meeting. HR assists me and my staff in reinforcing both the notice requirements (48 hour
advance notice of any selection meeting) as well as following up with the departments about a lack of
selection notes to support the decision made. In fact, HR catches many of these concerns prior to review
by my office, and if notes were not taken during the selection meeting, the recruitment team will have the
hiring manager or lead panelist prepare a summary memorandum to assist in explaining the results of the
selection. The corrective action taken when appropriate notice was not taken is often a detailed review of
the entire process by my office, but once in a while it will result in scheduling a second selection meeting
to ensure that the results of the interview and selection process are accurately recorded.
DTH Packet
DTH packet review often leads to identifying some paperwork that was inadvertently omitted, signatures
forgotten, additional explanation or clarification about the results, and once in a while, concerns with the
job description and posting arise at this stage. It is not surprising that as HR and the departments become
accustomed to the new processes and significant amount of new paperwork that errors or missing
information will be found upon final review. These are usually easily and quickly corrected by discussion
between HR and the department, or less common, me and the department. However, when I do get
involved in following up with the department about missing information or needed corrections, they are
cooperative and usually learn from the feedback given. I view this as another training opportunity for the
time being, though as the Plan is more frequently implemented by all of the departments, I will expect that
these errors become less frequent.
When concerns with the job description and posting language are identified at this stage of the process, I
work with not only the recruitment team but also the compensation and classification team which is tasked
with creating and revising the job descriptions. In a few instances, concerns about the wrong minimum
qualifications appearing the posting language resulted in the position needed to be reposted to ensure that
the Plan was followed, any applicable CBA was followed, and that the correct applicant pool was moved
through the process.
I expect that as my staff begins to increase monitoring activity over the next reporting period, we will
continue to see significant improvement in the implementation of the Plan processes as well as the
continued increase in collaborative efforts between HR and the Departments which will result in problem
solving of issues or concerns prior to any Plan violations occurring. Between March and August, I have
already seen an increase in communication between departments and my office, as well as departments
and HR. Communication is a good indication that the Plan guidelines and purpose will be carried out
appropriately.
INVESTIGATIONS
I have not issued any Incident (investigation) Reports since the filing of the last semi-annual report,
because my focus has been on training my own staff as well as rolling out the Employee training as
required by the Plan. Several of the investigations that were filed during the first reporting period have

Page 26 of 36

 7
been completed; however, reports are still pending. Those will be reported on during the next semi-annual
report in March 2016.
Since March 1, 2015, I have received an additional 29 complaints or allegations that the Plan was not
followed. Two (2) of those concerns were identified by my staff while monitoring; seven (7) concerns
were brought to my attention through HR recruitment staff or leadership; one (1) issue was brought to me
from a complainant but was forwarded to the Office of the Independent Inspector General (OIIG) for
investigation due to allegations of unlawful political discrimination; and 19 filed by complainants from
outside HR or a compliance office.
My staff identified significant concerns during the interviews for two different positions in two different
departments. In one, the panel did not follow procedures regarding the interview questions – significantly
rephrased interview questions which created very different interviews for the candidates considered for
the position. In the other department, the interviewing panel collaborated about the candidates without
individually assessing them as required and made several concerning comments about the candidates.
Reports on both of these concerns are pending finalization and should be released relatively soon.
HR brought seven (7) potential violations to my attention this reporting period consisting of the following
allegations: a department used different interview questions from what HR had approved prior to the
interviews; a few hiring managers may have made offers to the candidates or promises of offers; two
issues involved panelists not identifying conflicts of interest in accordance with the Plan; and others
involving candidates complaining that individuals had been hired despite not meeting minimum
qualifications for the job. Most of these are still under investigation, but at least two are pending
finalization of the reports.
As for the remaining complainant-filed allegations, three have reports pending, and the remaining are in
various stages of investigation. Many of the allegations focus on the validation process, a few focus on
the selection and offer process, and others provide vague allegations that they have never been called for
interview despite applying for numerous positions over the last few years. This type of allegation can
often lead into an investigation of not only whether the proper validation procedure was used, but also
whether the applicant has lied on any of those numerous applications in order to better his/her chances of
receiving an interview.
Incident Reports issued which identify Plan violations require a recommendation for remedial action. I
have not issued an Incident Report pursuant to this Plan requiring remedial action yet. However, when I
do release such a report, HR is then required to respond to those recommendations. Despite the lack of
reports issued and the opportunity to official respond to recommendations, to date HR has collaborated
with me on identifying and correcting simple violations of the Plan that can be corrected immediately
(lack of interview notice in a timely fashion, failure to conduct an interview, failure to use approved
interview questions). When a department fails to give the appropriate notice for interviews or selection
meetings, HR and/or I have required that the meetings and interviews be rescheduled in accordance with
the Plan. If a hiring manager identifies a panel member to HR that has not been trained, interviews are
stalled until that panelist can be trained by me or another panel member is selected. Most recently, HR
and I discussed how lack of notice of a conflict of interest should be handled, and we both agreed that a
new panel would need to conduct a second round of interviews with no input from the panel member that
had the conflict. This was carried out by the department with monitoring by my office, resulting in a
process free of conflict of interest (in this case, although some of the final result was the same, other
candidates had been ranked that the first panel did not rank).

SUMMARY
Despite some delays with implementing the Plan fully, overall, much progress has been made over the
last 11 months since the Court approved the CCHHS Employment Plan. There is much left to do; we
must finalize the Policies and Procedure Manual and completely implement all Plan provisions.
Nonethesless, we have made significant progress this year in educating the staff at all levels and seen a
significant shift in process efficiency based on that education (and continuing education). Education is
the foundation of change, and we are now moving away from the training and into the full implementation
phase.
Sincerely,

Carrie L. Pramuk-Volk
