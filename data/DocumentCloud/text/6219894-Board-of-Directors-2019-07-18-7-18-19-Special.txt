Recommendations, Discussion / Information Items
A.

Analysis of the Uninsured (continued)

During the discussion of the information on the Self-Pay Cohort, Director Munar inquired whether information can
be provided regarding the income level of the cohort. Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer, responded
that staff will see if it is available. Additionally, Director Thomas inquired whether diagnostic data can be provided.
B.

Strategic Plan FY2020-2022 (Attachment #2)

Dr. Shannon provided an overview of the presentation containing the draft tactics, objectives and highlighted
strategies for the strategic plan, and invited Directors to provide any comments and recommendations.
Director Munar stated that more emphasis should be made to improve the payor mix; he recommended that a goal
be set. Additionally, he recommended that more emphasis should be made to improve the capitation rate and improve
advocacy.
Director Thomas commented that, many years ago, the County commissioned a study on the subject of having Cook
County employees receive their health services here at the System. He recalled that there were two (2) issues relating
to that: 1) capacity and 2) behavioral health. He stated that there should be more of a focus on behavioral health.
With regard to collective bargaining, Chair Hammock stated that the administration should be sure to identify any
work rules that are needed to execute this plan; he would like the administration to report back to the Board where
they were successful and not successful in negotiating those.
Director Driscoll requested that a modification be made to Objective 5.1 (slide 26) to read as follows: “Tailor Social
Determinant of Health strategies to achieve the most impact on CCH patients and Health Plan members and create
health equity.”
Director Gugenheim commented that, with regard to Objective 1.1, she believes that there are too many strategies
listed; she suggested that some might be collapsed or consolidated under a broader umbrella.
Dr. Shannon stated that the Strategic Plan will be presented to the Board for consideration at the July 26th Board
Meeting. The three (3) year financial projections relating to the Strategic Plan will be presented for consideration in
August to the Finance Committee and Board. The Strategic Plan and financial projections will then be presented to
the County Board for consideration in September.

IV.

 Self Pay Cohort – Summary of Results
Observations vs. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Key Facts
How many people are Self-Pay? - 6,990
Why do people remain Self-Pay? –

To be tested or surveyed

KFF Research Findings - In 2017, 45% of uninsured adults said that they remained uninsured because
the cost of coverage was too high.
many do not have access to coverage through a job

some eligible for financial assistance under the ACA may not know they can get help,
and undocumented immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid or Marketplace coverage.

3. Who remains in Self Pay?

Male (52%)

White (46%)

45-64 years old (47%) non Hispanic/Latino (52%)
35 of 87

31

 Self Pay Cohort - Summary of Results
Observations vs. Kaiser Family Foundation Key Facts
How does not having coverage affect health care access?

7% more Visits, 9% more outpatient visits, about 13% less

inpatient stays.

A. People without insurance coverage have worse access to care than people who are insured?

Not apparent in CCH population
B. Studies repeatedly demonstrate that the uninsured are less likely than those with insurance to receive preventive care and
services for major health conditions and chronic diseases.

To be further interrogated
What are financial implications for CCH serving the continuously uninsured?

CCH FY2018 - 235K Accounts referred to collections, $296.8M and $3.7M or 1% Collected
Per KFF - The uninsured often face unaffordable medical bills when they do seek care. In 2017, uninsured nonelderly adults were
over twice as likely as their insured counterparts to have had problems paying medical bills in the past 12 months. These bills can
quickly translate into medical debt since most of the uninsured have low or moderate incomes and have little, if any, savings.
