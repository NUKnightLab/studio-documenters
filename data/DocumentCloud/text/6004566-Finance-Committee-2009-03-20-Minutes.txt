Notes on Implications of Federal Approval of Disnronortionate Share (DSH) Funding and New Rates

Methodology for the Cook County Health 8.: Hospitals System

After months of System close collaboration with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family
Services, the approval by CMS on December 4th of Illinois? Medicaid State Plan Amendment'provides

for estimated (annualized) payments to CCIEEHS of $133.8 million in state ?scal year 2009, and $150.0
million in state ?scal 2010; 

Offsetting these gains are the negative effects of lower inpatient per diem payment rates due to the
simultaneous implementation of a new ?cost limited? Upper Payment Limit (UPL) methodology the

net effect is assumed to be about $60?$70 million in a ?re?pricing? that will be conducted in the April
or May; 

Assuming SFY09 YTD actual Medicaid utilization growth the System?s net improvement in
revenues from these two offsetting factors is estimated at $70 million in 

The new rate structure is retroactive to July 1, 2008; Also, a likely retroactive (one-time) opportunity
exists for DSH eligibility prior to July 1, 2008;

Net per diem inpatient rates, excluding DSH, will change from a System global rate of $2,834 per day
to $1,457 (Stroger), $1,014 (Provident), and $1,199 (Oak Forest);

Certain Medicaid ambulatory services reimbursement rates, for services such as high tech diagnostics,
observation stays, and outpatient surgeries will increase; For example, the least complex outpatient
surgical procedure at Stroger Hospital now will be reimbursed at $709 (net), whereas formerly the

. payment was $390.

The System and the County currently are advocating for increased DSH cap for Illinois, and? for
possible changes to the Medicaid Upper Payment limit for public, non-state hospitals;

Honorable Todd H. Stroger

President

Cook County Board of Commissioners
118 N. Clark Street, Room 537
Chicago, IL 60602

Dear President Stroger:

I am respectfully submitting information for your review in relation to item #9 on the February 4, 2009 Board Agenda (?gure
I.) and the status of the relocation project to the Oak Forest HosPital Campus (OFHC).

Post September 1 1, 2001, the needs and demands of the Cook County Department of Public Health have

. completely changed since its inception in 1945. Technological advances, emergency preparedness needs, and the need to
increase ef?ciency have been the reasons for to obtain a new administrative location to better serve our constituents
while realizing our future ?scal constraints. Brie?y, I have highlighted the critical points of this project and the justification
to continue to move forward:

Current Operational Status
1. administrative o?ices are located on 2 ?oors in a 6 story non?County owned office complex at 1010 Lake

Street in Oak Park. Also, our administrative of?ces are located in a municipality that operates its own state-certi?ed
health department for its residents. Thus, provides services to this village. 

2. administrative of?ces provide clinical Services at this location. district of?ces and related
of?ces are located strategically throughout suburban Cook County to deliver our clinical and inspection services
(?gure 2.).

3. also pays a prorated share of property taxes on this property as a result of this lease. This expense would be
removed with our relocation to OFHC.

4. utilizes all communication capabilities such as conference calling, email, broadcast faxing, video
conferencing to reach our clients, district sta?', media, community partners, etc. Thus, program staff rarely
host visitors at 1010 Lake Street. strives to be a service delivery organization that operates in the community
and 125 municipalities to accomplish our mission and mandates.

5. On a daily basis, approximately 50% of our staff housed at this location do not ful?ll their job responsibilities only at
1010 Lake Street. Staff may begin their day at this location but immediately depart to conduct inspections, program
education, community outreach, etc. throughout suburban Cook County.

6. Due to our designated status as a ?rst responder in a time of declared public health emergency, incident
command staff housed at 1010 Lake Street can not get to our equipment and supplies located on the Oak Forest
Hospital Campus in a timely fashion. The 1010 Lake Street location is dif?cult to travel from when getting to major
access highways in an emergency. Also, the 1010 Lake Street location does not have the storage space or the loading
dock capabilities to house our vast supply inventory.

We Being HealthC?RE to Your Community



71

7. The 1010 Lake Street location has no back up power generation to maintain our communication and computer
equipment in a time of an emergency or for daily operations when electrical service is down. Electrical service is
occasionally down for unexplained reasons and has resulted in signi?cant repair cost to communication and
computer serVer equipment.

8. Since 200?, several units and other ancillary administrative operations are now operating out of OFHC
Building E.

9. The infrastructure for voice and data capabilities have already been in place and operational since 2008 at OFHC
Building in anticipation of the relocation of our administrative staff to this location. Costs have been incurred by
the county for this phase of the relocation project.

S_ite Selection Parameters
OFHC Building was selected as the future site of our administrative of?ces:

1. Since county-own space in the suburbs was available and we would save on lease cost. Also, savings in this line
account could be transferred to other line accounts in the budget to deliver more direct services.

2. Since the site offers far greater and better securig for our operations. -

3. Since the location is near 2 major highway systems that can better reach our district of?ces and related of?ces that
serve our suburban residents. The proximity to these highway systems also increases our response time in a declared
emergency. Also, the location provides us with the capability to receive national and state stockpiles via air and
ground in a secure fashion. 

4. Since this county-owned space is near a Metra line and 2 major PACE lines. Also, OF HC offers free parking for our
staff and visitors.

-?mSince our emergency public health supplies were already housed at OFHC. With the staff and equipment so near each



other, our response time increases immensely.

6. Since back up power generation is available on the campus for our communication and computer equipment in a time
of an emergency and for daily operations.

7. Since the Cook County Emergency Management Agency (CCEMA) would be located in the same building. Due to
our responsibilities in an emergency, must staff a position in CCEMA when the county has opened its
emergency operations center.

Site Selection Comparative Models
The ?rture residence of administrative of?ces is also based on the national model for public health agencies. Figure

3 is a map of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and its related of?ce locations. Figure 4 is
a map of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its related of?ce locations. If you will
notice, the central administrative of?ces for DHHS and CDC are both located on the east coast and not in the center of the
United States. However, both agencies have strategically placed their regional of?ces in locations that are vital to their
service delivery model.

With our myriad of new and existing challenges in suburban Cook, the administrative location of our of?ces at Oak Forest
and related of?ce locations offer both the best future service delivery model as well as incorporate the effective use of tax
payer resources and county owned space.

Site Selection Fiscal Impact
The ?scal impact of redirecting these lease dollars to direct program services is substantial. In late 2007, began to

move several operational units and ancillary administrative operations to OFI-IC Building B. This project was completed in
the spring of 2008 and resulted in returning approximately 11,000 square feet of of?ce space 0r 1 ?oor to the
landlord resulting in a' savings of approximatelv $230,000.00 annually to the county prior to the new lease agreement. Thus,
in conjunction with the Real Estate Management Department, prepared a leased in partnership with our current
landlord that included only 26,182 square feet of o?ice space or 2 ?oors, a stable square foot rate of $23.00 over the lease
term, a 3 year lease term based on the timeline developed by Capital Planning, and a favorable termination clause should our

I. OFHC renovation project be completed prior to 2011. The annual lease cost and the entire lease cost over the next 3 years for

our administrative of?ces at this location is $602,186.00 and $1,806,558.00, respectively. Also, the annual lease cost
represents 3.78% of the FY 2010 proposed budget.

72

Reason For Current Lease

As you may recall, this lease agreement went before the Board on March 13, 2008 and met with signi?cant concern prior to its
approval. was questioned why the lease was needed since county owned space was available in the Health System
and the lease amount was considerable. I informed the Board at that time that clearly recognized the enormous cost
and agreed wholeheartedly that we could relocate and the county could realize these futures savings. Whenl informed the
Board that a relocation plan was in place for the OFHC and that this project was already underway, the lease was approved
knowing that this particular cost would not reappear in 2011 if we remained on scheduled. In additions, your of?ce directed
to incorporate the Forest Park Administrative Of?ces into our relocation plans at Oak Forest as well to
realize additional savings and reduce the amount of excess county owned of?ce space in the CCDPI-I system. For your
review, I have included the post board agenda for March 13, 2003 referencing item #33 and its voting record {Figure 5).

Renovation Costs and Future Savings
For your information, Capital Planning, as of November 12, 2008, estimates that the renovation cost for the designated

space and the ?nal relocation cost are $5,100,000.00. Although the up?-ont costs are signi?cant at this time, the
future savings far outweigh the continued lease arrangement for space that is neither ?mctional not optimal for in the
future.

Moreover, CCDPI-I will spend over the next 3 years for its current leased space (table 1.). If were to
remain in its current lease arrangement after 2011 for the following 15 years, we will spend approximately $9,966,554.67
based on a conservative 5% increase in the rate per square foot at each 5 year interval of a new lease. If you combine this
?gure with our current lease, CCDPI-I will spend approximately $11.7 million dollars on this particular leased space over the
next 18 years starting in 2008. Furthermore, if you subtract the renovation costs from this ?gure, will save the
county by relocating to Oak Forest approximately $6.6 million dollars over a {urine 15 year period. This $6.6 million dollar
?gure represents a dollar amount that is approximately half of our current 110 account. Therefore, as you see, the potential
savings are real and the opportunity to obtain them is achievable.

Conclusion

I hope that the information included in this document is both help?il and clear. believes from our operational
experience that this project will bene?t all of our residents and the agency itself. Therefore, we respectfully request that your
of?ce and the Board continue supporting the project so that we can position in the best situation to achieve continued
success.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I you should have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me
at 708-492-201 0.

Sincerely,

rem/gs?-

ITEM #9
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
PETER N. SILVESTRI and EARLEAN COLLINS, County Commissioners
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
IN OPPOSITION TO THE RELOCATION OF THE
COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH
TO THE OAK FOREST HOSPITAL OF COOK COUNTY CAMPUS

WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Public Health has been located at its current location at 1010 Lake Street in
Oak Park, Illinois since 1992, having relocated ?'om its Maybrook County Courthouse facility for the purpose of providing
additional courtrooms; and

WHEREAS, the facility is centrally located in Cook County in downtown Oak Park, accessible to the CT A Green line and
the Blue Line, the METRA railroad line and the Eisenhower Expressway and numerous PACE and CT A bus lines; and

WHEREAS, the facility includes the Department's administration of?ces, various educational programs, public information
resources, which are utilized by municipalities, public and private schools, community groups, the press and the public; and

WHEREAS, Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is located in the far southwest section of the County and is not nearly as
accessible as the Oak Park location; and

the Oak Forest Hospital site requires the expenditure of public funds, which far outweigh a long term rental of
space in a central location; and

WHEREAS, the people of Cook County and their municipalities and schools are better served in an accessible, central
location, which has been utilized as such for the past seventeen years.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Board of Commissioners direct that all efforts and
expenditures planned for the relocation of the Cook County Department of Public Health be tenninated.
