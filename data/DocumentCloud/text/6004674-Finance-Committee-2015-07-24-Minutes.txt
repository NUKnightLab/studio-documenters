UNANIMOUSLY.

III. Action Items (continued)
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #1)
Douglas Elwell, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy, provided an overview of the requests

During the review of request number 7, Mr. Elwell stated that he will provide the cost per pound relating to
these services in time for the Board Meeting next week.
During the discussion of request number 8, Mr. Elwell noted that there were three (3) responders to the
Request for Proposals (RFP). The contract is for services of both staff and physicians for the two (2) linear
accelerators. Chairman Collens inquired regarding the price difference between the proposed vendor and the
two other responders. Mr. Elwell indicated that he can provide that information.

 III. Action Items
B. Contracts and Procurement Items (continued)
With regard to request number 9, Mr. Elwell stated that this is a sole-source contract for a particular drug that
can only be obtained from one source. Around the country, the specialty pharmacies that used to traditionally
sell through distributors like everyone else have now moved to a position where they want the buyer to
contract directly with them. He noted that the administration is looking at having CCHHS become a specialty
pharmacy itself, which will allow for a different way to get these medications.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of request numbers
1 through 15. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Financial Statements (Attachment #3)
Metrics (Attachment #4)
Report of emergency purchases (Attachment #5)
CountyCare Update (Attachment #6)
Mr. Elwell provided an overview of the Report, which included information on the following subjects:
Financial Results; 2015 Budget Concerns; Future Metrics; and FY2016 Initial Budget Discussion. Steven
Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an overview of the information contained in the
CountyCare Update. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the subject of increased pharmacy costs, as referenced on slide 2 of the Report,
Director Junge inquired whether part of the increase was attributable to Hepatitis C drugs. Mr. Elwell stated
that Hepatitis C drug costs are part of what is driving CountyCare’s increased expenditures, but not for
CCHHS as a provider. Currently, the administration has been able to work with the manufacturer to get free
drugs for Hepatitis C patients who are indigent and are not covered by Medicaid. At this point, CCHHS has
not made an expenditure for Hepatitis C drugs, other than those for CountyCare members.
During the review of the slides regarding the FY2016 Initial Budget Discussion, Board Chairman Hammock
inquired regarding the assumptions relating to the payer mix, in terms of the self-pay population. Mr. Elwell
responded that he expects that the proportion for the self-pay population will remain where it is today;
however, the subject is still being reviewed, as there is a chance that it may go 1-2% up or down.
Director Junge inquired regarding the Medicare population; she asked what happens when Medicaid patients
age into Medicare. Mr. Elwell responded that CCHHS has a contract with one of the dual organizations, Well
Care. The administration does not expect to get into the Medicare risk business, because it is not ready for it;
therefore, for now, it will work with the other Medicare plans out there.
In response to a suggestion from Mr. Scheer regarding collaborating with other large public health care
entities, such as those in Los Angeles and New York, on issues like Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)
funding, Mr. Elwell stated that the administration is currently in contact with them regarding the new proposed
managed care regulations; he agreed with Mr. Scheer regarding the benefits and effectiveness of that type of
collaboration.

 IV. Report from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Finance and Strategy (continued)
During the discussion of pension costs, Chairman Collens noted that the pension costs are not currently
included in the CCHHS budget. He stated that there needs to be a better understanding with the County about
the accounting of this; perhaps it ought to be included in the CCHHS budget, and the allocation from the
County should be increased to match that, so the CCHHS administration can better manage its pension side.
Mr. Elwell stated that, after speaking with the County’s Chief Financial Officer, he expects that this will soon
happen.
Chairman Collens clarified that the plan is for Mr. Elwell to bring the budget to the next Finance Committee
Meeting, which will presumably be a longer meeting than normal. Board Chairman Hammock inquired
whether the budget would be approved at the August meeting. Mr. Elwell responded affirmatively.
During the discussion of the Metrics, Board Chairman Hammock inquired regarding the measures pertaining to
CareLink and Bad Debt. Mr. Elwell stated that he should have asterisked those measures, as staff are
reviewing those right now. CCHHS has been doing a better job of charging for items, but it is using the same
cost-to-charge ratio that it has been using for the past couple of years. The administration believes that the
cost-to-charge ratio has dropped dramatically; there is a disagreement internally about what that ratio should
be. Historically, the ratio has been at 88%, but it may have dropped to 65%; he will come back at the next
meeting with the right figure. The administration believes that significant improvements have been made in
that area, so that will need to be adjusted.
With regard to the data on full-time equivalent employees per adjusted occupied bed (FTEs per AOB) included
in the Metrics, Mr. Elwell noted that this reflects that CCHHS is either overstaffed or is producing less than it
needs to be producing in some areas; he provided examples of some factors that influence this number,
including those relating to collective bargaining agreements and staffing issues. Mr. Scheer indicated that this
reflects built in inefficiencies, relative to the rest of the industry. He stated that it is the style of practice that
creates that number; what the Board should consider is whether that is the style of practice that it intends to
have carried on. He inquired whether a comparison can be provided of other large public institutions and local
institutions. Mr. Elwell responded that CCHHS is investing in the UHC database; this can be used to obtain
that data. Chairman Collens indicated that, by the end of the year, he expects that serious comparative data
will be available.
Mr. Elwell noted that an emergency purchase was recently made; information on that purchase is included as
Attachment #5.
During the discussion of the CountyCare update, Mr. Glass noted that data on utilization of CCHHS services
by CountyCare members was incorporated into the presentation that went to the Managed Care Committee; he
stated that he can include this information for the Finance Committee in the future. Chairman Collens stated
that it would be helpful to incorporate some of that information into this presentation. From a big picture
perspective, CountyCare represents $900 million per year, and only approximately $200 million is flowing into
CCHHS as a provider; it is important for the Finance Committee to have that analysis as part of its routine
presentation.

 Financial Results
• Surplus after County Support was $7.7 million year to date
thru May
• This was better than budget by $31.3 million
• We lost money in May primarily related to adjusting our
Malpractice reserves to reflect higher than anticipated
settlement of older claims.
• CountyCare revenues exceeded expenses by $6.7 million
while being below budget on Revenue and Expense.
• Variance in supply expense of 20% is attributable to
pharmacy costs being higher than expected based on price
and usage and more of the cost being delivered outside our
system

 2015 Budget Concerns

 Key Drivers

County while reducing the need for support from
the Cook County taxpayers
• Invest in new and existing clinical services and
facilities to remain competitive
• Improve patient experience to attract sufficient
number of patients to maintain the mission
• Continued aggressive recruitment of exceptional
staff

imaging, ophthalmology, and outpatient surgery
• Generate capital from improvements in operations
• FFS that will require prior authorization will now come
from Medicaid MCOs, Medicare, and Commercial
plans
• DSH and BIPA expected to be stable

Page 33 of 61

Finance Committee I July 24, 2015

 Initial Expense Assumptions
• Increased personnel costs related to increases in
the recently negotiated CBAs
• Maintenance costs continue to increase on older
facilities
• Pharmaceutical and medical supply costs
continue to increase based on price and usage
• Continuing to have substantial financial impact
are unreimbursed costs
