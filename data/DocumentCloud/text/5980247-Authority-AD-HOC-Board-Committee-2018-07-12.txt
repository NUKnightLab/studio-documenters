July 12, 2018, Board Committee Meeting Overview

This memo provides an overview of the Board Committee meeting on Thursday, July 12, from
11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. at ICJIA’s office at 300 West Adams, Chicago, Suite 200.
For the first meeting of this introspective committee, we’d like to review the guidance outlined in
ICJIA’s administrative rules and enabling statute (linked below), discuss the strengths and
weaknesses of the current structure, and begin thinking about a timeline for changes.
ICJIA’s enabling statute:
http://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=397&ChapterID=5
ICJIA’s administrative code:
http://www.ilga.gov/commission/jcar/admincode/002/00201750sections.html
Among other things, this Committee will help the agency establish procedures for welcoming
new Board Members, clarify the role of the Board in the SOC and Budget Committees, and
design quarterly meetings that distribute valuable knowledge and identify opportunities for
collaboration.
We look forward to your participation,
John Maki
Executive Director,
Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority
