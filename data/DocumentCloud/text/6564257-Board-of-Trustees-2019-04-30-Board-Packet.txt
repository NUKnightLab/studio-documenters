RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
We have a lot to celebrate this month. Public transportation and mobility options for our state
were on the minds of almost everyone. We worked diligently with our transit partners at the Ohio
Public Transportation Association and were able to see our state legislators pass a budget that
includes dedicated money for public transportation for the next 2 years. Leader Emilia Sykes
came to visit us at METRO HQ and was one of the many champions for this cause as she fought
hard to make sure public transit money was not dropped from this budget. Representative Bill
Roemer also voted for this bill after coming to visit us and tour our facilities. We visited countless
others in Columbus in February and these efforts were rewarded in April. Public transportation
knows no boundaries and is important for both sides of the aisle to invest in its future. If you see
your state representative, please say ‘thank you’ to them for their support in this effort.
Congratulations to our own talented folks as we celebrate recognition for board member Don
Christian as one of Leadership Akron’s “New Community Leaders” and director of planning,
Valerie Shea on her award for “International Member of the Year” by WTS. We continue to watch
METRO RTA and its dedicated team members come to the forefront of the minds of those
organizations who are shaping our city and region.
I am excited this month to embark on our new committee structure for you and the leadership
team this month. The committees who have met so far have been very productive, and the
excitement and energy that has come from the first meetings is contagious. I truly believe the
committees are the meat and potatoes of building our organization and taking it to the next level.
My team and I appreciate your commitment to these committee and board meetings and your
perspective on what we are trying to accomplish together. We look forward to seeing you on
Tuesday at 9AM.
Yours in accessible transportation,
Dawn Distler
Executive Director

 MARCH 2019 OPERATIONS REPORT
The training hours for the month of March totaled 680. The training consisted of New Hire Training, Refresher Training,
Line-Service training, Specialty Training, and mandatory training per the Preventable Accident Policy.
A representative from Motor Coach Industries (MCI), was on site Tuesday, March 12. The purpose of the visit was to
showcase the new commuter coach (CRT). METRO operators, mechanics and other team members had an opportunity to
ask the MCI representative various questions regarding the new coach. The major difference in the CRT and the 2000
series style buses that we current have is the low-floor mobility/ADA boarding area. Overall the feedback was positive and
the visit was informative.
METRO operators were recognized by Mayor Dan Horrigan on Thursday, March 21. Mayor Horrigan presented METRO
with a proclamation marking March 18 as Transit Driver Appreciation Day. Several Board Members also joined the Mayor
and METRO team at 6:30 a.m. to celebrate this occasion. Thank you for your continued support.
th

The spring sign-up (process of selecting assignments by seniority) began on March 25 and continued through March
27th. The actual spring sign-up (date that operators begin new routes) began on Sunday, April 7 and will end on Saturday,
June 1.
On Friday, March 29, the Executive Director and the Director of Operations attended the “LEVEL” Luncheon at the Hilton
Akron/Fairlawn. The event was hosted by the Akron Urban League and the purpose was to engage various members of
the community and organizations to have a conversation to raise awareness, lower bias and create equity. The “LEVEL”
Luncheon will be followed by a series of subsequent lunch and learn diversity and inclusion workshops throughout the
remainder of the year.

MARCH 2019 CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PARATRANSIT REPORT
PARATRANSIT PASSENGERS: 23,049 passengers transported in March, up from last month by 1,393 and down from
March 2018 by 1,135 passengers. Weather typically plays a role in changing passenger counts.
NON-EMERGENCY TRANSPORTATION (NET): 2,718 passengers transported in March. With changes in Medicaid at the
state and county levels, we transported 1,234 less passengers this March than last month, and 1,851 less passengers from
March 2018. All three providers of the NET program will continue to experience changes as administration of the
program evolves.
CARE CENTER CALL NUMBERS: 30,426 calls were answered during the month. Of that, 10,125 calls were line-service
information and the balance 20,301 calls were paratransit reservations and paratransit returns and/or cancellations.
Total call volume answered was consistent with March 2018. The trend continues with a decline in information calls as
other options are available for passengers.
APPLICATIONS FOR PARATRANSIT SERVICE: 180 applications were received in the month; application count is typically
high in March and this was no exception. On the Reduced Fare line-service side, we approved 21 new applicants and
renewed passes for 12 existing passengers. There were 10 ADA applications processed for ADA service. SCAT service had
the largest amount of applications received with 35 new passengers receiving service and an additional 21 passengers had
their services renewed.
AGENCY AUDITS: Direction Home conducted a compliance audit on our Title III contract. This audit is mandated by the
Ohio Department of Aging. Our method of handling program income, cash and in-kind match and cost sharing was
reviewed. I am happy to report that we successfully passed the audit with no issues found related to our fiscal monitoring
policies and procedures.
TRAINING, MOBILITY, ELIGIBILTY AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: Twenty-four (24) passengers utilizing a mobility
device were brought into METRO offices for the mandatory wheelchair weight and inspection and advocacy training. As a
team we were involved in 46.25 hours of relevant training during the month of March to aid us in providing better service
to our passengers. Customer Service team members attended the following events in the month of March: Employing the
Community event hosted by DJFS at the Job Center, AMHA HCVP event, WIC Advisory Board, World Relief, East Akron
Neighborhood Development Emergency Taskforce, Standdown for Homeless Veterans, Mayor Horrigan’s Senior
Commission, Minority Behavioral Health Group, Access Meeting, Firestone High School, Summit County Agency
Networking Meeting, Foster Grandparents, Northern Summit County Youth Transition Fair and Clergy On-Board hosted by
METRO.
