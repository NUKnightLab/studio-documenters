Legislative Updates – (9:24 a.m.- 9:37 a.m.)
SB 2 (ref. enclosed) Mr. O’Donnell provided an update to the Board regarding SB 2 in conjunction with an update
regarding the proposed Board C&DD regulations. SB 2 includes granting authority to the Ohio EPA
to create regulations governing the Construction Demolition and Debris recycling or processing
industry. He advised that SB 2 was introduced several weeks ago and that there have been three
hearings held. The bill is supported by the C&DD industry, which seeks to level the playing field with
the unregulated part of the industry. The text of SB 2 is the same as former SB 333 from last year.
Meanwhile, CCBH staff met with an attorney for the C&DD industry and discussed the Board’s
proposed C&DD regulations. The meeting was very positive with several worthwhile ideas being
discussed. CCBH staff intend to work on the regulations to get them in final shape for Board review
and approval at the March 2017 Board meeting.
