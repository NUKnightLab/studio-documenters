amount of each Bond shall be redeemed as shall equal $5,000 for each number assigned to it and so
selected.
Notice of the redemption of the Bonds shall be mailed not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for such redemption to the registered owner(s) of Bonds to be redeemed at their last

interest on such Bonds or portions thereof shall cease to accrue and become payable. If there shall be
drawn for redemption less than all of a Bond, the District shall execute and the bond registrar shall
authenticate and deliver, upon surrender of such Bond, without charge to the owner thereof, in exchange for
the unredeemed balance of the Bond so surrendered, Bonds of like series, maturity, interest rate and of the
denomination of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.
The bond registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Bond after notice of the
redemption of all or a portion thereof has been mailed. The bond registrar shall not be required to transfer

thereof, shall be thereunto affixed or otherwise reproduced upon each Bond and attested by the manual or
authorized facsimile signature of the Secretary of the District.
In case any officer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, shall appear on any Bond
shall cease to hold such office before the issuance of the Bond, such Bond shall nevertheless be valid and
sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the person whose signature, or a facsimile thereof, appears on such
Bond had not ceased to hold such office. Any Bond may be signed, countersigned, sealed or attested on
behalf of the District by any person who, on the date of such act, shall hold the proper office,
notwithstanding that at the date of such Bond such person may not have held such office. No recourse
shall be had for the payment of any Bonds against any officer who executes the Bonds.
Each Bond shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication executed manually by the bond
registrar. No Bond shall be entitled to any right or benefit under this ordinance or shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the bond
registrar.
Section 11. Transfer, Exchange and Registry. The Bonds shall be negotiable, subject to the
provisions for registration of transfer contained herein and in the Bond Purchase Agreement. Each Bond
shall be transferable only upon the registration books maintained by the District for that purpose at the
corporate trust office of the bond registrar, by the registered owner thereof in person or by his attorney duly
authorized in writing, upon surrender thereof together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to
the bond registrar and duly executed by the registered owner or his duly authorized attorney. Upon the
surrender for transfer of any such Bond, the District shall execute and the bond registrar shall authenticate
and deliver a new Bond or Bonds registered in the name of the transferee, of the same aggregate principal
amount, series, maturity and interest rate as the surrendered Bond. The Bonds, upon surrender thereof at
the corporate trust office of the bond registrar, with a written instrument satisfactory to the bond registrar,
duly executed by the registered owner or his attorney duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged for an
equal aggregate principal amount of Bonds of the same series, maturity and interest rate and of the
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof.
For every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, the District or the bond registrar may
make a charge sufficient for the reimbursement of any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be
paid with respect to such exchange or transfer, which sum or sums shall be paid by the person requesting
such exchange or transfer as a condition precedent to the exercise of the privilege of making such exchange
or transfer. No other charge shall be made for the privilege of making such transfer or exchange. The
provisions of the Illinois Bond Replacement Act, 30 Illinois Compiled Statutes 315, shall govern the
replacement of lost, destroyed or defaced Bonds.
The District and the bond registrar may deem and treat the person in whose name any Bond shall be
registered upon the registration books as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be

BOARD AGENDA

February 11, 2015

overdue or not, for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal of, redemption
premium, if any, or interest thereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, and all such payments so made to
any such registered owner or upon his order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability
upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the District nor the bond registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 12. Security for Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds are issued as “limited
bonds” as defined and referred to in the Local Government Debt Reform Act. The Limited Tax Bonds are
payable from the District’s “debt service extension base,” as defined in the Property Tax Extension
Limitation Law, 35 Illinois Compiled Statutes 200/18-185 through 18-245. The District covenants that it
will not issue any bonds, notes or other obligations if the issuance thereof would cause the anticipated tax
extension for any tax levy year for limited bonds of the District to exceed the debt service extension base of
the District less the amount in items (b), (c), (e) and (h) of the applicable definition of “aggregate extension”
contained in the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, for non-referendum obligations, except
obligations initially issued pursuant to referendum.
The full faith and credit of the District are hereby irrevocably pledged to the punctual payment of
the principal of and interest on the Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds shall be direct and general
obligations of the District, and the District shall be obligated to levy ad valorem taxes upon all the taxable
property in the District for the payment of the Limited Tax Bonds and the interest thereon, without
limitation as to rate, but limited as to amount by provisions of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law.
Section 13. Form of Limited Tax Bonds. The Limited Tax Bonds shall be issued as fully
registered bonds and shall be in substantially the following form, the blanks to be appropriately completed
when the Limited Tax Bonds are printed:
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, by purchase of the Series 2015_ Bonds, each
investor in the Series 2015_ Bonds will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to and
agreed with the District that it will not sell or otherwise transfer its Series 2015_ Bonds unless
