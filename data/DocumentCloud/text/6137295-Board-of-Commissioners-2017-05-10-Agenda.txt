PROPOSED NO CASH BID REQUEST
Requestor: Matthew T. DiCianni, Village Attorney, Village of South Chicago Heights
Request: Approval of No Cash Bid Request
Location: Village of South Chicago Heights
Volume and Property Index Number:
021; 32-33-102-019-0000.
Summary: Please find included in these materials the Village of South Chicago Heights’s no-cash bid
application. The Village submits this application in order to acquire property commonly known as 3244
Butler St., South Chicago Heights, IL 60411. There is only one PIN included in this request. This
property was previously used for industrial purposes as the site of the Chicago Heights Pattern & Model
Works, Inc., which employed up to twenty people. Unfortunately, this business no longer occupies the
building, and it has been vacant and unoccupied since 2010.

The Village has retained legal counsel to obtain the tax deed and will bear all legal and other costs
associated with the acquisition of this parcel. If the Village is able to acquire this property, it plans to
rehab the property and market it to an investor in the hopes of bringing jobs and money into the
community. However, there is no investor or third party to whom the Village presently plans to deed the
property, and there has been no third-party request made to the Village to acquire the property. If the
Village is unable to sell the property, then it will use it as the home of its Public Works Department.
If the Village successfully acquires this property, it will file for tax-exempt status because it will retain
the PIN for municipal use. It will also submit to the Cook County Planning and Development Department
no-cash bid reports on the status of the parcel for five years or until development is complete, whichever
occurs last.

The County shall develop and use measures to facilitate the participation of all firms in County

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

establish Project Specific Goals for construction, which shall be incorporated into each bid and RFP.
Notwithstanding the above, Established Businesses may participate in the Program as authorized under
Section 34-300.1.
Sec. 34-296. - Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBE's or WBE'PCEs
own forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or
WBEPCE for the work on the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or
WBEPCE (except supplies and equipment the MBE or WBEPCE purchases or leases from the prime
Contractor or the prime Contractor's Affiliate), unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by an MBE or WBEPCE for providing a
bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing
bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the
fee is reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services,
unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(c) When an MBE or WBEPCE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBEPCE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(d) Only expenditures to an MBE or WBEPCE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether an MBE or WBEPCE is performing a Commercially Useful
Function, the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the
amount the MBE or WBEPCE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is
actually performing and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or
WBEPCE must be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for
negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable)
and paying for the material itself. An MBE or WBEPCE does not perform a Commercially Useful
Function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in the contract through which funds are passed
in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or WBEPCE participation. If an MBE or WBEPCE
subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would be expected based on normal industry
practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful Function. When an MBE or WBEPCE is
presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the Certified Firm may present
evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the fees or transportation charges for the delivery of materials or
supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the payment of such fees is a customary industry
practice and are commensurate with fees customarily charged for similar services, unless otherwise
provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(f) One hundred percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE
Manufacturer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.

Page 12 of 74

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 10, 2017

(g) Sixty percent of the cost of the supplies, equipment or goods obtained from a PCE Distributor or
Regular Dealer shall be counted, unless otherwise provided pursuant to Section 34-300.1.
(h) If a PCE ceases to be certified for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted for the remaining term of
the Contract.
(i) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of an MBE or WBEPCE
shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBEPCE.
Sec. 34-297. - Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid/proposal is due. In the event a bid or proposal leads to a Contract with the
County, the Utilization Plan as approved by the CCD shall be incorporated as a material commitment on
the part of the Contractor to each relevant PCE, and the contractor and the County. Failure to include a
Utilization Plan shall render the bid or proposal not Responsive.
(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and an MBE or WBEPCE in which the Contractor requires
that the MBE or WBEPCE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CCD will determine
whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). Parties submitting bids or
proposals for Procurements may in all instances request a partial or full waiver of one or more
established Project Specific Goal for PCE participation. In making this determination, the Director will
consider, at a minimum, whether the Contractor has:
(1) Solicited through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEsPCEs certified in the scopes
of work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs with
timely, adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to
allow MBEs and WBEsPCEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up
initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs.
(2) Selected portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEsPCEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and
WBEPCE participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these
work items with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the
work available to MBEs and WBEsPCEs and to select those portions of the work or material
needs consistent with the availability of MBEs and WBEsPCEs to facilitate their participation.

Page 13 of 74

 Board of Commissioners

BOARD AGENDA

May 10, 2017

(3) Negotiated in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEsPCEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for
the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and
WBEsPCEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEsPCEs as being unqualified
without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be
some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEsPCEs is not in itself
sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such
costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with
its own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all
scopes of work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Made efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEsPCEs in obtaining necessary equipment,
supplies, materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Used the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations,
minority/women
contractors'
groups,
government-sponsored
minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEsPCEs.
(7) Maintains or commits to establish and maintain a mentor-protégé agreement with one or more
PCEs that is enforceable and that, in the judgement of the CCD, has performance standards and
outcomes that are clearly established and effective in terms of assisting the PCE in acquiring
additional skills, experience, and relationships helpful to the long-term success of the PCE
consistent with the provisions of Section 34-271(d).
(d) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have
met the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBEPCE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(e) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBEPCE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBEPCE and the agreed upon dollar
value shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(f) The CCD shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of work and
the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEsPCEs. The CCD may request clarification in writing of items
listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity to augment
listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.

Page 14 of 74

May 10, 2017

(g) If the CCD determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific Goals
have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Agency, the CCD and
User Agency shall recommend award to Purchasing Agent.
(h) If the CCD finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CCD shall
communicate this finding to the Purchasing Department and recommend that the bid/proposal be
rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest procedures.
Sec. 34-298. - Contract administration procedures.

(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the
contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted
to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CCD and the User Agency shall monitor
subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and timely
access to the Contractor's books and records, including, without limitation, payroll records, tax returns
and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment to
MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBEPCE performing any portion of the
contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing
inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEsPCEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CCD, in consultation with the
CPO and the User Agency. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the
Contractor to contract penalties or other sanctions. Upon such written approval by the CCD, the revised
Utilization Plan shall be incorporated into the Contract as an amendment by the CPO. The CCD shall
promulgate policies and procedures with respect to changes to a Utilization Plan.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of an MBE or WBEPCE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the CCD, CPO and the User Agency in writing, and shall
clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute an MBE or
WBEPCE subcontractor or perform the work designated for an MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor
with its own forces unless and until the CCD, in consultation with the CPO and the User Agency,
approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to
begin work until the CCD, CPO and the User Agency have approved the substitution.
(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited.
The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBEPCE subcontractor to resolve the problem.
Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBEPCE

Page 15 of 74

can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the
correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of performance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.
(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
(v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where
agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any
denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CCD.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
AMENDMENT TO TAX INCENTIVE ORDINANCE
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 74 Taxation, Article II
Real Property Taxation, Division 2. - Classification System For Assessment, Sec. 74-71, of the Cook
County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 74-71
(a) Living wage requirement.

(1) Unless expressly waived by the County Board, any Employer occupying a property that receives
a property tax incentive for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9
multifamily residential property shall pay not less than the Living Wage, as defined in the Cook
County Procurement Code (Cook ,/County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. IV, Div. 1 § 34-121), to each
of its onsite Employees, unless such Employees’ Wages are governed by Federal or State
prevailing wage law.
For purposes of this Section, the term “Employee” shall mean an
employee who performs duties or services for an Employer on average at least 30 hours per
week in any two week period for which the Employee is paid; “hours per week” shall mean
hours for which an employee is paid or is entitled to payment by the Employer for a period of
time during which no duties are performed by the Employee due to vacation, holiday, illness,
incapacity, jury duty, military duty or approved leave of absence.
(2) On and after July 1, 2020, the owner of any property that receives a property tax incentive shall
notify all Employers who occupy such property as lessees of the requirements of this Section.
Upon commencement of a lease, on or after July 1, 2020, of a property that receives a property
tax incentive, any new lessee shall be required to submit to the municipality or the Cook County
Board, as the case may be, an affidavit stating that such lessee is paying a Living Wage to its
Employees in compliance with this Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the requirements of this Section shall not apply to an Employer who was a lessee and not an
owner-occupant of a property that receives a property tax incentive prior to July 1, 2020.
(23) This Section shall not apply to Employers that are not-for-profit organizations or funded by
Federal grants or Federal loans or Employers who are lessees but are not owners of a property
that receives a property tax incentive prior to adoption of this amended Ordinance. Further, this
Section shall not apply to Employers who can demonstrate to the County Board that compliance
with the requirements of this Section would cause such Employer to be in violation of the terms
of a collective bargaining agreement between the Employer and a labor union.

BOARD AGENDA

May 10, 2017

(4) Every Employer required to pay the Living Wage shall notify its Employees of the Living
Wage requirement and shall notify all of its Employees annually of any adjustment to the
Living Wage. In addition, the Employer shall notify its Employees that if any Employee
contends that the Employer is not paying a Living Wage or has otherwise violated this section,
that Employee may file a complaint with the Cook County Commission on Human Rights
("Commission").The Commission shall investigate alleged violations of the Living Wage
Ordinance and is authorized to adopt regulations for the proper administration and enforcement
of its provisions. If at the conclusion of the Commission's investigation, the Commission finds
that the Employer has violated this section, it shall (1) in the case of an Employer receiving a
property tax incentive, notify the Assessor; or (2) in the case of a Contractor or a subcontractor
required to pay the Living Wage, notify the CPO, who shall exercise such remedies as are in the
best interest of the County, including ordering the Employer to pay back pay and penalties, as
provided in this section.
(35) If an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, such Employer may be required to
pay back pay to each affected Employee, and may also be fined by the County up to $100.00 for
each affected Employee for each day paid at less than the Living Wage. Such penalties will not
be imposed on any Person except after a hearing (Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 2, Art. IX).
Further, if an Employer is found to be in violation of this section, the property tax incentive for
this property is subject to revocation.
(46) If an Employer is found to have retaliated against an affected Employee, the Employer’s
property tax incentive may be terminated unless such Employer appropriately reinstates or
compensates such Employee.
(57) For the purposes of this Section:
Property tax incentive means a reduction in the assessment level as set forth in Division 2 of this
Article for Class 6b industrial property, Class 8 industrial property, or Class 9 multifamily
residential property. "Property tax incentive" shall not include a Class 9 designation granted to
supportive living facilities, which establish an alternative to nursing home care for low income
older persons and persons with disabilities under Medicaid and which are certified by the State
Department of Public Aid pursuant to Division 2 of this Article; and
Sales tax means the Retailer's Occupation Tax, the Service Occupation Tax and/or the Use Tax.
(68) Living Wage Affidavit
Every municipality or the Cook County Board that provides a Resolution or Ordinance or
authorized officer letter, as the case may be, to an applicant for a Class 6b industrial property
or a Class 8 industrial property tax incentive shall maintain in its files and records
documentation that such municipality or the County Board received and filed the Living Wage
Affidavit submitted by the owner or lessee of such property stating that such owner or lessee is
paying a Living Wage to its Employees in compliance with this Section. Further, an applicant
or lessee of a Class 9 multifamily residential property tax incentive shall provide the

municipality or the Cook County Board, as the case may be, a Living Wage Affidavit which
shall be maintained by such municipality or the Cook County Board in its files and records.
(b) State or Federal Laws.

(1) Except where a Person has requested an exception from the Assessor and the County Board
expressly finds that granting the exception is in the best interest of the County, such Person
including any Substantial Owner (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34367) shall be ineligible to receive any property tax incentive noted in Division 2 of this Article
if, during the five-year period prior to the date of the application, such Person or Substantial
Owner (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) admitted guilt or
liability or has been adjudicated guilty or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of
committing a repeated or willful violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820
ILCS 115/1 et seq., the Illinois Minimum Wage Act, 820 ILCS 105/1 et seq., the Illinois
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 820 ILCS 65/1 et seq., the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 et seq., the Employee
Classification Act, 820 ILCS 185/1 et seq., the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C.
201, et seq., or any comparable state statute or regulation of any state, which governs the
payment of wages.
(2) The Assessor shall obtain an affidavit or certification from every Person and Substantial Owner
(as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) who seeks a property tax
incentive from the County as noted in Division 2 of this Article certifying that the Person or
Substantial Owner (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) has not
violated the statutory provisions identified in Subsection (a) of this Section.
(3) If the County or Assessor becomes aware that a Person or Substantial Owner (as defined in Cook
County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34--367) has admitted guilt or liability or has been
adjudicated guilty or liable in any judicial or administrative proceeding of committing a
repeated or willful violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act, 820 ILCS 115/1
et seq., the Illinois Minimum Wage Act, 820 ILCS 105/1 et seq., the Illinois Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 820 ILCS 65/1 et seq., the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. 2101 et seq., the Employee Classification Act, 820 ILCS
185/1 et seq., the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 201, et seq., or any comparable
state statute or regulation of any state, which governs the payment of wages during the five-year
period prior to the date of the application, but after the County has reclassified the Person's or
Substantial Owner's (as defined in Cook County, Ill., Code, Ch. 34, Art. V § 34-367) subject
property under a property tax incentive classification, then, after notice from the Assessor of
such violation, the Person or Substantial Owner shall have 45 days to cure its violation and
request an exception or waiver from the Assessor. Failure to cure or obtain an exception or
waiver of ineligibility from the Assessor shall serve as grounds for revocation of the
classification as provided by the Assessor or by the County Board by Resolution or Ordinance.
In case of revocation or cancellation, the Incentive Classification shall be deemed null and void
for the tax year in which the incentive was revoked or cancelled as to the subject property. In
such an instance, the taxpayer shall be liable for and shall reimburse to the County Collector an

Summary: Under this proposed increase and six-month extension of the interagency agreement, the
Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA) will continue to operate a toll-free helpline service and
manage and administer housing counseling services as a part of the Circuit Court’s free Mortgage
Foreclosure Mediation Program.

Families facing foreclosure call the IHDA’s helpline to receive important information on the foreclosure
process and to set up an appointment with a HUD-certified housing counseling agency. Families receive
the housing counseling services from IHDA’s seven (7) HUD-certified subcontractors which were
selected after a rigorous application process and are located throughout Cook County. Services include:
one-on-one housing counseling with families; assistance with applying for loan modifications; and
identification of other options to avoid foreclosure whenever possible. Each family receives an average
of four (4), one-on-one counseling sessions. As of 12/31/2016, IHDA’s subcontractors assisted more than
157,000 families through the helpline, provided more than 88,000 families with free one-on-one initial
housing counseling sessions, and conducted more than 300 housing counseling workshops throughout
Cook County at which almost 9,000 families received assistance.
The increase and extension are necessary for the remainder of the program year. Request for Proposals
(RFPs) are in process for all program services.
