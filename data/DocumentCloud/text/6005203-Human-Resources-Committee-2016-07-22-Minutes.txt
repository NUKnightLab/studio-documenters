Ms. Lopez noted that the comparison figures located at the bottom of slide 6 were transposed and should be reflected as
follows: FY15 – 47.71 Average/Month, and FY16 – 41.83 Average/Month.
During the discussion of the information on slide 11, Director Velasquez inquired regarding whether a plan exists to
address the issue of hiring bilingual and bicultural staff - particularly providers and those with direct patient care. Ms.
Lopez stated that she has been informed of a potential Request for Proposals planned to be issued for a service that will
help to assess bilingual ability of staff; that is one tool that can be utilized to consistently demonstrate and assess
people’s skill sets.

Report from Chief of Human Resources (continued)
The Committee held a discussion on the subject of recruitment efforts to fill vacancies, in line with the strategic
objective and related tactics regarding hiring more bilingual employees and developing a cultural competency of the
workforce. In response to a question from Board Chairman Hammock regarding the pool of potential applicants from
which the House Staff Physicians (as referenced on slide 1) originated, Dr. John Jay Shannon, Chief Executive Officer,
provided information on the process used to match residents through the National Residency Match Program. The
National Residency Match Program is an electronic web-based program that allows applicants, theoretically an infinite
number of applicants, to apply to a training program. The leadership of the training programs within those departments
look at that online applicant pool and winnow down what portion of applicants they want to interview on-site. Those
individuals come and interview on-site, and after the interviewing season is done, the leadership makes a list of who it
liked out of those they interviewed. Those applicants also make a list of what programs they liked after they have
interviewed at several places. That information is put into a big black box that matches them electronically, so on
“Match Day,” any one of these programs would get a list that says (for example) - you’ve interviewed and ranked 200
people for these spots, here are the 40 that matched for you.” Most of the time, the match list becomes de facto the
people that join the program, although every once in a while there is a person who matched but cannot keep that
commitment; he noted that it is almost a contractual arrangement when the parties enter into the match. The vast
majority of leadership of these training programs are actually clinical faculty who run the training programs. In
response to a question regarding the number of potential applicants who would be interviewed for a total of 124 House
Staff Physician positions, Dr. Shannon stated that it varies, as there is variability from department to department. The
Department of Medicine, for example, could have a total candidate pool of thousands to begin with, for perhaps 40
spots; other programs have a very limited pool of candidates.
In response to a question regarding whether encouragement is given to training program leadership to be sensitive to
minority groups when looking at the applicant pool, Dr. Shannon responded that, typically, there is not a specific
dictum given on that; however, if one looks at the candidates that match CCHHS’ programs, it is a very diverse pool.
He referenced certain departments that have a higher percentage of international graduates, and other departments that
have a higher percentage of American graduates. He stated that all of the training programs are sensitive to the idea of
wanting to look like the people served; he added that some of these training programs do not necessarily interact
directly with patients a lot - Pathology and Radiology are examples of this. Board Chairman Hammock suggested that
data on this subject be kept over time, particularly in light of the fact that there is a good portion of residents who
remain with CCHHS following their training. Dr. Shannon stated that he will have Dr. John O’Brien, Chairman of the
Department of Professional Education, report back on the subject.
Director Junge noted that diversity has many meanings. She stated that it might be useful to have as a goal for all of the
departments to try and bring in staff who come from the same backgrounds as CCHHS patients; she clarified that she
meant backgrounds of African-Americans and Latinos from Chicago. In her experience, too often foreign graduates are
used to satisfy the goal for diversity, but that goal should be more nuanced.
Chairman Wiese reminded the Committee that neither CCHHS nor the County has an affirmative action plan; she
encouraged the administration to address that important subject.
Director Richardson-Lowry, stated that, from her experience in running a diversity program in a very large international
law firm, there are strategies that can be employed if the objective is truly to diversify staff. She suggested that, if the
objective is diversity and inclusion, then that should be formalized in the employment process, and those managers
should be formally trained in what that means. If the organization collects the data that Board Chairman Hammock
referenced earlier, that will also inform; then, there are methodologies that can be employed that can help close that
gap.
Following the Committee’s discussion, it was determined that Dr. Shannon and Director Richardson-Lowry would
further discuss the subject in a later conversation.
