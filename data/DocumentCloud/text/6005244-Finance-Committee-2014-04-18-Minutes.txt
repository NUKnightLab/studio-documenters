III. Action Items (continued)
B. Request to concur with the execution of a Master Intergovernmental Agreement between the City of
Chicago / Chicago Department of Public Health and the County of Cook / Cook County Health and
Hospitals System (Attachment #1)
Joy Wykowski, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs, and Dr. Keiki Hinami, Senior Attending Physician,
Department of Medicine, provided an overview of the request presented for the Committee’s consideration.
The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
During the discussion of the item, Board Chairman Carvalho inquired as to the reason why a separate system
needed to be created for the purpose of immunization registration; he inquired why the Chicago Department of
Public Health would not use the Illinois Comprehensive Automated Immunization Registry Exchange (ICARE) for this purpose. Dr. Michael Vernon, Director of the Communicable Disease Unit at the Cook County
Department of Public Health, responded that this particular system is used for mass immunization campaigns.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of the request
to concur with the execution of the Master Intergovernmental Agreement. THE
MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

C. Contracts and Procurement Items (Attachment #2)
Gina Besenhofer, System Director of Supply Chain Management, provided an overview of the requests
presented for the Committee’s consideration. The Committee reviewed and discussed the requests.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 1. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 2. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
During the discussion of request number 3, Board Chairman Carvalho provided information on the Access to
Care Program. Access to Care has a per-member cost, and therefore, from their perspective, the System’s
funding pays for a certain number of people. They have a network of volunteer physicians who agree to see
people when they are enrolled in this program; there is a nominal fee charged to the patient each year.
Normally, if a doctor wants to provide services to a person who is uninsured, just out of the goodness of their
heart, they face the dilemma of needing to write a prescription or order a lab test for this person who cannot
afford to pay for it. This program was created so there was a way to pay for all of those things – it has a
formulary, it provides support for prescriptions and various tests, and if those primary care doctors treat a
patient enrolled in the program who needs specialty care, they have a referral system into this System for
specialty care. The program only provides services to persons who are ineligible for any other programs.
Director Gugenheim, seconded by Director Wiese, moved the approval of request
number 3. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved the approval of request
number 4. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.
During the discussion of request number 5, a question was raised regarding whether the Group Purchasing
Organization (GPO) was utilized. Ms. Besenhofer responded that the GPO had multiple vendors available.
When it is determined that there is more than one vendor available under the GPO, she will put it through a
competitive methodology and utilize a Request for Proposals (RFP) process; the proposers under this RFP
were vendors under the GPO.

IV. Recommendations, Discussion/Information Items
A. Update on Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare
Steven Glass, Executive Director of Managed Care, provided an update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration Project/CountyCare. He stated that CountyCare continues to operate under a temporary
extension of its 1115 Waiver, achieving significant accomplishments in enrollment and membership again this
month.
So far, in April, an additional 3,800 CountyCare applications have been initiated. This brings the total number
of applications initiated to just under 154,000 since the CountyCare program began. 4,500 applications have
been submitted to the State’s Department of Human Services (DHS) so far this month for processing,
increasing the total number of applications submitted to 125,000. April has also brought 5,000 new approvals
for CountyCare coverage, which brings the total number of approved applications to 94,643.
Mr. Glass stated that records indicate that a backlog of about 18,000 applications are pending with DHS at this
time. The administration is working in partnership with DHS to assess and reduce this number as much as
possible by June 30th, which is the formal end of the Waiver demonstration period.
All other trends in the program continue as they have in prior months, in terms of where applications originate
and where members are assigned.
Mr. Glass stated that on March 31st, which was the last day of enrollment for the on-line health insurance
marketplace, the CountyCare call center initiated over 1,000 applications – more than double the number
processed on a typical business day. This influx of applications is due to a misconception that Medicaid
enrollment ended with the March 31st deadline for Marketplace sign-up. Medicaid enrollment, CountyCare
enrollment, never ends. Someone who is Medicaid eligible can always sign up for coverage, and the
CountyCare call center is always available to help walk people through this process. Staff is working
aggressively to communicate this message – that Medicaid enrollment never ends – through outreach and
community partners.
Director Hammock requested that information be provided on the demographics of the 90,000 enrollees; he
also inquired whether a more comprehensive report that includes a map reflecting the applications can be
provided3. Mr. Glass responded in the affirmative.
With regard to the ongoing negotiations with IlliniCare, for the third party administrator contract, Mr. Glass
stated that the negotiations are going very well. A couple of marathon meetings were held this week, and the
parties have hammered through all of the details of the agreement. It is the administration’s hope and desire to
have an executed agreement by the end of the month.
Director Wiese, seconded by Director Gugenheim, moved to receive and file the
update on the Section 1115 Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project/CountyCare.
THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

A. Report of Emergency Purchases (Attachment #5)

Emergency Purchases. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

Background

Public Health?s immunization registry. The current system captures patient demographic information and
adolescent Tdap, MCV and HPV) and in?uenza immunization information. The web-based system allows
CDPH and to simultaneously enter patient and immunization data, and/or monitor immunization activity,
at multiple browser-equipped sites using applicable security and for access to protected health

information.

The Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Programs provide ?nancial incentives for
the ?meaningful use? of certified EHR technology to improve patient care. The development of this system helps
meet Meaningful Use requirements regarding a public health objective by having the capability to submit

electronic data to immunization registries/systems.

 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION
This discussion and analysis provides the readers of the monthly unaudited financial
statements of the Cook County Health and Hospital System (CCHHS) with an overview
of the financial activities for the month ended December 31, 2013. This discussion
focuses on the significant financial issues and major financial activities during the current
month. It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of
the CCHHS.
The CCHHS includes the following entities: John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital (JSH), Oak
Forest Health Center (OFC) Provident Hospital (PHCC), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), the Ambulatory and Community Health Network (ACHN), the Bureau of Health
Services (BHS), CORE Center (for reporting purposes part of Stroger Hospital), and
Cermak Health Services (CHS). Starting this fiscal year 2013, we have added the
Medicaid Expansion. Collectively, these entities provide primary, intermediate, acute,
and tertiary medical care to patients, without regard to their ability to pay. The Bureau of
Health Services oversees the operational, planning, and policy activities of the CCHHS.
The CCHHS is included in the reporting entity of the Cook County, Illinois, as an
enterprise fund. As an enterprise fund, the CCHHS’ financial statements are prepared
using proprietary fund accounting that focuses on the determination of changes in net
assets, financial position, and cash flows in a manner similar to private sector businesses.
The financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis of accounting, which
recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred.
In 2008 the Cook County Health and Hospital System Board was created by the Cook
County Board of Commissioners to provide independent oversight of health care
operations, and in 2010 the Cook County Board of Commissioners voted to make the
Cook County Health and Hospital System Board permanent.
In 2012 the Cook County Health and Hospitals System and Cook County Board Officials
collaborated to cut Medicaid costs, help county taxpayers, and transform Cook County’s
hospital system by jump-starting national health care reform in Cook County. In
November, 2012 the federal governmnent approved the 1115 Medicaid Waiver for Cook
County, allowing CCHHS to enroll more than 115,000 individuals who will be eligible
for Medicaid in 2014 into a Cook County network with no cost to the state of Illinois.
An Medicaid Expansion allows the Cook County’s Health System to early enroll certain
uninsured patients into Medicaid. Specifically, these are patients who are not currently
eligible for Medicaid, but who will be eligible in 2014 under the Accountable Care Act.
Many of these individuals are patients who already are being treated by our system
without compensation. The Waiver is funded entirely by the federal government.

 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (IN THOUSANDS)
The Cook County Health and Hospitals System finished the month with overall revenue
of $85,749 and overall expenses was $93,690..
Net Patient revenue for the twelve months was $74,360.
Net Patient revenue consists of all charges including automated contractual allowances
and bad debt adjustments. Write-off of Bad Debt is a CCHHS Board approved policy.
Other revenue was $9,102. Other revenue consists primarily of parking revenue.
Patient Accounts Receivable – BEPA System
Patient Accounts Receivable
General
As compared to November 30, 2013, Total Patient Accounts Receivable at the end of
December-2013 reduced by 4 to 101 days. Additionally, there was a 4 day decrease in
this figure, as compared to the previous month’s figure.
Days of Revenue Outstanding measures the average number of days charges remain in
accounts receivable after service has been rendered before collection activities have been
completed, including charity care and bad debt write-offs. Days of Revenue Outstanding
is measured in charges, not cash collections.
Days of Revenue Outstanding is a useful tool to measure collection efforts over time (i.e.,
whether this number is growing or decreasing). This number will be large due to the
large number of Self-Pay patients CCHHS services and the processes CCHHS must
complete before patient accounts are collected or written-off to bad debt. These
processes include, but are not limited to, the following:






Making an effort to attain third-party insurance coverage, including 1115 waiver
and MANG applications;
Processing charity care applications;
Sending three (3) monthly statements before accounts are turned over to
collections;
Placing accounts bi-monthly with the collection agency; and
Permitting patients to pay their account balances over time (time payment).

Total billed accounts declined by $18.226M (-5.7%) as compared to the November-2013
balance. The decline in this figure indicates an increasing number of accounts are
completing the collection process, which includes charity care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
upon the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity

 care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Inpatient Accounts Receivable
Discharged Not Final Billed
Inpatient discharged but not final billed accounts at the end of December-2013 decreased
by $0.208M (-2.5%), as compared the November 30, 2013 balance. This decrease
indicates that more inpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as compared to the
previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based

care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Billed Inpatient Accounts
Billed inpatient accounts at the end of December-2013 increased by $0.575M (0.4%) as
compared to the November 30, 2013 balance.
The increase in this number indicates fewer accounts had the collection process
completed than in the previous month and that a lower number of accounts are being
removed from active accounts receivable. CCHHS’ collection process includes charity
care and bad debt write-offs.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts, as
Medicaid pays CCHHS’ claims on a per-diem and Medicare pays CCHHS’ claims based
up on the diagnosis, regardless of charges on the patient accounts. Additionally, charity
care and bad debt write-offs are part of the collection process and will not result in actual
cash collections. Finally, the reimbursement for 1115 Waiver patients is made through a
per-member-per-month payment, not a claim-by-claim basis.
Outpatient Accounts Receivable
Unbilled Outpatient Accounts
The balance of unbilled outpatient accounts decreased by $0.955M (-8.8%) by the end of
December-2013, as compared to the level of unbilled accounts as of November 30, 2013.
This change indicates that more outpatient accounts are moving to a “Billed” status, as
compared to the previous month.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid’s and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration.
Billed Outpatient Accounts
7
Page 32 of 62

 The billed outpatient accounts receivable at the end of December-2013 fell by $18.801M
(-11.7%), as compared to the balance as of November 30, 2013.
The reduction in this figure, as compared to the prior month’s balance, indicates a greater
number of Out-Patient accounts had their collection and write-off related activities
completed.
The reduction of internal bill-holds from 20 days to 6 days will tend to cause a growth in
the billed accounts receivable.
The change in this figure does not translate dollar-for-dollar into actual cash receipts due
to Medicaid and Medicare’s reimbursement configuration and to charity care and bad
debt write-offs.

Salaries and Wages - $39.541M
Benefits - $11.022M
Supplies - $7.374M
Purchased Services, Rental, and Other - $30.748M
Insurance - 2.058M
Depreciation - $2.815M
Utilities - $0.132M
Nonoperating Revenue was $10.569M. The largest portions of this are attributed to
property tax in the amount of $3.312M. Sales tax revenues are recognized by CCHHS
when earned; this occurs when the underlying sales transactions occur. The amount
recorded as Due from State of Illinois - Sales Tax represents the amounts earned by
CCHHS, however, the cash is not yet received from the state. There is a 3 months lag
from the time of the underlying sales transaction to the receipt of funds.

 Taxes collected for the Health to date have been fully credited to the Health Fund except
as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the CCHHS
financial statements. CCHHS basic monthly unaudited financial statements are comprised
of fund financial statements.
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The CCHHS, like other
state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

The OFHC FFS budget has been combined with the SHCC FFS budget due to the configuration of CCHHS system that treats OFHC as a SHCC clinic.

The Medicaid fee-for-service revenue through the IGT covers the period beginning week ended 11/20/13 - 12/11/2013.
Vendor Payments From Revenue are payments out of revenue posted by the County Comptroller. Pharmacy Billing and Revenue Enhancement
payments are reductions to Medicaid revenue. Collection Agency payments are reductions to Self-Pay (Other) revenue. Physician Billing
payments include refunds processed by CCHHS. Included in the "Revenue Enhancement" totals are payments to the state for supplemental
workers hired to help clear the Medicaid backlog.
The Meaningful Use budget is spread over 12 months, as it is not known in which month this payment will be received. Meaningful Use includes
both the Medicare and Medicaid portions.

Page 51 of 62

Revenue Enhancement includes the fee CCHHS pays the state for the additional state workers that process CountyCare and MANG applications.
