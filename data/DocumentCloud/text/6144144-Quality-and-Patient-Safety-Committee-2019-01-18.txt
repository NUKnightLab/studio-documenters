Recommendations, Discussion / Information Item
A. Strategic planning discussion: Quality Measures (continued)
During the review of the measures and data, Board Chair Hammock recommended that the column in the
data charts that show the comparison to national mean should instead reflect whether Stroger Hospital’s
results are better or otherwise than the national mean, rather than “above” or “below.”
Following the discussion, Board Chair Hammock observed that this is a great programmatic approach;
however, he did not hear a lot about financial impact. He thinks the organization has to be realistic in the
following two (2) ways: 1) each initiative needs to have a candid cost benefit review; and 2) in
cooperation with the Chief Financial Officer, the administration should determine a sum of money that
could be used to fund key initiatives, and get that on the budget prospect for the year.

VI.

Closed Meeting Items
A. Medical Staff Appointments/Re-appointments/Changes
B. Claims, Litigation and Quality and Patient Safety Matters
C. Matters protected under the federal Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 and

 Definition of Health Care Quality

the degree to which health care services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood
of desired health outcomes and are consistent with professional knowledge" (IOM, 2001, p. 44}.

The six dimensions of quality are:
- Safety: Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.

Effectiveness: Providing services loased on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and
refraining from services to those not likely to loenefit.

- Patient-centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient
preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions.

- Timeliness: Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for looth those who receive and
those who give care.

- Efficiency: Avoiding waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy.

- Equity: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such
as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic status.
