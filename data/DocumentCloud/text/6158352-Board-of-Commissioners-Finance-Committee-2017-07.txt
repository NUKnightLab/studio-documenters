BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter 38 Health and
Human Services, Division 1, Sec. 38-113 through Sec. 38-144 of the Cook County Code, is hereby
amended as follows:

Page 61 of 66

 DIVISION 1. – GENERALLY
***

Sec. 38-113. - Duties.
The Medical Examiner has and shall exercise the powers, duties, responsibilities, functions
and authority provided by ordinance for those purposes and functions. Any abuse by the Medical
Examiner of the authority contained in this ordinance [article] shall be deemed cause for removal.
***
Sec. 38-132. - Identified body; public disposition.
Where the Medical Examiner has no legal reason for retaining a body and an authorized
person cannot or will not assume responsibility for final disposition of the decedent within 30
days of the death of the decedent, the Medical Examiner shall have the authority to dispose of
the body by public disposition. Notwithstanding the above, where the decedent's next of kin
objects to public disposition by donation to science prior to transfer of the body, the Medical
Examiner's Office shall have the authority to dispose of the body by cremation. Disposition of
fetal remains may be by burial when available or by cremation.
***
Sec. 38-136. - Permission to embalm.
In the interest of public health and hygiene and the preservation of the dignity of the deceased,
anybody any body that is stored in the facility more than three days after death may be embalmed
at the discretion of the Medical Examiner without the permission of the deceased person's nextof-kin.
***
Sec. 38-139. - Permit required for cremation.
(a) Where the remains of any dead human body are to be cremated, thus becoming
unavailable for later examination, it shall be the duty of the funeral director or person having
custody of the dead human body to obtain from the Medical Examiner a Ppermit to Ccremate.
(b) The Medical Examiner may deny a Ppermit to Ccremate, if it is necessary to preserve
the body for law enforcement purposes.
Page 62 of 66

 (c) The Medical Examiner's Ppermit shall be presented to the local registrar in applying for
the permit for disposition of a dead human body provided for in 410 ILCS 535/21 of the "Vital
Records Act," as heretofore or hereafter amended.
(d) No crematory shall cremate a dead human body unless a permit for disposition of a dead
human body with an attached Medical Examiner's Ppermit to Ccremate has been furnished to
authorize the cremation.
***
Sec. 38-144. - Fees.
The Medical Examiner shall charge the following fees with the amounts as set in Section 321 of this Code.
(1) Autopsy report.
(2) Toxicology report.
(3) Miscellaneous reports, including artist's drawings, but not including police reports.
(4) Permit to Ccremate a dead human body obtained from the Office of the Medical Examiner,
by facsimile or electronic filing, unless the Medical Examiner determines that the
decedent and the authorized person is indigent and unable to pay the permit fee, or other
special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's discretion.
(5) Return fee. The return fee is charged to funeral homes that pick up bodies from the Medical
Examiner's Office and then request to return them to the Office after determining that the
family has no funds for burial. This cost would include the cost of the burial shell and the
burial cost.
(6) Death certificate amendment fee. Fee is charged if the amendment is made later than one
year of the person's death (due to a return by Ffuneral Hhome). The Office of the Medical
Examiner is charged by the Illinois Department of Vital Records for amendments made
to a death certificate after one year of the death.
(7) Storage fee. This fee covers bodies returned (by funeral homes) to the Office of the
Medical Examiner for storage while families secure funds for burial services and bodies
brought to the Medical Examiner's Office from hospice, nursing homes, and hospitals for
cases not falling under Medical Examiner jurisdiction as defined in Section 38-118. The
ability to accept cases for storage will be at the discretion of the Medical Examiner and
will depend on the current and anticipated morgue census. This "storage fee" discourages
the use of the Office of the Medical Examiner as a storage location for non-Medical
Page 63 of 66

 Examiner cases or cases that have been discharged from the Medical Examiner's Office
to funeral homes and encourages funeral directors to verify that families have funds for
burial prior to removing a body from the Office of the Medical Examiner. In the cases of
funeral homes, this "storage fee" would replace the "return fee" if a funeral home returns
a body and picks it up again within ten days. If the body being stored is not picked up
within ten days from the date of storage, the body will be disposed of in accordance with
Sec. 38-132. held and buried by the County according to the standard operating procedures
of the Medical Examiner
(8) Photographs, radiographs, and histology slides.
(9) Charge to non-County owned hospitals for the acceptance of fetal remains not falling
under the jurisdiction of the Medical Examiner.
(10) Confirmation of death letter.
(11) Tissue procurement morgue use fee. Fee charged to a certified facility or program seeking

providing student and resident rotations at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset the
County's costs for disposable supplies as well as the staff time supervising the rotation.
(13) Staff supervision of external experts. Fee charged to individuals requesting to review
slides, images and/or records at the Medical Examiner's Office to offset staff costs for
supervising such review.
(14) Toxicology send-out fees. Fee charged for processing, packaging and shipping specimens
to reference labs at the request of the decedent's next-of-kin for testing.
(15) Lab use fee. Fee charged to institutions authorized by the Medical Examiner and County

(16) Expert witness fees. Fees will be charged to attorneys for case review, expert consultation
and trial/deposition time for the Chief Medical Examiner, Assistant Chief Medical
Examiner Assistant Medical Examiners, and Toxicologists for Medical Examiner cases
leading to civil litigation. The Chief Medical Examiner shall be authorized to waive or
reduce said fees where warranted and shall be authorized to issue regulations regarding
expert witness fees. Such fees will not apply to criminal proceedings related to Medical
Examiner cases.
Page 64 of 66

 (17) Cremation Ffee. Fee charged for cremation and storage of decedents cremated and stored
by Cook County. Cremation fees shall be paid to the Cook County Medical Examiner

fee, or other special circumstances warrant fee waiver in the Medical Examiner's
discretion.
