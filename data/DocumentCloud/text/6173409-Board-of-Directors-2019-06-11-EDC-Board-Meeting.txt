PROJECTS
DDA FUNDING, CITY GENERAL FUND AND BOND FUND REQUEST: RIVERFRONT ASSET
PLAN AND ADMINISTRATION
Ms. Pavelko advised that in 2017, the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit
(the “EDC”) sold land located in the Waterfront East Project Plan Area to the Michigan Department
of Natural Resources. In connection with the sale of land, the City of Detroit (the “City”) and the
EDC agreed to grant the sale proceeds totaling $4,300,000 million to the City of Detroit Downtown
Development Authority (the “DDA”) under the condition that the funds be provided as a forgivable
loan to support capital improvements for the City’s Hart Plaza.
The City’s General Services Department (“GSD”) has recently requested the assistance of the
EDC and the DDA to support a comprehensive Riverfront Asset Plan (the “Planning Study”) it
hopes to undertake in 2019. The Planning Study will include Hart Plaza, Aretha Franklin
Amphitheater (formerly Chene Park), Erma Henderson Park/Marina and adjacent public land
including Jefferson village. In particular, GSD would like the EDC to administer and manage the
contract for the Planning Study. The purpose and scope of the Planning Study is further described
in the attached Exhibit A.
The City has estimated that the total cost of the Planning Study, including contingency and
administrative costs for management and implementation efforts, to be $1,263,760. It is proposed
such costs be split 50/50 between the City and the DDA.

 In connection with the EDC’s administration and management of the contract for the Planning
Study, GSD has identified $631,880 in funds from the City (the “City Funds”) for the Planning
Study. The City Funds are comprised of $181,880 of City general funds to be allocated for
administrative expenses and $450,000 of City bond proceeds to be allocated towards the
Planning Study. The remaining portion of the costs for the Planning Study totaling $631,880 is to
be funded by the DDA through its reserved funds for Hart Plaza (the “DDA Funds”).
In connection with the administration of the Planning Study, staff is requesting the EDC Board of
Directors approve the following: (i) acceptance of the City Funds pursuant to a funding agreement
between the EDC and the City, subject to City Council approval and in accordance with the
proposed terms in Exhibit B; (ii) acceptance of the and DDA Funds pursuant to a funding
agreement between the EDC and DDA, subject to the approval of the DDA Board of Directors;
and (iii) authorization to amend the EDC’s Professional Services Agreement with the Detroit
Economic Growth Corporation (“DEGC”) allowing DEGC staff to provide the EDC with additional
administrative services over three years totaling $363,760 to administer the Planning Study.
A resolution was included for the Board’s consideration.
Ms. Bruhn asked if the plans will come back to the Board for final approval. Ms. Pavelko
responded that the EDC will be the sponsor of the plan. We will hire a staff person to manage
the Plan. An RFP will be issued, and staff will have a collective review of the proposals received.
Once a contractor is selected, it will be brought back to the EDC Board for approval. A
presentation will be given to the Board on the Plan.
Mr. Osei asked if the EDC is acting as a pass-through. Ms. Navin stated that we are not using
any EDC funds, but EDC is not just a pass-through because it will be contracting with and
managing the contractor. Our staff will be involved and there will be other stakeholders involved
as well, including the City because the City is partially funding it, and the DDA..
Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Bruhn, seconded by Mr. Hodge, Resolution Code EDC 19-06-52-12
was unanimously approved
Ms. Bruhn requested that the Board be kept apprised when there are some benchmarks along
the way, like when there are public meetings or if there is an interim report.
ADMINISTRATION
EDC Budget for FY 2019-2020
Ms. Kanalos advised that the proposed FY 2019-2020 EDC budget and resolution adopting the
budget was included in the Board material for review and approval. She advised that we were
unable to convene a Finance Committee meeting, but the Finance Committee Chair gave
approval for the budget to be placed on the agenda.

 Mr. Long reviewed the budget for the benefit of the Board and responded to questions.
Subsequent to the discussion, the Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Stallworth, seconded by Mr. Roling, Resolution Code EDC 19-06-01204 was unanimously approved.
Mr. Osei asked that each of the transfers be reflected on the budget as separate line items to
avoid confusion.
City of Detroit/EDC and DEGC/EDC Contracts Authorization
Ms. Kanalos advised that the Economic Development Corporation’s (the “EDC”) agreement (the
“City Agreement”) with the City of Detroit (the “City”) and the Professional Services Agreement
(the “DEGC Agreement”) with the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (the “DEGC”) will expire
on June 30, 2019.
Staff requested authorization to extend and/or execute a new City Agreement and DEGC
Agreement together with such changes recommended or required by counsel for either party, for
the period of July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020.
With respect to the City Agreement, City Council is anticipated to approve a budget allocation in
the amount of $275,000.00. $20,000 of the City Agreement will be used to operate the Next
Michigan Development Corporation.
The DEGC Agreement will be for a base compensation of $800,000.00 funded primarily from the
City Agreement allocation of $255,000.00, $350,000.00 from EDC’s Trizec Annuity, and
$195,000.00 from EDC’s Loan repayment account, plus such additional amounts authorized by
the DEGC Agreement.
A resolution was included for the Board’s consideration authorizing execution of the City
Agreement and the DEGC Agreement.
Subsequent to a discussion, the Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Stallworth, seconded by Mr. Hodge, Resolution Code EDC 19-0601-205 was unanimously approved.

affirmatively, with the exception of Mr. Quarles who was absent.
Ms. Bruhn made a motion to nominate the current slate of officers to serve another term.
Mr. Hodge seconded the motion.
Ms. Forte asked if there was a motion to approve the nominated slate of officers.

OTHER MATTERS
PUBLIC COMMENT
Ms. Forte called for public comment and informed that they would have two minutes:
Mr. John Lauve of Holly, Michigan stated the following:
“A couple of things here—this agenda, you don’t have any numbers on here. You should
at least put the budget number and this contract number. It was hard to hear what you
were saying and what the numbers were. Four hundred and fifty thousand for this
contract. The thing that bothers me about this contract is why don’t you just hire an
architect and have him oversee It, and then they have the resources and you don’t have
to get involved in hiring somebody and creating an administration for that project. Then
you’d have the depth of that architectural firm to drawn on. And you don’t have the names
of the people that are on the committee here. At City Council meetings, they have the
names of the people that are on the Council, so that would be constructive. I am just
concerned about what is happening in the city and this is an example right here. These
two buildings are on Cass Avenue and Ilitch was going to tear these things down. The
City Council stopped them, but you might notice that the windows are open and there is
just a fence around it. So, they are not doing anything. And this is disgraceful to have a
free pass for the Ilitch clan to have these blighted sites all over the city. The have the
commitment to fix the Eddystone Hotel that they made. They were supposed to have it
done a year after opening the Arena. They haven’t done anything except maybe clean
the building. It is all open windows and they just got an extension for two years more to
complete this. In the meantime, they’ve completed their Ilitch school of corruption. Now
they’re building a medical facility next to the arena with a basketball court in it.”
Mr. Forte advised Mr. Lauve that his two minutes were up and thanked him for his comments.
Ms. Joanne Warwick stated the following”
“My name is Joanne Warwick and I live in the city of Detroit. I am a returning resident.
I’ve taught school in the neighborhood I’m living in now. I am kind of horrified about what
is going on in the city. I mean there are a lot of good things but there’s a lot. I just don’t
get it. So, just a very curious thing, this real estate committee. You know there is
something strange that people are telling me they don’t know what the real estate
committee is, but, yet it is City documents, it is on a City web page and it says Detroit
Economic Growth Corporate is a part of the committee. Now, and I find it a little strange
because there are people like Melvin Hollowell who told me he didn’t know what I was
talking about, Saskia Thompson, Erica Ward Gerson, and I just find that strange because
I have a copy of some real estate meeting minutes from July 14, 2015 and Jana O’Hana

 was there, right. So, she’s the Land Bank. Jill Bryant is the Building Authority. So, this
thing exists. Now, yesterday, I was told by the Mayor’s office that now the real estate
committee only consists of Matt Walters, whose mother, by the way, is on the Board of the
Land Bank. So, anyway, to the extent that you all have anything to do with what is going
on in the neighborhoods, please understand that there is a serious lack of community
engagement and I just find that highly disturbing, because really a lot of what is going on
violates the Detroit City Charter. The Land Bank, set up by Section 4-112, City Council is
supposed to be approving the disposition of properties, not Mike Duggan or whoever it is
on this real estate committee, because documents on the City’s web page and the Land
Bank finally say it. So, just wanted you to know that nuisance abatement that the Land
Bank is doing is…”
Mr. Forte advised Ms. Warwick that her two minutes were up and thanked her for her comments.
ADJOURNMENT
With there being no further business to come before the Board, on a motion by Ms. Bruhn,
seconded by Ms. Clayson, Ms. Forte adjourned the meeting at 9:02 a.m.
