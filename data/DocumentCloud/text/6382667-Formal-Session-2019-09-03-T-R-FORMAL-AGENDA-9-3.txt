In Memoriam

May 23, 1929 July 19, 2019

Loriess Delores (Boyd) Sisco was born May 23, 1929 to the union of the late Irene
Thomas and Henry Boyd in Mobile, Alabama. She is the oldest of twelve children; and

Loriess completed her educational studies at the local school system. At the age of
eighteen, she met and married the love of her life, Ernest T. Sisco, Jr. The loving couple
migrated north to Detroit, Michigan in the 1940?s to take advantage of the opportunities
in the auto industry; and

The couple originally lived on Maybury Grand, before the houses were bought out for
the expansion of what is now 1-94. Later they moved to 3845 VinewoodI in 48208 where
she would raise her eight children and enjoy her golden years; and

Loriess was a successful homemaker and house wife for twenty years before entering
the workforce and ultimately retiring in the mid 1990?s as a Nurse?s Aide at the
Eastwood Convalescent Center. Her experience raising her eleven brothers and sisters
in the south and her own eight children gave her the knowledge, compassion and
discipline to make her a valued family matriarch, community member and employee;
and

Loreiss Delores Sisco, eldest sibling of twelve, mother of eight, grandmother of twenty
and great-grandmother of eleven, made her transition peacefully on Friday, July 19,
2019, surrounded by family who loves her dearly. She will be missed by a host of
family, friends and connections she made throughout her full and lively lifetime.
THEREFORE BE IT

Council Member Raquel Casta?eda?Lo?pez and the entire Detroit City Council extend
our sincere sympathy to the family, friends and community of the late Loreiss Delores
Sisco. Our thoughts and prayers are with you as you cherish her memory and continue
to build her legacy.

40 Years of Dedicated Service

WHEREAS, In April 2019, CHIEF ANTHONY HOLT celebrated his 40?h anniversary with the Wayne State
University Police Department. A native Detroiter and son of a church minister, HOLT has deep

Detroit Police, the Wayne County Sheriff, Detroit Medical Center police, and others. CHIEF
HOLT has brought in a different method of policing, using COMPSTAT data-driven technology,
surveillance cameras, and other high-tech devices. The campus police use the data to track crime
reports, plot incidents onmaps and zero in on patterns so decisions can be made on how to eliminate
?hot spots? of criminal activity. At Wayne State, the crime-?ghting initiatives are working the
force?s quick response times and commitment to public safety have created an increasing
counterweight to crime in the area; and

WHEREAS, CHIEF ANTHONY HOLT is widely respected throughout the law enforcement community as a
disciplined leader and consummate professional with the proven ability to deliver results. NOW,
THEREFORE BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Detroit City Council and Council President Brenda Jones, hereby congratulates and
commends CHIEF ANTHONY HOLT for his signi?cant contributions to the Wayne State
University Police Department and the City of Detroit.
