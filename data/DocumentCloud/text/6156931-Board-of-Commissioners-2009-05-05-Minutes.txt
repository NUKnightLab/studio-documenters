HONORING THE LIFE OF ARTURO VELÁSQUEZ
WHEREAS, Almighty God in His infinite wisdom has called Arturo Velásquez from our midst and into

WHEREAS, Mr. Velásquez was born in Tototlan, Jalisco in Mexico in 1915 and emigrated with his
parents to Gary, Indiana at the age of 8; Mr. Velásquez’ father, who owned a business in Mexico, soon
returned to Mexico; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Velásquez and his mother, who remained in Gary, Indiana, suffered through the
depression. Due to a lack of food, Mr. Velásquez and his mother attempted to return to Mexico; however,
a road accident in New Mexico prevented the Velásquez family from reaching their native Mexico.
Broke and stranded, Mr. Velásquez’ mother became a farm worker and migrated between sugar beet
fields in South Dakota and tomato farms in Minnesota and Iowa before finally settling in Chicago; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Velásquez attended thirteen grammar schools throughout his mother’s migration
through the sugar beet and tomato fields, and finally graduated from Haines Elementary School in

WHEREAS, on March 6, 2008, in recognition of Mr. Velásquez’ many contributions to the Mexican and

renamed West Side Technical Institute as the Arturo Velásquez West Side Technical Institute; and
WHEREAS, in 1999, Arturo Velásquez was also given the “El Reconocimiento OHTL” award from the
Mexican government – the highest award given by the Mexican government to a Mexican living outside
of Mexico; and
WHEREAS, the most thorough and most voluminous resolution or writing depicting the life of Mr.
Velásquez could never truly express or reflect the vastness and breadth of Mr. Velásquez’ commitment to
the Mexican and Latino community and his generosity to those less fortunate; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Velásquez is survived by his wife Shirley, his 4 children, 11 grandchildren, 19 greatgrandchildren, and his siblings, Marina, Eliseo, Josefina, and Elisia.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that Arturo

WHEREAS, on May 3, 1791 the Parliament of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ratified a
democratic constitution; this democratic constitution was the first in Europe, and the second in the world,
after that of the United States of America, which was adopted in 1788; and
WHEREAS, the constitution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth allowed for political equality
between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government,
thereby tempering the worst abuses of serfdom; and
WHEREAS, King Stanislaw August Poniatowski described the May 3, 1791 Constitution as “founded
principally on those of England and the United States of America, but avoiding the faults and errors of
both, and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country”; and
WHEREAS, the May 3, 1791 Constitution reflects Enlightenment influences, in particularly the
separation and balance of powers so that, in the language of Article V, “the integrity of the states, civil
liberty and social order remain always in equilibrium”; and
WHEREAS, Chicago hosts the largest Constitution Day Parade outside of Poland, and the Polish
American community in Cook County contributes substantially to the vibrancy of the culture and
economy of Cook County.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, on April 9, 2009 the Cook County Health & Hospitals System Board (“System Board”)
adopted the Procurement Policy for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System (“System”); and
WHEREAS, the System Board took this action pursuant to the Ordinance Establishing the Cook County
Health & Hospitals System (“Enabling Ordinance”) which expressly provides that the System Board shall
have the authority over all procurement and contracts for the System, and further provides that the System
may exercise this authority, in whole or in part, pursuant to its discretion; and
WHEREAS, as the System’s Interim Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), David R. Small, stated in a letter
to the Board of Commissioners dated April 20, 2009, the System Board has stated that it is genuinely
committed to the County’s policy to promote equal opportunity in its procurement process and has
expressly set forth in the System’s new Procurement Policy that Protected Class Enterprises shall
participate in not less than 35 percent of the annual aggregate value of all contracts awarded by the
System; and
WHEREAS, in furtherance of its mission to ensure sound fiscal management of all aspects of the
System, the System has issued a Request for Proposal (“RFP”) for the System’s participation in a Group
Purchasing Organization (“GPO”), a purchasing consortia that the Systems argues is in the best interest of
the System and its patients; and
WHEREAS, numerous local small business owners who are certified as Minority and Women Owned
Business Enterprises (“M/WBEs”) oppose the System’s use of a GPO stating that it would eliminate their
ability to do business with the County because GPOs shut out small M/WBE businesses and offer
opportunities only to majority corporations who pay to participate in GPO contracts; and
WHEREAS, as an example of this exclusion, the M/WBE business owners allege that a vendor currently
supplying pharmaceuticals to the System through a contract previously approved by the County Board
has not met its M/WBE participation goals as agreed to in its contract; and
WHEREAS, the System disputes this allegation, stating that the County Board approved a reduced
M/WBE participation goal of 3 percent due to the stringent manufacture and delivery standards for the
purchase of pharmaceuticals and the vendor is satisfying this participation; and
WHEREAS, the Director of the Office of Contract Compliance states a different finding in a
Memorandum to the Chair of Contract Compliance, dated April 20, 2009, concluding that the
pharmaceutical vendor’s 3% goal has not been met.

1376

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that in an effort to protect the integrity of the M/WBE
Ordinance and the impact utilization of GPOs will have on M/WBEs, the Contract Compliance
Committee of the Cook County Board will convene a public hearing and will request to hear testimony
from the following: Warren Batts, Chairman, System Board; David R. Small, Interim System CEO;
Leslie Duffy, System Chief Procurement Officer; Betty Hancock Perry, Director of the Office of Contract
Compliance; and representatives from the M/WBE small business community, as well as from other
members of the public.

REQUESTING A NO-COST PILOT PROGRAM FOR
REVERSE AUCTION E-PROCUREMENT SOLUTION
WHEREAS, the FY2009 budget process again saw substantial cuts, with an across-the-board 4% budget
cut for all departments and elected officials with the exception of court ordered programs, and a 2% cut
for the Cook County Health & Hospitals System; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government must continue to undertake serious efforts to create efficiencies
in the delivery of its services, not solely because of the current difficult economic situation the country is
faced with, but because it is the duty of this Honorable Body to ensure that taxpayers’ money is invested
wisely and that this government is doing everything in its power to continually identify cost savings and
streamlining opportunities in order to deliver quality services in the most efficient and cost effective
manner possible; and

1377

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
WHEREAS, online reverse auctions have been successfully used in the private sector procurement
process for over a decade; and
WHEREAS, reverse auctions have evolved to be able to meet the public sector procurement
requirements, which leads to increased savings, more efficient operations and decreased expenditures; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the increased savings, online reverse bidding solutions enable a transparent
process capable of being monitored in real-time; creates increased competition; improves vendor
participation; reduces procurement time cycle and government administrative costs; creates an audit trail
and reporting efficiencies; and creates a disaster recovery archive; and
WHEREAS, online reverse auction providers can deliver a real-time, secure, web-based electronic
bidding process with all of the above mentioned benefits all at no cost to the governmental entity, with
fees being paid by the successful bidder; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois is now considering using said bidding solution to streamline its
procurement process, with the passing of House Bill 379, which has now moved to the Senate for further
consideration; and
WHEREAS, the City of Chicago has already completed a similar pilot program and is currently seeking
to expand the service, allowing all City of Chicago Departments to participate, with the same goal of
streamlining its procurement process and saving taxpayer dollars.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request that the Purchasing Department conduct a no-cost to the County pilot program for a
reverse auction e-procurement solution with the goal of qualifying and quantifying the efficiencies
created using this procurement solution and the accompanying savings; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the pilot program should have a duration of 12 months and include
no less than six procurements using the online reverse auction solution with three of the six procurements
consisting of one each of the following categories: services, commodities and construction.
Approved and adopted this 5th day of May 2009.

REQUESTING THE INTEGRATION OF
ORGANIC ENHANCING PRODUCTS TO TREAT ROAD SALT
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department has the responsibility of designing and maintaining
over 573 center line miles of highways, many of which, are part of the major arterial network that leads to
and from area expressways and toll roads, including two-lane highways, and has maintenance
responsibilities for 1,478 lane miles of pavement and 132 bridges, 351 traffic signals and 7 pumping
stations from five maintenance garages throughout Cook County; and
WHEREAS, snow removal, anti-icing and de-icing applied measures on all highways, bridges and roads
under the jurisdiction of Cook County are the responsibility of the Cook County Highway Department;
and
WHEREAS, de-icing is a reactive snow and ice control strategy that involves the application of a
chemical, most commonly road salt, on top of a layer of snow, ice, or frost that has already bonded to the
surface of the pavement; and
WHEREAS, anti-icing is a proactive strategy in which snow and ice control materials are applied before
a snow, ice or frost event, preventing precipitation from bonding with the pavement surface; and
WHEREAS, rates of application of road salt vary from 25 lbs to 400 lbs per lane mile with more road
salt per lane mile used the lower the actual temperature or forecasted temperature and the heavier
precipitation type; and
WHEREAS, up to 80 percent of untreated road salt is lost with traffic action to the roadside environment,
while pre-wetting or pre-treating the salt with liquid chemicals has proven to help the material “stick” to
the roadway; and
WHEREAS, the Median Cost per Ton of road salt has increased from $36 USD in 2003 to $120 USD in
2008 in the United States, with a final cost to Cook County during the 2008 winter of $125 per ton, a total
expense of four million dollars over the estimated budget for road salt; and

1379

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
WHEREAS, according to the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 577,
published in 2007 and sanctioned by the National Academy of Sciences, all snow and ice control
materials can affect the environment with roadway application being the primary source of runoff,
causing significant localized effects; and
WHEREAS, the same report states that Chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcing steel from the use of
road salt is the most widely occurring cause of concrete deterioration, posing the highest risk to structural
integrity because it causes a very localized attack on the steel, resulting in high cost for maintenance and
repairs. Chloride-induced corrosion is also the primary cause of bridge steel structural corrosion; and
WHEREAS, loss of capital related to corrosion damage from the snow and ice control chemicals on
water supplies, health, vegetation, highway structures, vehicles, and underground utilities exceed 15 times
the amount of money spent on purchasing and applying said chemicals; and
WHEREAS, according to the NCHRP report, snow and ice-control organic products used in conjunction
with road salt, have demonstrated significant corrosion inhibiting characteristics as well as increased
overall product performance; and
WHEREAS, the use of snow and ice-control organic enhancers in conjunction with road salt, has proven
to be a cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional snow and ice-control products
by improving the road salt performance, reducing overtime costs, preventing corrosion and reducing the
overall environmental impact; and
WHEREAS, several Counties in Illinois have seen at least 20% savings in their cost of road salt by
integrating organic enhancers, including Du Page County for the last two years, Lake County for the
last three years, McHenry County for the last seven years, Winnebago County for the last year, Jo Daviess
County for the last five years, Peoria County for the last two years, Henry County for the last four years
and Knox County for the last four years; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department currently does not use organic enhancers in
conjunction with road salt for snow and ice-control.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby request that the Highway Department start the process of integrating organic enhancing products
to treat road salt provided that said products lower the cost to Cook County for snow removal and icecontrol expenses related to road salt usage, and equipment and structural maintenance for FY 2009 and
future years.

WHEREAS, the holiday of Cinco de Mayo commemorates the victory of the Mexican militia over the
French army at The Battle of Puebla, Mexico, 100 miles east of Mexico City, on the morning of May 5,
1862; and
WHEREAS, lead by Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguin, a small, poorly armed militia estimated
at 4,500 men demonstrated their courage and sacrifice for freedom by stopping and defeating a well
outfitted French army of 6,500 soldiers, which had known no defeat for almost 50 years, therefore
postponing the invasion of the country for a full year; and

1385

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
WHEREAS, this victory was a glorious moment for Mexican patriots, helping develop a needed sense of
national unity and pride; and
WHEREAS, according to a paper published by the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and
Culture in 2007, about the origin of the observance of Cinco de Mayo in the United States, the modern
American focus on this holiday first started in California in 1863 in response to the resistance to French
rule in Mexico, and has since been celebrated continuously while virtually ignored in Mexico, where it is
celebrated mainly in the southern town of Puebla and a few larger cities, and has to this day not been
recognized as a federal holiday, and
WHEREAS, celebrating Cinco de Mayo has become increasingly popular in parts of the U.S. that have a
high population of Americans of Mexican ancestry, making of this holiday a celebration of Mexican
culture, food, music, beverage and customs unique to Mexico; and
WHEREAS, the cultural impact of the Cinco de Mayo holiday is evident in more than 150 official
celebrations in towns across the U.S. that are predominately non-Hispanic, and
WHEREAS, over 70% of Hispanics living in Cook County are of Mexican descent and make numerous
cultural and economic contributions to the growth and development of our county.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby join in the celebration of Cinco de
Mayo, and encourage all Cook County residents to join in this celebration of the Mexican culture and

WHEREAS, the latest FY2008 data from the Illinois Secretary of State indicates that Cook County has
3,490,693 registered vehicles or 2,590,316 more than the next closest county; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department was established in 1913 by the State of Illinois upon
approval of the first officially recorded County highway system maps; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department has the responsibility of designing and maintaining
over 573 center line miles of highways, many of which, are part of the major arterial network that leads to
and from area expressways and toll roads, including multi-lane highways, and has maintenance
responsibilities for 1,478 lane miles of pavement, 132 bridges, 351 traffic signals throughout Cook
County and seven pumping stations from five maintenance garages; and
WHEREAS, many municipalities of Cook County, including Chicago, have or will receive millions of
dollars in Federal Stimulus monies for road construction and maintenance projects; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Highway Department will only receive $213,000 in Federal Stimulus
money; and
WHEREAS, the County, therefore, must rely solely on the monies it receives from the State of Illinois
through the Motor Fuel Tax (MFT) receipts, which is almost exclusively the funding source for County
highway projects, and the local gas tax to maintain its roads and bridges; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s share of the MFT fund, per State statute, is 16.74% due to its status as the
only County in Illinois with over 1,000,000 or more inhabitants; and
WHEREAS, in the coming years, several other Illinois counties may also reach the 1,000,000 inhabitant
milestone, and consequently Cook County’s share of the MFT fund could be substantially cut; and
WHEREAS, such a drastic reduction in the County of Cook’s MFT distribution would have an adverse
effect on the County Highway Department’s ability to fulfill its mission; and
WHEREAS, Cook County’s status as the most populous County by far, in Illinois, as well as having the
most registered vehicles and the most frequently used roads and bridges under its jurisdiction should be
recognized and consequently funded appropriately and reliably.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby urge that the Illinois General Assembly, amend Chapter 35 ILCS 505/8 (e) (2) (B) as follows:
16.74% to the counties of the State having 1,000,000 3,000,000 or more inhabitants; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that by enacting said amendment the State of Illinois will ensure that
the Cook County Highway Department will have a reliable and steady funding source; and

1387

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body encourages the State of Illinois to increase its
funding of the Cook County Highway Department for the successful operation of its critical mission for
the foreseeable future.

WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day is different from Memorial Day and Veterans Day; Memorial Day is for
remembering those who died in uniform, those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country;
Veterans Day is for paying tribute to all of those who have ever worn a military uniform in service of our
country, past and present; and
WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day recognizes the men and women of the Armed Forces throughout the
world, including the young adults who have just joined the military and face the real possibility of going

Antonio, Texas; at Fort Dix, New Jersey; at Parris Island, South Carolina; at the Navy's Great Lakes
facility in Illinois; or at one of the other basic training sites the services operate; and
WHEREAS, Armed Forces Day is an occasion to remember those who are now faced with making the
tough decision as to whether to continue to serve their Country; they are weighing the demands that
continued military service brings, whether they are active duty or one of our Citizen Airmen or Citizen
Soldiers who serve in the Reserves or National Guard; and

and experience managing the certification of over 3,100 candidates and the layout of over 800
ballot styles was invaluable. The expiration date of the purchase order was April 8, 2009.

Commissioners approve the disbursement of funds totaling $200,000.00 from the Not-For-Profit Dispute
Resolution Fund, County Fund 531, to the Center for Conflict Resolution (Center). The Center was the
only qualifying applicant for these funds in 2008.

1498

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MAY 5, 2009
The disbursement will have no fiscal impact on Cook County since, by statute, fees from civil filings are
collected solely for this purpose. There are sufficient funds available in 531-818 Account,
Reimbursement to Designated Fund, for this purpose.
Estimated Fiscal Impact: $200,000.00. (531-818 Account).
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS
GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER NO. 2009-01
SUBJECT: ILLINOIS NOT-FOR-PROFIT DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), the Clerk
of the Circuit Court of Cook County has collected fees from civil filings for disbursement to the Dispute
Resolution Centers which qualify under said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook
County. Fees available for disbursement from this Fund for the year 2008 total $258,740.00.
Upon review of applications received for funds collected in 2008, the sole qualifying applicant
under the requirements set forth in said Act and General Order 19 of the Circuit Court of Cook County
was found to be the Center for Conflict Resolution. It is eligible for the maximum amount allowable for
disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year of $200,000.00.
Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act (710 ILCS 20/1 et seq.), any funds
collected but not disbursed in a given year shall be paid in single county judicial circuits to the County
Treasurer for the administration of justice in the judicial circuit. An amount of $58,740.00 remains
collected for the year 2008 but no other Dispute Resolution Center is qualified to receive disbursement of
these funds.
Therefore, it is hereby ordered that the amount of $200,000.00, representing the maximum
amount allowable for disbursement to any Dispute Resolution Center in a given year, shall be disbursed
to the Center for Conflict Resolution.
Further, it hereby ordered that the amount of $58,740.00 representing funds collected under the
Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Act for 2008 but not disbursed shall be paid to the Treasurer of
Cook County for the administration of justice in the Circuit Court of Cook County.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Transmitting a Communication, dated April 21, 2009 from
MARIA PAPPAS, Cook County Treasurer
by
MICHAEL J. SHINE, Chief Deputy Treasurer
submitting a proposed Taxing District Debt Disclosure Ordinance that would provide transparency in
government and further the goal of full disclosure to Taxpayers.
Taxpayers are entitled to have readily available to them full disclosure of all debts and liabilities of each
taxing district. With few exceptions, this information is prepared as a matter of course each fiscal year
and would not require additional accounting work from taxing districts.
This proposed ordinance creates a single electronic repository which would allow taxpayers to
electronically access the financial information they need to make informed decisions about the taxing
districts they support. The Treasurer's Office website would house and maintain the electronic
infrastructure where each taxing district would be able to upload their information and make that
information electronically available to taxpayers.
