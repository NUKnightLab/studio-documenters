The Information Technology Services Department is responsible for ensuring that the CHA
continuously provides a systematic and effective program for managing the life cycle of the CHA’s
records and storage to support the agency’s operations. Prudent business practices dictate having
storage and service agreements in place to ensure critical business records are maintained. Storage is a
critical factor in managing the records lifecycle and retention and in maintaining applicable compliance
standards and practices. The CHA issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) in June 2013. This RFP
competitively solicited qualified firms and/or individuals who could provide Offsite Record Storage
Services to the CHA. Of the two responses received it was determined that R4 Services LLC was the
most responsible and advantageous respondent. Accordingly, the resolution for Item 5 approves award
of contract to R4 Services for offsite record storage services.

(Item 7)
During most of the past 25 years, Habitat managed eight of CHA’s HOPE VI and several other
development grants for new mixed-income or Scattered Site Housing, including all fund
disbursements, HUD reporting, audit management, and HUD grant program closeouts. In this

Gardens, ABLA Homes, and for the Lakefront Properties. The ongoing management activities include
monthly, quarterly, and annual reports to CHA and HUD; review of predevelopment and construction
draws; funds disbursement; eLOCCS management with HUD; audit preparation; and grant closeout.
The agreement will be in an amount not to exceed $482,000 for the base term of two years, from

contracts for the CHA Housing Voucher Informal Hearing Program, in an aggregate amount not-toexceed $1,200,000. Pursuant to HUD rules and regulations, the Authority must offer an informal
hearing for certain CHA determinations relating to the individual circumstances of a participant family.
The purpose of the informal hearing is to consider whether the CHA’s decisions related to the family’s
circumstances which affect their HCV voucher, are in accordance with the law, HUD regulations and
CHA policies. The CHA is not permitted to terminate a family’s assistance until the time allowed for
the family to request an informal hearing has elapsed, and any requested hearing has been completed.
The families may contest an adverse decision in the Circuit Court of Cook County. In mid-2011 the
CHA took over the HCV informal hearing program from its HCV Contract Administrator. To conduct
the IFHP, the Office of General Counsel procured the services of a legal recruiter to assist the CHA to
recruit 15 attorneys as temporary employees to act as HCV hearing officers and presenters.

Substance Abuse Prevention Programs. CHA’s Resident Services Division is charged with supporting

part of this charge, Plan Forward: Communities that Work commits to a program addressing youth
substance abuse for at least 60 youth as an initial deliverable. These programs will build on past
substance abuse services through a pilot program in 2012, which produced promising results. CHA
offers these services in cooperation with the Chicago Department of Public Health, which contributes
up to $80,000 per year for this effort. HHCS and MFS will each implement an evidence-based
curriculum for 240 total youth between the ages of 11 and 18 in an after-school setting during the twoyear base term. The curricula focus is on developing positive knowledge and characteristics that have
been proven to decrease youth substance abuse behaviors.

By exercising the first option year of the contract, CHA will continue to support those seven youth in
their sophomore year of high school. For their junior and senior years, Link will assume the cost of the
scholarships and additional supports as funds leveraged by the two-year relationship with CHA. This
will ensure that the seven youth have consistent support throughout their high school career. In
addition, LINK will provide tutoring and parent support for approximately 23 CHA youth that enroll in
their scholarship program.

out-of-school time. To encourage youth fitness and wellness, CHA contracted with IAFC in 2013 to
provide a program for youth ages 6 to 13 based on the successful SPROUT model, which utilizes the
ReCharge fitness and wellness curriculum designed to work with the President’s Challenge, and
focuses on four core concepts: Energy In (nutrition), Energy Out (physical activity), Teamwork and
