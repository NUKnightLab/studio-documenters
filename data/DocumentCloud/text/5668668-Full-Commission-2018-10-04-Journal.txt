REPORT FROM THE CHAIRMAN
“I have a couple of items today. One we’re in the last quarter of this year, so it is time for
me to start looking forward to the first quarter of next year meaning setting the calendar for the
Commission for the upcoming year. I’m targeting Tuesday, January 8th, as the first meeting of
the New Year. That would be the organizational meeting in which this body will elect a new
chair, and I wanted to make sure that got out there as quickly as possible, but also because if
anyone has any strenuous objections to that particular date or if it conflicts, please let me
know. I have selected Tuesday instead of the usual Thursday because of the way that the
holiday falls. I don’t think we’d be prepared to come in on January 3rd and start rolling. But, if I
wait until Thursday of the second week, then we will kind of lose another full week of
productivity. There will be a lot of organizational stuff to do for whomever is the new chair to
set up committees and such, so long way of saying I’m targeting Tuesday, January 8th, if you
want to mark it on your calendars, but if anybody has any conflict or problems with that date,
466

 please contact me today. Also, I am going to take a point of personal pride and make a
presentation of a resolution to the Dearborn Press & Guide Newspaper, which this year, is
celebrating 100 years of service to the Dearborn community. Many of you probably know that I
spent nearly a quarter century, oh my God, as a journalist, most of that time at the Press &
Guide, starting while I was still in high school lasting until 1996. So 20+ years, so I have been a
part of that newspaper’s history. It began as the Dearborn Press in 1918, other newspapers
were started in Dearborn, including the Dearborn Guide, which I was originally hired into, and
the Dearborn Press merged with the Dearborn Guide in 1976 or 77. I will have to read the
resolution. It has had a lot of changes over the years, but since it is so near and dear to me,
and I think that more than ever the role of journalism in our society, in our democracy, is
emphasized. I wanted to take a point today to just ask to make this presentation during the
Chairman’s Remarks. If I could ask Dave Herndon from the Press & Guide to join me briefly at
the podium for a presentation.”
At this point in the proceedings, a presentation was made to the Dearborn Press &
Guide.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
The Acting Clerk advised that there was no Unfinished Business
