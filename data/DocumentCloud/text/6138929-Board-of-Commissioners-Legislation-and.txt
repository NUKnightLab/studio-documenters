PROPOSED RESOLUTION
SUPPORTING THE UNITED STATES CENSUS AND THE ILLINOIS COMPLETE COUNT
COMMITTEE AND ENCOURAGING COOK COUNTY TO DEVELOP ITS OWN CENSUS
OUTREACH STRATEGY
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States requires an enumeration of the population every 10 years to
apportion congressional representation among the states; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 141 of Title 13 of the United States Code, the next federal decennial census of
the population will be taken on the first day of April in 2020; and
WHEREAS, a complete and accurate count of Illinois' population is essential to the State because the census
count determines congressional representation, state redistricting, federal grant formula allocation, and the
distribution of state grant and subsidy funds for an entire decade until the next decennial census is taken; and
WHEREAS, currently there are over 63 federal programs benefiting Cook County that use census enumeration
and population numbers as part of their funding formulas, including formulas for education, health, and human
services programs; and
WHEREAS, the United States Census Bureau will endeavor to count every person in the nation, and many states
and counties will be initiating programs and initiatives to promote the census; and
WHEREAS, it is vitally important for Illinois and Cook County to do everything they can to ensure that every
resident in Illinois and Cook County is counted in the 2020 United States Census; and
WHEREAS, Cook County will work and partner with Illinois in an intergovernmental manner to support,
advance and implement the objectives and goals of Illinois Senate Joint Resolution 29, which creates the Illinois
Complete Count Commission to develop, recommend, and assist in the administration of a census outreach
strategy to encourage full participation in the 2020 federal decennial census of population required by Section 141
of Title 13 of the United States Code; and
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Members of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners that Cook County shall develop a comprehensive census outreach strategy in Cook County that
shall include, but not be limited to, Cook County agency and department initiatives to encourage participation in
the 2020 census, the establishment and support of school-based outreach programs, partnerships with
philanthropic organizations, non-profit community-based organizations, and multi-lingual, multi-media
campaigns designed to ensure an accurate and complete count of Cook County’s population; and
