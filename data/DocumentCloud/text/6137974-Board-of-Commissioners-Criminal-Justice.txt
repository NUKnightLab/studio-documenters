PROPOSED ORDINANCE
ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER 46 OF THE COOK COUNTY CODE OF ORDINANCES
CONCERNING “LAW ENFORCEMENT” BY ADDING A NEW SECTION 46-38 PROHIBITING THE USE
OF CHOKE HOLDS BY COOK COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is a Home Rule Unit of Government pursuant to the 1970 Illinois Constitution,
Article VII, Section 6; and,
WHEREAS, pursuant to its home rule power the County of Cook may exercise any power and perform any
function relating to its government and affairs, including the power to regulate for the protection of the public
health, safety, morals and welfare; and,
WHEREAS, Cook County Police Officers and those public servants under the direction of the Cook County
Sheriff strive to maintain a courteous and professional demeanor when dealing with the public, in addition to
Page 1 of 3

 and including individuals detained in Cook County Jail and the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center; and,
WHEREAS, the Cook County Sheriff trains his officers to select the appropriate level of force based on a
subject’s actions, and to modify their selection of options as the subject offers less or greater resistance; and,
WHEREAS, choke holds are largely ineffective and create the potential for a subject to panic and react with
greater resistance than he or she otherwise might deploy during an officer restraint; and,
WHEREAS, the children in the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, due to their ages, are not as likely to
appreciate the consequences of impulsively resistant behavior in the same manner as an adult inmate; and,
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Commissioners of Cook County intend to codify the Cook County
Sheriff’s commitment to a progressive and reasonable escalation and de-escalation of officer-applied force into
the County Codes and Ordinances, and further intend to expressly prohibit the use of choke holds by Cook
County police officers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE PRESIDENT AND BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF
COOK COUNTY:
SECTION 1. The above recitals are expressly incorporated herein and made part hereof as though fully set
forth herein.
SECTION 2. Chapter 46-38 of the Cook County Code of Ordinances concerning “Law Enforcement” is
hereby enacted as follows:
Sec. 46-38 Policy on Use of Force- choke holds prohibited
(a) Members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Cook County police officers as well as any private
security personnel employed by Cook County shall use an amount of force reasonably necessary based on the
totality of the circumstances to perform a lawful task, effect an arrest, overcome resistance, control a subject, or
protect themselves or others from injury. Circumstances that may govern the reasonableness of using a
particular force option include but are not limited to: (1) whether the subject poses an immediate threat to the
safety of officers or others; and (2) whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest
by flight.
(b) After gaining control of a subject, members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Cook County
police officers as well as any private security personnel employed by Cook County shall:
(1) Avoid sitting, kneeling, or standing on a subject’s chest, which may result in chest compression, thereby
reducing the subject’s ability to breathe;
(2) Position the subject in a manner to allow free breathing and, whenever feasible, avoid placing the subject on
his or her stomach;
(3) Monitor an arrestee until transported to a secure location; and,
(4) Seek medical attention for an arrestee who has injuries or illnesses consistent with Sheriff’s Department
Policy Directives.
(c) No Cook County Sheriff’s Department, Cook County police officer or private security personnel employed
by Cook County shall apply a choke hold in the performance of his or her duties unless faced with a situation in
which the use of deadly force is justified under applicable law. A choke hold shall include but is not limited to,
any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.
(d) For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the following meaning:
“Police officer” means any person who by virtue of his or her public employment is vested by law with a duty to
maintain public order or make arrests for offenses, whether that duty extends to all offenses or is limited to
specific offenses.
“Private security personnel” means a person or persons acting in the capacity of his or her employment by a
private contractor who engages in the business of providing a private security officer, watchman, patrol, guard
dog, canine odor detection or a similar service by any other title, or name on a contractual basis for another
person, firm, corporation, or other entity for a fee or other consideration and performing one or more of the
Page 2 of 3

 following functions:
(1) The prevention or detection of intrusion, entry, theft, vandalism, abuse, fire or trespass on Cook County
governmental property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law enforcement;
(2) The prevention, observation or detection of any unauthorized activity on Cook County governmental
property or private property within jurisdiction of Cook County law enforcement;
(3) The protection of persons authorized to be on the premises of the person, firm, or other entity for which the
security contractor contractually provides security services;
(4) The prevention of the misappropriation of the concealment of goods, money, stocks, bonds, notes,
documents or papers;

(5) The control, regulation, or direction of the movement of the public for the time specifically required for the
protection of the property owned or controlled by the client;
(6) The protection of individuals from bodily harm or death (body guard functions).

Effective date: This ordinance shall be in effect immediately upon adoption.
