STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE RESPONSE REGARDING
PRESIDENT AND COMMISSIONERS VA CAN CY PROCEDURES

Honorable Gregg Goslin
Commissioner -14th District
Cook County Board of Commissioners
11 8 North Clark Street, Room 567
Chicago, IL 60602

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDfNGS FOR JUNE 6, 2006

Re: President and Commissioner Vacancy Procedures
Dear Commissioner Goslin:
You have asked our office to advise you concerning the procedures authorized by law for appointing a
successor or replacement should a vacancy occur in the office of the President of the Cook County Board
of Commissioners, or in the office of one of the Cook County Commissioners. Specifically, you ask four
questions:
I address your questions in the order you pose them.
1. Should a vacancy occur in the Office of the President of the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, is the County Board authorized by law to appoint a replacement?

Section 4-8 of the Cook County Ordinance, and Section 5/2-6003 of the Counties Code, both titled,
"Vacancy in office of president," provide in pertinent part as follows:
In the case of death, resignation, removal from office or other inability to act of the
president so elected ... If less than two years and sixty days of the unexpired term remain,
the board of commissioners shall elect one of their number to serve the unexpired term of
the president.
55 ILCS 5/2-6003; Cook County Ord.§ 4-8.
Based on these authorities, the County Board is authorized to appoint a replacement to fill a vacancy in
the office of President of the Cook County Board, when less than two years and sixty days of the
unexpired term remain.

2. If the Board of Commissioners has such appointive authority, must the appointee be a current
sitting commissioner, and if so, must said Commissioner be of the same political party as the
current President?
Based on the above cited authority, the Board's appointee as President of the Board must be a sitting
commissioner, but need not be of the same political party as the President whose tenn he or she is
appointed to complete.

3. Does the law provide for a timetable for an appointment, and require anything other than a
simple majority vote on the question?
Neither of the above cited authorities provide a timetable for appointment of a President by the Board
when less than two years and sixty days remain in the unexpired tenn of the President. Since no higher
majority is required by law, the appointment may be made by a simple majority vote. See, Board Rules,
secs. 1-5, 4-5.

4. Similarly, should a vacancy occur in the office of a Cook County Commissioner, who is
authorized by law to appoint a replacement?
Section 25- 11 of the Election Code, pertaining to vacancies in elective county office, expressly pennits
home rule counties such as Cook County to provide for fi lling vacancies by ordinance, for the office of
county commissioner. See, I 0 ILCS 5/25-1 1. The County Board has exercised this authority, adopting

4

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 6, 2006

Ordinance No. 94-0-18, titled "Ordinance to Establish Qualifications for Office and Filling of Vacancies
in Single-Member Districts," on March 1, 1994. That ordinance provides in pertinent part as follows:
Section 2. Vacancies

***

(b) At all times from and after December 5, 1994, if a vacancy occurs in the Office of
Commissioner, such vacancy shall be filled by appointment of the appropriate district
committee of the political party in the County Board District of which the incumbent was
a candidate at the time of his or her election. If the incumbent Commissioner was
appointed to the position, then such vacancy shall be filled by the appropriate district
committee of the political party in the County Board District which appointed the
incumbent. The appointee shall be of the same political party that the incumbent
Commissioner was at the time of his or her election or appointment.

(c) The district committee of a County Board District shall consist of the committeemen
of each ward or township contained in whole or in part within the County Board District.
In making appointments under this Section, each committeeman of the appropriate
district committee shall be entitled to one vote for each vote that was received, in that
portion of the County Board District which he or she represents on the committee, by the
Commissioner whose seat is vacant at the general election at which the Commissioner
was elected to the seat that has been vacated (or his or her elected predecessor, if the
Commissioner whose seat was vacant was appointed) and a majority of the total number
of votes received in such general election by the Commissioner whose seat is vacant is
required for the appointment of his or her successor.
(d) Appoinhnents made under this Section shall be in writing and shall be signed by
members of the district committee whose total votes are sufficient to make the
appointments. Such appointments shall be filed with the County Clerk.
Cook County Ord. No. 94-0-18, sec. 2{b), (c) & (d).
Thus, pursuant to the above cited ordinance, " the appropriate district committee of the political party in
the County Board District of which the incumbent was a candidate at the time of his election," is the
entity authorized to appoint a replacement for vacancy in the office of Commissioner.
If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours truly,
Patrick T. Driscoll, Jr.
Deputy State's Attorney
Chief, Civil Actions Bureau

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved that the communication be received
and filed. The motion carried unanimously.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 6, 2006

WHEREAS, the members of this Board owe the 5,500,000 citizens of Cook County the fiduciary duty to
ensure that Cook County government perfonns its functions at the direction of its duly elected or
appointed public officials, this Board is presently unsure that this Board has fulfilled and is fulfilling that
duty to their constituents; and
WHEREAS, the members of this Board owe the over 300,000 citizens of 4th Cook County District the
fiduciary duty to ensure that their Cook County Commissioner is capable of and is perfonning his
functions, this Board is presently unsure that this Board has fulfilled and is fulfilling that duty to the 4th
Cook County District constituents; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Illinois law, this Cook County Board of Commissioners has the legal duty to
detennine whether a vacancy in the office of Cook County Board President or Cook County
Commissioner exists and, if so, to fill any vacancy as provided by Illinois law; and
WHEREAS, the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution provides a process for the temporary
replacement of the President of the United States during such time as the President is temporarily unable
to discharge the powers and duties of his office and likewise, Article V., Section 6(b) of the Illinois
Constitution ( 1970) provides a process for the temporary replacement of the Governor of the State of
Illinois during such time as the Governor is temporarily unable to discharge the powers and duties of his
office, Illinois law does not presently specifically provide for a temporary replacement of a County Board
President or County Commissioner during a temporary period of disability. However, this Board
concludes that the Home Rule powers of Cook County pennit Cook County to enact an ordinance to that
effect.
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED, that:

which conclude on December 4, 2006; and

4.

Further, that this Board 's presiding officer (or acting presiding officer) shall cause subpoenas to

COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
WHEREAS, The Voting Rights Act of I 965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 to I 973aa-6) has proven to be one of the
most successful and effective civil rights laws in American history; and
WHEREAS, as the Supreme Court has said, the equal right to vote 1s fundamental because it is
"preservative of all rights;" and
WHEREAS, discrimination on the basis of race persists in our nation and equal opportunity in voting
still does not exist in many jurisdictions; and
WHEREAS, in 2007, three crucial sections of the Voting Rights Act will expire unless Congress votes to
renew them; and
WHEREAS, Cook County, with its ethnic and racial diversity, commitment to equal rights and quest to
ensure fundamental fairness in the voting process, believes in the need to uphold the decree of equal
justice for all through either extending or making permanent all sections of the Voting Rights Act.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY THE COOK COUNTY BOARD OF
COMMISSIONERS, that in relation to the Voting Rights Act, the County of Cook urges Congress to:
I.

Reenact the Section 5 pre-clearance requirements consistent with the time period adopted
with the I 982 extension. These provisions directly impact nine states with a documented
history of discriminatory voting practices and local jurisdictions in seven other states by
requiring them to submit planned changes in their election laws or procedures to the U.S.
Department of Justice of the District Court in Washington, D.C. for pre-approval; and

2.

Renew Section 203 and 4(f)4 so that new citizens and other Americans who are limited in
their ability to speak English can continue to receive assistance when voting. These
provisions currently impact over 466 local jurisdictions across 31 states; and

3.

Renew Sections 6 to 9, which authorize the attorney general to appoint election monitors
and poll watchers. The need for such monitors and poll watchers is paramount to the

147

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 6, 2006

conduct of a free and meaningful democracy. These monitors attend and observe voting
and vote-counting procedures during elections. They watch, listen, and take careful notes
of everything that happens inside the polling place during an election, and are also trained
not to interfere with the election in any way. They prepare reports that may be filed in
court, and they can serve as witnesses in court if the need arises; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this Resolution be delivered to the President of
the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the
Minority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Minority Leader of the
House of Representatives and all members of Congress representing Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Resolution shall take effect on the date of its passage and
approval.

Approved and adopted this 6th day of June 2006.

RESOLUTION

Transmitting a Communication, dated April 28, 2006 from
DOROTHY BROWN, Clerk of the Circuit Court
On behalf of the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Information Systems (CCICJJS) Committee, I
am respectfully requesting that the due date for the CCICJIS Detailed Plan of Action be revised from July
13, 2006 to the new date of December 31, 2006.
The Cook County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution 04-R-257 at the Board Meeting of July
13, 2004 that: I) augmented the membership of the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Infonnation
Systems (CCICJIS) Committee and 2) charged the CCICJIS Committee with the development of a
detailed plan of action to support the Cook County Criminal Justice Strategic Plan. The current target
completion date for this detailed plan of action is July 13, 2006. I am happy to report that, although there
have been various delays, we are making good progress towards the development of this detailed plan of
action. However, because of these delays, the subcommittee chairpersons, who are playing key roles on
this project, have asked me, as Chair of the CCICJ IS Committee, if the completion date can be extended
to December 31 , 2006.
The concern of this cross-agency group is that the quality of the detailed plan of action should meet or
exceed the high level of quality established with the development of the strategic plan; and that the
additional time will better position us to achieve this goal. l agree with their concern, and additionally

148

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 6, 2006
recognizing that these individuals also have full time commitments to their respective job duties and
responsibilities, I fully support establishing a new due date.
Further, on behalf of the CCICJIS Committee, I commit that we will deliver a detailed plan of action that
the Cook County Board of Commissioners can be proud of and one that provides us with a roadmap to
achieving the overarching goals of an integrated criminal justice enterprise: complete, accurate, timely
and accessible criminal infonnation to all stakeholders within the justice environment, resulting in
enhanced public safety while protecting the civil liberties of the Cook County citizenry.
WHEREAS, the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Resolution, Agenda Item #79, dated April 23,
2002, established the Cook County Integrated Criminal Justice Information Systems (CCICJIS)
Committee; and
WHEREAS, the CCICJIS Committee was comprised of the major criminal justice stakeholders of Cook
County and the State of Illinois; and
WHEREAS, the Committee was charged with the development of a high-level strategic plan for an
integrated criminal justice information enterprise for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the CCICJIS Strategic Plan was submitted to the Cook County Board of Commissioners
May 1, 2003; and
WHEREAS, the CCICJIS Strategic Plan detailed the eight strategic issues of Governance, Data
Custodianship, Integration, Privacy, Standards, Infrastructure, Biometrics, and Funding, all which have a
direct impact on the development of an integrated criminal justice enterprise for Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the recommended next step in realizing the goals of an integrated criminal justice enterprise
for Cook County is to proceed with the development of a Detailed Plan of Action, which will draw upon
the eight strategic issues and associated recommendations.
