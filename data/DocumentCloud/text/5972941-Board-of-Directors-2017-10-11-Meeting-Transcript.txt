Tuesday, December 5th, meeting.

10

Our meetings

There will be a number of -- I expect

11

there will be a number of items that will require

12

board action including our 2018 budget and likely

13

some other movement on other projects that I'll

14

be providing more of a fulsome update on today.

15

So please let me know if you have any conflict

16

with the December 5th date.

Also, the 2018 meetings we've started

18

working on a schedule for those quarterly

19

meetings.

20

options to provide to you in the next couple of

21

weeks and hope to do that to finalize our

22

schedule.

23

before hopefully our next board meeting so we can

24

announce those dates at the next board meeting.

We are working to get some date

And we'll be able to finalize that

Great job.

So moving into project updates unless

14

there is any other questions.

So back in July --

15

we last met at our June board meeting, but last

16

July the Mayor announced that the -- a new

17

project, the building of the Joint Public Safety

18

Training Academy in West Garfield Park.

19

3rd he announced that the City had entered into a

20

letter of agreement to purchase the 30-acre

21

campus on West Chicago Avenue in the West

22

Garfield Park neighborhood.

On July

23

This project will be providing

24

classroom and scenario training to all of
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

7

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

Chicago's first responders.

2

City there are numerous locations where police

3

and fire and first responders train throughout

4

the City.

5

this joint public safety training academy at 4301

6

West Chicago.

7

So throughout the

Those will all be consolidated into

So the CIT has been asked to lead the

8

procurement to select a design, build, finance

9

developer for the project; and I am pleased to

10

let you know that we expect that that RFQ will be

11

issued today.

12

The project for the -- the project

13

budget will be approximately $95 million

14

inclusive of land acquisition.

15

it will take about 18 to 24 months to complete.

16

So we will plan to have a pre-submittal

17

conference on October 25th at 10:00 a.m. at the

18

Garfield Park Conservatory and responses will be

19

due to the CIT on November 20th.

20

And we he expect

So you can see the upcoming project

21

milestones.

And I wanted to ask Tom to -- who

22

has taken the lead on drafting that document to

23

walk us through not just the milestones, but also

24

a little bit about the RFQ document.

8

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

MR. BUDESCU:

Sure.

Thanks.

So, you know,

2

you can see, you know, I think the first thing to

3

make clear is the land acquisition is a separate

4

transaction than the selection of a design,

5

build, finance developer for the project.

6

City as Leslie already alluded, has entered into

7

a letter of intent or some sort of preliminary

8

agreement with the owner and that's going before

9

City Council for the purchase of the 30-acre site

10

The

on West Chicago.

11

And what we are working on is

12

designing the procurement for a developer to come

13

and build the facilities needed to provide for a

14

consolidated public safety training academy on

15

that 30-acre site.

16

We are going to release the RFQ today.

17

It's the beginning of a 2-part procurement

18

process.

19

qualifications from bidders to show us that they

20

have the appropriate qualifications to both

21

design, construct and also finance a portion of

22

the capital costs associated with the campus.

23

expect those RFQ's will be due November 20.

24

The RFQ will request statements of

We expect a then short list up to 4
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

We

9

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

qualified bidders and issue our request for

2

proposals to them.

3

include, you know, more committed pricing,

4

financing terms and conceptual designs.

5

That proposal will then

We will then from those proposals

6

select one developer to recommend to the City to

7

proceed with which will then be introduced to

8

City Council.

9

of 2018.

10

We are hoping that will be in June

Then there is a significant design

11

process and also the legislative process, but we

12

think construction could start as early as July

13

2018.

14

That's our target goal for that right now.

MS. HUBBARD:

Leslie, can you tell me a

15

little bit about what kind of training will be

16

done there?

17

includes just the police or?

18

Is this police academy if it

MS. DARLING:

Yes, both recruits and ongoing

19

police training.

20

training that police officers will receive

21

throughout their careers and that will also take

22

place at the facility.

23
24

So there will be continual

In addition, they will be training all
fire personnel there, both recruits and ongoing
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

10

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1
2

-- and ongoing training.
MS. HUBBARD:

And will they have like I

3

assume new state-of-the-art kind of technology

4

and facilities?

5

MS. DARLING:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

It

6

will be state-of-the-art scenario-based training.

7

And so there will also be an indoor shooting

8

range and it will provide some of the programatic

9

things I know that police and fire would like to

10

see an improvement in.

11

state-of-the-art scenario training and an indoor

12

shooting range, a pool and also I believe a track

13

for driving or that will go around the campus.

14

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So definitely

I don't remember this,

15

but I think Kym is asking the right question.

16

The question that most of the public will ask is

17

what's going to happen there.

18

well-delineated in the RFQ or are there more

19

specs without kind of speaking to the curriculum

20

or the programming?

21

MR. BUDESCU:

Is that

So the RFQ includes a program

22

that's been developed jointly by 2FM and CPD and

23

CFD that gives a high-level overview of the sort

24

of the amenities and facilities that they see on
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

11

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

this campus.

2

car for scenario training, a fire ladder, a fire

3

tower, an indoor pool, shooting range.

4

So the idea of driving truck, a CTA

What it doesn't do and what is not

5

part of the procurement ultimately is what is the

6

curriculum that is being applied within those

7

facilities for the training.

8

of the scope of what we have been tasked to do

9

and 2FM.

10

And that's outside

I think that's going to be a separate

initiative to determine that.

11

MS. DARLING:

Yes.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I think it's important --

13

that's outside the scope of this.

14

question that folks will ask.

15

communications folks that work with the

16

administration that were here, I would say to

17

them it's probably, you know, a very helpful

18

thing to make sure that we're proactively saying

19

here is what the curriculum will be.

20

you know -- because given that we're doing this

21

work, we will all be asked that question.

22

it's kind of not our area of expertise, but it

23

should be answered.

24

It is a

So if there were

Here is,

And

And I know that it will, but I want to
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

12

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

I think sort of just support the questions

2

because it's, you know, I think that's what's

3

going to -- after the RFQ today especially that's

4

where people are going to say what's happening

5

there.

6

point them to an answer.

7

And, you know, we have to be able to

MS. DARLING:

So our client on this project

8

is the Department of Fleet and Facility

9

Management which handles the buildings.

And they

10

are working directly with the police and fire

11

departments to make sure that the program and the

12

police and fire have approved the program that's

13

going to be in our RFQ today.

14

So we've worked very, very closely

15

with police and fire over quite some time to

16

formalize the program and the building needs.

17

We're talking about classrooms and the program of

18

who is going to be teaching and what that

19

curriculum is.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

I'm more talking about

21

like the we mentioned -- which I think one of the

22

neatest things about this is the sort of

23

scenario-based training, right, part of that is

24

deescalation.

And that's, you know, clearly

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

13

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

something that is top mind for a number of folks

2

for good reason.

3

talking about how the facility will enable that

4

type of training I think sort of making that

5

connection.

And I think that, you know,

6

I'm not talking about who is going to

7

teach what in the classroom, but more, you know,

8

why it's useful to have a facility that has these

9

components that helps us.

10

It's useful to have a

firing range for the following reasons.

11

And by the way, if you talk to, you

12

know, I'm sure Alderman O'Shea and others will

13

agree with this, you know, members of the

14

department are excited about it for the same

15

reason.

16

so I think it's a good thing for us to be able to

17

just speak to some of the dynamic elements of

18

this.

19

and building elements and how they help create

20

sort of state-of-the-art environment for the type

21

of training that you mentioned.

22

Want the training, want the -- you know,

And how infrastructure elements, design

MR. MARQUISOS:

If I could just add what I

23

think is unique about or what's great about the

24

procurement that we've designed for this project
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

14

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

is we are soliciting qualifications for the,

2

quote, unquote, state-of-the-art people in this

3

industry.

4

who have built training centers around the

5

country.

6

with the City to finalize the program and the

7

design.

8

working with CPD and CFD to kind of finalize and

9

formulate the program that we're also discussing.

10

They will be bringing forth the talent

And they'll be working collaboratively

So we do have these kind of experts

MR. BUDESCU:

And align that sort of with

11

the design program of the facilities with the

12

curriculum program and making sure that one

13

complements the other in a way that's productive

14

as to what you alluded to.

15

MS. DARLING:

So this is the first kind of

16

2FM design look at what they think the needs are,

17

but this isn't exactly what's -- what it's going

18

to look like because that design process will

19

occur after a design, build, finance developer is

20

selected.

21

it will be a very collaborative process with

22

experts in the field and working very closely

23

with both police and fire departments to insure

24

that it delivers exactly what you are talking

And as Tom said and George mentioned,

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

15

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

about, Mr. Chairman.

2

So, you know, you can see there's a

3

number of -- there's a burn tower there on the

4

left side that is currently in the south loop.

5

They may do burn tower work in the south loop

6

right now.

7

-- the design will get worked out additionally

8

over time and after selection.

9

very much looking forward to kicking this process

So I think you'll see that this will

And but we are

10

off today and happy to answer any other

11

additional questions.

12

MS. HUBBARD:

What is the exact location?

13

MS. DARLING:

4301 West Chicago Avenue.

14

MS. HUBBARD:

Thank you.

15

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

16

process, this RFQ and RFP?

17

MS. DARLING:

18

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

19
20

And it's a two-step

Yes.
What is the timing on

when you get to the RFP?
MS. DARLING:

The RFP we're going to be --

21

as soon as we release this RFQ, we will start to

22

turn our attention on drafting the RFP.

23

goal will be to -- at selection in December or

24

early January, our goal will be to drop that RFP

And our

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

16

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

to the short list of bidders as soon as the short

2

list is announced.

3

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Got it.

Okay.

So we get

4

it back November 20 and some time in December

5

we'll short list?

6

MS. DARLING:

That's right.

Yeah, we are

7

hoping to move very quickly so we can get to the

8

design process as fast as possible.

9

MR. LINGENFELTER:

Is that design

10

complementing curriculum part of the

11

qualifications?

12

specific response?

13

Are you asking for that kind of

MR. BUDESCU:

So we're asking for

14

qualification in design and construction of

15

projects of similar size and scope, right.

16

so I think the more qualifications you have that

17

are more relevant to the scope that we are

18

looking for, the more favorably that evaluation

19

will be.

20

MR. LINGENFELTER:

21

MS. DARLING:

And

Okay.

And I would just add that the

22

initial groundbreaking will take place as

23

mentioned here in July of 2018.

24

initial occupancy would be anticipated in June of

And we expect

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

17

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

2019, and final and full occupancy not until the

2

spring of 2010 -- I'm sorry, 2020.

3

MR. BUDESCU:

2020.

And that's a point worth

4

expounding upon about a little bit is, you know,

5

there are certain elements of the project that

6

are really consolidating existing City facilities

7

while there are other elements that are providing

8

facilities that the City doesn't currently have.

9

So they may go and pay a fee to use

10

the burn tower at another municipality or

11

something like that.

12

is going to be the completion of the things that

13

the City currently doesn't have.

14

out of any rent or lease payments for facilities

15

that are not controlled by the City and have that

16

responder training done on City owned assets.

So what's being prioritized

So we can get

17

And then the second phase will be more

18

the consolidation of the existing -- I don't want

19

to say necessarily phases, but that's how it's

20

being prioritized.

21

are the things that will be prioritized that the

22

City currently doesn't have.

23
24

MS. DARLING:

So what may be used earlier

So we are thrilled to be

partnering with the City on this really important
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

18

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

project, and happy to continue to answer any

2

questions that you have.

3

I would, you know, just want to

4

mention quickly that in the RFQ we are requesting

5

that the bidders commit to exceeding the City's

6

MBE/WBE goals.

7

15 percent local participation in the community

8

areas and 50 percent on City labor participation

If there are no

further questions on the public safety training,

I will just say that the RFQ will be available on

blast it out through the Department of

on is the relocation of the 2FM operations from

1685 North Throop.

3

2FM, their maintenance facility, fueling

4

facility, will all be moved off of that location

5

at North and -- that's currently at North and

6

Throop.

7

will be voting on the -- on the land sale of that

8

property today.

9

that the CIT dealt with, but that will enable us

This -- all the operations of

That's something that the City Council

Again, that is not something

10

to move forward with the project and will help

11

fund the relocation.

12

The facility will replace the existing

13

headquarters and will move to three separate

14

locations in the City.

15

facility for 2FM is moving to Englewood.

16

there will be a north side satellite repair shop

17

on North Neenah and then a City fueling station

18

will be moved to the north branch off Goose

19

Island.

20

The main maintenance
And

So we have led the procurement and

21

selected a developer for that project.

You've

22

all been updated and aware of that.

23

continued to work very closely with our partners

24

at 2FM on this project and we are -- have moved

We have

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

20

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

very quickly and I think work has gone

2

extraordinarily smoothly on this project.

3

We have selected AECOM in partnership

4

with the City to do the design, build process for

5

this work.

6

various City departments on permits and zoning.

7

George has headed up that process with 2FM.

8

are also assisting 2FM in negotiating the design

9

build agreement with AECOM and that is going

We are continuing to meet with

We

10

well.

11

gone extraordinarily smoothly regarding the -- an

12

agreement on what the design and the needs of the

13

City are.

14

And the project design process has also

The project budget is $37 million for

15

all 3 facilities.

16

money, but there is a significant amount of

17

engineering that needs to be done to make sure

18

that 2FM is able to meet all of their needs and

19

get the work done that they need to do within

20

that budget.

21

with the selected design builder and things are

22

moving very smoothly.

23
24

That seems like a lot of

So it's been a good partnership

If things continue to go as we expect,
our goal will be to introduce to City Council
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

21

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

that draft contract with AECOM at the November

2

City Council meeting and hope to have action in

3

December from City Council on that.

4

After that we would -- the City would

5

execute the contract.

Again, I want to reiterate

6

this is a City contract not with CIT.

7

not be a party.

8

on the project will be in March 2018.

CIT will

And then initial groundbreaking

9

So I wanted to ask George to kind of

10

lend some additional color to what's been going

11

on with that project.

12

MR. BUDESCU:

Tom.

Can I make one clarification

13

so Scott won't be nervous.

14

the negotiation of the agreement with 2FM, but

15

the law -- City Law Department is leading that.

16

MS. DARLING:

17

MR. MARQUISOS:

We are assisting in

Yes.
Yes, so this kind of going

18

back to what we have been talking about the

19

police training academy, this is a design build

20

delivery system.

21

exceedingly well.

22

more about fleet operations than we ever thought

23

we would.

24

And I think it's working
We have come to understand

But the truth is the City has 11,000
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services

22

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

vehicles that they are responsible for

2

maintaining continually.

3

vehicles, right, they are police, fire, garbage

4

trucks, snow plows.

5

workings of Chicago's government.

6

the appropriate facilities to not only complete

7

emergency repairs, but ongoing maintenance is

8

kind of a critical function.

9

designers with a lot of expertise working in

And these are critical

These are essential to the
And so having

And having

10

collaboration with the guys who actually repair

11

these things day in and day out, has been a very

12

productive process.

13

I think we have come up with a design

14

for the Englewood facility and the satellite shop

15

on the north side that is really going to provide

16

very appropriate facilities for maintaining all

17

these various vehicles.

18

great process to be part of.

19

fleet guys are now excited about their new home.

20

And it's been a real
I think that the

What -- not to say that the operations

21

at North and Throop weren't efficient, but that

22

was actually a steel warehouse that got converted

23

over many years and they operated in there in

24

ways that they adapted to the building.

Now

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

23

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

we're constructing buildings that are uniquely

2

designed for the operations.

3

will be a game changer for the way that the City

4

operates their fleet.

And I think that

5

So this is a project that we are very

6

excited about and glad to be partnering with and

7

we look forward to this continuing to roll out.

MS. DARLING:

Any questions on the North and
We had a recent -- we

10

attended a recent community meeting with Alderman

11

Sawyer, a ward meeting, and 2FM presented the

12

project to make sure that the community was fully

13

aware.

14

Alderman Sawyer and the community, at least the

15

people at the ward event, really welcomed the

16

facility and the people who will be working at

17

2FM down to Englewood.

18

community interest, excitement about the new

building.

Alderman Sawyer in presenting it to the

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

What's the address of the

Englewood location?
MS. DARLING:

6800 South Wentworth.

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

24

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

MR. MARQUISOS:

We don't have an official

2

address yet, but it's between -- it's 69th and

3

Wentworth.

4
5

But the address will be 69th Street.

MR. BUDESCU:

We should have an official

address by the next board meeting.

6

MR. MARQUISOS:

7

MS. DARLING:

By the next week I hope.
Right, so not officially yet.

8

Okay.

And what we have been talking for the last

9

two years about, smart lighting.

The exciting

10

thing here is we have moved to actual

11

implementation of this exciting project and it is

12

happening.

13

all know what the project is.

14

we did or the City executed the contract with

15

Ameresco and that was completed.

16

CDOT who is managing the day-to-day work on this

17

contract issued work order number one in

18

coordination with the Department of Innovation

19

and Technology.

So I won't do an intro because you
But back in June

And thereafter

And that was issued June 29th.

20

As you recall there is the LED

21

conversion part of the project, the asset

22

condition assessment and the infrastructure

23

stabilization part of the project and the

24

technology part of the project.
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

25

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

So the asset condition assessment

2

began in July.

3

poles and fixtures have been assessed already by

4

a small and able team run by Ameresco.

5

spring of 2018 we expect that all of the fixtures

6

in the City will be surveyed.

7

allow CDOT to triage repairs to improve

8

reliability of the system.

9

At the end of last month 87,000

And by

So then that will

As you know, a couple of weeks ago the

10

Mayor announced that the installations were

11

beginning.

12

installed by the end of this year.

13

end of the month, last month, 2000 LED fixtures

14

have been installed on the south side.

15

are doing 2,000 LED fixtures a week now.

16

are 7 crews out on the street doing -- each crew

17

can do approximately 4 fixtures an hour.

18

We expect to have 19,000 fixtures
And as of the

So they
There

So and in a minute I'm going to show

19

you -- and, Patty, actually maybe can you show us

20

now.

21

smartlighting.org.

22

that there is a public website that is now

23

available.

24

update on exactly which streets have had LED

See if we -- that link should be hot for
And I would like to show you

And that's going to provide a weekly

26

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

installations.

And then it will also -- we'll

2

see if we can get it this to work.

3

provide a two-week look ahead on the streets that

4

will be receiving the installations for the next

5

two weeks and that's going to be updated weekly.

6

You can take a look at that.

7

that will be available and we hope that all --

8

you know, worst case scenario is we -- oh, there

9

you go.

And also to

And it's a website

There it is.

10

So this is the smart lighting website.

11

And if you haven't had a chance to take a look at

12

it, it shows the breakout by ward.

13

blue lines are where lights have been installed

14

and then the yellow-orange line is the upcoming

15

two-week look ahead of what will be installed

16

over the next couple weeks.

17

And then the

So we are excited.

I know this is hopefully Alderman

18

O'Shea your office has been receiving it and I

19

think they are trying to make sure that

20

Aldermanic Offices are getting that.

21

rollout continues, I know that the Mayor's Office

22

and CDOT will be communicating with each Alderman

23

in their ward as it's going to be effected.

24

MR. RAMIREZ:

And as that

Leslie, can we go back and

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

27

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

look at that side by side that you had initially

before you clicked onto this?

MS. DOMINGUEZ:

MR. RAMIREZ:

website.

On the PowerPoint?
It's on the main page of the

I think if you just arrow back.

MS. DARLING:

I think on the landing page,

Jorge?

8

MR. RAMIREZ:

Yes.

9

MS. DARLING:

Can you scroll down?

10

MR. RAMIREZ:

I was just trying to look at

11

the side by side just to see the lighting

12

difference.

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

That's not a great

14

photograph, but I think what was pretty clear for

15

those that attended the announcement event we

16

were right on the corner where half the street

17

had been done and the other half hadn't.

18

perception is that, you know, we have been

19

billing this as higher quality light.

20

there is very little debate about that when

21

you're out there and you can see.

22

And the

I think

It's hard to capture photographically

23

because most of these camera devices compensate

24

for the light differentiation.

So it's not

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

28

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

giving you the true -- but when you actually

2

experience it and we've done that many, many

3

times now in the field and we've questioned both

4

residents and police and there is general

5

agreement that the lighting is better.

6

MR. RAMIREZ:

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

Okay.
In that it provides you

8

greater visibility and it's just better directed.

9

And so we're quite pleased with the way this has

10
11

panned out.
MR. BUDESCU:

To George's point I think it's

12

-- this photograph doesn't capture it and it's a

13

difficult thing to do, but it's something that we

14

have been putting our heads together on.

15

we launch this program and implement it, we want

16

to find ways to more effectively communicate how

17

that is looking out there.

18

photograph or a video and hopefully that's

19

something that we'll be able to more effectively

20

communicate soon and share with --

21

MR. LINGENFELTER:

And whether it's a

My 6th grader said it

22

looks like a basketball gym.

23

there.

24

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And as

We were right

Yes, this looks like the

800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

29

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

south side of Chicago.

2

MS. DARLING:

Treasurer Summers and Carl

3

were able to come to the announcement and so they

4

can give the firsthand, but generally it was --

5

the lighting has been very well received.

6

really does provide better clarity.

7

know the light will be more reliable and the

8

system will work far better.

9
10
11
12
13

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And it

And as we

Just a question on the

other slide back on the PowerPoint.
MS. DARLING:

Yes, we're going to switch

back to that.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

We were talking about the

14

network access system and the next steps there.

15

I want to get a sense of just when you think will

16

the network system be completed in sort of

17

parallel timing to the --

18

MS. DARLING:

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

20

MS. DARLING:

21

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.
I'll take that one.
Oh, sure.
So as we've been talking

22

about one of the key components of this project

23

is billed as higher quality more reliable

24

lighting is the City wide lighting management
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

30

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

system, so there is a technology piece to this

2

process.

3

think we are very much in the ramp-up stage.

4

And we have made good progress, but I

In the previous slide we talked about

5

2,000 lights installed in September and now we're

6

at 2,000 lights a week.

7

4 weeks to kind of get the whole process figured

8

out as to where we're going and which lights go

9

where and how many get put up and all that.

Right.

So it took us 3,

But

10

now that we have it figured out, it goes pretty

11

quickly.

12

So I am pleased to report that all the

13

data has been collected to date from the

14

after-condition (sic) survey.

15

people look out and go to and visit 87,000

16

different poles and report to us their physical

17

condition and the lighting context that they

18

liked and a bunch of other attributes.

19

information has now been uploaded into the

20

lighting management system.

So we have had

All that

21

So we have our previous database that

22

we knew where all these light fixtures were, but

23

we really didn't know much else about them.

24

we're getting more granular information about
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

Now

31

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

what they do, how well they do it and in what

2

condition they are.

3

integrated, and that's kind of the first -- that

4

initial integration was kind of a major

5

milestone.

6

So that's all been

And now a process is in place so it

7

happens automatically.

8

assess these lights, at the end of the week they

9

check the quality of the data, it gets inputted

10

As soon as these guys

into the system.

11

And we are now meeting with DoIT and

12

CDOT and doing the preliminary training of the

13

configuration of the lighting management system.

14

So people will now be able to navigate through

15

the system and get the information they need off

16

it.

17

ramp up through the rest of this year.

18

the end of this year, early next year there will

19

be extensive training and we'll start utilizing

20

the system as it was intended to be used.

21

So we expect that process will continue to

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

And by

So we indicated on the

22

previous slide that all 327,600 lights will be

23

surveyed by April.

24

poles and --

Is that the case for all

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

32

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

2

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

3

MR. MARQUISOS:

So we'll know --

Yes, the idea is to --

4

before we can figure out what is the best

5

expenditure of repair dollars, let's figure out

6

what our problems are.

7

and looking at every light, every pole, every

8

wire and getting a better sense of where our --

9

where is money best expended to reduce failures.

10

And so we're going out

And so once we have that picture of

11

the whole pie, CDOT can start choosing what part

12

of the pie they want to have the resources that

13

are available.

14

MR. RAMIREZ:

So what does CDOT -- I'll wait

15

until you're finished.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Just real quick.

With

17

the nodes themselves, do we have to have the

18

whole network in place for --

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

No.

20

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

So the ones that are

21

being installed now will work with the areas that

22

the lights have been installed?

23
24

MR. MARQUISOS:

Yes.

At the risk of getting

into the weeds, so there is going to be 50 access
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

33

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

points across the City.

2

installed and mainly on the south side.

3

that are installed on the south side will be able

4

to communicate with all the lights that are

5

installed in that first area.

6

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

7

MR. MARQUISOS:

We currently have 5
So the 5

Got it.

And as we roll out we add

8

more access points and ultimately there will be

9

50 across the City and the whole City, but, yeah,

10
11
12

it's an expanding network.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

Okay.

But they work as

we expand?

13

MR. MARQUISOS:

14

MS. DARLING:

Yes.
Yes.

But, you know, one of

15

the things that we have said publicly many, many

16

times is that this will reduce the need for

17

residents to call 311, to notify the City that a

18

light is out.

19

implemented citywide at this point.

20

the new lights.

That is not something that is

21

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

22

MS. DARLING:

23
24

It's only on

Sure.

Which we expect to be

completely reliable and not to go out at all so.
CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

As long as it's true on

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

34

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

the new lights.

2

true on the old lights.

3

You can't set the expectation as

MS. DARLING:

Right, yes.

So we just want

4

to make sure that people know that if lights are

5

out currently, that calling 311 is still the

6

right thing to do.

7
8
9

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

If they are not an LED

light.
MS. DARLING:

If they are not LED.

And in

10

those few blocks on the south side that have been

11

installed.

12

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

Sorry, did you --

So the question that I have is

14

so since this stuff can interplay, are we

15

coordinating like when a light needs to be fixed

16

or repaired and dropping in the new one instead

17

of repairing it and then it's going to get

18

replaced anyway to save money?

19

dropping in the new instead of repairing?

20
21
22
23
24

MR. MARQUISOS:

Or are they just

So it's a nuance question

and it's one -MR. RAMIREZ:

You may not know and that's

okay.
MR. MARQUISOS:

I know.

It's just there is

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

35

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

a lot of different types of repairs that are

2

required.

3

Ameresco's team go out with night surveyors in

4

advance of the areas that they plan to do in the

5

next two weeks and then they report to CDOT the

6

things that aren't working.

7

individual light that's out, the anticipation is

8

that the cobra head has failed and when we put

9

the new LED, it will work.

So basically the way it works is

And if it's an

If we see a block of

10

lights out, CDOT is informed of that.

11

and fix a systemic problem in advance of the

12

LED's.

13

MR. RAMIREZ:

14

MR. MARQUISOS:

15

MR. RAMIREZ:

They go

I see.
So it -Yeah, I guess I was talking

16

more -- I mean, that makes sense and that's the

17

way that they should do it.

18

It's good to hear.

I was thinking like what if there's an

19

area that's not even mapped out yet for -- like

20

it's down the road months and months, and a light

21

is out.

22

of lights scenario.

23

in or are they going through with the repair?

24

And clearly it's a light, not a string

MR. MARQUISOS:

Are they dropping a new head

Okay.

Since the end of 2015

all HDS lights that cannot be re -- that require

more than a bulb replacement are being converted

to LED.

MR. RAMIREZ:

Okay.

And that was done

independent of this project.

MR. RAMIREZ:

So now we're just

But will that work -- that's

not the new head that we're putting on then, it's
just the bulb.
MR. MARQUISOS:

Every head that we put on

12

has the ability to add a node when the time

13

comes.

14

installed last year and not part of this project;

15

when we get to that neighborhood, we can put the

16

node on top of it and make it -- and allow it to

17

join the network.

18

question is.

19
20
21

We can have it -- even if it was

MR. RAMIREZ:

I think that's what your

That's exactly what I wanted

to know.
MS. DARLING:

And then one of the most

22

exciting things is that the City has secured $6.2

23

million in incentive funding from ComEd to

24

support the Chicago Smart Lighting Program.

this is far in excess of anything that we

expected.

3

team and especially George who has been working

4

in very, very close partnership with CDOT and

5

ComEd to assist in securing these funds for the

6

City of Chicago.

7

And I want to give some credit to our

So this will really go a long way in

8

helping launch this program.

9

that used to be provided by DCEO from the State

10

of Illinois; but based on a bill that passed in

11

Springfield last year, those incentive funds have

12

now moved over to be managed by Commonwealth

13

Edison.

14

2017 for these incentive programs and we have

15

been lucky enough to assist the City in securing

16

these funds.

17
18

And this is funding

So they had funds available, left for

So this is --

MR. LINGENFELTER:

So we didn't have

anything in the original budget for the DCEO?

19

MR. MARQUISOS:

It was an if come so we

20

didn't count on it.

21

this little bridge period in the transition from

22

DCEO to ComEd, is that ComEd is giving these

23

kinds of amplified incentive rates for the

24

balance of 2017.

But the great thing about

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

38

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

And so we worked with CDOT to maximize

2

the amount of rebates that we could get in this

3

year.

4

$6.2 million which is a pretty great incentive

5

and it translates to basically 75 percent of the

6

cost is being reimbursed by ComEd.

7

won't --

So with just 19,000 fixtures we're getting

I mean, that

MR. BUDESCU:

Of the LED conversion.

9

MS. DARLING:

Yes.

10

MR. MARQUISOS:

That won't continue for the

11

rest of the project, but this kind of unique

12

window we kind of maximized.

13

MR. BUDESCU:

Yeah, it won't continue at

14

that rate, but it's important to note this 6.2

15

million that's specifically for the work being

16

done in 2017.

17

work being done in 2018 which is going to be far

18

more than 20,000 lights, there will be other

19

incentive funds available and, you know, we'll

20

see at what level they come in.

21

And then we'll expect that for the

But we're really excited, you know, in

22

terms of the first fiscal calendar year of the

23

project this is well in excess of what we

24

expected.

And I think it's a really great win
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

39

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

for the City in terms of project economics.

already made sense and now it makes even more

3

sense.

4

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

It

Can we just spend 60

5

seconds on the potential future phases.

6

you're talking about -- talking how to do it and

7

talk about what we have and where we're at, but

8

we're building this network not only for now and

9

in the future.

10

I know

We talked about the use of the

nodes and in the future and etcetera.

11

I get asked about, you know, what's

12

going to happen there.

13

you know, we had a crawl, walk, run is sort of

14

what I typically say when we have a -- an aging

15

-- aged infrastructure.

16

are elements to this that we have to take care of

17

first.

environment.

19

And the answer is like,

We have, you know, there

You know, the lights and the built

You know, we're building in such that

20

we can be flexible.

21

the future prospects are.

22

in a position to evaluate -- we'll be far enough

23

along to evaluate that piece of it.

MS. DARLING:

I don't know, you know, what

project and the City's goal was to build a future

3

ready system to make sure that they could take

4

advantage of increases in technology.

5

goal as we ran the procurement for this process

6

was to have any add-ons or smart city add-ons to

7

the network be revenue neutral or revenue

8

positive.

9

Our goal with the

And our

And no City in -- anywhere that we

10

were able to tell was drawing revenue off their

11

streetlights at the time of this project.

12

expect that will change tremendously over the

13

next few years and our system will be ready for

14

that.

15

knowledge -- you know, obviously Danielle DuMerer

16

who is the head of the Department of Innovation

17

and Technology is constantly working and being

18

approached by different vendors with lots of

19

ideas.

20

the extent that they would like our assistance

21

with that, we are ready to provide it.

22

We

We are not prepared and the City to my

I'm sure she is assessing those.

And to

But those systems will be future

23

ready, and we want to make sure that the system

24

is utilized to leverage the technology and the

network that's being put in.

be opportunities for that.

3

you want to add anything, you know, either George

4

or Tom; but, you know, I think we'll be ready to

5

take advantage of those new technologies as they

6

come online.

MR. MARQUISOS:

I think there will
And I don't know if

And Commissioner DuMerer is

8

speaking on October 14th at a Smart City

9

Conference in Chicago and giving a keynote

10

address so I will be there to see what she has to

11

say about that.

12

MS. DARLING:

Any other questions about

smart lighting?

quickly on our Home Buyer Assistance Program.

15

have 19 approved lenders now.

16

loans in 46 out of the 50 wards.

17

over $36 million worth of loans for over 170 -- a

18

couple of loans have closed since this date, so

19

175 families have been helped by this program.

20

All right.

We'll touch base
We

We have closed
We've closed

There is little more than

$7-and-a-half-million of loans open that have not

update at the next meeting.

2

You know, we're always looking to help

grow this project and improve the services.

4

know, we handle the administrative kind of back

end of the program and administering it for the

City.

improve it.

So we are working with the City to help

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

There was a great article

last week about a federal hardest hit program

10

that was administered locally by IDOT and it's

11

continued application -- you'll appreciate this,

12

Kym.

13

97-year-old woman stay in her home and it was

14

sort of a great example.

15

Its continued application helped a

I feel like, you know, we are rightly

16

focussed on getting the number up from 174 to

17

many multiples of that which there is clearly a

18

capacity in need for it.

19

do it I think is to tell some of the stories of

20

people that have been helped.

21

have the 97-year-old woman who got to keep her

22

home kind of thing, but I wonder just how much we

23

actually know about, you know, who these folks

24

are and how this helped them.

And part of the way to

I don't know if we

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

43

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

And I do think that in as much as we

2

sort of blasted out to Alderman and we have done

3

community presentations and looking at some other

4

models now of maybe how to address that, you

5

know, there is nothing like telling a story of

6

the folks who have benefited from it.

7

wondering how we can, you know, learn more about

8

who we've helped in the program.

9

MS. DARLING:

Sure.

I was

That's something that

10

we can look into with the lenders directly

11

because they have the front line.

12

limited information about the borrower and we are

13

not able to reach out to them directly.

14

to go through the lenders.

15

that and work with DPD on that too.

16

CHAIRMAN SUMMERS:

17

MS. DARLING:

We get very

It has

So we will look into

Okay.

Awesome.

So we want to just talk

18

quickly about a couple of additional initiatives.

19

Tom continues to work and advise on the O'Hare

20

Express Rail Working Group.

21

of substantive updates to share today, but the

22

group continues to make progress and look at

23

options for the City.

24

updated.

We don't have a lot

And we'll keep you

Tom, I don't know if you want to add
Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

44

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

anything about your work on that?

2

MR. BUDESCU:

No.

3

MS. DARLING:

No.

Okay.

And then we also

4

are, you know, as we talked about retrofit and

5

doing additional retrofits along the way, we have

6

been working on -- the Mayor's Office has

7

convened a working group co-chaired by 2FM

8

Commissioner Reyonlds and Elevate Energy CEO Anne

9

Evens to identify opportunities to develop solar

10

energy projects in the City and partnership with

11

the City and sister agencies that are in line

12

with the Mayor's 100 percent renewable commitment

13

for municipal buildings by 2020.

14

So the working group is reviewing and

15

permitting regulatory processes around solar

16

installations and then identifying opportunities

17

for expansion of solar -- could develop local

18

workforces and insure access to renewable energy

19

for all Chicagoans.

20

And CIT is a member of the working

21

group alongside labor, environmental

22

organizations, community groups, workforce

23

development partners and ComEd.

24

is expected at the end of 2017 or the beginning

The final report

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

45

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

of 2018.

And the City will at that time consider

2

potentially partnering with other parties to

3

develop its own solar installations.

4

expected that the CIT could play a pivotal role

5

in that effort, although our specific role will

6

not be known until the working groups'

7

recommendations are finalized probably at

8

beginning of next year.

And it's

9

So I will keep you updated on that,

10

but that working group had been very active in

11

the -- and I'll make sure that you all are aware

12

of what's happening and hopefully we'll have a

13

great role in that going forward.

14

MS. BARRETT:

MarySue.

I just wanted to jump on that

15

quick.

Both from our earliest transactions of

16

Retrofit One and to your update just now, so much

17

of what the Chicago Infrastructure Trust does is

18

impact in climate resiliency and carbon

19

reduction.

20

So I just wanted to point out a point

21

of coordination, Mayor Daley -- Mayor Emanuel,

22

excuse me.

23

Emanuel is hosting groups, other colleague mayors

24

from around the globe in early December.

That's my old -- my history.

Mayor

I think

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

46

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

it's the 3rd and the 4th on a climate -- a

2

Mayor's climate gathering.

3

intense opportunity for us to share and learn

4

some of the things that the Trust has been -- has

5

been accomplishing.

6

probably already on your radar, Leslie; but I

7

wanted raise this as an opportunity for us to

8

network and to learn.

9

MS. DARLING:

So that will be an

So I just wanted to -- it's

It is on my radar.

We are

10

working -- on this working group for solar we are

11

working very closely with Chris Wheat, the

12

Mayor's Chief Sustainability Officer, and he is

13

running point on that convening in December.

14

so he and I have been in very close touch about

15

what we might share about that so I'll keep you

16

updated.

17
18
19

MR. RAMIREZ:

And

Is it limited to solar or is

there any geothermal in there?
MS. DARLING:

You know, I don't -- I think

20

it's limited to solar because based on the bill

21

that passed in Springfield last year, there is a

22

tremendous incentive for solar generation.

23

so they're looking at the opportunity to take

24

advantage of those opportunities.

And

So I will

Victoria Legal + Corporate Services
800.827.7708 www.victorialcs.com

47

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

circle back with Chris, but the focus on this has

2

been solar.

3

MR. BUDESCU:

I think that's a point worth

4

making on the timeliness of this effort where

5

solar projects didn't always pencil out

6

economically in the City of Chicago and the State

7

of Illinois.

8

There's the legislation last June and

9

Springfield kind of -- in track with what Leslie

10

was mentioning in moving incentives to OEMC to

11

ComEd, there were other changes made to the way

12

that these energy efficiency incentives are

13

required in the state.

14

legislative expert.

15

mangling up -- conflating some of these issues,

16

but the reality is it's changed the economics of

17

solar.

18

created a window and an opportunity to make these

19

projects worthwhile and not just environmentally

20

desirable, but economically prudent.

21

that's a really big driver of this working group

22

and the timing of it and the idea behind pushing

23

this initiative forward right now.

24

And, you know, I'm not a

I'm probably already

And I think that people think that it's

MS. DARLING:

And so

Any other questions?

48

 Chicago Infrastructure Trust - October 11, 2017

1

MR. LINGENFELTER:

I think it would be

2

helpful if we every once in a while I do my own

3

running tally of the finance totals of projects

4

we have done, and it would be helpful to do that

5

for both jobs and the carbon footprint.

6

that would be great to have.

7

MS. BARRETT:

A score card.

8

MS. DARLING:

Great idea.

I think

Thank you.

We

9

actually know a lot of those -- we have modeled a

10

lot of the numbers at least on the smart lighting

11

program, so we will be able to share that in

12

December.

13

If there are no other questions now

14

would be the time for public comment.

Patty, has

15

anybody signed up for public comment?

Okay.

Looks like no.

Any other comments from the
