under current law there is no legal premise on making a patron leave because they
are gambling beyond. their means.

Mike Fries asked Tom Swoik if there was any data to establish a cbnnection
between 24 hour gaming and problem gambling. Swoik stated that there Was no
relationship between the issues. Winkler asked about any research or study
comparing '24 hour gaming to a person?s addiction to gambling and there was no
study done in the United States or Canada.

Member Gardner stated that casinos can make an estimate on what effect 24 hour
gaming would have on the economic factor. The big issue is revenue to the State,
how much of an increase in revenue would 24 hour gaming produce for the State.

Member Gardner also asked if. there was a limit on hours of operation withinthe
Act. "I?om Swoik and Mike Fries stated. that when the Act was enacted, it read 24?
hour gaming, with the Administrator having the authority to allow 24 hour

Governor to be a consultant to the Gaming Board regarding compulsive gambling.
.Mr. Anderson has spoken before the Gaming Board several times. He stated that
gambling was put on the 'riverboats to protect people from gambling beyond their
means, which. means that when the boats were cruising gamblers were only

Illinois Gaming Board Special Hearing of April 8, 2008

Public Comments of Anita Bedell
Executive Director ofIllinois Church Action on Alcohol Addiction Problems

I want to thank the Board for holding a special hearing on the proposal to allow 24 hour
gambling at Illinois casinos. This is a very important public policy issue, and I thank. you for taking the
time to allow the public comment before making your decision.

The Illinois Gaming Board was set up to regulate a business that has known problems
associated with it. Some people will lose everything they own gambling. That is why the Illinois
General Assembly originally limited casino gambling to cruises had a beginning and
ending time and gambling could not be conducted while the riverboat was docked. I

This is the third time the casinos have asked the Illinois Gaming Board to approve 24 hour
gambling in Illinois. In 199.9 the request was withdrawn. In 2003, the Gaming Board denied the
request for 24/7 gambling. At that time there were approximately 900 gamblers on the Self~Exclusion
list. Friday, there were 5,711 addicted gamblers on the Self-Exclusion list?man increase of 250%. .1
come before you today and ask that you deny the request for all 24 hour gambling, even for those who
are requesting 24 hour gambling only on week-ends and holidays.

Many addicted gamblers will Continue to gamble until all of their money is gonewwell over 24
hours. I know one family whose son committed suicide after losing his rent money at Illinois cainos.
Larry had once gambled for 3.0 hours at a casino in Wisconsin. His parents said, ?If you keep the
casinos open constantly, it will increase the odds of someone like Larry to either start an addiction or
to evolve past the point of recovery. Those extra two hours of action might simply be a convenience
for some, but it will be a death sentence to others. So please, don?t do this.?

On June 23, 2002 a bus driver who went on a 48 hour gambling Spree crashed a commercial
bus killing 5 people. They were returning from a week-end trip to a casino in Niagara Falls, Canada.

In December, 2003, Bally?s paid $50,000 for several violations in its haste to transact ?nances
for a high roller who was playing $100 slot machines for more than 81 hours over a long weekend three
years earlier.

Last month an addicted gambler filed a law suit against 6 Atlantic City casinos and one in Las
Vegas. She-would gamble for 4 or 5 days straight without sleeping, and sometimes passing out at the
tables. During one 5-day gambling binge in 2005 she existed on nothing but plastic cups of orange
juice and Snickers bars that staff gave her. On the fifth day, she said a dealer told her to go home
because she appeared exhausted and unableto keep track of the cards she was playing. (Newsday. com,
March 82008) With more shift changes, how would the staff even know she had been at the casino
nonustop?

Bill K, who lost $1 million gambling in Atlantic City casinos, told me that until 1991 Atlantic
City casinos were only open 16 hours a day. Today the casinos are open 24/7, and ?if you want to see
pathological gambling in full bloom, take a stroll through the casinos during those extra hours?.

I have a letter from Clarence Rack. He was hoping to speak before the Board today, but he
missed the deadline by 10 minutes. He spoke before the Gaming Board in 2003 after he learned that
his home was in forecIOSure. His wife was an addicted gambler, but she would not sign up for the Self?
Exclusion Program. and continues to gamble.

Clarence asked me to tell you the negative impact gambling has had on his family, because 24
hour gambling Will impact many more familieswdivorce, applying for lunch programs and financial
aid for school and being denied because he made too much money, going to the food pantry to feed his
children, and the high level of stress on the family. The children have lost their mothermshe only sees
them on holidays, His oldest daughter was accepted at several universities, but they were unable to
?nance her-education, so she attends a Junior College and works at a part timejob.

Most people drive to Illinois casinos, some of which are located in densely populated areas.
Allowing 24 hour gambling and drinking at casinos will impact pubic safety. According to Dr. Valerie
Lorenz, a pioneer in treatment for gambling addiction in Baltimore Maryland, addicted gamblers drive
like drunk drivers. Addicted gamblers seem more hurried and take more risks during their heavier
gambling activity. Common civil Violations include speeding, reckless driving, driving without a
license or suspended license, no insurance, and driving-under unsafe conditions.

The combination of alcohol and gambling has lead to serious suicide attempts. I. have talked
with gambling addicts who close their eyes while driving in the hopes that they will have a car crash
and their families will be able to collect money from the insurance policy.

INCREASE REVENUES AND KIZIEP JOBS.

TH REVEN UES OF CASINOS AND THEREFORE THE SUPPORT TO THE STATE

SIGNIFICANT DEGREE BY THE SMOKING BAN. 1N JANUARY WE SAW REVENUES

Comments for Gaming Board Hearing on 24-hour Gambling
April 8, 2008

I don?t know anyone who is happy when their relatives are out late gambling. I have two
relatives who have had problems with gambling. When they are out late gambling,
family members feel concern, stress, anger, and frustration, and they want their loved one
to come home. A casino closing time provides an Opportunity for problem gamblers to
walk away from the table and return to their homes and their responsibilities.

If we care about our society, then we care about individuals? lives. We care about
relationships, and wecare about families. 'l?wenty?iour~hour gambling would not support
families, but rather would increase the strain on families associated with problem I
gambling. -

While considering what I might say to you, I. called my brother who has a lot of friends
who gamble. He agreed that a casino closing is helpful for compulsive gamblers. He
told me ofhis friend Jonathan who has a gambling problem, and hence is never able to
save any money. After a car accident at age 16, Jonathan received a $7,000 settlement.
He took his $7,000 to a casino near where he lives in California. The casino was open
24?hours a day, and Jonathan gambled for three days, until all his money was
gone. At this point, he called my brother to ask fora ride home. When my brother
arrived, Jonathan asked to borrow $100 so he could continue gambling.

My brother also suggested I speak with his friend Tommy who works at a horse race
track in California. Based on his experience, "l?ommy agreed that closing time was

important. He said he sees lots of people who gamble more than they should, and need
some external help to stop gambling. The track "Ionimy works at opens at 10:00 am, and
closes at 9:00 am the following morning. Tommy said the problem is that a local casino
is open 24~hours a day, so gamblers leave the track at 9:00 and head over to the casino.
He suggested. that: it is important that all the gambling establishments close at the same
time period, so that. compulsive gamblers are more likely to actually stop gambling for a
period of time. 

I believe that Illinois gambling establishments should close for part of the day, and that.
they should close concurrently.

Because of the problems associated with gambling, I oppose any expansion of gambling,
including any expansion of hours casinos may operate.

Jonathan accessed funds for gambling through identity fraud. His parents had put his
$7,000 settlement money into a trust fund until he was 18. At age 17, Jonathan fabricated
a fake ID and managed to prematurely access the $7,000 from the legal trustee. onathan
didn?tjust gamble during the three days at the casino, he was also offered drinks, and he
drank alcohol around the clock. He also bought drugs from the drug dealers who are easy
to ?nd in casinos. By all accounts, Jonathan looked and felt terrible at the end ofhis
three days in the casino. I-rlis gambling added tension to his relationship with his parents.

Tommy has a legal job at a race track, but he is surrounded by and participates in illicit
activities. In California, gamblers who win over a certain amount are required to deduct
taxes and sign relevant tax forms. Although the taxes have already been deducted, many
gamblers do not want the paper trail associated with signing the tax documents. Tommy
offers to sign for them in exchange for a 10% cut of their winnings. Tommy also makes
a point of collecting many losing tickets. At tax time, Tommy offsets all the winnings he
signed for with more than enough of the losing tickets he collected, and ends up
collecting a sizable tax refund from the government.-

My point with these stories is that when I speak to people who gamble a lot, they cannot
seem to speak. of gambling without Speaking of the shady dealings associated with
gambling a in these cases drugs, alcohol, identity fraud, tax fraud, and strained family

relationships.

I urge you not to expand gambling, the hours people can gamble, or the harms associated
with gambling in Illinois. 

Thank you,
f2! f2? 1"??er

waif:

My name is Jerry Prosapio, and I am co~founder of Gambling Exposed- Gambiing Exposed is an
educational entity designed to reveal the truths of the impact that gambling has on our society. I am
also a former compulsive gambler who knows first~hand the destruction that this addiction can
produce. My addiction to gambling started with a $2.00 daily double horse racing bet that won and
paid $80.00. I was hooked with that first win. Thirteen years later, the results of my addiction were
the following: 

Excessive. loans and cash advances on 1.7 credit cards.

2. Loss of 2 businesses with double bankruptcies (both business and personal) totaling well into
the 6 figures. .

3. illegal loans with the Mafia, which resulted in a terrifying and unexpected home visit to my wife
and my then baby son. - 

4. Jeopardizing again the life of my infant son while leaving him unattended in a vehicle as I went
to meet someone inside a bar in order to pay off my'gambling debt. 

5. Tremendous undue stress on my wife and marriage. My wife, although able to function and
still go to work at the height of my addiction, was, am convinced, close to a nervous
breakdown. -

6. Thoughts of ending it all. On my final plane trip home from a casino (flying then under a false
name), thought it would be best if the pilot would just crash the plane. 

it is by the graceof God that have been free of gambling for the past 25 years. For the first ?16 of
those 25 years, from 1983 to 1999, I regularly attended Gamblers Anonymous. In 1983, my first year
in the program, there were 12' Gamblers Anonymous meetings in the whole Chicagoland area. Of
those 12 meetings, there were only 3 women in attendance. in 1991, when gambling expansion
began in there were 19 total meetings with about a dozen women in attendance- Now, in
2008, there are a startling 57 meetings with 40% women in attendance, and 50% of all 
members are new woman! This gambling addiction, unlike alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes, is able to
prey on all peeple and age groups, from teenagers up to seniors in their '70s and 803.

Today, with recent bankruptcy legislation,.addicted gamblers are forced to choose one of the
following:

1. No longer able to absolve the full amount owed on credit cards and other debts, they will turn
to the streets. Crime has increased dramatically as compulsive gamblers are frantic to find new
money to solve their financial woes. No bank, business, or home is safe, and casualties have
mounted.

2. Payday Loan and Car Title businesses, which are already heavily supported by compulsive
gamblers, see even a larger number of victims entering their trap. These 2 predatory businesses
have exoloded since this current expansion of gambling. Open a new strip mall and usually this
will be the first blight to appear. They were not even part of the Illinois landscape until 1997.

5535W95t are. 60445 is ?08.339.?ii2? as fax7083899934 ea emailinfogitiambiingExposednrq

3. Finally, illegal street loans by the Mafia, which I mentioned earlier, will be the last resort.
These loans and the subsequent pressure exerted by futile inability to repay will result in tragic
endings. 

ask, on behalf of all the family members of compulsive gamblers already in the throes of financial
ruin, to help stop further destruction. Please do not add to the grip that gambling has on those
addicted, like once was. I plead with you, to vote no on allowing 24 hour gambling to casinos in
Illinois. I thank you for allowing me the time to share this with you. .

Villa. Park, IL 60 81 Illinois Gambling Board 4~8~08

Good morning, Chairman. Iaffe, members of theBoard, and staff. My
name is Kathy Gilroy. .I speak before you. today as a member of the public.
I am. here to voice my concerns about the prospect of 24-hour gambling at
certain Illinois gambling casinos. This issue has been before this Board
twice before, and this Board wisely did NOT approve it on either of those
occasions.

The Obvious queStion is: Who really wants gambling casinos to be open
during the hours that they are now closed? The answer is: only those who
i have a gambling problem and. those who are bene?ting from the losses of
those with a gambling problem. 

When riverboat gambling casinos first opened. in Illinois, they were
required to cruise for a certain period of time. Gamblers were also required.
to leave the riverboat at the end. of each cruise. The purpose of this policy
was to give gamblers a break from the action and. the opportunity to leave
the casino. It was a safeguard. for those with a gambling problem. That
safeguard. is already gone. Even when cruising was not required any more,
. gambling casinos maintained. the cruise-times and breaks for a period of I
time. safeguard is also already gone.

At a time when the number of persons in Illinois who have volunteered to
be self~excluded from gambling casinos has ballooned to over 5,000, is it
really a good time to eliminate any MORE safeguards? I would venture that
a high percentage ofpersons in. a gambling casino at closging~.time are either
on the self?exclusion. list already'or will shortly BE on it. That means that
those couple of hours when the gambling casino is closed are the only
safeguard LEFT for them, to stop them from gambling.

Will you be extending the carding of gamblers to all. who enter the
gambling casinos? If so, you may find. that it will not be cost-effective to be
open those wee hours of the morning anyway. EXTENDING ?l?lElIEi 
will. only be EXTENDING PAIN of those who have a gambling
addiction. Please remember your duty to look out for the interests of the
public and not just the interests of those who are pro?ting from their losses.

Illinois Gaming Board
Special Meeting
April 8, 2008

GAMING

Twenty four hour gambling at Casinos, what is the industry thinking? This would
just provide more uninterrupted time for addicted gamblers to lose and lose big.
Is there no end to how much casino operators will prey upon their victims?

The state?wide smoking ban was meant to be something good for the health of
Illinois residents. But now it looks like determined opportunists want to use this
ban to further addict vulnerable people and the state of Illinois to gambling
revenue The state?s racetraoks are pursuing the same strategy, applying for
many new Off Track Betting parlors in bars and restaurants that are pleading
declining revenues due to community and county smoking bans and now the
state?wide smoking ban. This is the third time casinos have requested 24uhour
gambling (earlier requests were in 2003 and 1999).

Since the introduction of riverboat casinos, the gambling industry has played
one state against another, citing which neighboring states have eliminated
cruising requirements, more lenient regulations, longer hours, etc. Why don't
they compete for who has fewer broken families, suicides, home foreclosures,
bank robberies, business embezzlements, and less domestic violence? One of
the conclusions of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission was that
casinos should assume more social responsibility. I propose that Illinois
casinos and the Illinois Gaming-Board become leaders in becoming more
socially responsible. Leave the casino gambling hours what they are now or
reduce them to shorter hours.

Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this issue.
