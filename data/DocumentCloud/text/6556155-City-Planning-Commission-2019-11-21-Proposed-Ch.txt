movement of pedestrians or safe ingress and egress from buildings or sites;

Transitional housing
Typically refers to rental housing for persons whose most recent
address has been a homeless shelter and who anticipate finding
a permanent residence after leaving the transitional housing
facility and after accumulating funds for a rental security
deposit. Unlike residents of emergency shelters who may move
after 30 days, transitional housing residents may spend many
months before relocating.
Transitional housing may differ from typical apartment house
living insofar as the residents may be expected or may be able
122
9-27-19

 to avail themselves of counseling or life skills training or job
training on the premises.
When transitional housing offers space for three or more
families and provides separate housekeeping and cooking
facilities for each, it should be regulated as any other multiplefamily dwelling, provided, that when residents are not free to
come and go because the program is part of a correction
program, the facility should be regulated as a pre-release
adjustment center.
When residents require supervision, assistance, protection or
personal care, the facility should be regulated as an adult foster
care facility.
When the facility offers congregate style temporary lodging
primarily to the homeless, it should be regulated as an
emergency shelter.
When the facility offers sleeping quarters in the form of cots or
beds in the same room, it should be regulated as a public lodging
house.
When the transitional housing facility includes a residential
substance abuse treatment program, it shall be regulated s a
residential substance abuse service facility.

Transitional surfaces

When the facility provides sleeping accommodations in ten or
fewer rooms or dwelling units that lack separate housekeeping
and cooking facilities in each unit, it should be regulated as a
rooming house.
Transitional surfaces exist adjacent to each runway as indicated
on the Flight Obstruction Area Map on file at the Buildings,
Safety Engineering, and Environmental Department. These
surfaces begin at the centerline of the runways and extend
outward, at the elevation of the runway, for 500 feet in the case
of instrument runways, and 250 feet in the case of noninstrument runways, and then slope upward and outward one
foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point
where they interest horizontal surface “A.” Further, transitional
surfaces exist adjacent to all approach surfaces and extend the
entire length of the approach surfaces, beginning at the edges
and extending upward and outward at the same 1:7 slope ration
to the point where they intersect horizontal surface “A.”
