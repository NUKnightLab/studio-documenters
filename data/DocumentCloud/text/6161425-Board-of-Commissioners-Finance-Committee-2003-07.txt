of State's office, it can file an appeal with the Assessor's Office requesting a
classification change for its properties to Class 4, which lowers the assessment
level from 38% to 30% of fair market value; and
WHEREAS, the change to not-for-profit status results in a 21 percent tax
reduction each year; and
WHEREAS, any property not classified as a not-for-profit or not owned by a
religious organization is deemed Class 5 property and assessed at 38% of its
fair market value; and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit status is in place until the property is sold or it
violates its status; and
WHEREAS, not-for-profit corporations occasionally stray from their mission or
fail to abide by the words and intent of their charters.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED

and publicly-available facts demonstrate that the not-for-profit owner has
operated contrary to the letter and intent of its charter.
