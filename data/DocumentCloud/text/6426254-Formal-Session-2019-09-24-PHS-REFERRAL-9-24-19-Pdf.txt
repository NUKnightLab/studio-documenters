RE: Petition No. 590 First Latin American Baptist Church, request to vacate and

part of the north-south alley, 20 feet wide, in the block of Vernor Highway, 66 feet wide, Wolff
Avenue, 50 feet wide, Scotten Avenue, 66 feet wide, and Palms Avenue, 50 feet wide.

The petition was referred to the City Engineering Division DPW for investigation (utility review)
and report. This is our report.

The request is being made to facilitate a future development.

The request was approved by the Solid Waste Division DPW, and Traf?c Engineering Division
DPW, and City Engineering - DPW.

Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) has no objection to the conversion to easement.
The speci?c DWSD provisions for easements are included in the resolution. DTE Energy reports
involvement because they have services in the area; a specific provision to maintain access to DTE
facilities is a part of the resolution.

All other involved City Departments, and privately owned utility companies have reported no
objections to the conversion of the public right-of-way into a private easement for public utilities.
Provisions protecting utility installations are part of the attached resolution.
I am recommending adoption of the attached resolution.

RE: Demolition damage to 6350 DeSoto, Detroit
Background

In June of this year Homrich caused damage to the structure, gutter and downspout at 6350 DeSoto while
demolishing an adjacent home. At the homeowner?s request, Homrich dispatched a laborer to 6350 DeSoto to
repair the damages.

When asked about the quality of the repair, according to the homeowner, the laborer stated the gutter had to be
installed in a manner pitched away from the roof to ensure it is secured to the roof. (See the attached
photographs).

Since that time the homeowner has initiated numerous conversations with Homrich representatives regarding
removing and properly reinstalling the gutter and downspout after performing the needed repairs to the
structure. This matter remains unresolved.

 

Please provide answers to the following:

1. What has the DLBA done to resolve this ongoing matter?

2. Does the DLBA maintain records of private properties damaged during demolition of land bank owned

homes.

3. If yes, to question 2 above,

a. How many private properties have been damaged to date?

b. How many private properties have been satisfactorily repaired to date?
is there a reporting process whereby demolition contractors report damages to private property?
Is there a process in place for the inspection of damages to private property damaged during demolition.
Is there a process in place for the inspection of repairs to private property damaged during demolition.

EMORANDUM

TO: Law Department
FROM: Council President Pro Tem Mary Shuf?e.
VIA: Council Member Scott Benson, Chair

Public Health and Safety Standing Committee
DATE: September 17, 2019
RE: D-DOT Income Based Reduced Fare Ordinance

 

This communication is to request the Law Department to draft an income-based reduced
fare ordinance. Such a program is designed to increase transit affordability, by providing
those with zero to low incomes with the opportunity to gain access to transit. Increasing
transit affordability will ensure residents have access to school, work, daycare services,
and medical appointments.

Should you have any questions please contact my of?ce.
