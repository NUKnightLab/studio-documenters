LETTER
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 14, 2007 from
RICHARD A. DEVINE, Cook County State’s Attorney

Chicago, Illinois 60602
Re:

07-503: Appointment of Denise Roche-Evans to the Cook County
Emergency Telephone System Board

Dear Mr. Birk:
You have asked our office to advise you concerning whether any conflict of
interest would be created by the appointment of Denise Roche-Evans, who is
employed by the Sheriff of Cook County as the Director of 911 Communications,
to serve as member of the Cook County Emergency Telephone System Board
(“ETSB”). President Stroger presented this appointment at the November 6,
2007 County Board meeting. The appointment was referred to the Legislation,
Intergovernmental and Veteran’s Relations Committee, and was discussed at the
November 20, 2007 meeting of that committee.
ISSUE PRESENTED:
Whether any conflict of interest would be created by the appointment of Denise
Roche-Evans, who is employed by the Sheriff of Cook County as Director of 911
Communications, to serve as a member of the Cook County Emergency
Telephone System Board.

5538

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 31, 2008
CONCLUSION:
This Office has concluded that no conflict would be created by the service of Ms.
Roche-Evans on the Cook County ETSB. Pursuant to ordinance, “at least three
members of the [ETSB] shall be representatives of the 9-1-1 public safety
agencies, … and appointed on the basis of their experience.” Cook County Ord.
§ 26-79(b). Further, it is our understanding the Ms. Roche-Evans’ position as the
Sheriff’s Police Department’s Director of 911 Communications, is funded
entirely by the County through the budget of the Sheriff and not by the
Emergency Telephone System Fund. Moreover, in her capacity as the Sheriff’s
911 Communications Director, Ms. Roche-Evans is supervised exclusively by
the Sheriff and his delegates, and not the ETSB or the ETSB’s executive
Director.
DISCUSSION:
The Cook County ESTB was established pursuant to statute by county-wide
referendum held on April 20, 1993. See, 50 ILCS 750/1 et seq.; Cook County
Ord. No. 92-O-49, adopted September 21, 1992), presently codified at Cook
County Ord. §§ 26-71 through 26-80. Section 26-79(b) provides as follows:
(b) At least three members of the Board shall be representatives of the 9-1-1
public safety agencies, including but not limited to police departments, fire
departments, emergency medical services providers, and emergency services and
disaster agencies, and appointed on the basis of their ability or experience.
Elected officials are also eligible to serve on the Board. Members of the board
shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for their actual and
necessary expenses.
Cook County Ord. § 26-79. As is evident, three of the ETSB board members are
required to possess qualifications of the type possessed by Ms. Roche-Evans, i.e.,
experience in 911 communications.
A review of caselaw and opinions issued by the Illinois Attorney General
concerning conflict of interest and incompatibility of public offices reveals that a
conflict exists when two offices are viewed as fiscally incompatible. See, e.g.,
People ex rel. Theros v. Verbeck, 155 Ill. App. 3d 81, 83-84 (1st Dist. 1987)
(Defendant’s two offices were fiscally incompatible since defendant as a member
of the county board had authority to act upon the salary and budget of the county
coroner who, in turn, determines defendant’s salary as deputy county coroner.
The potential for influencing his superior’s salary and budget and, ultimately, his
own salary, without more, rendered defendant’s offices incompatible.)
Further, a conflict has been found to exist when a subordinate official, in another
capacity, supervises his superior. See, Rogers v. Village of Tinley Park, 116 Ill.
App. 3d 437, 441 (1st Dist. 1983) (Positions of municipal police officer and
village trustee incompatible); 1996 Ill. Op. Att’y Gen. No. 96-042 (Conflict of
interest in county board member serving as county housing authority executive
director, because county board member’s power to act upon appointment of
housing authority commissioner, who in turn selected and supervised executive
director of the housing authority precluded simultaneous tenure in these
positions.)

5539

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR MARCH 31, 2008
The appointment of Ms. Roche-Evans to the County ETSB implicates neither of
these potential areas of conflict. No fiscal incompatibility can be present because
Ms. Roche-Evans’ salary as the Sheriff’s Director of 911 Communications is not
paid from any ETSB funds, but rather exclusively through the Sheriff’s budget as
provided in the annual Cook County appropriations ordinance. Further, in her
capacity as 911 Communications Director for the Sheriff, it is our understanding
that Ms. Roche-Evans is supervised exclusively by the Sheriff and his delegates
and is not responsible to the ETSB.
Thus, this Office has concluded that no conflict of interest is presented by the
proposed appointment of Ms. Roche-Evans to the Cook County ETSB.
_________________________

President be approved.
