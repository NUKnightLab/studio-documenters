1. JM reported on his latest work with cultivating the weekly neighborhood art’s guides, a
Halloween guide that has events everyday for 13 days around WPB, and new potential
buildings for murals.
2. Mural update – We have five new mural submissions to be reviewed next month since
there was not quorum when they were initially reviewed. Darian has expressed he
knows of two sites for murals. Former voting member, Amy (last name?) has been
funded by Sony to complete a mural in the neighborhood.
3. DG would like Worker Cottage to be lit 24 hours a day. AH will reach out about this.
4. We have received the electrical invoice for Worker Cottage and it will be brought to the
Executive Committee.
5. SSA staff will check with State Farm about liability insurance for the Window Works
program.
6. DG would like AH to reach out to Roberto to do a photo collage/history of a building
installation for Window Works.
7. Christina Murphy’s “Bountiful” sculpture will be brought to the Executive Committee.
8. DG discussed Chopin Theatre’s book project to the committee. They presented all of
the requested documents to the Executive Committee earlier in October and were
approved.
9. JM suggested the committee look into advertising the neighborhood arts/programs in
an arts publication in 2019. He also suggests we send out a survey to local artists and
galleries to see what we can begin in 2019 to benefit their work.
Motion 1: DG motions to approve Darien Hallagan as a voting member for the Arts Committee.
