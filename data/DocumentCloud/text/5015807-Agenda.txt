Subject: Corrective Action Plan, including the Auditor General?s Assessment, November
15, 2017, for the Wayne County Department of Corporation Counsel Outside
Legal Counsel Services.

Dear Chairman Basham:

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States, and the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing
issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors, the Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General (OAG)
requested the Wayne County Department of Corporation Counsel Outside Legal Counsel
Services to submit a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for the recommendations identi?ed in the
Wayne County Department of Corporation Counsel Outside Legal Counsel Services
Performance Engagement, dated July 6, 2017. Thirteen recommendations were addressed to the
Wayne County Department of Corporation Counsel and one (1) recommendation to Wayne
County Department of Risk Management.

The CAP was provided as requested. Attached is a Summary and Assessment of the CAP
prepared by the OAG. The summary schedule includes: the recommendations; management?s
comments on the ?ndings and recommendations; management?s action taken or planned;
whether management has or intends to implement the recommendation; responsible
implementation or targeted implementation date; and the Auditor General?s
assessment.

Honorable Raymond Basham, Chairman
DAP No 2017-57?012

January 16, 2017

Page 2 of 2

Our assessment of the 14 recommendations found that management took suf?cient action on ?ve
(5) recommendations, four (4) have not been addressed and ?ve (5) are in process. Therefore, a
follow?up review is deemed necessary.

We recommend
management within Wayne
County Corporation
counsel implement policy
and procedures that
document (1) the need for
"the outside legal services,
and (2) the process used
for selecting a Speci?c
outside legal ?rm to
provide the services in
order to ensure
transparency and fairness
within the selection
process.

Disagree

The Of?ce - of Corporation
Counsel will conduct an internal
audit to determine the
circumstances which require
outside counsel to be retained
and will draft an internal .policy
that will address said
circumstances. The Of?ce of
Corporation Counsel selects
outside counsel by evaluating
which law ?rm is the most
quali?ed to providethe services
required in the most cost-
effective manner possible. The
Of?ce of Corporation Counsel
will include this selection method
in its internal policy.

Yes

Administration

In-Process

During the review, management
stated they will draft an internal policy that
will require Corporation Counsel to
document both the circumstances that
require outside counsel to be retained as
well as the selection process for retaining
outside counsel. However, the document
which supports the decision would be
protected by the attorney work product
privilege

Based on the limited review of the action
taken, it appears management is in process
of addressing the recommendation.

However, a follow?up review may be
necessary in the near ?iture to verify that the
described action has fully occurred.

 

 

16-02

 

Corporation Counsel when
selecting ?rms to provide
outside legal counsel and
rates are a consideration
should ensure that the
contracts are based on the
rates in the proposals as
long as they are not in
excess of the maximum
$200 rate.

 

Disagree

 

The Of?ce of Corporation
Counsel does not believe it
should charge di?'erent law ?rms
different rates, regardless of What
rate was bid. The Of?ce of
Corporation Counsel pays
$200/hour to all outside counsel.
This is consistent with most
municipal legal departments and
it supports small businesses,
many of which are headquartered
inWayne County.

 

No

 



 

Not
implemented

 

The OAG commends Ceiporation Counsel

for capping outside legal fees at$200lhoun

However, we. still believe that if a law ?rm,
responding to a Request For Quali?cations
(RFQ), submits a billing rate less than
$200lhour, the subsequent contract should
be executed at the lower quoted billing rate.
Ifi?t remains Corporation Counsel?s intent to
pay $200/hour to all outside legal counsel,
then we suggest Corporation Counsel
consider revising the RFQ language to state
the hourly fee will be $200/hour.
Corporation Counsel indicated that the RFQ
was posted. on November 28, 2017;
therefore, they would not be able to revise
the RFQ nor did they believe it necessary.

We recommend Disagree
management within the

Counsel:

(A) Implement procedures
to ensure that legal
service contracts
$50,000 and greater
are presented to the
Wayne County
Commission for
approval in
accordance with the
Procurement
Ordinance and that
services are not
performed or
payments made until
Commission approval.

 

 

Procedures are in place to request
Commission approval for
contracts that equal or exceed
$50,000. Services are not paid
for until an approved contract has
been executed, however, there
are times when services must be
provided before an approved
contract is in place such as
responding to a complaint or
other court ?lings in the time
required by the relevant court
rules.

 

Procedure
already in place

 

 

Not
Implemented

 

Based on the discussion with
Corporation Counsel, they indicated that
they disagree with this recommendation as
they stated they have procedures already in
place to ensure contracts greater than
$50,000 are submitted to the Commission
for approval. However, as noted in our
initial engagement, we identi?ed a contract
over $50,000 that did not come to the
Commission for approval prior to services
being performed.

During the review, while we did not
note any new legal services contracts greater
than $50,000 that were not presented to the
Commission for approval, we did note an
instance where work was performed by
outside legal counsel prior to Commission
approval. The ultimately
approved the modi?cation retroactively.

Corporation Counsel believes their
procedures are suf?cient to ensure contracts
greater than $50,000 are presented to the
Commission for approval.

Subject: Engagement and Other Projects, Audit/Work Plan, Year 2018

Dear Chairman Basham:

I, along with the staff of the Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General (OAG), are honored and
pleased to provide for your consideration the enclosed 2018 Annual Audit Plan. This
comprehensive report details our plan of audits and reviews for the upcoming year. This report
is provided in accordance with Performance Standard 2010, Planning, of the International

Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, issued by the Institute of Internal
Auditors.

This standard, along with best practices for professional internal auditing, requires internal audit
organizations to submit their annual audit plan to their oversight body for acceptance. It also
requires the internal audit organization to obtain input from management to ensure their
concerns, regarding risk and other factors that could impede the entity from achieving its
Operational objectives and goals, are considered in developing the annual plan. We requested
and received comments from elected of?cials and senior management in responses to the 
risk assessment questionnaire in developing this Audit/Work Plan.

The plan as transmitted is largely based on our internal assessment of potential risk to the county
across all executive branch departments, of?ces managed by county elected of?cials, as well as
certain component units and agencies of the county. We designed the Audit/Work Plan to
address perceived risk areas within county operations, along with considering the allocation of
our scarce resources to reviewing those areas.

We believe this audit plan is consistent with the mission of supporting an atmosphere of

continuous improvement, integrity, transparency, and accountability through an independent
assessment of county programs, activities, and functions.

 

Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General

We would like to acknowledge the professionalism and cooperation extended to us during this
process by county elected of?cials and management of county departments. 1 look forward to
another successful year of audit services to the County of Wayne.

In conclusion, I want to assure you that we in the OAG remain motivated and committed to
carrying out this plan and ful?lling the mission and purpose for which we were established.

Respectfully submitted,

Introduction

The Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General (OAG) is an independent, objective internal audit
organization, offering value to county of?cials responsible for governance over county
operations and accountability to its citizens. Our purpose is to examine and evaluate county
activities in order to achieve transparency and accountability of public funds, and improve the
operations of county government for the bene?t of Wayne County citizens. Internal Audit helps
an organization achieve its objectives by providing a systematic, disciplined and objective
approach when evaluating county operations and improves the effectiveness of risk management,
internal controls, and governance processes.

The OAG assists county of?cials and county managers by providing unbiased, independent
review and analysis of policies, procedures, and county operations. The OAG is reSponsible for
identifying the areas in need of review based on various risk factors.

Government Auditing Standards and the Institute of lntemal Auditor Standards encourage audit
organizations to establish a risk-based audit approach to determine the priorities for audit
activities. A risk assessment is a systematic process to evaluate, identify, and prioritize potential
audits based on the level of risk to the county. Determining which areas to audit and allocating
scarce resources to those areas is key to a successful internal audit function.

Audit Plan Development

Institute of Internal Auditors Standard 2010 Planning requires that the internal audit activity
establish a risk-based plan, undertaken at least annually, to determine the priorities of the internal
audit activity are consistent with the organization?s goals. The plan is largely based on our
internal assessment of potential risk to the county across all executive branch departments and

divisions, of?ces managed by county elected officials, as well as certain component units and
agencies of the county.

The goal of an annual audit plan is to ef?ciently prioritize and allocate limited resources to those
areas considered to present the greatest risk; where the Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General can
provide the greatest amount of value. As with most annual plans of activity, this plan should not
be considered static; instead it should be considered dynamic or ?exible and able to adapt to
changing conditions during the year, if they arise. We will continuously assess the deployment
of audit resources throughout the year to ensure they are being utilized in the most effective
manner for the bene?t of the county, its citizens, and users of its services. Completion of the
plan may be affected by audits requested by the commission, management of?cials, special
projects, and unforeseen circumstances.

Audit Process

As noted below, our audit process begins with the OAG performing a countywide risk
assessment which is described in more detail below. Once the risk assessment is complete and
input is provided by the commission and county leadership, the audit plan is developed,

submitted, and discussed with the Committee on Audit and received and ?led by the Wayne
County Commission.

Upon completion of audit ?eldwork procedures, a report is drafted which addresses the ?ndings
and recommendations resulting from the audit work performed. The OAG allows management
the opportunity to review the draft report for accuracy and include the Views from responsible
of?cials within the report. The draft report is submitted to the Committee on Audit for
discussion, review, and forwarded to the Wayne County Commission to be received and ?led.

After issuance of the ?nal report, the OAG requests a corrective action plan from management.
The corrective action proposed by management is assessed and the report is issued. Follow-up

reviews will be performed based on the seriousness of the identi?ed risk and related impact to
the county.

The Of?ce of Legislative Auditor General performed a countywide risk assessment to gain an
understanding of key ?nancial, compliance, and business risks that could potentially threaten the

county?s achievement of its

objectives. To complete the countywide risk assessment, a risk

assessment questionnaire survey was sent to all county elected of?cials and executive

department and division heads.

In addition, the OAG reviewed budgeted revenues and

Noted Kev Concerns

Retention of personnel High level of turnover across the county. The pace of staff leaving
has exceeded the rate at which the county has been able to hire in many departments.

Competitive Salaries and Bene?ts Replacing the loss of staff members is dif?cult because
salaries and benefits are not competitive.

Outdated Computer Systems Numerous county departments are presently operating with
outdated information systems to conduct their day-to?day transactions/ activities. Many noted the
IT systems are no longer supported.

2018 Audit Plan

We designed our ?risk?based? audit plan to address what we consider to be the highest priority
areas, while allocating our scarce resources to reviewing these areas.

The plan, which lists 43 engagements, includes audits, consulting, reviews and other engagement
types that will be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing
Standards (GAGAS) issued by the U.S. Comptroller General and the International Standards for
the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (HA) issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors.
Also included are carry?over engagements from the prior year?s audit plan.

The engagements were selected to assist county leadership and management with their oversight
and decision making; improve the effectiveness and efficiency within county operations; and,
enhance accountability over resources. The planned engagements will take place within county
and in certain cases, component units.

This audit plan is based on an estimation of 11,600 engagement hours. Based on current direct
audit hours available, our goal is to complete approximately 25 projects depending on the

number of hours it will take to complete each engagement. See page 13 of 18 of our plan for
additional detail.

While general audit objectives are included in the plan, specific objectives will be determined
upon completion of the planning phase of each engagement.

Statement of Organizational Independence
HA Standards Attribute Standard
1110 Organizational Independence

The chief audit executive must report to a level within the organization that allows the internal
audit activity to fulfill its responsibilities. The chief audit executive must con?rm to the board,
at least annually, the organizational independence of the internal audit activity.

1110. 01 The internal audit activity must be free from interference in determining the scope
of internal auditing, performing work, and communicating results.

GAS 3.02 3.5 9? Independence

3.02 - In all matters relating to the audit work, the audit organization and the individual
auditor, whether government or public, must be independent.

Two attributes that assure the success and credibility of the Office of Legislative Auditor General
(OAG) are independence and objectivity. This involves maintaining a mental attitude and
perspective of independency in fact and appearance from the processes employed, the results,
conclusions and reporting of engagements and projects performed under the scope of authority.
These parameters are set forth in the Wayne County Charter Section 3.119 and Wayne County
Code of Ordinances Chapter 65 and are applied to the OAG functions and auditors who are
involved in the activities prescribed.

The Auditor General shall be appointed by a majority of the Commissioners serving. The
Auditor General may be removed for cause by a 2/3 vote of the Commissioners serving. The
Auditor General reports directly to the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Wayne County
Commission who has delegated the responsibility for independently managing the audit function.
Therefore, the OAG is considered free from impairment to independence as stated in 3.28a and
3.2% of the Government Auditing Standards.

Office of Legislative Auditor General
Statement of Organizational Independence
Calendar Year 2018

Along with the structure as outlined above, the OAG assures this concept as it applies to the
internal audit function on an annual basis and/or as required. These elements joined together
must meet the requirement for Organizational Independence required under Standard 1110 of the
International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing as issued by the
Institute of Internal Auditors.

NOTE: The most relevant Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and
Institute of Internal Auditors (HA) Standards are listed at the bottom of this statement.

 

Identify audit areas that may be affected or where organizational independence may be impaired:

Wayne County Commission Audit (Completed once every two years)

 

 

 

POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPAIRMENTS TO THE INDPENDENCE

I have reviewed the activities, functions, organizational structure, and reporting lines with
respect to Wayne County and its departments, elected of?cials, component units, agencies,
programs, and processes. I am not aware of any circumstances that might impair or lead others
to question the ability to be independent, impartial, and objective on any
audit/engagement, except as indicated above. Therefore, any potential impairment listed above
are areas that the OAG does not engage.

RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE THIS DISCLOSURE

I understand that I am also responsible to make timely written noti?cation in the event any other
circumstance arises during the course of the year that might impair or appear to impair the
independence with respect to an audit or activity this includes external impairments and
required disclosure related to nonuaudit service as noted in 3.44 of GAGAS and 1130 of the HA
Standards.
