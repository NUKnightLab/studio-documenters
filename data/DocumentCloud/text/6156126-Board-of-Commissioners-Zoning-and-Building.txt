Seeking a SPECIAL USE FOR UNIQUE USE for the continued operation of an
excavating business and two rental units for a five year period In the R-4 Single
Family Residence District. The property consists of approximately 2.53 acres,
located approximately 1650 feet East of State Street, on the North side of 1291h

On March 4, 1992, the County Board enacted an Ordinance granting the application in
accordance with "The Findings and Recommendations of the Zoning Board of Appeals". The
initial five years expi red March 3, 1997. The operators of the excavating business failed to
make any request for an extension until July 21 , 1999. On that date, at a regularly scheduled
public hearing, the Zoning Board of Appeals took testimony from the applicant and Scott
Buening, Community Development Director for the Village of Lemont. After considering the
testimony, the Zoning Board of Appeals recommended to the County Board that an extension
thru December 31, 2000, be granted. On August 4, 1999, the County Board granted that
extension.

The Zoning Board of Appeals received a letter dated November 1, 2000, from James
Morris of Morris Excavating Inc. , stating that they had purchased property to relocate the
business and are in the process of constructing a new building at 29 Forestwood Ct. ,
Romeoville, Illinois. They are striving to meet the December 3P 1 deadline, but would like to be
granted a six-month extension in case of any foreseen events that may delay the move.
