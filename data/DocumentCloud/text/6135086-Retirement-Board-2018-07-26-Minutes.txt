The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
Officer David A. Soltis is currently in receipt of disability benefits. Executive Director Tuczak
received a letter from him and his treating physician that his current medical condition includes
aggressive chemotherapy. His diagnosis is life threatening and the prognosis is guarded. He lives
in Florida, and has not seen Dr. Orris in 2018. Based on his medical condition, he is requesting
not to travel to Chicago, Illinois, at this time. The Board collectively agreed to delay Officer
Soltis’ examination by Dr. Orris until a future date due to his medical condition.
Officers Roberto Miranda and Dennis O’Connell are both officers that are in receipt of duty
disability benefits. They attended their exams with Dr. Orris. As part of each exam, Dr. Orris
requested they bring medical records to support their continuing disability, and they have not
supplied any documents. A letter was directed to each of them requesting all medical records and
notes from their respective primary care physicians and treating neurologists from the last year to
ensure continuation of duty disability benefits. They were to supply the records by July 15, 2018.
The records have not been received by staff at the Fund.
Following Board policy, it is recommended that benefits be suspended effective August 1st until
these records be supplied to Fund staff.

Director Tuczak reviewed with the Trustees the timeline for this year’s election for two trustee
positions. One position is for the annuitant representative and the other is for the member that
represents the rank of Investigator, Patrolman or ranks equivalent thereto. The sufficiency Board
hearing, at which a quorum must be present, is scheduled for Friday – October 5, 2018, at 9:30am.
Based upon the current election rules, some amendments to the rules are necessary to accommodate
the exact dates of this election and others in the past. Ms. Tuczak discussed the proposed
amendments to the election rules and distributed a copy of the proposed amendments to each Trustee.
Specifically, language is to be added indicating that specific dates and the schedule for each
respective election will be established by the Board in accordance with the rules, and the word
“approximately” will be added where certain dates are mentioned, which would afford some
flexibility on the dates.
It was moved by Trustee Hamburger, seconded by Trustee Wodnicki that the Board approve the
requested amendments to the Board Rules for Conducting an Election, as detailed and discussed.

The next issue concerned the Fund’s acceptance of requests from retired members to have deductions
from their pension checks for healthcare programs outside of the coverage administered by the City of
Chicago. As part of this process, the Fund must have a signed authorization on file to deduct the
premiums from the pension disbursement. There are approximately fifty annuitants for whom the
Fund’s staff is deducting a premium, but a signed authorization is not on file. These individuals have
received multiple requests for authorization, including a Final Notice sent in March. After thorough
discussion, it was agreed that another Final Notice be sent indicating that the deduction will cease
August 1, if no authorization is received. The Board requested that staff track all attempts to contact
the annuitants impacted.

Ms. Tuczak turned the floor over to Board counsel, Justin Kugler. The Fund reviewed this matter
earlier in the year regarding the passing of a widow “Collins”, whose death occurred some two years
ago, resulting in overpayment of benefits after date of death through the date the Fund learned of the
death. A letter was directed to certain family members with contact information at the Fund
requesting information and reimbursement of the overpayment. Such attempt received no response.
The Board then instructed counsel to redirect communication with notice that the matter potentially
may be handed over to the proper authorities if reimbursement is not completed. Justin Kugler
informed the Board that the Fund very recently recaptured $5,000.00 towards the overpayment, with
an agreement to pay $1,000.00 each month until the $14,000.00 is paid. With the Board’s approval, a
letter memorializing this payment and the agreement to future payments will be sent, thereby the
authorities shall not be contacted if the agreement is fulfilled.
It was moved by Trustee Wodnicki, seconded by Trustee Hamburger that the Board approve the
Collins’ family repayment plan as presented by Board counsel.

The last item from the Executive Director, Ms. Tuczak, was distribution of hard copies of the
December 31, 2017, actuarial valuations and the CAFR that were recently finalized and published.
Copies are also available on the Fund’s website.
The Fund’s Chief Investment Officer, Aoifinn Devitt, reviewed with the Board a few matters as an
Investment Committee meeting was not held in the month of July.
•

Investment performance of the Fund’s portfolio was discussed, noting that through June 30, 2018,
the Fund’s performance is essentially flat. Performance of the Fund’s equity, fixed income,
private credit, hedge fund and long-short equity portfolios were briefly discussed. The benefits of
the rebalancing completed earlier in the year were discussed.

•

Ms. Tuczak discussed the current cash position of the Fund, noting the cash available to fund July
benefits. Significant increases in cash are expected with the upcoming tax receipt collections due
in August.

President Hauser requested approval to attend two conferences; Illinois Public Pension Fund
