Welcome Resource Center/Intake Center (WRC) – The primary Intake Center for entering into the BSEED virtual environment. A customer’s arrival point
of entry for permitting applications; providing assistance, guidance and resources; allowing customers to create accounts, upload plans and applications for
review. Electronic Plan Review (ePLANS) - Electronic submittal of construction or site plans for review and approval, either off-site or at BSEED. Electronic
Plan Review is currently LIVE; is expected to streamline operations and reduce review turn-around and response times by providing parallel vs. sequential

 Notification of Violations and compliance enforcement at 36th District Court and Department of Administrative Hearings.
 Responding to Complaints.
 Examinations of Trade Professionals.
 Annual Cross-Connection Inspections.

There are future development projects that will demand onsite Inspectors to monitor the activities of the projects from ground breaking to completion. Based on
discussions with local contractors and or developers, three additional dedicated inspectors for each discipline will be needed for Building, Mechanical, Plumbing
and Electrical.

PROPERTY MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The Property Maintenance Division (PMD) provides inspections of existing rental residential and commercial structures to encourage property maintenance and
the stabilization of neighborhoods by addressing blight, as well as maintaining the safety and welfare of tenants. Property Maintenance also conducts community
surveys and responds to citizen complaints to correct noncompliant properties and if tenant relocation is necessary (in cases of no heat, water or electricity), PMD
works with the housing and health department to find temporary living arrangements. Property owners who are not in compliance with the current Property
Maintenance and Zoning Codes are subject to tickets which may result in litigation and possible fines levied by the Department of Appeals and Hearings and 36th
District Court. BSEED hired project managers who streamline and implement processes and procedures while tracking performance and daily productivity to help
increase code enforcement. All metrics, dashboards, and scorecards are being managed by the managers and reported to the Administration on a weekly basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
Environmental Affairs (EA) interacts with federal, state and local agencies to improve and protect the City’s water, air, and land resources. EA’s technical
personnel are assigned to either Environmental Assessment or Response (Brownfields) or Environmental Management Systems/Emergency Response.
EA develops and implements programs that support sustainable development initiatives which focus on Brownfields Redevelopment pursuant to the Michigan
Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA), Public Act 451 of 1994, as amended, and obtains funding for cleanup of contaminated sites. EA
fosters legislative and regulatory initiatives at the state and federal levels to assist the City of Detroit like other municipalities in meeting their environmental
objectives through partnership programs, policies, and funding. In addition, EA identifies funding opportunities by applying for and obtaining grants for
redevelopment purposes. EA reviews Environmental Site Assessment reports for commercial properties to assist the Detroit Building Authority in the demolition
of these sites. EA is responsible for enforcement of the bulk solid materials storage amendments to Chapter 22 of the City Code.
The City Charter requires EA to coordinate environmental protection policies in the City of Detroit. EA must review and approve Environmental Site Assessment
reports for all properties being acquired by the City of Detroit. EA staff provides skills to maintain citywide compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Staff
also provides guidance on the most effective, sustainable use of the natural resources available to the City. Lastly, EA assists other city departments with
environmental compliance requirements and objectives by providing technical assistance and developing procedures to achieve compliance.
In FY 2017-18, the Environmental Enforcement group which was formerly a part of the Department of Public Works (DPW) Solid Waste group was merged to
the EA appropriation for synergy and has been under the supervision of EA since May 2018. Personnel and operating costs associated with the unit are fully
reimbursable by the Solid Waste fund of DPW.
In FY20, the EA will assume responsibility for the administration of the Wayne County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Program within the city of Detroit.
The new program will require Environmental Specialists to review plans submitted for each development that meets the requirements in addition to conducting
multiple site inspections at each site to ensure that control measures are installed correctly and are working properly.
EA was approved to participate in the Community Rating System (CRS) in late 2017 which is optional to communities that participate in the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP). The mandated activities were evaluated and the city received a CRS classification of 8, which allowed homeowners of properties
located in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) of the city to realize a 10% reduction in the cost of their flood insurance premiums which became effective on
October 1, 2017.

B13-8

 BUILDINGS, SAFETY ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT (13)
Due to efforts by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which determine the size and location of the
SFHA, the Jefferson/Chalmers neighborhood may see an increase in the size of the SFHA by four times or more. It is the City’s goal to increase the flood plan
management activities to enable a higher reduction on flood insurance premiums. Additional participation in FEMA’s effort to revise the Flood Insurance Rate
Maps is imperative to prevent the expansion of the flood plains.
EA anticipates an increase in the number of Environmental Assessments reports for review and approval by EA requested for planning for new development
projects in the city and prior to commercial demolitions. EA also anticipates additional requests for environmental reviews from Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment
Authority (DBRA).
Environmental Enforcement has seen a yearly increase in requests submitted through See Click Fix from 17,690 in Fiscal Year 2017 to a projected 35,600 in fiscal
year 2019.
