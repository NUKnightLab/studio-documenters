Summary: The Cook County Sheriff’s Office has a program to train detainees and participants from the
Vocational Rehabilitation Impact Center to provide deconstruction and building material salvage services.
Upon completion of the program, each participant receives basic carpentry and building material reuse
training and an OSHA 10-hour safety certificate. The Forest Preserves seeks authority to continue to use
this program to remove unneeded buildings from recently acquired properties and other properties as
needed. The original agreement was extended annually, most recently in 2018 (Agenda Item 18-0269).
The original amount of $84,839.00 was increased by $100,000.00 in 2016 (Agenda Item 16-0234). Due to
a recent acquisition with numerous buildings that are not needed, the Forest Preserves is seeking to extend
the agreement for two (2) years and increase funding to cover estimated costs for removal of structures at
various locations listed in the amended agreement.

PROPOSED BID RECOMMENDATION
Department: Department of Planning and Development
Request: Authorization for the Forest Preserves of Cook County (the “Forest Preserves”) to enter into a
construction contract for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) improvements at the Forest
Preserves’ Central Garage, with Ideal Heating Company of Brookfield, Illinois
Reason: Contract #74000006072 issued under project #19-80-40 Central Garage HVAC Renovations
and Alterations includes, but is not limited to, demolition of an existing sixty-five (65) year old steam
boiler that has reached the end of its useful life as well as demolition of existing inefficient HVAC
equipment and installation of more energy efficient systems.
Improvements to this critical vehicle maintenance building are projected to save approximately 62.4
metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year (equal to the amount of emissions produced by thirteen
(13) cars each driving about 11,750 miles) and to save approximately $9,500.00 per year in utility costs
equating to 28 percent of current utility costs. This building is the Forest Preserves’ third largest natural
gas consumer and this work will help achieve the Forest Preserves’ goal to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Approximately $11,000.00 in utility company rebates will contribute roughly 1.1 percent of the project
costs.
