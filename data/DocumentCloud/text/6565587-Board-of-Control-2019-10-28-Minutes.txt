Inc.; asked if the ERP Project has stalled since July and if any negotiations were attempted with the vendor;
and asked how another delay would impact the ERP project.

there was any feedback from other vendors who were contacted for quotes on this service as the
department is also requesting an RFP exemption; asked what portion of the $237,584.47 is paid to Hyland

Dale Miller asked for confirmation that this service is necessary in order for the ERP Project to move
