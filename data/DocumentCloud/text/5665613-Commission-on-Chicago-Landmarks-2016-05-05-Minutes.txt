Approved unanimously with the following findings:
1) Preliminary find that the subject property, a 3-story garage building
constructed in 1960 with subsequent alterations to the front façade and
1-story rooftop addition from 2000, is non-contributing to the
character of the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and its
demolition would not be an adverse effect to the District. Upon receipt

permit in accordance with Section 2-120-825 Permits for Demolition
of Landmarks City Council Approval Required of the Municipal Code
of Chicago or as applicable;
2) Find that the new construction project, contingent upon the future
approval of a demolition permit, and with the following conditions,
meets the criteria set forth in the Commission’s Rules and Regulations,
the Commission’s Guidelines for Alterations to Historic Buildings and
New Construction and the Design Guidelines for the Historic
Michigan Boulevard District therefore, the project will not have an
adverse effect on the significant historical and architectural features of

 the landmark district and approve the project with the following
conditions:
a) The proposed size, shape, scale and siting of the building as shown
on drawings dated 4/27/16 is approved as proposed;
b) A report by a licensed structural engineer addressing how the
adjacent Essex Inn building should be supported, braced, and
protected, including any vibration monitoring, during the
excavation and construction process shall be included on the
permit plans. The recommended measures, sequencing, and
protections shall be incorporated in the structural and architectural
drawings;
c) All enlarged flashing details and foundation wall details between
Essex Inn and the side walls and foundations of the new high-rise
shall be included in the permit plans;
d) Enlarged typical details and the final selection of material samples
should return to the Permit Review Committee for approval; and,
e) Any major changes to the proposal will come back for review and
approval by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks or by its
Permit Review Committee.

with a maximum height of 25’-6” is approved as submitted. The new,
3’-6” glass railing set back a minimum of 4’-6” from the outside face
