(Item 5)
There were four Workforce Services contracts approved by CHA’s Tenant Services Committee on
August 14, 2013. However, this item for Chicago Urban League was not approved by the full Board at
the August or September Board meetings due to lack of quorum. In order for the contract terms to be
consistent for all four workforce contracts, and to ensure there is no interruption in services for CHA
families, the Chicago Urban League’s Transitional Jobs (TJ) program started on October 1, 2013
Therefore, following consultation with the CHA Board Chair and the Chair of the Tenant Services
Committee, Item 5 is being presented as a ratification. The TJ program is an evidence-based program
model that leads to sustained unsubsidized employment. The TJ model is designed to address the
employment needs of individuals who possess little or no work history. TJ has distinct differences
from other jobs programs, including supportive services, a literacy component, subsidized work
experience, support during transition to unsubsidized employment and retention support after job
placement. The subsidized job period typically lasts between six and ten weeks, and wages are paid by
CHA’s workforce provider. The ultimate goal of TJ is to transition workers into unsubsidized
positions. Chicago Urban League has existing relationships with employers and will focus on high
growth industries.
Madam Chair abstains from voting on Item 5 only.

(Item 7)
On January 6, 2000, the CHA Board of Commissioners approved the Plan for Transformation, which
called for sweeping changes in both the administration and operation of CHA. The Plan for
Transformation was approved by HUD and incorporated into a Moving to Work (MTW)
Demonstration Agreement, which was executed on February 6, 2000. On June 26, 2008, CHA
executed an Amended and Restated MTW Agreement (Restated Agreement) between itself and HUD,
which supersedes the original MTW Agreement. The Restated Agreement extends CHA’s participation
in the MTW Demonstration to the end of FY2018. CHA’s continued participation in the MTW
Program is contingent upon adherence to the requirements set out in the Restated Agreement, which
includes submission of an Annual Plan. The document represents CHA's FY2014 MTW Annual Plan
and details CHA’s anticipated activities for FY2014. Per HUD guidelines, CHA has organized the
discussions of activities in the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan under the following Sections: Introduction,
General Housing Authority Operating Information, Non-MTW Related Housing Authority
Information, Long-Term MTW Plan, Proposed MTW Activities – HUD Approval Requested, Ongoing
MTW Activities - HUD Approval Previously Granted, Sources and Uses of Funds, and Administrative.
Prior to submission of the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan to the Board, a 30-day public comment period
was conducted wherein both residents and the public alike were able to submit comments orally and in
writing, regarding the information contained in the proposed Plan. The public comment period ran
from August 28 through September 27, 2013. During such time, on September 11, 2013, a public
comment hearing was held. Prior to finalizing the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan, CHA gave
consideration to comments received during the public comment period. To this end, CHA has
complied with the requirements of the Restated Agreement and HUD regulations regarding annual
plans. The resolution for Item 7 approves the submittal to HUF of the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan, and
the form, CHA Certifications of Compliance with MTW Plan Requirements and Related Regulations.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-87
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated October 9, 2013
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO APPROVE THE FY2014 MOVING TO WORK
ANNUAL PLAN
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan, and the
form, CHA Certifications of Compliance with MTW Plan Requirements and Related
Regulations.

THAT

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to approve any final changes to the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan. Such
approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s approval of any and all
such changes.

THAT,

this approval of the FY2014 MTW Annual Plan supersedes any and all conflicting
language found in prior CHA MTW Annual Plans.

6

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby grants authorization to submit the FY2014 MTW
Annual Plan to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

(Item 8)
The resolution for Item 8 approves submittal of a Portfolio Application to HUD under the Rental
Assistance Demonstration (RAD) Program. RAD was established by HUD as a demonstration
program to preserve public housing units in a safe and decent condition for residents. The program was
developed by HUD with input from residents and advocates. RAD allows properties to receive their
operating assistance through long-term Section 8 contracts. HUD has assessed that the Section 8
funding platform is more reliable than Section 9 funding which is more susceptible to Congressional
appropriations. The Section 8 funds provided under RAD will make more funds available to
rehabilitate, repair, and generally operate units without depending on additional money from Congress.
In addition, RAD will offer residents greater choice and mobility. The authorization contained in this
Board item is solely to submit RAD applications for the following 33 properties:

 (Item 9)
In June 2012, the CHA released Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure the professional services of a

entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE THREE, ONE-YEAR OPTIONS OF

(Item 10)
The CHA’s current contracts for employee healthcare plan benefits with Blue Cross Blue Shield
(medical and dental) and Lincoln Financial (AD&D, Life, STD and LTD) will terminate on December
31, 2013 and must be replaced effective January 1, 2014. HUD has previously authorized the CHA to
utilize its insurance Broker of Record to solicit competitive insurance bids on behalf of the CHA.
Mesirow Financial, the CHA’s insurance broker for Employee Health Plan Benefits, directly solicited
requests for insurance premium quotes from 18 top healthcare insurance providers in their respective
fields, including the CHA’s current healthcare benefit insurance providers, for employee medical,
dental, AD&D, Life, STD and LTD. Letters requesting premium quotes, along with current data
necessary for preparing insurance premium quotes, were delivered by Mesirow to the 18 healthcare
insurance providers in June 2013 requesting submittal of proposals by June 17, 2013. Mesirow
received three quotes for medical, five for dental, and four for life and disability. The alternate carriers
for medical submitted quotes with large premium increases and were not competitive. All proposed
quotes (e.g. medical 5.61 %, dental 1.9% and life/disability 7.32%) received for plan year 2014
9

 represent an increase in premiums over plan year 2013 which are lower than the average trend of 9.5%
to 11.5%. The estimated 2014 renewals are based on quoted premiums and the eligible staff headcount
of projected participant levels for 2014.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-90

obtained with Federal funds. BMO Harris Bank N.A. is the Authority’s primary cash management
bank and has consistently provided best practice service delivery in a full range of banking products
and services. Their commitment to Plan Forward is evident in this facility as the credit terms
contemplate a wide range of options with respect to collateral/term and pricing. The CHA plan for
acquisition of units can be greatly enhanced by exercising appropriate financing options contained in
this loan commitment.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-91

providing the necessary resources to meet critical CHA reporting requirements. E&Y has provided
CHA guidance with implementing new Governmental Accounting Standard Board pronouncements

Center and MTW reporting requirements is crucial for the Authority to meet its reporting requirement
to HUD.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-92
