COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS
Submitting a Resolution sponsored by
FORREST CLAYPOOL, County Commissioner
Co-Sponsored by
ANTHONY PERAi CA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AN INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT AUDIT
OF THE JD EDWARDS SYSTEM
WHEREAS, it is important for governments and businesses alike to make use of the best available
technologies in order to streamline and make more efficient their operations; and
WHEREAS, recognizing the need for new, seamless technology, Cook County purchased the JD
Edwards system' s three components, Purchasing, Payroll, and Financial Recording, in sequential order in
the late 1990s; and
WHEREAS, Cook County spent anywhere between $22 million and $40 million on the initial purchase
cost and maintenance cost of the system, though the precise figure is not known because there has been
no audit or other detailed accounting shared with the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, there have been a series of issues regarding the use of the system in the Recorder of Deeds'
Office, including a failed attempt to use the JD Edwards system as the cashiering system for the Recorder
of Deeds and the subsequent abandonment of JD Edwards by the Recorder of Deeds; and
WHEREAS, this failed attempt and the subsequent contracting of a different system by the Recorder of
Deeds cost the County at least $200,000 to $400,000, though the precise figure is unknown due to the
lack of audit to date; and

2888

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

WHEREAS, of the County Clerk, Assessor, Treasurer, and Clerk of the Circuit Court, only the Treasurer
uses the JD Edwards software, though it does not work solely electronically as the Treasurer' s staff must
physically print out the data from the JD Edwards system from where it must be sent to the Comptroller' s
Office to be manually entered into the system; and
WHEREAS, JD Edwards, which is based on old IBM code which is outdated, has been purchased by
Oracle, which is no longer writing the code upon which JD Edwards is based, making it difficult and
prohibitively expensive to upgrade and maintain JD Edwards; and
WHEREAS, anecdotal evidence, such as the proliferation of paper purchasing forms (29-A Fonns) to
this day, show that the use of the JD Edwards system as advertised is incomplete; and
WHEREAS, to date, the County has not ordered a comprehensive audit of the payments made for the JD
Edwards system and its maintenance or the alternatives that some offices have used in its stead.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls on
President John H. Stroger, Jr. to contract with an independent and reputable auditing firm to begin at once
a management audit of the JD Edwards system, and all expenses arising from other financia l software
used for purchasing, payroll, and financial recording purchased by the County since 1997.

Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Information Technology and Automation (Comm. No. 273078) and the
Committee on Finance (Comm. No. 273079). The motion carried unanimously.

2889

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

WHEREAS, the Cook County Department of Corrections population projected for the month of August,

WHEREAS, currently 1,445 detainees have been incarcerated for approximately 1-5 years in the
Department of Corrections facility according to the Length of Stay chart issued by the Sheriffs Office at
the Department of Corrections Subcommittee meeting on September 12, 2005; and
WHEREAS, the Chief Judge's Office, the State's Attorney 's Office, the Public Defender's Office, and
the Clerk of the Circuit Court's Office have a constitutional obligation to move cases through the court
system in an expeditious manner; and
WHEREAS, the Illinois Statute (55 ILCS 5/5-18001 et. seq.) and Cook County Ordinance (Chapter 5,
Section 161-163) empower the Judicial Advisory Council to devise means to effect the improvement of
administration of justice in and with relation to the County, and to formulate all proper suggestions and
recommendations concerning legislation and other measures designed to bring about such improvement.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners directs the
Judicial Advisory Council to create and chair a task force consisting of representatives of the Chief
Judge' s Office, the State's Attorney' s Office, the Public Defender's Office, the Sheriffs Office and the
Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court. The purpose of the task force will be to: l ) monitor the
progression of cases of incarcerated detainees whose length of stay have been between 1 to 5 years in the
Cook County Department of Corrections; 2) identify strategies to move these cases through the court
system with a priority on those cases that have been in the system the longest; and 3) identify, discuss and
resolve any issues identified by any office participating in the task force that create barriers to moving
cases through the system. Examples of issues include those identified at the September 12, 2005
Department of Corrections Subcommittee meeting dealing with video conference equipment, Public
Defender's access to clients and the sharing of case information; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the task force shall meet no less than six times per year and shall
produce a report summarizing each meeting to be submitted to the Board of Commissioners for review
and action. Reports will be submitted to the Board of Commissioners by the following dates: December
30, February 28, April 30, June 30, August 30, and October 30; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the first meeting of the task force will be held no later than October 21,
2005. An initial report from the first meeting will be submitted to the Board of Commissioners by
November 10, 2005; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the task force will continue to meet until the case backlog is cleared or
until directed by the Board of Commissioners.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to suspend the rules so that this
matter may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
approved and adopted. The motion was withdrawn.
Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Department of Corrections Subcommittee.
Upon further discussion, Commissioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, amended the motion
to refer the Proposed Resolution to the Department of Corrections Subcommittee (Comm. No. 273080)
and the Committee on Finance (Comm. No. 27308 I). The motion carried unanimously.

generally been the only vendor to bid on this, forcing by rule, a rebid and potentially delaying
the reassessment calendar. Because State statute imposes strict guidelines as to who may
publish the real estate assessment in the triennial and non-triennial townships in Cook County
outside the City of Chicago. Cook County Suburban Publishers, Inc. is the only qualified
vendor.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $56,395.08. Contract period: January I, 2006 through December 31, 2006.
(040-240 Account). Requisition No. 60400003.

needs; and length of jail stay.
Vice Chairman Hansen stated that Judge Marovich made an additional stipulation that the Department of
Corrections Subcommittee provide a comparison between the amount of funding being requested by the
Administration and the amount of funding being requested by the Sheriffs Office. (The referenced
documents are on file in the Office of the Cook County Clerk.)
Chainnan Steele replied that prior to the start of the meeting she received a letter from the Sheriffs Office
requesting that the Administration set forth its funding proposal. Attached to this correspondence is a
letter from Chief Judge Timothy Evans detailing the staffing needs of the Cook County Courts. Chainnan
Steele distributed stamped copies of these documents to the Commissioners.

Bobbie L. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Mandatory Garbage Service Ordinance
WHEREAS, Cook County currently has no ordinance requiring residents to ha ve a refuse
removal service; and
WHEREAS, municipalities throughout Cook County require their residents to use the
services of a waste disposal finn licensed with their respective municipality; and

30 13

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

WHEREAS, numerous incidents have arisen in which residents of unincorporated Cook
County have refused to dispose of their garbage in a safe and timely manner; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has had no recourse to address these situations as they arise.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, that Cook County will institute the
Mandatory Garbage Service Ordinance requiring all residents in unincorporated Cook
County to dispose of their garbage in the following methods:
Section 1
(a)

Lawful methods of disposal. All refuse produced on the premises of any
residential dwelling shall be disposed of by the person in possession of the
premises by the acquisition of a refuse removal service for each such residential
dwelling from a waste disposal firm with pickup and removal of such refuse by
such waste disposal firm to be only from the premises on which the refuse is
generated and not from any location other than the premises on which the refuse is
generated. It shall be presumed that all residential dwellings in unincorporated
Cook County generate refuse. The Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook
County Department of Public Health may waive the requirement of this section for
a particular property only upon receipt of a written request from the owner of the
premises therefore, supported by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by
the Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook County Department of Public
Health, at their absolute discretion, that no refuse other than recyclable materials
are and will be generated by the occupants of the premises. The decision of the
Cook County Department of Public Health, Environmental Health Service Unit, to
grant, or deny, such a waiver request shall be final. Refuse produced on the
premises of any residential dwelling may be disposed of pursuant only to those
specific additional methods of disposal expressly authorized by, and approved
pursuant to this Ordinance.

(b) Preparation of garbage. It shall be the duty of every person in possession of any
premises to cause all garbage produced on the premises to be thoroughly drained of
all surplus liquid, securely wrapped or bagged in paper or packed in a covered box
or carton of such dimension as will permit its free passage into and out of the waste
containers, and finally deposited after such wrapping or bagging in such a waste
container as soon as practicable after the same is produced thereon. Materials of
every character shall be securely wrapped or bound in such a manner as may be
necessary to prevent scattering and shall be deposited in a waste container or
otherwise deposited herein.
Section 2
(a) Penalties and Fines. The Environmental Health Service Unit of the Cook County
Department of Public Health shall have the authority to levy fines and issue
citations to persons occupying premises that fail to comply with Cook County's
Mandatory Garbage Service Ordinance. The Environmental Health Service Unit
shall have the discretion of issuing a warning for a first offense, $50 for a second
offense and up to $250 for subsequent offenses.
*Referred to the Committee on Environmental Control on 06/21/05.

additional vaccinations are required: distemper, Para influenza, parvovirus, and hepatitis;
and
WHEREAS, the four additional vaccinations are not currently required by federal, state, or
local laws; and
WHEREAS, the promulgated rules were not reviewed by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, Veterinarian Associations, or the Chicago Park District prior to being
implemented; and
WHEREAS, the Chicago Park District needs additional time to set up a process to be in
compliance with the promulgated rules.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners defers the new pennitting requirements for Dog Friendly Areas for 60 days;
and

Chainnan Quigley stated that the purpose of this meeting is for Cook County, the Chicago Park District
and dog owners to discuss issues relating to existing regulations, possible new regulations and the
implementation and administration of these regulations.
Dr. Sheldon Rubin, Chicago Veterinarians' Association, made the following recommendations: all
groups with an interest in this issue should be brought together for discussion, including veterinarians,
dog walkers and representatives from dog-friendly-area (D.F.A.) boards . More comprehensive testing
should be mandated, including tests for distemper, kennel cough (bordetella), and diseases communicable
to humans. In response to Commi ssioner Steele' s concern regarding the monitoring of D.F.A's, Dr.
Rubin stated that these areas are successfully self-monitored.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

Steve Dale, Syndicated Columnist, voiced the following concerns: the pennit application does not specify
what tests should be included; the thirty-day deadline is confusing; taken together, the costs for an exam,
vaccines and City and Park District fees are prohibitive for some people; redundant fees could be
streamlined; and the Chicago has no emergency contingency plan regarding pets.
Judy Martinez, Director of Intergovernmental and Community Affairs, Chicago Park District, stated that
the Park District is considering reducing its fee to $10.00. The Park District will not be able to meet its
October deadline; a more tenable date would be January 5, 2006. The Park District currently does not
have the infrastructure to process permits; in this regard it hopes to partner with the City Clerk's Office.
She voiced concern that, with regard to pennit requirements, there are disparities among the cities within
Cook County. Ms. Martinez clarified that the Park District does not intend to pursue any litigation
a$ainst Cook County.
Daniel G. Parmer, D.M.V. , Administrator, Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control,
stated that on May 20, 2005, the County issued regulations for all D.F.A. 's county wide. On April 25,
2005, the County approved the Park District's plan. Dr. Panner suggested that a meeting be scheduled
involving the County, the Park District, the City, community groups and either the Chicago Veterinary
Medical Association or the Illinois State Veterinary Medical Association (ISVMA).
Chainnan Quigley recommended that Dr. Panner structure a series of meetings in the following way to
address the drafting of regulations and fonns. Initially, a relatively small working group could be fanned,
including the Veterinarians' Association. This working group could be technical in nature, and could
address the medical and time-requirement aspects of regulations and fonns. Additional meetings could be
held involving a larger number of participants. These meetings could address D.F.A.'s and public
awareness of enforcement, fees and any other regulations. Chainnan Quigley noted that additional issues
exist, for example creating a unified data base and the most effective role for the City Clerk' s Office to
assume.
Dr. Parmer stated that the State's Attorney' s Office had just notified him that any alterations made to the
Chicago Park District regulations must be made to the regulations of all other Cook County Park
Districts.
Chainnan Quigley asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the registered public speakers.

the process of correcting problems related to poor management; and
WHEREAS, a management audit can identify problems related to inventory controls, and
missing or inadequate internal financial controls; and

Agreement. The Public Defender will present a study conducted by the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center and the Public Defender's Offices which analyzes the children' s length of stay; this study makes
recommendations as to how cases can be expedited. The Public Defender's Office and the Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center will also review the status of their compliance with the recommendations set
forth in the Memorandum of Agreement.

Commissioner Hansen asked that his letter of September 8, 2005 , to President Stroger be entered into the
record. (The referenced document is on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Chairman Collins stated that this public hearing seeks to address the issue without presenting an undue
burden on the 2006 Budget.

stated that all reported incidents have been reviewed and analyzed. He emphasized that Juvenile
Temporary Detention Center personnel are thoroughly screened, and that the Inspector General has
recommended terminations for sustained accusations of abuse.

Stroger from Bart Lubow of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. (The referenced letter is on file in the Office
of the County Clerk.) This letter summarizes the key elements of the discussion held between executives
of the Annie E. Casey Foundation and James L. Whigham, Chief of Staff, J.W. Fairman, Chief
Coordinator of the Bureau of Public Safety and Judicial Coordination, and Jerry Robinson,
Superintendent of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. In addition, this letter details how the Annie

Commissioner Moreno asked ifand when the Annie E. Casey Foundation reached out to the County.
Mr. Whigham replied that the Annie E. Casey Foundation reached out to the County approximately one
week prior to this meeting; the Foundation believed so strongly in the significance of this issue that they
flew to Chicago to meet with members of the Administration on one day' s notice.
Mr. Whigham emphasized that the County has mandated that the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
cooperate with the Foundation on every level of the assessment.
Mike Mahoney, Fonner President of the John Howard Association stated that the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center is cited as a national example in tenns of population reduction. Cook County has an
excellent partnership history with the Annie E. Casey Foundation. He is confident that continued
partnership will be fruitful. He recommended that the Commissioners review the two most recent reports
published by the John Howard Association. These reports analyze issues of overtime, vacancies, and
ways to improve management. As a court monitor in the Doe v. Cook County case, Mr. Mahoney will file
a report next week regarding Cook County's compliance with the consent decree; this report will detail
the County' s successes as well as areas for improvement.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Health and Hospitals of the Board of Commissioners of Cook C ounty met pursuant
to notice on Thursday, September 15, 2005 at the hour of 10:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendation is as follows:
272033

PROVIDENT HOSP ITAL OF COOK COUNTY by Michele T. Thompson, Acting Chief
Operating Officer, transmitting a Communication, dated June 28, 2005.
Provident Hospital of Cook County has respectfully submitted the revised Medical Staff
Bylaws and General Rules and Regulations of the Medical Staff of Provident Hospital of
Cook County for approval by the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

*
*

Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 07/12/05.
Deferred at the Health and Hospitals Committee meeting of07/26/05.

In response to Commissioner Hansen, Randolph Johnston, Assistant State' s Attorney, State's Attorney's
Office, stated that the rationale for making two changes are: I) during the initial six-month probationary
period the medical staff will have an opportunity to see whether the physician can perform and observe
procedures that occur infrequently; and 2) the physicians' appointments are for a two-year period which
during the first six months are in a provisional category. If there is no reason not to elevate the physicians
to full attending status, then the change will occur automatically. Part of the problem is the time required
to get items placed on the Board Agenda and approved by the Board.
Commissioner Hansen stated that if there is going to be a provisional period, the physicians should be
appointed for a provisional period, whether it be six or twelve months before they are eligible to be
appointed for a full two-year period. He stated that he doesn' t see the logic in appointing someone for the
full two-years.
Dr. Aaron Hamb, Chief Medical Officer, Provident Hospital of Cook County, replied that this procedure
is similar to the initial probationary period for any employee. The Hospital has an opportunity to make a
decision whether they want that employee to continue for the remainder of his two year appointment.
Commissioner Suffredin requested that the State's Attorney walk the Commissioners through the
amendment process. Since the last Health and Hospitals Meeting of July 26, 2005, Dr. Hamb distributed
the redlined version of the Bylaws with the changes, and a chart explaining the changes.
Commissioner Hansen pointed out that he is concerned about the procedure.
Dr. Hamb replied that both the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
as well as the lllinois Department of Public Health requires the County to make appointments for a period
of two years.
Commissioner Hansen asked why a new section was added in the Bylaws in reference to Tele Medicine
referred to as Section 405-G, and will there be any problem with regards to the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Dr. Hamb replied that the reason Section 405-G was added is that there where situations where Provident
Hospital of Cook County was sharing information with Stroger Hospital of Cook County through a Tele
Medicine mechanism. The requirements by JCAHO say that if you share information between hospitals it
has to be noted in the Bylaws.

3023

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

Mr. Johnston replied that in terms of HIPAA there is no problem with sharing medical information
between two healthcare providers for the purpose of treatment.
Commissioner Hansen stated that Section 4.07-(1), relating to professional activities or perfonnance, has
been entered with respect to the applicant. It states that it is final, under the subject listed in Section 4.07I. How are pending judgments and settlements being dealt with?
Dr. Hamb replied that he doesn ' t have a problem with adding pending actions.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Section 4.07-(1) by
adding the phrase "pending actions".
Commissioner Daley asked whether, once the Bylaws are amended, do they have to go back to the
Medical Executive Committee for approval.
Mr. Johnston replied yes, because it is a joint document which was jointly negotiated.
Commissioner Peraica stated that it is extremely important to insert the language suggested by
Commissioner Hansen. Further, Commissioner Peraica stated that it is important for the Board to be
careful how the County screens the applicants who want to join the County's Health System since the
Board is self-insured.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that he opposes any amendments to the Bylaws, because in the existing
Bylaws there is a section on how the Bylaws are amended. At today's meeting the Board can only vote
yes or no on the proposals before the Board. If the Board would like to make additional changes, there is
a procedure for the Board of Commissioners to offer amendments found in Section 17.03. The process
requires that the Board of Commissioners propose amendments and submit them to the Medical
Executive Committee, since they are joint Bylaws. Further, Commissioner Suffredin stated that when the
Commissioners began discussion on the Bylaws, which were before the Committee at the same time as
the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County Bylaws, the Commissioners had greater information on the Oak
Forest Hospital of Cook County amendments which were accepted by the Committee at the July 26, 2005
Health and Hospitals Committee Meeting. Also, at that meeting the Commissioners asked Dr. Hamb and
Mr. Johnston to provide additional information regarding why certain changes were being made in the
Provident Hospital of Cook County Bylaws and whether the Commissioners have received the
information.
Commissioner Suffredin stated that if the Commissioners do not agree with the Bylaws, they can vote
them down and the existing Bylaws would continue. Further, he stated that it is still an outstanding issue
for the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations to be given a final copy of the
Bylaws; the vast majority of the changes being made are to be in confonnance with the changes in state
law. Commissioner Suffredin stated that the State's Attorney talk about some of the specific state law
changes that have required the changes in the Bylaws. ln conclusion, Commissioner Suffredin stated that
these Bylaws only address the medical staff and do not change any other Laws; they are procedural.
Commissioner Suffredin suggested that the Committee call for a roll call vote, and on the issue of the
amendments he suggested that the Committee vote the amendment to the amendments down and return to
the main question.

Commissioners Hansen and Peraica withdrew their motion to amend the proposed Bylaws.

3024

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

Commissioner Gorman inquired whether the Bylaws contain an age restriction and, if not, whether the
County is considering possibly incorporating some type of age restriction for the medical staff.
Dr. Hamb replied that hospital looks at a physician ' s competency on a case-by-case basis; and to impose
such a restriction might be considered discriminatory.
Commissioner Murphy, seconded by Commissioner Peraica moved that Communication No.
272033 be approved. Commissioner Hansen called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being

as follows:
ROLL CALL ON MOTION TO APPROVE ITEM 272033

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Public Health Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Tuesday, September 13, 2005 at the hour of 11:00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, I I 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the

FISCAL IMPACT OF MENTALLY ILL ARRESTEES ON COOK COUNTY
RESOLUTION (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored
by Earlean Collins, County Commissioner; Co-Sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr., President,
Forrest Claypool, John P. Daley, Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman, Gregg Goslin, Carl R.
Hansen, Roberto Maldonado, Joan Patricia Murphy, Anthony J. Peraica, Mike Quigley, Peter
N. Silvestri, Deborah Sims, Bobbie L. Steele and Larry Suffredin, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
FISCAL IMPACT OF MENTALLY ILL ARRESTEES ON COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, Cook County is a home rule unit of local government pursuant to Article VII,
Section 6a of the Illinois Constitution of 1970 with powers to regulate those matters which
pertain to its government and affairs; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has the power and responsibility to conduct public hearings
regarding certain matters pertaining to Cook County Government; and

3102

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

WHEREAS, the fiscal impact of Mentally Ill Arrestees on Cook County Jail and the
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center is unknown, Cook County Jail is reported to have
approximately 800 Mentally Ill Arrestees in the system according to 2002 statistics; and
WHEREAS, the rate of recidivism among the mental ill population, commonly referred to as
the "revolving door syndrome", poses a financial hardship on the Cook County budget, and
makes it more difficult to comply with the Federal Consent Decree on overcrowding; and
WHEREAS, the State of Illinois has relinquished most of its responsibilities for adequate
care for the mentally ill without adequate plans for services and housing at the local level
which has contributed greatly to our jail populations.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners
shall conduct informational hearings to ascertain the fiscal impact of Mentally Ill Arrestees
on the Cook County Budget, and the ability of the Cook County Jail system to comply with
the Federal Consent Decree on overcrowding; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners seek legal
remedies to insure that the State of Illinois assumes its responsibilities for decentralization of
mentally ill patients to local communities in accordance with Federal regulations.
Chainnan Collins thanked everyone for coming to the meeting and participating in the County's quest to
find ways to reduce the population in the County's jail system.
Chainnan Collins stated that on June 21, 2005 , she and several Commissioners introduced to the Board a
framework for a comprehensive Jail Diversion Program for Cook County. This program includes a pilot
program for the mentally challenged, chronic alcoholics and substance abusers. The objectives are to
ensure more humane assessment and treatment for the mentally ill and chronic addicts; to afford the
County the opportunity to ensure equal treatment and protection under the law for all citizens; to reduce
the jail population and maintain compliance with the Federal Consent Decree; and to reduce the financial
burden on the tax payers of Cook County.
Chainnan Collins further stated that jails across the United States are rapidly changing into mental health
institutions; primarily because states have abdicated their responsibility and have closed most mental
institutions without adequately connecting those patients to community-based health facilities. The
mentally challenged inmate population, according to the Sheriff's Office, ranges from about I 000 to
1,200, and the average length of stay is approximately 180 days. This is approximately 50% longer then
the length of stay for other detainees. The cost of housing, according to the Sheriffs Office, is
approximately $70 per day for each detainee, and the County spends approximately $75,000 to $85,000
per day for the total number of detainees who are housed in the County Jail. Annually, out of the 100,000
admissions approximately 60% suffer from drug addiction or other chemical dependencies.
The dwindling federal and state resources allocated for the treatment of this population pose a tremendous
burden on the County Budget. Chainnan Collins stated that it is time for the County to take serious
action. Any Jail Diversion Program must address the issue of race; County Jails and Penal Institutions
across the Country are comprised of approximately 70% to 80% people of color. This raises serious
questions as to equal protection under the law. Other communities are able to deter the types of crimes
which most individuals of color are jailed. She further stated that for these reasons the County can reduce
the population of its jails by simple gestures and fairness. Commissioner Collins stated that this would
take training of both Jaw enforcement personnel and governmental institutions, in order to implement a
no-tolerance policy. Such a policy would address any actions that might lead to mistreatment and
unequal justice in the County's criminal justice system. Commissioner Collins concluded by noting that
she is grateful to the individuals who have been working with the County since the Ordinance was
introduced.

ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY (PAAC) TASK FORCE
AND TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK COUNTY TO REDUCE AND
PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND RELATED INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
(PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Joan
Patricia Murphy, County Commissioner; and Co-Sponsored by John H. Stroger, Jr.,
President, Elizabeth A~n Doody Gonnan and Deborah Sims, County Commissioners.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
A RESOLUTION TO ESTABLISH THE PARTNERS
AGAINST ANIMAL CRUELTY (PAAC) TASK FORCE AND
TO PROMOTE EDUCATION WITHIN COOK COUNTY TO
REDUCE AND PREVENT ANIMAL ABUSE AND
RELATED INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE
WHEREAS, criminal profiling experts associated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation

have identified a strong correlation between animal abuse and violence against humans and
have documented cruelty to animals as one of the traits which indicates the characteristics of
a violent personality which is demonstrated by the disproportionately high number of violent
killers in the prison system, virtually every serial killer, and recent cases of school violence;
all of which have involved persons with a history of animal abuse; and
WHEREAS, the Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC) Task Force was formed in

September 2004, to coordinate a county-wide effort to abolish cruelty, neglect and violence
involving animals in order to improve the quality and safety of their lives as well as the lives
and safety of the citizens of our communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of
Commissioners recognizes the establishment of Partners Against Animal Cruelty (PAAC), a
volunteer organization governed by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, comprised
of an advisory board of five to seven members, one appointee from each of the seventeen
(17) commissioner districts, and a representative from each of the thirty (30) townships as
well as law enforcement, animal control wardens, animal organizations, and shelters; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners:

1. Recognizes that individuals who abuse animals are more likely to commit more
serious violent crimes against humans.
2. Urges social workers, teachers, mental health professionals, and others to be aware of
the connection between animal cruelty and human violence and to evaluate carefully
and to monitor closely individuals who have a history of abusing animals since this
may indicate a propensity to commit violence against other humans.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR SEPTEMBER 20, 2005

3.

Urges appropriate local and county agencies to encourage and support research to
increase the understanding of the connection between cruelty to animals and violence
against humans in order to utilize instances of animal abuse to identify and intervene
with potentially violent individuals and to assist in identifying and protecting
children at risk of abuse and neglect.

4.

Urges agencies which are undertaking research on violent crime and its causes to
incorporate examination of the link between violence against animals and violence
against humans.

5.

Urges local law enforcement officials, particularly prosecutors and judges, to treat
cases of animal cruelty seriously both because such cruelty is a reliable indicator of
the potential for domestic violence and other fonns of violence against humans.

6.

Commends the fine work of local animal control officials and humane investigators
who help enforce laws against animal abuse and urges these professionals to work
more closely with local law enforcement personnel to identify and prevent potential
violence against humans.

*Referred to the Public Health Subcommittee on 06/21/05.
Commissioner Murphy stated that since 2004 her office has been working with law enforcement agencies,
humane and anti-cruelty organizations, elected officials and members of the general public to promote
awareness not only regarding cruelty to animals but also its direct correlation to crimes against people;
this is how Partners Against Animal Cruelty came into being (PAAC).
Commissioner Murphy stated that animal cruelty encompasses a range of behavior harmful to animals.
She stated further that today the Committee will be discussing intentional cruelty and abuse.
Chainnan Collins asked whether the County has procedures in place for children who abuse animals.
Commissioner Murphy replied that those children will be identified by law enforcement officers, and then
Social Services will be brought in so that the children can receive the proper treatment.
Chainnan Collins asked the Secretary to the Board to call upon the public speakers.
