PROPOSAL

The City Planning Commission has received, processed and now presents to Your Honorable

the existing structure at 304 Erskine Street to be reestablished as an eight (8) unit residential

{?417 1:wa 
t3;- - -
53-2-2.? mfg-2._

Existing Proposed

 

The proposal also includes an eight (8) stall surface parking lot to the rear Ofthe building. The
site is approximately 0.1727 acres with the lot dimensions being 150? 50.?

The building, once completed, would remain two (2) stories at 33? with a total gross square
footage of 7, 805 sf.

Ofthe eight units proposed for the redevelopment, the unit mix is as follows:

Two (2) units are efficiency units totaling 732 sq ft. and 624 sq ft.
Four (4) units are one (1) bedroom units ranging 640 sqTwo (2) units are two (2) bedroom units at 968 sq. ft. and 1,134 sq ft.

Six (6) units will be at market rate rent, and the remaining two 2) units are affordable units at
80% AMI.

Lastly the plan calls for energy efficient lighting and stormwater management systems. The
anticipated construction date is May 2019 with a May 2020 anticipated completion date.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS

Surrounding Zoning and Land Use

The zoning classification and land uses surrounding the subject area are as follows:

North: is zoned undeveloped parcels; residential structure; Chilli Mustard Onions restaurant
East: is zoned underutilized grassy lot

South: is zoned Residential structure

West: is zoned Residential structure

Master Plan of Policies

The subject site is located within the Lower Woodward area ofNeighborhood Cluster 4 ofthe
Detroit Master Plan of Policies (MP). The Future Land Use map for this area shows Mixed-
Residential/Commercial (MRC) for the subject property. CPC considers this proposal to be
consistent with the MP. A determination by the Planning and Development Department is
forthcoming.

ANALYSIS
This project is generally in conformance with the PD District design criteria of Sec. 61 -1 1-15 of
the Zoning Ordinance.

In regard to criterion which speaks to scale, form, massing. and density and also criterion 
which speaks to compatibility; this project seeks to rehabilitate currently an existing structure.
Since the intent of the project is to reestablish the same dimensions, massing, form and aesthetic
of the existing structure, staff has no concerns with the building fitting the context of Erskine
Street.

Criterion mandates that Parking and Loading should allow for adequate vehicular off-street
parking facilities. This project offers the typical parking configuration that many Brush Park
multi?family dwellings offer, being parking with a rear access from the alley. The garage will
host eight (8) parking spaces.

COMMUNITY INPUT
The CDC has submitted a letter ofsupport for the project stating their support for the
redevelopment of the subject property.

RECOMMENDATION
On April 4, 2019, City Planning Commission voted to approve the proposal of Method Erskine,
LLC with the following conditions:

1. That the developer work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize disruption to
the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise; and

2. That ?nal site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the
developer to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to
submitting applications for applicable permits.

3. That CPC staff may review and approve an appropriate opaque fence for rear yard and also an
appropriate parking configuration prior to ?nal approval to submit for applicable permits.

Respectfully submitted,

Mmmz?}.

Attachment A: Poll Comments for "304 Erskine"

Below are the opinions submitted by CDC Board Members during the voting process for reference and
consideration- Please note, the opinions have no bearing on the Board's ?nal vote and are included for
reference only.

Comment 1

i am excited that the; residence will be renovated, however! do not support the totality of the design due
to the discrepancy between the render and blue prints that misleadingly show the facade of the new
build garage will match, in color, with the existing brick of the home but the plans state the garage will
be built of corrugated steel and painted storm gray giving the appearance ofa shipping container or
aluminum shed instead of complementing the historic home on the property.

Comment 2

I am generally supportive of the project. However, would highly suggest landscaping done to mask the
surface parking lot. Also, does the developer expect that cars would be able to pad: in front of each
garage door as well {is there enough room to do so)? Given the limited parking in the neighborhood that
would be advised.

awaiting an interpretation from the Planning and Development Department (PDD) which has already
reviewed the proposal and is in support.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS
The petitioner has presented to the community on at least three (3) occasions and has also spoken to
the most immediate neighbors in an effort to acquire the additional dormant properties. The Brush

Park CDC submitted a letter of support. During the CPC public hearing for this request, two
members ofthe public spoke expressing neither, support or opposition.

APPROVAL CRITERIA
The development is generally consistent with the approval criteria outlined in Sec. 61?3-96 ofthe
Zoning Ordinance. Staff speci?cally points to the following ?ndings in review.

Master Plan The proposed development should reflect applicable policies stated in the Detroit
Master Plan.

The development is consistent with the Master Plan of Policies. ?The High-Density Residential
designation allows for an overall density that?s greater than 24 dwelling units per net residential acre.
Such areas are often characterized by large-scale multi?unit apartment buildings with a common
entrance and shared parking.?

b) Scale, form, massing, and density. Scale, form, massing and density should be cwpropric?tte to the
nature ofthe project and relate well to surrounc'ling development.

The scale ofthe building is apprOpriate in that the proposed site is located in a high-density
designated area by the Master Plan. The scale will be in with the recently approved Brush and
Watson development to the south, just across the street. In terms of form and massing, the
development tries to create breaks in the massing to avoid dull facades, and to create some variation.

(0) Compatibility. The proposed deveIOpment should be compatible with surrounding development in
terms of land use, general appearance and function, and should not adversely a?'ect the value of
properties in the immediate vicinitv.

The subject block is largely undeveloped outside of the two (2) dilapidated structures that currently
abut the site.

e) Parking and loading. Where appropriate. adequate vehicular o?lstreet parking and loading
should be provided. The Citv Planning Commission will be guided by standards delineated in this
zoning ordinance with adjustments appropriate to each speci?c situation.

This development provides parking underground which, when possible, is desirable as it hides the
parking from the street view. This serves to relieve the impact of cars that would typically be housed
in off?street surface parking creating gaps in the built environment. The impact of large housing of
off?street parking is that it creates ?seas of parking? which are injurious to many elements of a
walkable community. So developers are always encouraged to find creative ways to provide parking
within the interior of developments.

Below?grade parking can be cost prohibitive, so it is commendable when a development can
accomplish this means of housing vehicles and work it into pro forma. It should be noted that
development will have 168 units, however will only provide l22 parking spaces (not including
commercial/retail requirement) which is not the typically required number of spaces. The developer
feels that this will accommodate the demand that the project will have.

Orientation. Careful consideration should be given to orientation bothfor solar access to the
proposed project and for shadow impact upon surrounding development.

The building is designed to orient towards and address the streets that it faces. The ground-floor
spaces are oriented to the streets in order to build street?level appeal and encourage pedestrian
activity. The orientation ofthe proposed buildings are appropriate and desired from a urban planning

perspective.

p) Urban design. Urban design elements ofform and character, especially in intensely developed
areas, should be carefully considered. Such elements include, but are not limited to: richness and
interest of public areas through the provision of'storefronts, window displays, landscaping, and
artwork; color, texture and quality of'structural materials; enclosure of public spaces; variations in
scale; squares, plazas and/or "vest pocket parks" where appropriate: continuity ofexperience, visual
activity and interest: articulation and highlighting ofimportant visual features: and preservation and
enhancement of important views and vistas.

The development as planned will be a generator of activity along Brush Street in a part of Brush Park
that needs the pedestrian activity. The buildings will complement the other coming development
along this thoroughfare. The use of large store front displays for the large amount of
retail/commercial space the buildings will provide, should be appealing to the population that
currently exists and also those who are expected to move into the community in the coming years.

RECOMMENDATION
At the regular CPC meeting December 6, 2018 the City Planning Commission voted to approve this
proposal ofCity Growth Partners LLC with the following conditions:

I. That the developer work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize disruption to
the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise; and

k)

That CPC staff may review and approve an appropriate opaque fence for rear yard and also
an appropriate parking configuration prior to ?nal approval to submit for applicable permits.

3. That ?nal site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the
developer to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to
submitting applications for applicable permits.

Attachment A: Poll Comments for "Brush House?

Below are the opinions submitted by CDC Board Members during the voting process for reference and
consideration. Please note, the opinions have no bearing on the Board's ?nal vote and are included for
reference only.

Comment 1

in general, lsupport this project. Related to the facade materials, the developer mentioned they are still
deciding whetherthe Mo buildings would have the some or di?erentfocade design/materials- My
prekrence mold be for di?'erentfoaade treatment between the two buildings to afer more variety in
the architecture of this block and the neighborhood overall, and to prewar it from looking like one large
building Drone "development".

Comment 2

in general, isupport this project. However, the massing feels overpowering for the block. it's basically
two very large buildings. And to [Comment if it's all the some materials and design, it's going to
feel like one massive building. Thoughts?

Comment 3

in general lsupport this project, but agree that the massing is overpowering and that the design is
too monotone. i would like to see the developer take cues from the building across the street on
Erskine and incorporate at least one other building material or color. Using a lighter aolorin some
places could also make the project feel less heavy and overpowering.

HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL

RE: Request of the petitioner City Growth Partners LLC to amend Article XVII, District Map
4, of the 1984 Detroit City Code Chapter 61, Zoning, and the provisions of the existing
(Planned Development District-Historic) zoning classification for properties
located at the northwest corner of Brush Street and Watson Street and commonly known
as 3119 Brush Street and 313 Watson Street to develop eight (8) townhouse units with
parking on?site (RECOMMEND APPROVAL WITH CONDITIONS).

NATURE OF REQUEST

The City Planning Commission has received the above captioned request of the City Growth
Partners, LLC and now presents this report and recommendation to Your Honorable Body. The
request is to modify the provisions of an existing PD (Planned Development District) zoning
classification for properties located at the northwest corner of Brush Street and Watson Street
and commonly known as 3119 Brush Street and 313 Watson Street to develop eight (8)
townhouse units with parking on-site. This proposal is also located within the Brush Park
Historic District.

 

PROPOSAL
The subject site lies on approximately 0.223 acres of land. The plans call for the development of
eight (8) attached townhomes, each three (3) stories in height.

II I 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ITII1

The structure will have a maximum height of approximately 42??7? at its highest point and entail
16, 829 total gross square feet. Each townhome is planned to be a two (2) bedroom unit of
approximately 2,080 square feet. The materials for the building include ironspot brick masonry,
fiber cement panels, composite wood, ornamental brick, and a bay window wall system among
other features. The developer plans to break ground in 2019 and complete construction by the
first quarter of 2020.

PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS

urraundin 3 Zoning and Land Use

The zoning classification and land uses surrounding the subject area are as follows:
North: is zoned undeveloped parcels;

East: is zoned Residential structure; underutilized grassy parcel

South: is zoned Residential structure; underutilized grassy parcel

West: is zoned Residential structure

Master Plan of Policies

The subject site is located within the Lower Woodward area of Neighborhood Cluster 4 of the
Detroit Master Plan of Policies (MP). The Future Land Use map for this area shows High
Density Residential for the subject property. CPC considers this proposal to be consistent with
the MP.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND PUBLIC HEARING RESULTS

The petitioner has presented to the community on at least three (3) occasions and also spoken to
the most immediate neighbor at 311 Watson. The Brush Park CDC has also submitted a letter of
support for this proposal.

One (1) member of the public spoke at the CPC public hearing, neither in opposition or support
of the project.

APPROVAL CRITERIA
The development proposal is generally consistent with the approval criteria outlined in Sec. 61-
3?96 of the Zoning Ordinance. Staff specifically points to the following issues.

Master Plan The proposed development should re?ect applicable policies stated in the
Detroit Master Plan.

The development is consistent with the Master Plan of Policies. The Mixed?Use
Residential/Commercial (MRC) designation encourages mixed?use development but also allows
for residential only developments in which this development would identify with.

b) Scale, form, massing, and density. Scale, form, massing and density should be appropriate to
the nature of the project and relate well to surrounding development.

The subject development fronts onto Brush Street and lies between Erskine and Watson Streets.
There is one existing residential home in proximity of the subject site. This historic home as well
as the Sanborn maps from 1950, were used for context when developing the massing and height
for the proposed building. The building is contextually fitted to the block, using recesses and
staggered to mimic the pattern of historic homes that once were. The development team
being sensitive to the nearby home has also maintained a contextual height. The one thing that is
not contextual is the setback from Watson Street, however this is a tough condition to overcome
when orienting the building towards Brush Street. Since the parcel is on a corner lot, this
condition can be deemed appropriate.

6) Parking and loading. Where appropriate, adequate vehicular o?-street parking and loading
should be provided. The City Planning Commission will be guided by standards delineated in
this zoning ordinance with adjustments appropriate to each specific situation.

Parking for the development is housed on the ground floor of each townhome, tucked in and
hidden from the public realm. There is a one?to?one ratio; units to parking spaces which meets
the requirement of the Zoning Ordinance for this site. Parking for each unit is accessed through

the alley, which is typical for many Brush Park buildings.

j) Screening. Appropriate ba?fering and screening of service, loading, refuse collection, mechanical
and electrical equipment and of parking areas should be provided.

The developer has considered a softer approach to the screening wall on the property line between
their site and the neighboring dwelling. A vegetative buffer or other softer buffer will be used for the
property line. The developer has requested to ?nalize this matter with CPC staff.

RECOMMENDATION
At the CPC regular meeting of December 6, 2018, the City Planning Commission voted to
approve this proposal of City Growth Partners LLC with the following conditions:

1. That the developer work with the immediately adjacent community to minimize
disruption to the neighborhood during construction and address impacts that may arise;
and

2. That ?nal site plans, elevations, lighting, landscape and signage plans be submitted by the
developer to the staff of the City Planning Commission for review and approval prior to
submitting applications for applicable permits.

Attachment A: Fall Comments 1lor "Brush 3?

Below are the opinions submitted by CDC Board Members during the voting process for reference and
consideration. Please note, the opinions have no bearing on the Board's final vote and are included for
reference only.

Comment 1

in general, lsapport this project- good urban form, appropriate building type, quality materials,
appropriate use of alley; and appropriate vehicle panting scenario. ldo, however, have some comments
for the developer's consideration that would improve the project but have no bearing on my support.

1? Existing historic structures in the neighborhood have "raised bases" of at least 3 ft or taller; other
new construction are incorporating this raised base and HDC has typically required or requested
it. it appears Brush 8 hosjust a raised base {two steps up to the porch}. i realize HDC has
already approved this project, but this building would be better received if it complied with
historic standards as it would enhance consistency of new construction with existing structures.

a The building lacks some variety along its 150' Brush Street length. Could be improved by varying
the facade treatment, heights, close setbacks, ifpossible.

Comment 2

Although support the project, i think the design is boring and unattractive. its very plain and monotone,
particularly when compared against adjacent historic structures. While i understand the intent ofa
modern design, i would suggest that the developer consider ways to incorporate more historically
complementary design and variations of colOras well as better landscaping, particularly along Brush
street

may be carried out at the Property, without requiring an amendment to this Plan, so long
as such eligible activities are permitted by Act 381 and the cost of such eligible activities
does not exceed the total costs stated in Attachment E.

Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the DBRA, all eligible activities shall commence
within eighteen (18) months after the date the governing body approves this Plan and be
completed within three (3) years after approval of the Michigan Strategic Fund work plan,
if applicable, or three (3) years after execution of the Reimbursement Agreement (as that
term is de?ned below). Any long-term monitoring or operation and maintenance activities
or obligations that may be required will be performed in compliance with the terms of this
Plan and any documents prepared pursuant to this Plan.

Exhibit A
Proposed SOMA District Redevelopment
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

The Developer desires to be reimbursed for the costs of eligible activities incurred by it as
described below. Some eligible activities may commence prior to the adoption of this Plan
and to the extent permitted by Act 381 shall be reimbursable pursuant to the
Reimbursement Agreement. Tax increment revenue generated by the PrOperty will be
captured by the DBRA and used to reimburse the cost of the eligible activities completed
on the PrOperty pursuant to the terms of a Reimbursement Agreement to be executed by
the DBRA and the Developer after approval of this Plan (the ?Reimbursement
Agreement?), to the extent permitted by Act 381. In the event this Plan contemplates the
capture of tax increment revenue derived from ?taxes levied for school operating purposes?
(as de?ned by Section 2(uu) of Act 381 and hereinafter referred to as ?School Taxes?), the
Developer acknowledges and agrees that obligation to reimburse the Developer
for the cost of eligible activities with tax increment revenue derived from Local Taxes, or
Speci?c Taxes that are considered Local Taxes, (as these capitalized terms are de?ned by
Act 381) is contingent upon: the Developer receiving at least the initial applicable work
plan approvals by the Michigan Strategic Fund and the Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality, as may be required pursuant to Act 381, within 180 days after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, or such other date as the DBRA may
agree to in writing or (ii) the Developer providing the DBRA with evidence, satisfactory
to DBRA, that the Developer has the ?nancial means to complete the project without the
capture of, and subsequent reimbursement with, the contemplated School Taxes.

The costs listed in Attachment are estimated costs and may increase or decrease
depending on the nature and extent of environmental contamination and other unknown
conditions encountered on the Property. The actual cost of those eligible activities
encompassed by this Plan that will qualify for reimbursement from tax increment revenues
of the DBRA from the Property shall be governed by the terms of the Reimbursement
Agreement. No costs of eligible activities will be quali?ed for reimbursement except to
the extent permitted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Reimbursement
Agreement and Act 381. The Reimbursement Agreement and this Plan will dictate the
total cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement, provided that the total
cost of eligible activities subject to payment or reimbursement under the Reimbursement
Agreement shall not exceed the estimated costs set forth in Attachment B. As long as the
total costs are not exceeded, line item costs of eligible activities may be adjusted after the
date this Plan is approved by the governing body, to the extent the adjustments do not
violate the terms of the approved MDEQ or MSF work plan.

I). Estimate of Captured Taxahie Value and Tax Increment Revenues (Section
Beginning Date of Capture of Tax Increment Revenues (Section 
Impact of Tax Increment Financing on Taxing Jurisdictions (Section 

This Plan anticipates the capture of tax increment revenues to reimburse the Developer for
the costs of eligible activities under this Plan in accordance with the Reimbursement
Agreement. Subject to Section 13(b)(16) of Act 381, a table of estimated tax increment
revenues to be captured is attached to this Plan as Attachment F.

Exhibit A
Proposed SOMA District Redevelopment
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

Tax increments are projected to be captured and applied to reimbursement of eligible
activity costs and payment of DBRA administrative and operating expenses, (ii) make
deposits into the State Brown?eld Redevelopment Fund, and make deposits into the
Local Brown?eld Revolving Fund, as follows:

 

Reimbursement Admin. St_ate _L0cal
Costs Brown?eld Revolving
Fund Fund
School Operating Tax $3,158,018 $0 $0
State Education Tax $526,336 $0 $413,565
City Operating $1,771,239 $640,182 $0
Library $411,091 $148,581 $0
Wayne County $694,398 $250,978 $0
HCMA $18,998 $6,866 $0
RESA/Special Ed $307,543 $111,156 $0
Wayne County Community $287,702 $103,985 $0
College
TOTAL $7,175,326*

In addition, the following taxes are projected to be generated but shall not be captured during
the life of this Plan:

City Debt $844,059
School Debt and Judgment $1,567,538
DIA $24,116
Zoo $12,058
TOTAL $2,447,771

*The total not to exceed am0unt requested for approval is $10,000,000 The eligible expenses are well in excess of this amount so should
revenues be available, the developer is requesting up to $10,000,000 be reimbursed

In no event shall the duration of this Plan exceed thirty-?ve (35) years following the date
of the governing body?s resolution approving this Plan, nor shall the duration of the tax
capture exceed the lesser of the period authorized under subsection (3) and (5) of Section
13 of Act 381 or 30 years. Further, in no event shall the beginning date of the capture of
tax increment revenues be later than five (5) years after the date of the governing body?s
resolution approving this Plan.

The Project is anticipated to have in excess of $10,000,000 in eligible expenses; however,
it is projected that only $7,175,326 will be captured and available for reimbursement under
this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, should more tax increment revenue be
available for capture than what is currently projected, the Developer is requesting that
$10,000,000 be approved as the maximum reimbursement amount under this Plan. This
requested maximum allowance would ensure that should projected taxable value be higher
than projected or a PA210 tax abatement not approved, the Developer is able to capture
available Tax Increment Revenues.

Exhibit A
Proposed SOMA District Redevelopment
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

The Developer has applied or will apply for a property tax abatement under the
Commercial Rehabilitation Act, PA 210 of 2005, as amended If approved, the
abatements will reduce the property tax obligations of the Property for the periods
applicable under the abatement certi?cate, thereby reducing the amount of tax increment
revenue available pursuant to this Plan.

E. Plan of Fimeing [Section Maximum Amougtof Indebtedness [Section
l3jl?e?

The eligible activities are to be ?nanced solely by the Developer. The DBRA will
reimburse the Developer for the cost of approved eligible activities, but only from tax
increment revenues generated from the Property. No advances have been or shall be made
by the City or the DBRA for the costs of eligible activities under this Plan.

All reimbursements authorized under this Plan shall be governed by the Reimbursement
Agreement. The inclusion of eligible activities and estimates of costs to be reimbursed in
this Plan are intended to authorize the DBRA to fund such reimbursements and does not
obligate the DBRA or the City to fund any reimbursement or to enter into the
Reimbursement Agreement providing for the reimbursement of any costs for which tax
increment revenues may be captured under this Plan, or which are permitted to be
reimbursed under this Plan. The amount and source of any tax increment revenues that
will be used for purposes authorized by this Plan, and the terms and conditions for such
use and upon any reimbursement of the expenses permitted by this Plan, will be provided
solely under the Reimbursement Agreement contemplated by this Plan.

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the State of Michigan, the
DBRA shall not incur any note or bonded indebtedness to ?nance the purposes of this Plan.

Interest shall be paid under this Plan as provided in the Reimbursement Agreement,
provided that to the extent that the Michigan Strategic Fund or Michigan Department of
Environmental Quality does not approve the payment of interest on an eligible activity with
school taxes, interest shall not accrue or be paid under this Plan with respect to the cost of
such eligible activity. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Developer, the DBRA, and the
State of Michigan, the DBRA may approve interest on the local portion of the
reimbursement to the extent that the projected internal rate of return to the Developer does
not exceed twenty as more speci?cally stated in the Reimbursement Agreement.

Reimbursements under the Reimbursement Agreement shall not exceed the cost of eligible
activities permitted under this Plan.

F. Duration of Plan (Section 
Subject to Section 13b(16) of Act 381, the beginning date of capture of tax increment

revenues for each eligible property shall occur in accordance with the tax increment
?nancing (TIF) table described in Exhibit F. In no event, however, shall this Plan extend

Exhibit A
Proposed SOMA District Redevelopment
Brown?eld Redevelopment Plan

beyond the maximum term allowed by Section 13(2)(f) of Act 381 for the duration of this
Plan.

Furthermore, this Plan, or any subsequent amendment thereto, may be abolished or
terminated in accordance with Section 14(8) of Act 381 in the event of any of the following:

a. The governing body may abolish this Plan (or any subsequent amendment
thereto) when it ?nds that the purposes for which this Plan was established have been
accomplished.

b. The governing body may terminate this Plan (or any subsequent amendment
thereto) if the project for which eligible activities were identi?ed in this Plan (or any
subsequent amendment thereto) fails to occur with respect to the eligible property for at
least two (2) years following the date of the governing body resolution approving this Plan
(or any subsequent amendment thereto), provided that the governing body ?rst does both
of the following: gives 30 days? written notice to the Developer at its last known address
by certi?ed mail or other method that documents proof of delivery attempted; and (ii)
provides the Developer with an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting.

Notwithstanding anything in this subsection to the contrary, this Plan (or any subsequent
amendment thereto) shall not be abolished or terminated until the principal and interest on
bonds, if any, issued under Section 17 of Act 381 and all other obligations to which the tax
increment revenues are pledged have been paid or funds sufficient to make the payment
have been identified or segregated.

G. Effective Date of Inclusion in Brownfield Plan
The Property will become a part of this Plan on the date this Plan is approved by the
governing body.

H. Disnlacemcntillelocation of Individuals on Eligible Property (Section 
There are no persons or businesses residing on the eligible property and no occupied
residences will be acquired or cleared, therefore there will be no displacement or relocation
of persons or businesses under this Plan.

1. Local Brownfield Revolving Fund (Section 8; Section l3( 211ml)

The DBRA has established a Local Brownfield Revolving Fund (LBRF). The LBRF will
consist of all tax increment revenues authorized to be captured and deposited in the LBRF,
as specified in Section 13(5) of Act 381, under this Plan and any other plan of the DBRA.
It may also include funds appropriated or otherwise made available from public or private
sources.

The amount of tax increment revenue authorized for capture and deposit in the LBRF is
estimated at All funds, if any, deposited in the LBRF shall be used in accordance with
Section 8 of Act 381.

J. Brownfield Redevelopment Fund [Section 8a; Section

211.906, that are captured under this Plan for up to the ?rst twenty??ve (25) years of the
duration of capture of tax increment revenues for each eligible property included in this
Plan. If the DBRA pays an amount equal to 50% of the taxes levied under the state
education tax, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, on a parcel of eligible property to
the Department of Treasury under Section 13b(14) of Act 381, the percentage of local taxes
levied on that parcel and used to reimburse eligible activities for the Project under this Plan
shall not exceed the percentage of local taxes levied on that parcel that would have been
used to reimburse eligible activities for the Project under this Plan if the 50% of the taxes
levied under the state education tax, 1993 PA 331, MCL 211.901 to 211.906, on that parcel
were not paid to the Department of Treasury under Section 13b(14) of Act 381.

K. Developer?s Obligations, Representations and Warrants

Project Description

Proposed SOMA District Redevelopment

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Synopsis

The proposed project entails the activation of an alleyway, the redevelopment of the
former Eliot Street, and the new construction of a parking deck and rehabilitation of the
office building located at 115 Erskine. In addition to supporting this mix of uses, it will
also support the rehabilitations occurring at 100 Mack Avenue into Class A space. The
parking deck will be an integral part of restoring the office building occupancy and is
needed to support the proposed hotel construction at 3448 Woodward Avenue. Upon
completion this first phase of the project will:

. Activate approximately 8,000 SF (40x200) of alleyway and streetscape open to

the public

- Repurpose and reconnect Eliot Street between John Road and Woodward
Avenue for reuse as a gathering space for street festivals and neighborhood
gatherings
. Creation of pocket parks and smaller green/garden spaces
. Create much needed parking space to facilitate the growth of the SOMA District
- Create a landmark gateway to Brush Park neighborhood
. Restore occupancy to existing office space
The project will include parking lot and current site features demolition to restore the
urban fabric of the area as well as rehabilitation of 115 Erskine for office re-occupancy.
A 6-story parking structure with ground floor retail is cornerstone to jumpstarting these
efforts to grow the SOMA District. The property will contain retail space on the first
floor and support mixed use within the SOMA District, including adjacent retail, office,
commercial and a proposed future hotel use. All new garden spaces will feature plants
that support the habitat of native wildlife and reduce stormwater runoff demand on
public infrastructure. The structure will have energy efficient and LED lighting.

The structure is anticipated to consist of the following estimated square footages:
. Five stories of parking spaces (580 spaces) totaling approximately 213,099 SF
. Four retail spaces totaling 6,730 SF

The office building at 115 Erskine totals 57,000 rentable square feet and upon re?
occupancy house approximately 200 jobs.

Upon completion, this project will activate and promote pedestrian traffic at the
gateway to Brush Park and the outskirts of Midtown. The project will act as a transit-
oriented development, located adjacent to the DDOT service lines, QLine and existing

Economic Benefit

Upon successful redevelopment, the project will create retail space and new jobs to fill
these spaces. It will also provide parking needed to accommodate the growth of the
neighborhood as well as create a transit hub for multiple modes of transportation
intersect. The SOMA District will also reestablish connectivity to the adjoining
Bonstelle Theater and a University of Michigan owned house considered a gem from
the ?Little Paris? heyday of Brush Park.

On a short?term basis, approximately 100 temporary construction jobs will be created
during demolition and new construction activities. The privately owned but publicly
accessible community spaces created will encourage greater foot traffic and generate
spin-off spending in the area and restore urban vibrancy. The office building at 115
Erskine upon rehabilitation will be able to house approximately 200 future employees.
While not included within the specific project scope, the parking structure will facilitate
and support the addition of 200 jobs within the office building located at 100 Mack
Avenue.

The development team will focus on the hiring of Detroit?based worker and utilize
programs such as the D2D program and Skilled Trades Task Force to ensure Detroit-
based contractors and residents benefit from the project.

Hard Costs: Approximately $18-20 million

Re: Brush Park CDC Letter of Support for SOMA Brush Park Mixed Use Project
Dear Mr. Nyman:

On behalf of Woodward Erskine LLC, we enthusiastically support the proposed SOMA development that
is planned for the southeast corner of Woodward and Mack Avenue, immediately north of our
development, the Scott at Brush Park.

We understand that the first phase of the project consists of a 550+ car parking deck and that a future
phase will include a vertical expansion for construction of residential units above. The proposed design
of the deck presents a thoughtful response to the neighborhood?s form-based code, providing an
activated. alley with retail shops and pedestrian circulation access, restored Eliot Street connecting
Woodward with John R, and providing new landscaping and recreation space between existing office,
historic home and the proposed parking deck.

We believe that this development will continue to generate further investment in the Midtown area. We
look forward to being neighbors across Erskine Street.

Sincerely,

BRODER SACHSE REAL ESTATE, lnc., Agent for

RE: Support of SOMA Development
Dear Mr. Gustafson:

On behalf of Midtown Detroit, Inc. (M DI), i would like to express our support for phase one of the
proposed SOMA Development, located at 3150 Woodward Avenue in the Brush Park neighborhood. This
development will provide a number of benefits, while enhancing the overall character of the
neighborhood.

Phase one of the project will be the development of a mixed-use parking structure located on Erskine.
This structure will provide six levels of parking, and ground level retail spaces. Future phases will call for
the construction of residential units above this parking structure. The overall plan calls for over 400,000
square feet of mixed-use development that will bring new office/retail space, hundreds of new
residential units, and plenty of parking.

This overall development will increase density and significantly add to the number of residential units
within the Midtown district. The addition of new commercial spaces will provide more economic
opportunity for new and growing businesses. The construction of contiguous urban wall space will
increase walkability of the area and add to the urban character of the neighborhood.

The SOMA development aims to transform an important corner along a busy corridor, and MDI offers its
full support. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at our MDI office.

Best regards,

Hi Elizabeth,

As indicated in our conversation, the data collected does indicated that Parcel 1 is in fact a ?facility" but I cannot make
the same conclusion for Parcel 3 due to the lack of data from that parcel.

Subject: "Facility" Verification - Detroit Brownfield Plan

Hi Paul and Michelle,

We're assembling a draft Brownfield Plan for submittal to DEGC for the attached parcels. Based on the sampling maps
and analytical table, provided would you be able to verify "facility? status?

When the BEA was completed, the property consisted of a single parcel. Since then they have been combined.
Therefore, I?ve provided a CAD overlay map of the sampling completed with the updated parcel map. In particular, we're
looking for confirmation on the contamination identified on Parcel 1 and Parcel 3 in the attached ?Parcel Layout? map.

Please let me know if you need any further information or have any questions.
Thank you,
