The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the previously discussed mailing from the Fund to
its members explaining that they will be solicited for health insurance enrollment from two
organizations; a City-sponsored plan; and a FOP-sponsored plan, for the continuation of healthcare
coverage. The Board’s attorney indicated that under the Illinois Statutes, the Fund needs the
member’s consent to deduct health insurance premiums from a member’s annuity. As such the letter
has been amended to include a signature line authorizing premium deductions from a member’s
annuity, along with a requirement that the member indicate their selection of Aetna/Labor First
enrollment or BCBS enrollment. It was noted that such letter is not a means to enroll in either plan.
Should a member not elect either, they would not need to return the form. Adjustments and
corrections were made to the letter. The Board agreed to the direct mailing letter from the Fund and
the mechanism to obtain signature authorization to deduct the insurance premiums.

The Executive Director reviewed with the Board the following matters.
•

The Executive Director continued with discussion of earlier this day concerning the letter to
annuitants regarding their health care coverage. A few more edits were discussed and agreed upon.
Discussion was held regarding annuitants whose annuities are not sufficient to pay for premium
deductions of a plan that he or she may select, noting that in such cases, the Fund will not allow any
deduction and the member would need to work directly with the provider. The Executive Director
informed the Board members that both the City-sponsored Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the FOPsponsored plan will have representatives in the Fund’s office to review the plans and discuss
administrative issues next week. All interested Trustees are invited to attend.

•

The Executive Director updated the Board members on the Fund’s signature verification process for
2016. There are approximately 100 annuitants who have not responded to numerous attempts to contact
them and obtain a verification signature and updated contact information for the Fund’s files. Therefore,
the October 31, 2016, annuity payment has been suspended for each non-respondent, until the member
contacts the Fund and the appropriate documents are obtained.

•

Next, the Executive Director requested up-to three hearings be scheduled for the December Board
meeting in order to keep the process of disability applications and status reviews progressing. The
Trustees agreed to no more than three hearings at the December 2016 Board meeting.

•

The Fund’s Comptroller and Executive Director drafted two RFPs for Board review. The actuarial firm,
GRS, and the audit firm, Mitchell & Titus, have been retained by the Fund for five years and under the
Illinois statute, such services should be subject to a new RFP, as both services are over $25,000. The
Executive Director proposed that both RFPs be posted on the Fund’s website, with some form of
advertising, beginning November 1st with the period closed on November 30, 2016.
It was moved by Trustee Maloney, seconded by Trustee Lappe that the Board approve the two RFP’s be
posted as discussed.
