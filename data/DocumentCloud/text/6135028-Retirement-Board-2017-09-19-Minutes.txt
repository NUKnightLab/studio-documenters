Administrative Rules Related to Public Act 100-0023 (the ?Act?)
September 19, 2017 Board Meeting (incorporates Board amendments made 9/19/2017)

Certain components of the Act amending the Illinois Pension Code (the ?Code"), if taken literally, are
ambiguous inconsistent with existing law and potentially unconstitutional. The LABF is in the process of
pursuing a legislative amendment to the Act to address these issues. In the meantime, staff
recommends that the Board consider adopting certain administrative rules to address some of the more time-
sensitive issues with respect to the administration of the Act. Passage of these rules will allow LABF to
administer the Act in a manner it believes is consistent with the spirit of the new law and lessen the likelihood
that the law be legally challenged. if these issues cannot ultimately be addressed via a legislative
amendment, or done so in a timely fashion, the Board may be required to adopt additional administrative rules
in the coming months.

Rules Approved at the August 22, 2017 Board meeting:

1. Definition of Tier 3 Members. Each person who first becomes a member or participant of the LABF or
of any reciprocal retirement system or pension fund established under the Illinois Pension Code (the
Code") other than a retirement system or pension fund established under Article the Code, on or after July 6, 2017 will, for the purposes of Article 11, be considered a member subject
to the new tier of benefits created by the Act. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that individuals who
became ?Tier 2? members of a reciprocal fund prior to July 6, 2017, but who become members of the
LABF on or after July 6, 2017, are not inadvertently treated as ?Tier 3? members.)

2. lrrevocable Election by Tier 2 Members. The irrevocable election that is to be made by certain
current (active and inactive) and former (refunded) LABF members under 40 of the
Code will be administered only to each such person who first became a member or participant of the
LABF or of any reciprocal retirement system or pension fund established under the Code other than a
retirement system or pension fund established under Article the Code, on or after
January 1, 2011 and prior to July 6, 2017. Furthermore, LABF will honor elections made by members
of both LABF and the Municipal Employees? Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago (The
purpose of this rule is to ensure that ?Tier 1? members of the LABF or a reciprocal Fund, who become
members of the LABF on or after January 1, 2011, will continue to be treated as ?Tier 1? members and
are not inadvertently required to make the irrevocable ?Tier 2? or ?Tier 3? election.)

Rules to be discussed and considered at the September 19, 2017 Board meeting:

1. See recommended amendment to Rule #2 adopted on August 22, 2017 above

2. Employer Contribution Credit toward Age and Service Annuities. The LABF will continue to
administer 40 as it existed prior to the passage of the Act for the purposes of
calculating ?Tier 1? member annuities e. LABF will continue to credit each employee?s account for
employer contributions at the rate of 6% of salary) (The purpose of this rule is to ensure that member
benefits are not diminished being as the Act removed the language contained in 40 ILCS 5/11- 170(b),
which specified the employer contribution levels for age and service annuities 

Note: Applicability of this rule to ?Tier 2? and ?Tier 3? members shall be determined at a future date

3. Treatment of Employee Contribution Receivables. Any receivable that accrues in a member's
account as a direct result of insufficient pension deductions being withheld from the member's salary
during the initial implementation of PA 100-0023 shall be payable to LABF by June 30, 2018. No
interest will be charged so long as the payment is made by the deadline.

 

Matter deferred to a future Board meeting:

1.

Employer Contributions Associated with Members Working for Local Labor Organizations.
Manner in which to determine employer contributions related to employees subject to 40 5/11?
215(c)(3) of the Code, which specifies the pension contributions made with respect to any member on a
leave of absence during which the member is employed full-time by a local labor organization that
represents municipal employees.
