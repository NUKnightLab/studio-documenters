“Dear God, thank you for another day; the sunshine, the rain and all the blessings you
give us each day. We pray for the ones who are hurting; the hungry, the misunderstood, the
mentally challenged and those struggling to live another day. Dear God, more than ever,
please show us wisdom in working in the unity that will please you. Give us strength to do
what we must as our responsibility is great, and the trust people placed into our hands must
always be in accord with your will. Bless our families, our friends, those gathered here with us
today. Let us strive to forgive those who stand in our way just because they can. Help us
keep our egos in check so we may serve the people of Wayne County as their unselfish
servants. We understand that we have been given this day, this moment, as a present; let us
