 Commissioner Jack Markowski, then presented the report for the Joint Finance and Operations
Committee. Per Commissioner Markowski, the scheduled Joint Finance and Operations Committee
Meeting was not held on Wednesday, July 17, 2013 due to a lack of quorum. Commissioners
however, were briefed on items appearing on the Agenda but no votes were taken.
Commissioner Markowski then presented an Omnibus Motion for the approval of the following ten
items:
(Item 3)
The resolution for Item 3 approves award of contract to Integrys Energy Services, Inc. for the
supply and delivery of electricity to various CHA residential sites. The CHA’s current electricity
supply and delivery contract with Constellation NewEnergy is set to expire on July 31st 2013. CHA
manages approximately 25,000 lower-income public housing units located throughout the City of
Chicago with approximately 15,000 households. Providing electricity to these units requires
approximately 53,000,000 kWh of electricity annually. Given the CHA’s anticipated consumption
of approximately 106,000,000 kWh of natural gas for the next twenty-four (24) months, the
recommended supply agreement offers CHA the opportunity to more advantageously purchase its
electricity needs on wholesale terms instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against
potential market price fluctuations. The CHA has utilized bulk power purchasing practices to secure
its electricity supplies for the housing portfolio at advantageous rates and to manage the risks of
market fluctuations in electricity costs and supplies. Continued use of bulk purchasing is expected
to provide further cost savings and efficiencies over the use of retail electricity supplies from the
local utility.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-50
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
requesting “AUTHORIZATION TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH
INTEGRYS ENERGY SERVICES, INC. FOR THE SUPPLY AND DELIVERY
OF ELECTRICITY TO VARIOUS CHA RESIDENTIAL SITES”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to enter into a contract with Integrys Energy Services Inc. for the supply and delivery
of electricity to various CHA residential sites for a two (2) year base term with three
(3) one year extension terms, in an amount not-to-exceed $8,700,000 for the base
term beginning August 1, 2013.
These awards are subject to each Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s applicable
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section III, and bonding and insurance requirements.

(Item 4)
During 2003-2010, CHA’s former HCV program administrator contracted with Access Living to
administer the Mod Fund which consists of a pool of money set-aside for the construction and
installation of accessibility features and devices such as grab bars, lifts, ramps and sensory
equipment, for HCV participants who need such features to utilize their housing choice voucher.
After the HCV administrator’s contract with CHA expired, the responsibility for contracting with an
entity to administer the Mod Fund shifted to the Housing Rights and Nondiscrimination Department
(HRND), a department of the Office of the General Counsel. A contract with a fixed compensation
4

 amount of $80,000.00 was executed with Access Living to continue to administer and disburse a
$200,000 Mod Fund with the assumption that the funding earmarked for the Mod Fund had been
previously approved by the Board for reimbursement to Access Living, as it had been the
organization administering the Mod Fund for nearly a decade. Since the vendor’s compensation
amount was $80,000.00 and it was believed that funding of the Mod Fund had been Board
authorized, the contract was not brought before the Board for approval. Accordingly, the resolution
for Item 4 grants formal authorization to fund Contract No. 11030 for the total amount of
$280,000.00, representing cost-reimbursement funding of $200,000.00 for the Modification Fund
and $80,000.00 in fixed fee compensation for Access Living’s performance under the Contract.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-51
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
entitled “RECOMMENDATION TO RATIFY CONTRACT NO. 11030 WITH
ACCESS
LIVING
OF
METROPOLITAN
CHICAGO
FOR
THE
ADMINISTRATION OF THE MODIFICATION FUND”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby ratifies Contract No. 11303 with Access Living
of Metropolitan Chicago in the amount of $280,000.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s applicable
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 hiring, and insurance requirements.

(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves submission of a De Minimus Demolition Application to HUD
for the demolition of a two unit Scattered Sites dwelling structure located at 2620 West Potomac
Avenue. Staff completed a structural assessment of the building located at 2620 West Potomac
Avenue to determine its structural stability and make recommendations as to its viability for
occupancy. The assessment revealed significant settlement of the interior floor slab, exterior
walkways and surrounding ground, which in turn has caused the interior bearing wall to drop. As a
result, the second floor joists are no longer properly supported. In addition, gaps between building
components are visible and extensive mold damage was observed. Because of the deteriorated
condition and life safety issues of the building, it has been determined that the architectural and
rehabilitation costs needed to make the building viable for habitation exceed the Total Development
Costs (TDC) allowed by HUD for these types of structures. The demolition of this property
qualifies under HUD’s de minimus rule which provides that in any five year period, a Public
Housing Authority may demolish 5% of its dwelling units or five dwelling units, whichever is less
by submitting an abbreviated demolition application. Within the last five years, the CHA has
demolished only three units under HUD’s de minimus rule and therefore is eligible to submit a de
minimus demolition application for this property.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-52
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013,
entitled “REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION TO SUBMIT A DE MINIMUS
DEMOLITION APPLICATION TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING
AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DEMOLITION OF A TWO (2) UNIT
SCATTERED SITES DWELLING STRUCTURE LOCATED AT 2620 WEST
POTOMAC AVENUE”;

5

 THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to submit a de minimus demolition application to the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) for the demolition of a two (2) unit
dwelling structure located at 2620 West Potomac Avenue, and to demolish said
property upon receipt of approval from HUD.

(Item 6)
The resolution for Item 6 approves the second option year of contracts and approves amendments to
increase the not-to-exceed contract amounts by $250,000 each for Contract No. 9048 with Harley
Ellis Devereaux; Contract No. 9049 with Holabird & Root and Contract No. 9050 with Globetrotter
Engineering Corporation for additional Prime Design Consulting (PDC) Services on a task order
basis. The PDC services include assessments, design, engineering, construction documents,
construction administration and close-out services. To meet the CHA’s critical goals for Senior
Housing Life Safety/Capital Maintenance, ADA/504 Federal requirements, and Scattered Site and
Unit Acquisition projects for 2013 and 2014, CHA must increase the not-to-exceed amount of the
three PDC contracts. The increase in the funding for the PDCs is essential if the CHA is to
successfully complete the Major Capital Projects Plan for 2013 and 2014. Without an increase in
funding, the CHA will be in jeopardy of missing critical construction deadlines due to insufficient
PDC capacity for design services. In addition, the PDC contracts expired on June 30, 2013. Initially,
staff did not anticipate exercising the second option year, as a new solicitation for Prime Design
Consultant services was planned for Board approval in the second quarter of 2013. Due to
unforeseen circumstances, the new solicitation was re-solicited and recommended awardees will not
be submitted for Board approval until the fourth quarter of 2013. Without the exercise of the second
option year for these PDCs, the CHA will be without PDC services to support the Capital Program.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-53
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO EXERCISE SECOND OPTION YEAR AND
EXECUTE AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE THE NOT-TO-EXCEED
CONTRACT AMOUNTS OF CONTRACT NO. 9048 WITH HARLEY ELLIS
DEVEREAUX, CONTRACT NO. 9049 WITH HOLABIRD & ROOT, LLC AND
CONTRACT
NO.
9050
WITH
GLOBETROTTER
ENGINEERING
CORPORATION FOR ADDITIONAL PRIME DESIGN CONSULTING
SERVICES”;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee
to execute Amendment No. 06 to Contract No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux
and Contract No. 9049 with Holabird & Root, LLC, and Amendment No. 4 with
Globetrotters Engineering Corporation to increase the not-to-exceed contract amount
by $250,000 for additional Prime Design Consultant services at various CHA
properties and exercise Option Year No. 2 for each contract.
The new not-to-exceed amount of Contract No. 9048 with Harley Ellis Devereaux
will be $7,348,682.75. The new not-to-exceed amount of Contract No. 9049 with
Holabird & Root, LLC will be $7,010,647.85. The new not-to-exceed amount of
Contract No. 9050 with Globetrotters Engineering Corporation will be
6

 $6,612,612.96. The aggregate increase to these contracts is the not-to-exceed amount
of $750,000.
The exercise of Option Year No. 2 will extend each contract end date from
6/30/2013 t0 6/30/2014. The new term of each contract will be 7/1/2009 through
06/30/2014.
Each Amendment is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s
MBE/WBE/DBE, Section 3 and insurance requirements.
(Item 7)
The resolution for Item 7 approves the ratification of contract modifications with the seven listed
vendors in the amount of $2,746,207.07 for various CHA projects. The general contractors listed
below have existing contracts with the CHA to provide construction services at various properties.
Each of these construction contracts has contract modifications that have cumulatively exceeded
$100,000 or 5% of the original contract amount. The contract modifications associated with the
above contracts were required to address a variety of issues, including but not limited to, health and
safety concerns, critical path tasks and infrastructure finishes. The contract modifications were a
result of discovered conditions, building code requirements, owner directed changes and design
corrections. The Capital Construction Department has verified that the amounts invoiced by the
contractors are for actual services requested by the CHA, required by Chicago Building Code or
circumstance, and all rendered and/or materials and equipment provided. The failure to ratify the
contract modifications listed above will likely result in protracted litigation with the contractors,
who have acted under the authority of the CHA, and that the CHA has been unjustly enriched.

WHEREAS,

RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-54
the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
entitled “RATIFICATION OF CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS FOR VARIOUS
CHA PROJECTS”;

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY
THAT

the Board of Commissioners hereby ratifies $2,746,207.07 of contract modifications
for various Chicago Housing Authority projects with the following contractors.

(Item 8)
The resolution for Item 8 approves amendment to the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan for potential
disposition of land and scattered site demolition in FY2013 and approves submission of the
amended Plan to HUD. The amendment includes conveyance of a southern part of Stateway
Gardens to the City in exchange for City land in proximity to the site; sale of portion of identified
property in Robert Taylor to XS Tennis Facility at fair market value; sale of vacant land adjacent to
Harry Schneider Senior Apartments to METRA at fair market value; sale of identified property in
ABLA to SOS Children’s Village in exchange for a series of commensurate public benefits to
residents of Roosevelt Square and proposed demolition of the 2 scattered sites known as 2723 W.
Augusta and 2828 S. Drake. A 38-day public comment period was conducted wherein both
residents and the public alike were able to submit comments orally and in writing, regarding the
information contained in the proposed Plan. The public comment period ran from May 28 through
July 5, 2013. During such time, on June 11, 2013, a public comment hearing was held. Prior to
finalizing the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment, CHA gave consideration to comments
received during the public comment period.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-55
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
entitled “AUTHORIZATION TO APPROVE THE FY2013 MOVING TO WORK
ANNUAL PLAN AMENDMENT
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY

8

 THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby approves the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan
Amendment.

THAT

the Board of Commissioners (“Board”) authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his
designee to approve any final changes to the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan
Amendment. Such approval shall constitute conclusive evidence of the Board’s
approval of any and all such changes.

THAT,

this approval of the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment supersedes any and all
conflicting language found in prior CHA MTW Annual Plans.

THAT,

the Board of Commissioners hereby grants authorization to submit the FY2013
MTW Annual Plan Amendment to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners has reviewed the Board Letter dated July 17, 2013
requesting approval of the FY2013 MTW Annual Plan Amendment, hereto attached.

(Item 9)
The resolution for Item 9 approves the disposition of lots on Washburne Avenue and transfer lots in
Fee Simple to SOS Children’s Village (SOSCV). SOSCV is proposing the development of fourteen
four-bedroom single-family homes on seven CHA owned lots on the north side of Washburne
Avenue between Racine Avenue and Loomis Street, directly across the street from Brooks Homes.
These units will provide homes for 14 families supporting approximately 72 children. The homes
will be owned and managed by SOS Children’s Villages Illinois. The property will be transferred
in fee simple to SOSCV Illinois or an affiliate. Related Midwest, the developer for Roosevelt
Square, will also be the developer for SOSCV in order to develop the lots in furtherance of the
Roosevelt Square development. SOS Children’s Villages Illinois is a not for profit corporation that
creates homes to provide care for foster children in community settings to assure that each child
grows into a productive and self-reliant adult. A key component of the model is a full-time
professionally trained foster parent whose only job is to provide unconditional love and care for the
children in their home. Operating funds for SOSCV are provided through a combination of
Department of Children and Family Services, federal and state funds. Private donations and
fundraising contribute to sustainability. To protect the CHA’s interest in the ABLA redevelopment
land the conveyance deed will contain a reversionary clause which will begin to elapse on the date
the last unit is occupied, along with a covenant requiring that the reversionary right does not burn
off until 85% occupancy, by a DCFS licensed foster parent, has been maintained for 5 years. If
during this 5 year period occupancy falls below 85% CHA shall have a right to demand a
reconveyance of the property, provided that SOSCV shall have a 90 day cure period prior to CHA
exercising such right. In addition, the deed will also include a covenant running with the land for a
period of fifteen years, beginning on the date the last unit is occupied to ensure that the land is used
for the housing of foster care families. If during this period SOSCV defaults on its loan, the lender
will be allowed to foreclose on and sell the property to either a (a) non-foster care provider,
provided that the CHA is reimbursed for the value of the land on the date of the conveyance,
$1,570,000, or (b) another foster care provider. Lastly, if during the period beginning on the date
the last unit is occupied and ending on the date that is five years from such date, there is a sale of
the project to a non- foster care facility purchaser, the CHA shall have the right to repurchase the
project at a price equal to the price negotiated less the $1,570,000. If the prospective purchaser
intends to continue to operate as a foster care facility, CHA will not be entitled to the $1,570,000
9

 credit if CHA elects to exercise its right to purchase the property. The development budget for the
SOSCV is approximately $6,780,463 funded by a construction loan from Bond proceeds in the
amount of $4,880,463 and a City of Chicago Grant of $1,900,000 approved by City Council in
March 2013. No CHA dollars are going towards the development of this project.
RESOLUTION NO. 2013-CHA-56

(Item 10)
The resolution for Item 10 approves a Mixed Finance Proposal, Evidentiary Documents and
Disposition Application for the Dorchester Artist Housing Development. The Dorchester Artist
Housing redevelopment is the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of the former 36-unit Dante-Harper
public housing Scattered Site development into 32 units of mixed-income housing and an arts
center/management office. This one phase redevelopment of five townhome buildings is located on
East 70th Street between Dante and Harper Avenues in Chicago’s Southside Greater Grand Crossing
neighborhood. Dorchester Artist Housing will consist of three different income tiers allocated for
public housing, affordable, and unrestricted market rate residents, respectively. The project’s five
buildings are located on two adjacent sites, divided by Harper Avenue, in an area generally bounded
by the alley north of East 70th Street to the north, South Dante Avenue to the west, East 70th Street
to the south, and midway on the block east of South Harper Avenue to the east. Dorchester Artist
Housing is designed to strengthen the Greater Grand Crossing community by rehabilitating the
vacant Dante-Harper development into a mixed-income community with a focus on the arts. Artists
will be encouraged to live in the development through a preference provided for artists only in the
tax credit and market rate units. In addition to housing designed to be customizable by the artists,
the on-site arts center with arts programming will be an attraction to artists and their families. The
development will provide a unique addition to the diverse array of rental and for-sale units available
across the community in multi-unit buildings, single-family, and town homes. Brinshore
Development, L.L.C. and The Rebuild Foundation NFP are the co-developers for the Dorchester
Artist Housing Redevelopment. Brinshore Development, L.L.C. (Brinshore) is the sponsor of the
10

 obligations under the redevelopment agreement. The residential development team consists of a
partnership between Brinshore and The Rebuild Foundation NFP, an Illinois not-for-profit
corporation. The total estimated development budget for Dorchester Artist Housing is $11,643,894
including the $3,550,000 CHA Loan to be funded with CHA Capital funds. Additional project
sources include approximately $361,917 of CHA Capital funds to be used to fund CHA
administration costs and the Initial Operating Deficit Reserve.
