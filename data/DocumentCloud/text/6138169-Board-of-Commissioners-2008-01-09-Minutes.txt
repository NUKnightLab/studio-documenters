classification for the remainder or for additional portions of the property,
provided that such subsequent application is made within seven years.

Sec. 74-65.

Qualifications for commercial development project status.

(a)
To qualify as a commercial development project under Class 7a or 7b, it is necessary that
the project be located in an area in need of commercial development in that:
(1)

The area is, or has been within the last ten years, designated by Federal, State or
local agency as a conservation, blighted or renewal area or an area encompassing
a rehabilitation or redevelopment plan or project adopted under the Illinois Urban
Renewal Consolidation Act of 1961, as amended, or the Commercial Renewal
Re-development Areas Act of 1967, as amended, or that the area is located in a
Federal Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, as proposed and
approved by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on
May 18, 1994, or the Commercial District Development Commission Ordinance
of the City of Chicago or designation of like effect adopted under any similar
statute or ordinance;

4794

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
(2)

Real estate taxes within the area, during the last six years, have declined,
remained stagnant or potential real estate taxes are not being fully realized due to
the depressed condition of the area;

(3)

There is a reasonable expectation that the development, re-development or
rehabilitation of the commercial development project is viable and likely to go
forward on a reasonably timely basis if granted Class 7a or 7b designation and
will therefore result in the economic enhancement of the area;

(4)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b
designation will materially assist development, redevelopment or rehabilitation
of the area and the commercial development project would not go forward
without the full incentive offered under Class 7a or 7b; and

(5)

Certification of the commercial development project for Class 7a or 7b
designation is reasonably expected to ultimately result in an increase in real
property tax revenue and employment opportunities within the area.

(b)
Prior to filing a Class 7a or 7b eligibility application with the Assessor, an applicant must
obtain from the municipality in which the real estate is located, or the County Board if the real estate is
located in an unincorporated area, an ordinance or resolution expressly stating that the municipality or
County Board, as the case may be, has determined that the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)--(a)(5) of this
section are present and that the municipality or County Board, as the case may be, supports and consents
to the Class 7a or 7b application to the Assessor. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be
included with the Class 7a or 7b application at the time of filing the application with the Assessor. A copy
of the ordinance or resolution, whichever is submitted, will be forwarded by the Assessor's Office to the
Secretary of the Board for distribution to the members of the County Board from the affected districts.
The application shall include any other information deemed necessary by the Assessor. The applicant
must demonstrate that the commercial development project qualifies for the Class 7a or 7b classification
and shall bear the expense of doing so.
(c)
Inasmuch as the County desires to encourage economic development in the
neighborhoods of the County, support the increased use of the incentive by smaller projects and to limit
the expense of such applications, the Assessor shall liberally construe the requirements of Subsections
(a)(1)--(a)(5) of this section for Class 7a applications.
(d)
The Assessor shall adopt rules, including a provision to ensure a proper review of the
application and supporting data.
(e)
Certification of a commercial development project shall not be denied by reason of
insufficient size if it otherwise qualifies hereunder. In determining what constitutes the "full incentive
offered" as provided in Subsection (a)(4) of this section, consideration may be given to any lawful
intergovernmental participation agreements under which the project developer has agreed, as a
precondition to Class 7a or 7b certification, to share a portion of future profits with the appropriate taxing
districts.
(f)
For Class 7a applications, where the Assessor finds that the conditions of Subsections
(a)(1)--(a)(5) of this section exist, the Assessor shall, within 60 days after receipt of the application and
necessary supporting data, certify the commercial development project eligible for Class 7a treatment
under this division.

4795

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
(g)
In order to determine Class 7b applications, upon receipt of the application and all the
necessary supporting data, the Assessor shall forward it to the Economic Development Advisory
Committee of the County. The Committee shall within 30 days return the application to the Assessor with
a finding stating whether the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)--(a)(5) of this section are present. The
Assessor shall review the application, supporting data, findings of the Committee and other appropriate
facts. Where the Assessor finds the conditions of Subsections (a)(1)--(a)(5) of this section exist, the
Assessor shall, within 30 days of the receipt of the Committee's findings, certify the commercial
development project eligible for Class 7b treatment under this division.
(h)
Class 7a and 7b certifications shall lapse within one year from the date of issuance unless
new construction or substantial rehabilitation, or in the case of abandoned property, reoccupation of the
commercial development project has commenced prior to its expiration.
(i)
To be certified as an area in need of substantial revitalization for purposes of Class 8
classification it is necessary that:
(1)

The municipality in which the area is located or, if an unincorporated area, the
County determine by lawful resolution that the area is in a state of economic
depression and that it is not economically feasible for private enterprise to
accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the
area without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar
import;

(2)

The municipality or, if in an unincorporated area, the County applies to the
Assessor for certification of the area as one in need of substantial revitalization;

(3)

Upon receiving an application to certify an area as in need of substantial
revitalization, the Assessor shall review the application, supporting data and
other appropriate factors relevant to a determination of the severity of the
economic conditions of the area. In determining whether the "in need of
substantial revitalization" requirement is met, the Assessor shall give strong
consideration and substantial weight to the fact that an area is located in a
Federal empowerment zone or enterprise community, as proposed and approved
by the County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18,
1994.

(j)
Upon finding that existing factors convincingly demonstrate that the area is in need of
substantial revitalization, as defined in this division, the Assessor shall grant such certification to the area.
In making this determination statistical data relevant to the surrounding area as well as the specific area
for which certification is sought may be considered. The surrounding area for the City of Chicago shall be
the community area as defined in this division; for all other areas in the County it shall be, where
applicable, the municipality in which the area is located.
(k)
If a municipality within an Enterprise Community, as proposed and approved by the
County Board on June 22, 1994, or the Chicago City Council on May 18, 1994, determines by municipal
resolution that the area is in a state of economic depression and that it is not economically feasible for
private enterprise to accomplish the necessary modernization, rehabilitation, and development of the area
without public assistance and encouragement, or a determination of similar import and submits a request
for Class 8 certification, such certification shall be automatic pursuant to this division. However, each
property eligible for a Class 8 incentive within the certified area must file an application in a timely
manner.

4796

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
(l)
Any Class 6a incentive that is still active can be renewed. The Class 6a incentive is
defined in this division. The renewal procedures described in Section 74-63 apply to Class 6a as well.
Sec. 74-66.

Where a single parcel of real estate is partially included in two or more of the above-described
classes, each portion shall be assessed at the assessment level herein prescribed for that class.
Sec. 74-67.

JOSEPH MARIO MORENO, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION REQUESTING THE SET ASIDE OF HOME FUNDS
FOR THE TOWN OF CICERO
WHEREAS, according to the 1990 U.S. Census, Cicero was reported to have 23,179 occupied housing
units with a population of 67,436; and
WHEREAS, over the next ten years, Cicero’s population increased to 85,616, but with an accompanying
drop in the number of occupied housing units to 23,115; and
WHEREAS, presently, Cicero’s population is estimated to be over 100,000, a forty percent increase from
1990 or 23,000 additional people living in the same number of housing units that were available in 1990;
and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing units, over 95% were constructed prior to 1970, has led to a
large number of health and safety hazards, such as structural deficiencies in heating, plumbing, and
electrical systems as well as the fact that the majority of these homes contain lead paint; and

4798

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
WHEREAS, the unfortunate result of these deficiencies is a large number of families in need of
rehabilitating their homes and a disproportionate number of Cicero children under the age of six being
effected by lead poisoning; and
WHEREAS, the need for housing rehabilitation in Cicero has outgrown it’s available financial resources,
with over three hundred families on a waiting list requesting funds to rehabilitate their homes; and
WHEREAS, during the last two years the town has used a portion of its CDBG allocation to fund an
Emergency Assistance Program, providing funds up to $4,999 to repair a hazardous condition requiring
immediate action to protect the health and safety of residents; and
WHEREAS, the town’s Home Repair Program will be reinstated this year with a cap of $4,999 to assist
homeowners who do not qualify for the Emergency Assistance Program; and
WHEREAS, this cap results from the requirement to provide Lead Abatement in any residential
rehabilitation project costing more than $5,000, and the lack of available local funding coupled with the
large number of units in need of rehabilitation; and
WHEREAS, the age of Cicero’s housing array, and the fact that many of the occupied housing units are
severely overcrowded, has had a negative impact on the safety and livability of these units; and
WHEREAS, complicating this significant problem is the fact that Cicero is a minority community, made
up of approximately 85% Hispanics, and nearly 20% of its residents have incomes at or below the poverty
level, greatly limiting their ability to afford needed housing repairs; and
WHEREAS, since 1991, the Town of Cicero has been an integral part of the Cook County Consortium
related to the HOME and American Dream Down Payment Initiative; and
WHEREAS, as part of the Consortium, Cicero contributes 11.1% of the total dollar amount received by
Cook County for these programs or about $650,000 to $700,000 annually; and
WHEREAS, although many communities in Cook County have benefited from these housing funds, the
Town of Cicero, with a need as great as any other community, has yet to receive any funding under these
programs, a potential loss of some $10 million; and
WHEREAS, Cicero is not able to keep up with the demand and need for housing rehabilitation, it is
calling upon the County of Cook to set aside $1.5 million in HOME funds annually to the Town of Cicero
over the next ten years, and $750 thousand thereafter; and
WHEREAS, Cicero intends to use these dollars to increase the number of Cicero residents in need of
housing rehabilitation to be able to do so.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, does
hereby request the Cook County Department of Planning and Development set aside HOME funds for the
Town of Cicero for the purpose of improving the housing conditions of its residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Honorable Body thanks the Town of Cicero for their
continuing contributions to these worthwhile causes and wholeheartedly encourages their efforts at
improving the safety and well being of its citizens.

WHEREAS, King County, the 12th largest county in the nation, in (Seattle) Washington, is home to 1.8
million people; and
WHEREAS, King County employs 20,000 attorneys and implemented an electronic filing system in

1/2 feet of paper, which amounted to 7 million pages per year; and
WHEREAS, once the paper document is scanned onto the King County’s ECR system, the office
“destroys” the paper document by recycling it after a 30 day period thereby significantly reducing
document storage costs; and
WHEREAS, the top courts in California, Montana and Florida, and some lower courts in New York,

practices in the courts; and

4802

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Green Courts Initiative should include a paper waste reduction
program, including a comprehensive program for paper, print cartridges and other packaging materials,

Supreme Court, the Administrative Office of the Illinois Court and the Circuit Court of Cook County in
its efforts to incorporate green practices in the courts by developing a Green Courts Initiative; and

Chief Judge organize a task force to oversee the development of a permanent electronic file and serve
system where paper files are eliminated and electronic documents become the official court record with

networks to encourage the use of a permanent electronic filing system and also seek to amend any rules,
acts, ordinances, resolutions or other legislation necessary to support a paperless system; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Green Courts Task Force should provide a report to the Board
no later than six months after the passage of this Resolution, and every six months after with an
evaluation and reports of the paper waste reduction program and electronic filing system, when approved

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
WHEREAS, the amount of the deficit has generated controversy and debate; and
WHEREAS, the most recent budget numbers do not account for the substantial amount of funds

approximately $130 million; and
WHEREAS, by statute the County is only permitted to set aside 3% of the total appropriation for the

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION PLAN
WHEREAS, employees of the County of Cook are covered by a pension plan which is based on defined
benefits rather than defined contributions; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is a rather generous one which often allows County retirees to draw
out a much greater amount than that which they have contributed; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan provides no incentive for County employees to invest greater
amounts in their own future; and
WHEREAS, the current pension plan is one which places a great financial burden on the County
taxpayers; and

Illinois Constitution of 1970 and governed under 40 ILCS 5/9; and
WHEREAS, it is possible for the Illinois General Assembly to create a new retirement system for new
hires; and
WHEREAS, it is crucial that the County create an alternative retirement package in order to reduce the
burden placed on the taxpayers by the current system; and

4807

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
WHEREAS, a defined contribution retirement system would encourage County employees to contribute
larger percentages to their salaries in order to yield greater benefits; and
WHEREAS, any newly derived system should allow for greater employee involvement in investment
decisions; and
WHEREAS, such a system should be portable so that employees leaving County service could roll their
benefits over to another system; and
WHEREAS, the federal government’s adopted the Thrift Savings Plan, a portable, defined contribution
plan for their employees in 1986, which allows participants to choose from 6 alternative funds; and which
currently covers more than 3 million participants; and
WHEREAS, the federal government Thrift Savings Plan allows employees to contribute up to 10% of
their salary to their retirement fund; and
WHEREAS, the Thrift Savings Plan has been a massive success, and currently has approximately 3
million participants.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does
hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to create a new defined contribution pension system for new
hires in Cook County modeled after the Thrift Savings Plan for federal government employees in order to
maximize County employee involvement in their retirement programs and reduce the costs of the pension
system for Cook County taxpayers.

Director of Financial Reporting in the Comptroller’s office, Faissal Abassi, who is responsible for
coordinating all auditing functions for the County. Additionally, Wrunda Bates and Lillian Adarmes have

future months, but that he would get back to the Committee members with additional information.

Transmitting a Communication, dated December 17, 2007 from
BRUCE WASHINGTON, Director, Office of Capital Planning and Policy
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization to enter into a professional services
contract with Roula Associates Architects, Chtd., Chicago, Illinois, selected from the Request for
Qualifications/Proposals process. The services required are design and construction administration for
the Residential Treatment Unit - Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RTU-RCDC) Project at the
Department of Corrections. It is respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project will provide a new facility to combine and house the Department of
Corrections Reception Classification Diagnostic Center (RCDC or intake facility) which
processes admissions into the Department of Corrections (DOC) and Cermak Health
Services of Cook County and a Residential Treatment Unit (RTU). The program includes
new intake, holding, and processing areas, clinics, medical services and associated
administrative functions, dormitories and auxiliary dormitory functions. In recent years,
this system has had to respond to the demands of increasing numbers of inmate admissions
and mental health evaluations and treatment. The existing RCDC and RTU facilities can no
longer accommodate the volume of admissions, screenings and care required. The facilities
are overcrowded, basic amenities are inadequate, building systems are outdated and in some
cases non-functional.
The new facility will meet current “Essential Standards” set by the National Commission on
Correctional Health Care and the American Correctional Association which are required for
maintaining accreditation, and will provide for an efficient and orderly intake process
including screening and provision of care.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $4,300,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
Reason:

Currently only Building 3 has central air conditioning on floor 1 and part of floor 2, and the
air conditioning unit is defective. All other air conditioning in the buildings is provided by
window units. The units are a security risk in that they can be removed by detainees for
egress or dissembled for parts. The provision of central air conditioning throughout the two
buildings will eliminate this security risk and provide more efficient climate control and
energy conservation.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $250,000.00. Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 9, 2008
Reason:

The intent of this project is to provide a Master Plan for the Cook County Bureau of Health
Services to include evaluation of current needs, projected needs and objectives and to
maximize the utilization of vacant and underutilized buildings at the Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County and Provident Hospital of Cook County Campuses. All agencies, departments
and functions within the Bureau of Health Services will be assessed.
The Master Plan will also focus on the adaptive reuse of vacant buildings and/or other space
at the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and Provident Hospital of Cook County
Campuses to both maximize existing County building inventory and effectively consolidate
and centralize the Bureau of Health Services to enhance functionality as determined by
analysis of the program data. Existing buildings and their systems will be analyzed and
recommendations made for appropriate future use, including but not limited to sustainable
design and site improvements, mixed use potential and new/replacement construction.
Relocations of agencies and use of occupied buildings, for purposes other than which they
where originally intended, will be analyzed and incorporated into the Master Plan where it
is indicated that a relocation would serve to augment the efficiency of services.
Additionally, a study will be conducted to establish the most viable use of any surplus
building inventory that would be compatible with agencies and services being
recommended for inclusion in the Master Plan.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $1,600,000.00. Bond Issue (28000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

BUREAU OF HEALTH SERVICES
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication from

requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with the Illinois Department of
Public Health, Springfield, Illinois, to provide reference laboratory testing services for metabolic
screening tests of newborn infants for Provident Hospital of Cook County and Stroger Hospital of Cook
County.
Reason:

The request is necessary for ongoing testing of patient samples to determine the presence of
PKU, a congenital disease defect in the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine, as
mandated by Illinois statute. Failure to have a new contract in place will not only effect
patient care of newborn infants but limit our ability to meet state regulatory requirements.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $153,000.00 [$50,000.00 – (891-365 Account); and $103,000.00 (897-365
Account)]. Contract period: December 1, 2007 through November 30, 2008. Requisition Nos. 88911010
and 88970166.

collection. At Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County, Accordis, Inc. collected $82,813.06
during the month of July 2005 and at Provident Hospital of Cook County they collected
$275,929.22, during the month of March 2006. This request is to pay outstanding invoices, in
the amount of $8,281.31 for July 2005; and in the amount of $27,592.92 for March 2006,
respectively. The delay for processing these invoices was due to reconciliation and
negotiation of disputed items.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $35,874.23. Estimated Revenue Generated: $358,742.28. (897-260 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.

The new bureau-wide Contract No. 07-72-330 is scheduled for an award on the January 9,

locations. The implementation process requires relocation of all medical records to a new
facility. The new vendor proposal includes the requirement of twenty (20) days to receive the
medical records. The contract specification gives the new vendor thirty (30) days to complete
installation and inventory of medical records. The expiration date of the current contract was
January 6, 2008.

compromise our ability to treat patients in a timely manner. The eleven month period is
requested for the assessment of each facility’s requirements to make this a bureau-wide
contract. The expiration date of the current contract was December 31, 2007.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $64,408.00. Contract extension: January 1, 2008 through November 30, 2008.

APPROVAL OF PAYMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated December 14, 2007 from
JOHNNY C. BROWN, Chief Operating Officer, Stroger Hospital of Cook County
requesting approval of payment in the amount of $16,580.41 to Chicago Medical Equipment & Supply
Company, Chicago, Illinois, for Contract No. 03-72-670 for the purchase of reagents and supplies for
vendor provided analyzers for creatine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin determination for the Department of
Pathology, Biochemistry Division.
Reason:

This request is to pay outstanding invoices within the contract period. Chicago Medical
Equipment & Supply Company reconciled their records and it was determined that two
outstanding invoices for Immulite creatine kinase (CK)-MB and troponin test reagents
utilized during the months of May and June 2006 were not paid. These test reagents measure
the cardiac enzymes released during a heart attack. The delay for processing these invoices
was due to the reconciliation and negotiation of disputed items. The expiration date of the
contract was August 19, 2006.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: $16,580.41. (897-365 Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2007 funds.

Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the payment to Chicago Medical
Equipment & Supply Company be made. The motion carried.
