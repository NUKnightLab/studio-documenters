PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION CONCERNING REMOVAL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER
WHEREAS, the office of the public defender is an office created by state statute, all as set forth in
Article 3, Division 3-4 of the Counties Code, 55 ILCS 5/1-1001, et seq. (“Illinois Law”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law sets forth the purpose of the public defender and the declaration of the General
Assembly of the State of Illinois wherein the General Assembly recognizes the People of the State of
Illinois’ fundamental right to quality legal representation in criminal and related proceedings; and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law also provides the process for appointment, the terms of employment, the oath
of office, the duties, the compensation, a provision for appointment of assistants, provisions for office
quarters and expenses and record keeping of the Public Defender in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners (the “President”) and the Cook
County Board of Commissioners clearly recognized the intent of the General Assembly to provide quality
legal representation to the indigent by seeking to reduce Edwin A. Burnette’s (hereinafter referred to as
the “Public Defender”) caseload by creating twenty-eight (28) new positions in the 2008 Budget; and

PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #7 cont’d
WHEREAS, notwithstanding the President’s and the Cook County Board of Commissioner’s willingness
to create twenty-eight (28) new positions to further ensure quality legal representation of the indigent,
during the Public Defender’s tenure, there were thirty-four (34) inmates of Cook County Jail (persons
held in custody who have not been convicted of a crime) who waited for trial for over five (5) years at an
approximate cost to the Cook County taxpayers of $5,584,500 ($90 per day for 34 inmates for 5 years),
while the Public Defender continues to fail to ensure that all assistant public defenders work a full forty
(40) hour work week, (See, Evaluation of the Juvenile Justice Division of the law office of the Cook
County Public Defender submitted herewith as Exhibit A on page 10 and hereinafter referred to as the
“Northwestern Report”); and
WHEREAS, Illinois Law provides the process for removing the Cook County Public Defender and is set
forth below:
The public defender once approved by the Board shall serve for 6 years and may be
removed by the President only for good cause or dereliction of duty after notice and a
hearing before the Board.
55 ILCS 5/3-4004.2(c) (emphasis added); and
WHEREAS, Black’s Law Dictionary defines dereliction in the performance of duties as:
[W]illful or negligent failure to perform assigned duties; culpable inefficiency in performing
assigned duties.
West Group, Black’s Law Dictionary 454 (7th ed. 2001);
WHEREAS, the President, being the duly elected officer, has determined that there is good cause to
remove the Public Defender; and
WHEREAS, the Public Defender has willfully or negligently failed to perform the following assigned
duties as the Cook County Public Defender in that:
1.

The Public Defender failed to notify the administration of the Chicago Community
Group’s ongoing report concerning the Criminal Courts; and the Public Defender, as
cited in the Northwestern Report, failed to ensure that all employees of his office
performed a full forty (40) hour week of work in exchange for their compensation;
specifically, the Northwestern Report stated there existed a problem in his office
concerning the early departure of assistants after court (See, Exhibit A, page 10);

2.

The Public Defender has failed to timely process promotions of employees within his
office resulting in an unnecessary and unreasonable delay in the hiring of entry-level
employees. The following are examples of such failures:
•

On or about October 25, 2007, the Public Defender was provided with lists of
applicants for the promotional position of public defender III and IV. The Public
Defender has approximately fifteen (15) of these positions vacant. Filling these
positions would allow the Public Defender to create vacancies for public defender I
positions, and hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. As of March 31, 2008, the Public
Defender has failed to fill all such positions except three (3).

•

In or about July, 2007, the Public Defender requested that five (5) public defender I
positions be reclassified to clerical positions within his office, further reducing his
ability to hire attorneys to reduce caseloads. This request was processed on or about
July 17, 2007.

 page 9
POST BOARD ACTION AGENDA
Meeting of May 7, 2008

COMMISSIONERS continued
PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS continued
ITEM #7 cont’d
•

Beginning on or about November 29, 2007, the Public Defender was advised that
supervisory positions could not be posted until job descriptions for those positions
were completed by his office and reviewed by the Bureau of Human Resources.
Despite repeated communications, these descriptions were not completed until midMarch, 2008. At about that same time, the Public Defender requested that these
positions not be posted, thereby placing the entire process in indefinite limbo.

Such failures have led this Public Defender to have a caseload greater than the national
standard. (See, Exhibit B submitted herewith the American Council of Chief Defenders
Statement on Caseloads and Workloads, August 24, 2007); and
3.

The Public Defender failed to ensure that all non-union employees complied with the
President’s executive order concerning the five (5) furlough day mandate, which
contributed to additional financial burden to Cook County and such savings should have
been reprogrammed back into services to the poor; and

4.

The Public Defender did not adequately handle the disciplinary issue of an employee
under his supervision who is alleged to have committed a crime in the workplace and
alleged to have been in possession of illegal and illicit drugs in the workplace; (See,
Exhibit C submitted herewith Pot Delivered to Public Defender’s Office Gets Clerk,
November 28, 2007); and

5.

The Public Defender has failed to identify Shakman Exempt positions as required under
the provisions of the Supplemental Relief Order and Consent Decree established in the 69
C 2145 and titled Shakman, et al. v. The Democratic Organization, et al.; and

6.

The Public Defender misled the Cook County Board of Commissioners by seeking the
appointment of a Special State’s Attorney to provide “analysis, interpretation and advice”
(See, Exhibit D submitted herewith Petition for Appointment of a Special State’s
Attorney) and the Public Defender exceeded such authority granted to him by this Board
of Commissioners by suing the President thereby causing a potential financial liability to
the Cook County taxpayers to pay attorney fees to the Public Defender’s attorney and the
President’s attorney. (See, Exhibit E submitted herewith Public Defender’s Complaint
and See also, Exhibit F submitted herewith Motion to Dismiss Pursuant to Section 2619); and

WHEREAS, the President, after affording the Public Defender the right to a hearing before the Cook
County Board of Commissioners, should remove the Public Defender as the Public Defender of Cook
County if there exists good cause for such removal.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the
above stated recitals and whereas clauses are incorporated herein by reference; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board of
Commissioners hereby finds that a hearing occurred to discuss whether the Public Defender was in fact
derelict in his duty and whether there is good cause for removal; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board of
Commissioners hereby supports the President’s removal of the Public Defender as the Public Defender of
Cook County in accordance with 55 ILCS 5/3-4004.2(c) for reasons set forth in this Resolution and at his
hearing before the President and this Board of Commissioners and further finds that his removal and the
appointment of another individual will best provide an environment where the taxpayers of Cook County
have greater confidence that resources allotted to the Cook County Public Defender are administered so
as to best fulfill his statutory duty to provide quality legal representation to the indigent of Cook County.

previous grant and new funding of $250,000.00. The funds will be used for the court’s Juvenile

court’s juvenile detention reform efforts. The grant also funds specialized consulting services, training,
supplies, and publications for JDAI programming.
The authorization to accept the original grant was given on July 31, 2007 by the Cook County Board of

This grant requires no cash matching funds and as such, would have no fiscal impact on the county.
