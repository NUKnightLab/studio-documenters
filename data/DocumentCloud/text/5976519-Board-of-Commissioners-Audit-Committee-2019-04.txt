Damon Howell, Field Auditor V

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We have completed the audit of the Cook County Department of Correction’s (DOC) Commissary system
for the period from December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017. The audit was performed to comply
with The Illinois Department of Corrections requirement of Commissary System Annual Audits as part of
the County Jail Inspections to be performed by the Jail and Detention Standards Unit. Our audit was
performed in accordance with the amended requirements of the Illinois County Jail Standards, Section 701.
250 - Commissary.
The scope and objectives of our audit were designed to determine the DOC’s compliance with the amended
requirements of the Illinois Jail Standards, Section 701.250 - Commissary. The scope of the audit also
included providing the required accounting of the total purchases, sales and expenditures of the DOC’s
commissary for the period December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017 as well as the total commissions
received from commissary sales and a detailed listing of how the commissions were used for the benefit of
the DOC inmates.
Based on the results of our audit procedures it was concluded that the Commissary Services offered to the
detainees at the CCDOC complies with each of the revised requirements of the Illinois Jail Standards,
Section 701.250. Using the financial information provided by both the commissary vendor and the Cook
County Sheriff’s staff, we provided an accounting of the total sales and expenditures of the DOC’s
commissary for the period December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017 as well as the total commissions
received from commissary sales and a detailed listing of how the commissions were used for the benefit of
the DOC inmates. Please refer to Exhibit A, B and C at the end of our audit report.

BACKGROUND
The Cook County Department of Corrections contracted with the Keefe Commissary Network, LLC to
establish and maintain a commissary system offering a full range of services and products to detainees at
the DOC. The agreement between the DOC and the Keefe Commissary Network, requires that scheduled
weekly commissary services be available to all DOC detainees.
Each detainee at the DOC has a trust account. The detainees can purchase items from the commissary using
the available funds in their trust accounts. The items available for purchase from the commissary include
clothing, stamped envelopes, toiletries, stationery and food items. The commissary sales at the DOC are
grouped in to two categories; microwavable sales and general sales. Per the contract the commission rate
for microwavable sales is 49.1% and the commission rate for the general sales is 43.5%. The commissions
from both types of sales are paid monthly and deposited into the Inmate Welfare Fund.
The Inmate Welfare Fund is administered by the Sheriff of Cook County for the direct benefit, welfare or
education of the individual and general inmate population and to enhance inmate activities and programs.
The funds in the Inmate Welfare Fund are to be used at the discretion of the Executive Director of the DOC
for the direct benefit of persons who are inmates in the Cook County Department of Corrections.

 AUDIT SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE
The objective of our audit was to determine the DOC’s compliance with the amended requirements of the
Illinois Jail Standards, Section 701.250 – Commissary. Our audit procedures were designed to obtain,
examine and test sufficient supporting documentation to reach a conclusion on the DOC’s compliance with
each of the amended requirements of the Illinois Jail Standards, Section 701.250. The scope of our audit
was for the period from December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017. The requirements we evaluated
for compliance were:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The establishment and maintenance of a commissary system to provide detainees with items or
access to services approved by the Sheriff.
No member of the jail staff gained personal profit, directly or indirectly, as a result of the
commissary system.
Prices charged detainees shall not exceed those for the same articles if sold in local community
stores nor shall the prices charged for postal supplies exceed those for the same articles sold at
local post offices.
Commissary access shall be provided on a regular basis and not less than once weekly.
Net profits from the commissary system shall be used for education, recreation or other purposes
within the jail for the benefit of detainees, as deemed appropriate by the Sheriff. Profits may be
used for record keeping expenses of the commissary.
Accurate accounting for all purchases, sales and expenditures of the commissary system, including
phone services and, if provided, email access, is maintained.

Additionally, our audit scope will include providing an accounting of the total purchases, sales and
expenditures of the DOC’s commissary for the period December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017 as
well as the total commissions received from commissary sales and a detailed listing of how the commissions
were used for the benefit of the DOC inmates.

AUDIT RESULTS
In order to reach a conclusion on our objectives, we performed our audit procedures which were designed
to obtain, examine and test sufficient supporting documentation to reach a conclusion on the DOC’s
compliance with each of the amended requirements of the Illinois Jail Standards, Section 701.250. Based
on our audit work we have reached the following conclusions:
•
•

•

The DOC along with the contracted services of Keefe Commissary Network, LLC have established
and maintain a commissary system offering a full range of services and products to the detainees
at the DOC.
It appears that no personal gain via the operation of the commissary system has been received
either directly or indirectly by any personnel including jail staff or other key members. This was
concluded based our review of the current service agreement, the current commissary practices,
the expenditures and approval procedures as well as discussions with Sheriff personnel and the
management of the commissary vendor.
Considering the fluctuations in the size of the item and the brand name compared, our review of
price comparisons performed by the commissary vendor as well as our own sample of price
comparisons indicated the majority of the items sold in the commissary system are sold at a price
lower than a compatible item sold in a local store. While our review did indicate examples where
the items sold in the commissary system were priced slightly higher than a compatible item sold in
a local store our overall conclusion is that the prices charged the inmates at the DOC are consistent
with the prices charged at local stores in Cook County.

 AUDIT RESULTS - CONTINUED
•
•

•

•

Our review of the prices charges for the postal supplies offered through the commissary system at
the DOC indicated that the prices charged did not exceed the price of the same article/similar item
sold at the local post office.
Commissary services are provided on a weekly basis to the detainees at the DOC. Per the
agreement between the DOC and the Keefe Commissary Network, it is required that scheduled
weekly commissary services be available to all DOC detainees. Based on our review of weekly
sales reports it appears that commissary is offered to the detainees at the DOC on a weekly basis.
Commissions from the commissary sales are deposited into the Inmate Welfare Fund maintained
at the DOC. The DOC has established and issued a Policy and Procedure for the Administration
of the Inmate Welfare Fund directive that clearly outlines how the fund is to be administered and
what the funds are to be used for. Our review of the expenditures from the Inmate Welfare Fund
indicated that the commissions received were appropriately used for education, recreation or
other prior authorized purposes meant to benefit the detainees.
Daily and monthly commissary sales reports are maintained and produced by the commissary
vendor for each sale type, general or microwavable. The reports clearly breakout the amount of
phone card sales as well as the commission amounts by sales type. Based on our review and
testing of the sales reports, we concluded that the reports appeared accurate and a reliable source
of information regarding both the commissary and phone card sales and commissions due to the
Inmate Welfare Fund.

Based on the results of our audit procedures it was concluded that the Commissary Services offered to the
detainees at the CCDOC complies with each of the revised requirements of the Illinois Jail Standards,
Section 701.250.
Using the financial information provided by both the commissary vendor and the Cook County Sheriff’s
staff, we provided an accounting of the total sales and expenditures of the DOC’s commissary for the period
December 1, 2016 through November 30, 2017 as well as the total commissions received from commissary
sales and a detailed listing of how the commissions were used for the benefit of the DOC inmates. Please

Per established Inmate Welfare policies and procedures, the Inmate Welfare Funds (including Commissary System net
profits) are to be used for the direct benefit, welfare or education of the individual and general inmate populations,
enhancing inmate activities and programs. The funds are used at the discretion of the DOC Executive Director, subject to
approval of the Sheriff’s CFO or Budget Director. The Sheriff’s Inmate Welfare Fund Committee is designated to provide
oversight of the Inmate Welfare Fund administration and fund disbursements. The Committee is required to meet and
approve expenditures in excess of $10,000.00. In addition, the Committee is required to review fund activity to evaluate
the actual benefits inmates receive from the Fund revenues.

 Per our review of the Inmate Welfare Fund’s cash disbursements journal, bank statements and sample testing of select
fund disbursements it appears that appropriate review and approval was given by authorized personnel prior to any fund
disbursements. Appropriate supporting documentation was included with reviewed disbursement requests. It appears that
net profits of the commissary system are appropriately used for education, recreation or other prior authorized purposes
meant to benefit the detainees.
