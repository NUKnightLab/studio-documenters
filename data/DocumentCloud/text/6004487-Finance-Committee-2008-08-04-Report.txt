System met pursuant to notice on Monday, August 4, 2008 at the hour of 10:00 A.M. at 1900
West Polk Street, Second Floor, in Chicago, Illinois.

Your Finance Committee has considered the following items and upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations follow.

Roll Call

Deborah Santana, of the Of?ce of the Secretary to the Board, called the roll of members, and it
was determined that a quorum was present.

 

Discussion of Max Financials

Mr. Pitt Calkin, Interim Chief Financial Of?cer of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services
appeared before the Committee, and presented information in the form of a PowerPoint
presentation. (See Attachment

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

Chairman Carvalho inquired as to why health care and pension ?gures are included in the data
presented, as they are not the System?s responsibility.

Mr. Calkin replied that he is utilizing GAAP accounting principals rather than Governmental
accounting principals.

Director GreenSpan inquired as to what refers to.

Mr. Calkin replied that this ?gure is applied to the cash number that the County has given the
Bureau fer the ?rst six months. He estimated that the Bureau is about three and one half months
behind on invoices, which represents 40%. It is the lag number, which accounts for that fact that
some of the cash payouts are actually from a prior period.

Director GreensPan inquired whether this lag time is typical.

Mr. Calkin replied in the af?rmative, however, he noted that it is just a little higher than usual.

Director Greenspan inquired as to what portion of total operating expense supplies and services
should be.

Mr. Calkin rcplied that he is not comfortable yet supplying this ?gure. For a public hospital,
however, he would expect that ?gure to be in the 21% to 23% range.

Chairman Carvalho stated that in the past, the IGT amount came to the County and the County
allocated only a portion to the Health System. He asked whether this was still the case.

Mr. Calkin responded that he would have to get back to the Chairman on this issue.

Director O?Donnell inquired whether low tax intake due to the economy is going to affect what is
distributed to the System.

Mr. Calkin stated that he would check on this.

Director Greenspan inquired why, if the IGT is presented here as a ?xed amount, is the System
behind budget on that item?

Mr. Calkin replied that $138 million was budgeted for the IGT, and he is not sure why the System
is coming up short $15 million.

Director Butler inquired as to whether the sales tax is computed at the old or new rate.
Mr. Calkin agreed that he would get back to the Committee with the answer.
Chairman Carvalho inquired as to how the expenses per unit compared to other hospitals.

Mr. Calkin stated that he will bring those ?nancials to next month's meeting. He will make the
comparison with public hoSpitals nationally and will include some trending as well.

Director Greenspan stated that it is possible to put a local market number to this as well.
Mr. Calkin stated that he will also get the information about hospitals in the Chicago area.

Chairman Carvalho stated that the Committee would be looking for this type of information on a
basis, and that the members should let Mr. Calkin know if he is going in the right
direction with the information he is providing.

Director O?Donnell inquired as to why the patient fee revenue is down so much since MedAssets
will be improving the revenue cycle.

Mr. Calkin replied that the $310 million projected for 2008 will probably come in at $270
million, because of the reduction in Medicaid patients and the increase in self-pay. The Bureau
added $20 million to the projection due to the MedAssets project that is ongoing.

Mr. Small noted that this is a preliminary snapshot; almost every item, except for IGT and BIPA,
is preliminary and has a number of variables to it.

Chairman Carvalho added that the Board would soon need to see multi?year projections. He
asked whether BIPA and IGT would continue to drop.

Mr. Small reaponded that he expected that they would continue to drop.

Chairman Carvalho noted that following contract negotiations it should be expected that overtime
will drop after a certain amount of time, as increased wages allows positions to be ?lled and
overtime to be reduced. He urged that management stay on top of this, inasmuch as wringing
overtime out of the system is often dif?cult.

Chairman Carvalho cautioned that many of the performance indicators are based on medical
coding data whose accuracy may he su3pect, since the System has been chronically understaffed
in this area. He added that inter-facility and service area ?nancial comparisons are also dif?cult.
since the Medicaid revenues per procedure do not vary according to diagnosis code or facility.
He suggested that Mr. Calkin drop a lot of footnotes on these data.

Mr. Calkin agreed to footnote the data as noted.

 

Budget Update

(See Attachment 

Ms. Jarese Wilson, Director of the Cook County Department of Budget and Management,
presented a brief overview of how the budget process operates.

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the System?s FY09 budget is not already under-funded by
$55 million, given projected cost increases and revenue decreases.

COOK COUNTY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS SYSTEM

Ms. Wilson replied in the af?rmative, and stated that this is why there is an opportunity to work
together to get at least a 90% number in place going into 2009 as the System Board is ?nalizing
multi-year budgets for the future.

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether the Committee was expected to cut the budget by $35
million to bring it to last year?s appropriation.

Ms. Wilson replied that she w0uld work with the Directors to get the budget in balance, and that
the Finance Director, Mr. Calkin, Mr. Small, the County?s Chief Financial Officer Donna
Dunnings, and she can work together. Once a decision is made together, the number will be the
President?s recommendation to the Commissioners and then at that time a debate will happen.

Director O'Donnell inquired as to the deadline for the Board to submit to the President.
Ms. Wilson replied that August 19 and August 20 are slated for the Bureau hearing.

Mr. Small stated that before this time, the Board and management need to meet to determine the
budget.

Ms- Wilson stated that she would like to have an agreed-upon number by the first or second week
in September.

Chairman Carvalho stated that this deadline presents a dilemma, given that there will only be time
for two meetings before then, and the System just acquired its interim Chief Financial Of?cer
three weeks ago and has yet to acquire an interim Chief Executive Of?cer. Furthermore, a budget
reflects strategic priorities, and the System is just beginning to establish what its priorities are.

Chairman Carvalho inquired as to how much of the 2007 Budget cuts were restored in 2008.
Ms. Wilson replied that all but approximately $12 million were restored.

Chairman Carvalho stated that a status quo budget would prevent the System from competing for
necessary funds with other County entities that might wish to make claim on the new County
resources from the sales tax increase. He further stated that restoring some of the programs that
directly affect patients should be a priority.

Director O?Donnell noted that the 2009 budget is based on the 2008 appropriations, not actual
expenditures.

Chairman Carvalho requested that a menu be created of the programs that have been cut for
potential restorations.

Director O?Donnell inquired as to which 2007 cuts were restored in ?scal year 2008.

Mr. Small replied that zero were restored. He believed that 2003 will look a lot like 2007 in
terms of services performed and expenditures and revenues generated. He stated that
management would be happy to bring recommendations on adjustments from 2003 to 2009,
including what the priority programs would be, and which programs were cutout.

Director Muiioz, seconded by Director O?Donnell, moved to approve the Contract and
Procurement Approvals.

Director Golden inquired as to the requirements and processes.
Chairman Carvalho and Mr. Small presented an overview of this process. 

Leslie Duffy, Director of Procurement of the Health System, introduced Carmen Triche?Colvin,
Cook County Purchasing Agent, who presented an overview of requests to rebid and the
circumstances that led to these requests to rebid.

Chairman Carvalho stated that it is important to get the contracts bid correctly to begin with, so
that you do not have a ?boomerang" effect, whereby you have to extend emergency purchases
and contracts at less than favorable circumstances.

Additional information was requested and received regarding the Contract and Procurement
Approvals items. (See Attachment 

Chairman Carvalho stated that Director Greenspan, before he had to leave, left several comments.
First, he would, in the future, like to see a cost per unit comparison to the previous contract and
he wanted to make sure that it was noted whether it was a competitive bid. (Chairman Carvalho
noted that the backup would answer this question.) Additionally, Director Greenspan asked why
the Board is seeing items of $17,000.00 or $20,000.00. (Chairman Carvalho stated that is
because the current ordinance has it that way; the Board ought to consider whether going forward
we would like to change that.)

Director Golden stated that the length of the contract should always be included.

Mr. Small stated the errata, which included the following:

Under Bid Award Recommendations, the item for reagents and equipment in the amount of
$255,288.00; and the item for reagents for samples of HIV and Leukemia in the amount of
$1,518,689.00 should be listed in the Preposed Contracts section, as they are both requests

to enter into contracts with Beckmau Coulter, Inc. for sole source supplies.

The Approval of Payment to Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago in the
amount of $746,263.00 is being WITHDRAWN.

Director Mu?oz, seconded by Director O?Donnell, moved to amend the motion to reflect the
errata as stated by Mr. Small. THE MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

On the motion to approve as amended, a voice vote was taken and THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

 

MedAssets Ul?ate

Mr. Small introduced Mr. Robert Wright, Ms. Gretchen Ryan, and Mr. Dan James of MedAssets,
who gave a PowerPoint presentation to the Committee.

(See Attachment 

Director O'Donnell inquired as to whether the functions are being staffed by MedAssets
personnel or whether Bureau personnel are being utilized. Additionally, she asked whether the
County would outsource these functions in three years.

Mr. Wright responded that there are many vacant positions; staff is not being displaced.
MedAssets will reuimmerse the staff in tools they have, and bring more tools to bear on the
process.

Director Golden inquired how many full time employees this will affect, and whether there are
executive sponsors for each of the areas.

Ms. Ryan replied that they have established a revenue cycle committee with executive oversight;
the people responsible for that are Mr. Small, Mr. Wright, herself, Judy Pinello (head of IS) and,
from the County, the County?s Chief Information Of?cer and the County?s Chief Financial
Of?cer. Additionally, they are establishing a number of committees and worksites. There are not
directors at every facility, but they are trying to get people around that level to work at every
facility.

Director O?Donnell inquired whether the County at present has enough positions to accomplish
the revenue collection.

Mr. Wright replied that there are enough positions, but that not enough of them are currently
?lled- They are augmenting this number with MedAssets staff, as well as resources from their
minoritynenterprise partners. He stated that he will come back to the Committee with exact
numbers at a later date.

Director O?Donnell inquired whether there is a system that MedAssets or the County is going to
put in place to make sure the appropriate data are collected.

Ms. Ryan replied that this information is already available in the clinical portion, but there is no
pathway for it to be pulled out in the claims area. Now, MedAssets has to work with Information
Technology to build this pathway.

Director Golden inquired whether we have implemented electronic medical recOrds at Provident
and Oak Forest HoSpitals and whether this will be an item that needs to be added to the budget for
2009 so that there can be System-wide interface between Siemens and Comer.

Mr. Wright replied that he was not sure. However, some of these issues are not technical issues;
they are people and process issues.

Director Muiioz inquired whether, because the Corner system can handle from front to end,
perhaps a hybridized system is not the correct way to go. Both the University of Illinois and
Northwestern use a Corner system.

Mr. Wright replied that when the admissionfdischarge functionality exists in a system other than
the patient accounting enterprise, it is problematic.

AUGUST 4, 2008

PAGE 9

Chairman Carvalho inquired whether provisions have been made to handle the larger number of
bill inquiries from patients that will occur if an increased number of bills are sent out.

Mr. Wright replied in the af?rmative.

Director Golden inquired whether MedAssets is surveying patient satisfaction.

Mr. Wright replied in the negative; this is very important, but they are not there yet.
Director O'Donnell inquired as to what is the Bureau?s Limit on Liability policy.

Mr. Small replied that this went through signi?cant re-engineering this past year. He stated that
he would be happy to provide this information to the Committee, including the sliding scale.

Director O'Donnell inquired as to whether the Limit on Liability policy has been cost-effective.
Additionally, she inquired into its administrative costs and whether the revenue collected offset
these costs.

Mr. Small offered to provide some estimate of that- From his perSpective, by offering service
with a smaller staff, shortcuts were taken and the overwhelming majority of the patients in the
self-pay category were defaulted to 100% discount without any effort to verify their eligibility;
eligibility was well-known to be merely a declaratory process.

Chairman Carvalho stated that this existing policy may need to be revisited.

Director O?Donnell inquired as to how MedAssets will interact with other vendors, and what
other vendors are responsible for.

Mr. Small replied that MedAssets will be reviewing this and make recommendations as to vendor
responsibilities to the Revenue Cycle Committee. Some contracts may be cancelled or
renegotiated.

Income Statement for the Six Months Ended
MW 31.; 2008

As of July-30.2008

Summary I

The ?nancial results ot?operations through the ?rst six months of the ?scal
year continue to be more favorable than planned in the original budget. The
favorable performance is due to the lower than expected expenses.

Expenses for all three of the hub facilities on a year to date basis are 1.7%
below the budget For expenses. This favorable level of expenses is somewhat
offset by a short fall in patient fee revenue of 15.8% and a decline in the
Inter-Governmental Transfer from the State of Illinois. The decline in the
IGT- is expected to be a total of$15,000,000 for the ?scal year and the May
income statement re?ects one half of that decline.

Operating Revenue

The System continues?to try to improve the level of collections from patient
fee revenue. The System has engaged a revenue cycle vendor to engage in
this process. The revenue cycle vendor has begun its work in June and
expects to provide an over-all plan for improvement early in its engagement.

The present collection rates suggest that the System will be approximately
$41,000,000 below the Budget by the end of the ?scal year. The primary
reason for the decline in expected patient fee revenue through the ?rst
portion of the year has been the increase in self pay patients and the decline
in Medicaid patients. The volume of services is above the budget for most
types of service. The payermix estimates for June indicate that the decline
in Medicaid and growth in self pay are beginning to return to more favorable
levels. 

Operating Expenses 

The year to date level of expenses at all three hub facilities is below the
approved budget as of the end of May. The System expenses for Supplies,
Purchased Services, and Utilities are signi?cantly below the Budget.

Salaries and Wages are also below the budget by a smaller margin. 

- Estimates for System are being used to try to present an accurate comparison
to the budget. The System is able through the payroll system to provide
accurate measurements of expense performance. There is an ongoing effort
to improve the accuracy of the estimates for the balance of the expenses of
the System.

Year to Date Expenses per Adjusted Patient Day

A comparison of expenses per unit of service at each of the three hub
facilities is as follows:

Category Stroger Oak Forest Provident

Salaries and Wages 1,832.10 1,850.95 1,894.24
Bene?ts 701.53 736.61 712.97
Supplies 415.38 . 303.17 329.54
Purchased Services 380.96 245.91 418.89
Depreciation 207.35 136.79 [07.17
Utilities 54.02 67.18 48.30
County services - - 16.05 16.48 80.85
Total 3,607.39 3,357.09 3,591.96

Non Operating Revenue

Non Operating Revenue is reported on a cash basis. The information is
obtained from the County Comptroller?s office. At the end of May Non
Operating Revenue was below the budget by 14.2% or $37,998,836. It is
expected that the collections of taxes will improve by the end of the ?scal
year. -
