 PERMIT REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT TO
COMMISSION ON CHICAGO LANDMARKS
June 6, 2013
The Permit Review Committee (PRC) met on May 2, 2013, at 10:00 a.m. The meeting was held
at 121 N. LaSalle, Room 1003A.
Present:

Ernest Wong, Chair
James Houlihan
Tony Hu (arrived at 10:25 a.m.)
Mary Ann Smith

Staff:

Dijana Cuvalo
Kandalyn Hahn
Cynthia Roubik
Lawrence Shure

The following projects were reviewed by the PRC:
1.

1531 N. Damen
(Wicker Park District – 1st Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed construction of an outdoor seating area and pick up window
including a new 9’ tall masonry wall and vestibule to conceal a proposed
walk-in cooler and dumpster area, new pass-through window on the
south (secondary) elevation of 1537 N. Damen, new 4’ decorative open
metal fence at northwest end of site.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The proposed 4’ fence shall be modified to match the design and
configuration of the existing wood planters (roughly 4’ in length, 1’ in
depth and 3’ in height) for consistency on the site;
2. As proposed, the 9’ masonry wall shall be painted with a breathable
coating to match the existing grey color of the Big Star Restaurant;
and,
3. Window details of the proposed “pass-through” window shall be
included in the permit plans. The window shall have a dark, nonreflective finish.

2.

1420 N. Hoyne
(Wicker Park District – 2nd Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed new construction of a 2½-story masonry single-family residence

 and rehabilitation and conversion of historic rear building into a garage.
Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The historic rear building built c. 1880s shall be rehabilitated as
proposed. Considering the historic development patterns of the district
which includes many examples of two buildings on a lot, and due to
the character of this specific property and the rear existing building, a
new building at the front of this lot is consistent with the architectural
character of the district and is approved as proposed per Environs
Development drawings dated 3/15/13 and revised on 4/11/13;
2. The new clad-wood double-hung windows on the east (front) façade of
the historic rear building shall be 2/2 configuration to match the
historic windows. Enlarged window and door details for the historic
rear building shall be included with permit application; and,
3. Material samples of face brick, common brick, roofing, and stone shall
be submitted for staff review and approval as part of the permit
application.

3.

2616-18 N. Milwaukee
(Logan Square Boulevards District – 35th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed two new 60’-long x 20’-tall signs on the south façade of an
existing 5-story masonry building.

Action:

The Committee reviewed the permit applications #100425032 and
#100425037 based on Article III of the Commission’s Rules and
Regulations, which includes “Standards and Criteria for Review of Permit
Applications”. At the meeting, the Committee voted unanimously to
adopt the following findings and to preliminarily disapprove the permit
applications:
A) Find that, pursuant to the Logan Square Boulevards Designation
Ordinance designating the Logan Square Boulevards District a
Chicago Landmark on November 1, 2005, the significant historical
and architectural features of the district are identified as “all exterior
building elevations, including rooflines, visible from public rights-ofway; historic coach houses and garages that contribute to the historic
character of the District…; and the landscaped boulevards and squares
within the [Logan Square Boulevards] District”; and,
B) Pursuant to Section 2-120-780 of the Landmarks Ordinance,
preliminarily find that the proposed signs would not meet the
Commission’s standards, guidelines, and criteria, and therefore would
adversely affect the Logan Square Boulevards District.

 4.

555 S. Dearborn
(Printing House Row District – 4th Ward)
Proposal:

Proposed addition to an existing penthouse atop a two-story masonry
building.

Action:

Approved unanimously with the following conditions:
1. The windows on the east and west elevations of the rooftop addition
shall be reconfigured to more closely correspond with the orientation
and proportions of existing 2nd floor windows;
2. The proposed rooftop addition exterior cladding shall have a
color/stain to match the existing building painted brick color; and,
3. The parapet height of the proposed addition shall be restudied
(lowered) to better align with the stringcourse of the adjacent building.
