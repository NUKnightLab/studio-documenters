A RESOLUTION DECLARING APRIL 2014 AS AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH
WHEREAS, April is Autism Awareness Month; and
WHEREAS, autism spectrum disorder is a neurological disorder characterized in varying degrees, by
difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors; and
WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released revised figures

autism since 2012 with
1 in 68 children currently diagnosed with autism; and
WHEREAS, autism is even more common among boys, affecting 1 in 42; and
WHEREAS, autism is the fastest growing developmental disability in the United States, affecting more
than three million people and it is an urgent public health crisis that demands national, state, and local
responses; and
WHEREAS, symptoms and characteristics of autism may present themselves in a variety of
combinations and can result in significant lifelong impairment of an
individual’s ability to learn,
develop healthy interactive behaviors, and understand verbal as well as nonverbal communication; and
WHEREAS, as the effort to address autism continues, doctors, therapists, and educators can help
persons with autism adjust to its challenges and provide early, accurate diagnosis, and the resulting
appropriate education, intervention, and therapy that are vital to future growth and development; and

Autism Speaks, Easter Seals, Misericordia, Best Buddies of Illinois, Helping Hand, Aspire, Community
Support Services, local special education classrooms, special recreation associations, and others; and
WHEREAS, at Brookfield Zoo, the Society has created innovative care kits for individuals with autism,

developmental and intellectual disabilities; and
WHEREAS, the Society has also focused programmatic resources on improving the lives of those
affected by autism by launching an innovative project to support early learners on the autism

WHEREAS, in the fall of 2013, the Society launched “Family Fun Saturdays at Brookfield Zoo,” in
partnership with Easter Seals to create inclusion and animal-centric experiences for early learners with
autism spectrum disorder; and
WHEREAS, this innovative project was based on recent research which found that the presence of an
animal can significantly increase positive social behaviors among children with autism and that inclusive
learning/experiential environments support the development of adaptive behavior and communication
for early learners with autism spectrum disorder; and
WHEREAS, inclusion-based and animal-centric activities were developed and facilitated by Easter
Seals therapists and Brookfield Zoo staff and volunteers to
address or even advance developmental
milestones for early learners with autism; activities sought to engage individuals in sensory, social, visual,
fine, and gross motor
skill development in an inclusive and nurturing environment; and
