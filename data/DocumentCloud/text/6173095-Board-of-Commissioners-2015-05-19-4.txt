 EXPLANATION
In July 2013, the Board of Commissioners approved the award of an agreement with Integrys Energy
Services, Inc. for the supply and delivery of electricity to various CHA residential sites and facilities for a
base period of two (2) years. The base term of the contract began on August 1, 2013 and will expire on
July 31, 2015.
The Electricity Supply and Delivery Agreement offers CHA the opportunity to purchase its electrical needs
at wholesale instead of retail, and enables the CHA to hedge against potential market price fluctuations
through use of multi-tiered price/risk management options.
The CHA is planning to utilize this contractual capability and current low pricing in the energy market to
lock in favorable electricity rates for two (2) one year periods in an effort to decrease our exposure to
market volatility.
Market indicators suggest that the current electricity commodity rates are expected to increase in the
next two years. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the CHA to present an extension option for two (2)
one year periods to the Board for authorization before the current base term of the contact is complete.
This will enable the CHA to lock in current rates for future usage, for up to two years; instead of waiting
for the expiration of the current term and only exercising a one year extension option at that time.
Under this contract, Constellation provides the supply and delivery of wholesale electricity to the Chicago
central utility gate. Com Ed then delivers this electricity to all CHA family, senior and scattered site
properties in the CHA traditional public housing portfolio. The CHA continues to utilize Com Ed for the
distribution of electricity from the Chicago’s central delivery gate to actual CHA buildings. The associated
local distribution costs are not included within the scope or budget of this contract and will continue to
be billed separately.
The CHA is recommending that the Board authorize the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to execute
an amendment to Contract #11319 with Constellation Energy Services, Inc., to exercise both the first and
second extension options reserved under the contract; extending the contract from August 1, 2015
through July 31, 2017. This amendment will also increase the existing not to exceed compensation
funding by an amount not to exceed $6,632,320.

amount not to exceed $6,632,320, resulting in a new aggregate compensation in an
amount not to exceed $15,332,320.
