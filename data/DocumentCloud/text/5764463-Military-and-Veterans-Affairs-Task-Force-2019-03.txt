RE: WILLIAM G. JOHNSON vs CITY OF DETROIT
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS
FILE 14374 (PSB)

On March 20, 2018, your Honorable Body authorized settlement of the wage loss portion
of the lawsuit of William G. Johnson vs City of Detroit, Department of Public Works; File 
14374 (PSB), in the amount 85,000.00. At that time, Medicare?s interest (pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 1395, et seq. and rules promulgated thereunder) had not been determined, and the medical
part of William G. ohnson?s workers compensation claim was not resolved.

The City can adequately address Medicare?s interests by purchasing an annuity for
$41,839.00 that will cover the cost of a Workers Compensation Set-Aside Arrangement
which was approved by the Center for Medicare Medicaid Services on
January 25, 2019.

We, therefore, request authorization to settle the medical part of this matter for the amount
of FORTY-ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY-NINE DOLLARS and
that your Honorable Body authorize and direct the Finance Director to issue drafts totaling that
amount payable to: Paci?c Life Insurance Company by Paci?c Life Annuity Services Inc. (Tax
ID 91-2025652), to fund the annuity, and to William G. Johnson as
seed money for the annuity, to be delivered upon receipt of properly executed releases and order
of dismissal in Workers Compensation Claim #143 74, approved by the Law Department.
