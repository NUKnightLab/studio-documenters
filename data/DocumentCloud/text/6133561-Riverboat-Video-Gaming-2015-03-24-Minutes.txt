DISCUSSION ON PENDING RIVERBOAT GAMBLING LEGISLATION
Caleb Melamed our Legislative Liaison presented the following remarks:
Land-based casinos: House Bill 3607 (Rep. Hays—assigned to House Executive Committee)
incorporates an Illinois Gaming Board (“IGB”) recommendation to the Governor. The bill
amends the Riverboat Gambling Act by explicitly authorizing land-based casinos. Currently, 4
out of the 10 Illinois casinos are located away from a natural body of water (Rivers Casino in
Des Plaines, Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Jumer’s Rock Island, and most recently Harrah’s
Metropolis). These casinos meet the water requirement by constructing shallow moats over their
gaming areas. The moats are expensive to build and maintain. Elimination of the water

 requirement will bring a substantial savings to these casinos. Casinos currently located on water
will feel financially freer to move to potentially more lucrative inland locations. The likely result
will be increased revenues to the State from casino gaming. House Bill 3170 (Rep. Harris) also
provides authority for land-based casinos.
Gaming Expansion:
House Bill 2939 (Rep. Rita—Assigned to House Executive Committee) does the following:
•

Creates a State-owned Chicago casino. The casino will have from 4,000 to 10,000
gaming positions (compared to a maximum of 1,200 gaming positions in existing Illinois
casinos).

•

Specifies distributions from the State Gaming Fund of revenues from the Chicago casino.

•

Prohibits political contributions by licensees under the Riverboat Gambling Act and
Video Gaming Act.

House Bill 3564 (Rep. Rita—Assigned to House Executive Committee) is a more extensive piece
of legislation which includes the following provisions:
•

Creates a State-owned Chicago casino with from 4,000 to 6,000 gaming positions.

•

Specifies distributions from the State Gaming Fund of revenues from the Chicago casino.

•

Creates new casinos in Winnebago, Lake, and Vermillion Counties and the South
Suburbs of Chicago.

•

Authorizes the IGB to license electronic gaming facilities in racetracks (“racinos”). All
Illinois racetracks except Fairmount in the Metro East area can apply for racinos.
Racetracks in Cook County can house up to 600 electronic gaming terminals, and those
outside Cook (i.e., Balmoral, which has filed for bankruptcy, and the currently dormant
Quad Cities Downs) can house up to 450 electronic gaming terminals.

•

Prohibits political contributions by licensees under the Riverboat Gambling Act and
Video Gaming Act.

At present, none of the above items of legislation are moving forward in the legislative process.
