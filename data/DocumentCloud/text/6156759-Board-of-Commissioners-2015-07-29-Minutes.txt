OF THE HONORABLE DONNA GERSON
WHEREAS, Donna Gerson represented the best qualities of citizenship and humanity through her lifelong
work as an elected official and community leader. She served as an Evanston Alderman, Library Trustee
and was active in politics her entire life. When she died on July l 0, 2015 she left behind a family, countless
friends and a community profoundly enriched for having known her; and
WHEREAS, Donna Gerson was born and raised in Akron, Ohio. She met her husband of over 61 years,
Stan Gerson during her first year oflaw school at Case Western Reserve. Both Donna and Stan took career
detours and left Akron for Chicago, and finally settled Evanston. She left the law for teaching and the two
settled in South Evanston where they raised their two children Lisa and Michael and became politically
involved in the movements promoting fair housing and school desegregation in addition to many other local
issues; and
WHEREAS, Donna Gerson had a lifelong interest in politics that began very early in life; she was a
selfdescribed "political junkie" who enjoyed discussing politics. When the Gersons were in their 40s, they
spent a year in London during her husband 's sabbatical. While there, Donna was exposed to a radio show
that interested her. When she returned, she pitched the idea of doing a similar program to WBEZ, Chicago's
Public radio station. Donna became a radio host of a program that featured interesting content from current
magazine articles; and
WHEREAS, Donna Gerson was an admired and longtime member of the League of Women Voters of
Evanston, generously supporting the organization for decades and tirelessly mentoring the organization' s
newest leaders; her generosity with her time was legendary. As a valued member of the League she worked
tirelessly, advocating for justice and equality for all. She was active on the North Shore Summer Project,
an open housing initiative and was a passionate supporter of Evanston' s school integration initiative. She
was also an extremely talented writer whose talents were put to good use when she became the editor of
the League's newsletter, The Intercom. She honed her leadership skills during her early League years and
it was with their strong support and encouragement that she ran and won a seat in Evanston' s City Council;

when she was elected by the voters of Evanston' s Ninth Ward to be their Alderman. She diligently
represented the ward from 1979 to 1983. She also served on Evanston's Zoning Board of Appeals. She
forged strong bonds with her fellow elected officials that outlasted their tenns of office and spanned
decades. They gathered once a month meeting socially to talk about everything from Evanston politics to
their grandchildren; and

WHEREAS, Donna was a lifelong learner who had a passion for poetry and loved, in particular
Shakespeare's sonnets. She attended classes at Northwestern University ' s Osher Lifelong Learning
Institute and later became a coordinator. Her appreciation for the written word and devotion to her
community was acknowledged and she was appointed to be an Evanston Library Trustee. There was no
better advocate for the Evanston Public Library. She served two tenns, and will long be remembered for
her work supporting the expansion of evening hours and the renovation of the aging Chicago Avenue
facility. She was also the voice of wisdom during the Youth Service Renovation Project of 2009 and for
successfully and diplomatically guiding the process when the library transitioned to a separate tax-levying
district; and

WHEREAS, Donna Gerson was a great champion of the principles of participatory democracy and was
innovative in her work to further those standards. She coupled her in-depth understanding of government

or commission which was published in Illinois Issues Magazine; and

Assistant to Commissioner Joanne Alter at the Chicago Metropolitan Water Reclamation District. Later
she became a management analyst at the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District and retired in 1993; and

WHEREAS, Donna Gerson was a cherished member of her synagogue, Beth Emet. The congregation has
a tradition of anonymously delivering food to ill or housebound members of the synagogue. Despite the
anonymous nature of the program, it was widely known that in many cases, the items had either been
prepared by Donna or delivered by her, or both. Few could match her culinary skills or thoughtfulness. She
was also a talented seamstress who learned to sew from a treasured aunt and frequently sewed her children's
clothing; and

WHEREAS, the community has lost a great friend in Donna Gerson and she will be sorely missed by her
two children Lisa Gerson and Michael Gerson but her loss will be felt most acutely by her husband of 61
years, Stan Gerson and her dear friends of over fifty years, a group of intrepid women known as the
" Quintessentials;" and

\VHEREAS, Donna Gerson possessed the unique combination of passionate political act1v1sm and
diplomacy. She regularly achieved her goals without rancor and, as a result was genuinely admired and
respected by her peers. She fonned and nurtured strong relationships with fellow elected officials and
friends that lasted over fifty years.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, on behalf
of the 5.2 million residents of Cook County commemorates the extraordinary life of Donna Gerson and

Summary: The additional time is needed to finalize the Disparity Study. The Study includes a
comprehensive statistical analysis based on the County's procurement history. The consultant collects,
sorts, researches and analyzes data gathered and will use a custom census methodology as recommended
in the National Disparity Study Guidelines, to accurately estimate minority-and women-owned business
enterprise (M/WBE) availability. Using these estimates, the Consultant will calculate a disparity index
using regression analysis. The Consultant is conducting three separate disparity studies due to the fact that
each agency (the County, Cook County Health and Hospitals System, and the Forest Preserve District) has
different procurement needs. The objective of the disparity study is to have statistically reliable data
relevant to each agency to validate its M/WBE program and ensure the programs are defensible in court, if

facility owners to complete a multitude of repair/maintenance and construction projects with a single,
competitively bid contract. The JOC process generally involves first selecting a pool of potential
contractors through a competitive procurement process, and then identifying projects for such selected
contractors.
The County has already completed a JOC competitive procurement process, and it has created the pool of
generated contractors to perform certain projects generally associated with Maintenance, repairs,
replacement and routine work.
The JOC program has an administrative component managed by the Gordian Group. The Gordian Group
maintains an area price book, which captures the prices for specific construction work items within this
region . JOC contractors bid against the prices included in the price book. The cost, therefore, of any work
performed by the contractor is a contractor markup fonn the price book. The Gordian Group would receive
5% administrative fee from Cook County based on the total project cost of the work. The Gordian Group
will manage the JOC process and will verify that all proposals and work are compliant with the terms and
conditions outlined in the JOC contract within the County.The Department of Capital Planning and Policy,
proposes to assign the projects listed below to the Gordian Group to share with participating JOC
contractors.

The Chief Procurement Officer concurs.

Summary: In collaboration with the Cook County Offices of the Assessor, Clerk, Treasurer, Board of
Review, and Recorder of Deeds, the Bureau of Technology seeks Board approval of a contract with
Tyler
Technologies, lnc. to replace the County' s legacy property tax system. The County currently employs
40-year-old technology to manage and implement tax collection across 1,500 taxing districts. The
system incurs more than $5M per year in support costs and depends upon inflexible and disparate legacy
systems, including paper-based validation of system reports. These costs are expected to increase as the
IT industry and future generations of IT professionals abandon the legacy technology upon which the
County' s property tax domain currently depends.
The proposed contract will re-engineer business processes and workflows through the implementation
of modern technology and provide myriad benefits, including increased property tax revenue from
improved assessment, appraisal, and collection operations, an improved ability to accommodate property
tax workloads without requiring additional staff, and enhanced public services and responsiveness for
County tax payers.
Request for Proposals (RFP) procedures were followed in accordance with the Cook County
Procurement Code. Tyler Technologies, Inc. was recommended based on established evaluation criteria.

A motion was made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, that this
Contract (Technology) be referred to the Technology and Innovation Committee. The motion
carried.

behavioral health, vocational and educational treatment services from community-based sources, such
as T ASC, combined with intensive court supervision. As of 3/31/2015, 106 participants have been
admitted into the program. The program has achieved a retention rate of 79 percent, well above the rate
of drug courts nationally, despite the challenging nature of the population. As the Designated State
Agency for court treatment programs as a condition of probation, T ASC is the only authorized contractor
and is uniquely qualified to act as an intennediary between the court system and the treatment
community.
This is a Sole Source Procurement pursuant to Section 34.-139 of the Cook County Procurement Code.

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Department: Clerk of the Circuit Court

Page 142 of 292

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 29, 2015

Request: Transfer of Funds
Reason: The transfer of funds is needed in order to provide additional encumbrance for professional
services of three I.T. programmers for Mainframe and .Net programming to assist with electronic filing,
imaging operations and the implementation of the Standard File Room Operating Procedures (SFROP)
Project.
From Account(s): 335-240, $40,759.00
To Account(s): 335-260, $40,759.00
Total Amount of Transfer: $40,759.00
On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
5/ 15/2015, $0.00, $2,300.00
How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 335-240, Printing and Publishing, was identified as the source of the transfer of funds to provide
additional encumbrance for professional services of three LT. programmers. This is because the
purchase of Personal Issue Traffic tickets for the City of Chicago and Suburban Traffic Tickets in 2014
with FY 20 14 funds, while awaiting the bid and award of a new traffic ticket contract, reduced the need
for a larger order of tickets in 20 15. The new contract was awarded and a purchase order was received
on 4/8/20 15. The order is currently in process and, therefore, additional tickets will not be needed until
FY 20 16, hence the availability of funds for the transfer.
Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from.
None
If the answer to the above question is "none" then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.

As a result of supplemen tal tickets ordered in 2014 with FY 20 14 funds, we anticipate an additional FY
2015 order for traffic tickets wi ll be less than previously anticipated, hence the ava ilabi lity of funds in
Account 335-240 for the transfer.

A motion was made by Commissioner Garcia, seconded by Commissioner Moore, that this
T ransfer of Funds be approved. T he motion carried.

PROPOSED ORDINANCE AMENDMENT
COOK COUNTY SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX
WHEREAS, just two short years ago, the President and the Cook County Board of Commissioners made
good on the pledge to taxpayers and businesses by repealing the last .25% of the so-called ' Stroger sales
tax'; and
W HEREAS, the decision and votes to cut taxes on everyday items a majority of residents need to help
working families, toothpaste, milk, baby form ula and other everyday necessities, was made as a means
of lessening the burden on them and stimulating the economy; and
WHEREAS, the tax rollback fulfilled a pledge we made to businesses that were concerned their
customers would buy goods outside Cook County and as such, not only benefited Cook County shoppers,
but also the retailers that serve them; and
WHEREAS, economic development also benefited as the tax climate is one of the many variables that
businesses consider when deciding where to create jobs; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

July 29, 2015

WHEREAS, the cumulative effect of the sales tax rollback yielded roughly $440 million in annual
savings for taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, a sales tax is recognized as an inherently regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the
least fortunate among us; and
WHEREAS, the same arguments and reasoning used to gather support and passage of the rollback of
the regressive sales tax are just as valid today as they were then; and
WHEREAS, the recent decision to reinstate the I% sales tax increase in its entirety restores these same
burdens on Cook County residents, families and businesses that compelled the Board to roll back this
tax in the first place; and
WHEREAS, given that the proposed 2016 budget has yet to be introduced, raising the sales tax was a
premature burdening of our taxpayers with hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes each and every
year into perpetuity; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this action, Cook County consumers and visitors are facing a nation-leading
sales tax of between 10.25 percent and 11 .25 percent. The highest rate, 11.25 percent, would be paid by
consumers in the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority area, which makes up most of the City of
Chicago' s core; and
WHEREAS, this access to a massive influx of new taxpayer dollars will only serve to lessen pressure
on the administration of the President and on the Board to continue to seek ways to improve the
efficiency, transparency and operations of Cook County government; and
WHEREAS, in order to preserve the impetus and maintain the pressure to continue to refonn county
government and reaffinn that there is more that needs to be done, and done soon, this Honorable Body
should take a proactive approach and commit to roll back this most recent sales tax increase;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners, that Chapter
74, TAXATION, ARTICLE V. - SERVICE OCCUPATION TAX, Sections 74-190 through 74-192 of

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
RESOLUTION URGING GOVERNOR RAUNER TO SUPPORT ROSELAND COMMUNITY
HOSPITAL BY IMMEDIATELY RELEASING FULL FUNDING-AND SUPPORTING
CONTINUED FULL FUNDING IN THE STATE BUDGET-TO ALLOW THE INSTITUTION
TO
CONTINUE PROVIDING VITAL AND LIFE-SA YING SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY
WHEREAS, Roseland Community Hospital has been a life-saving anchor for 90 years, serving a
community that is over 98% African-American and that suffers a poverty rate that is nearly 1.8 times
that of the Illinois state average-and an extreme poverty rate more than double the state average.
WHEREAS, Roseland Community Hospital is located in a healthcare desert and the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services has designated it as serving a medically underserved area/population, and
as a primary care, mental health and dental health professional shortage area.
WHEREAS, should Roseland Community Hospital be forced to close due to the current funding crisis,
residents would have to travel five miles to the next closest hospital, Advocate Trinity, and nearly eight
miles to the nearest trauma center, Advocate Christ, putting residents with life-threatening conditions at
a greatly increased risk of death or negative health outcome.
WHEREAS, past funding shortfalls and the current state budget crisis have already decimated vital
support programs in the Roseland community, leaving Roseland Community Hospital as the only
institution still standing from which residents can receive life saving care and support.
WHEREAS, the Rauner administration has chosen to stop payments to Roseland Community Hospital,
including both State and Federal Medicaid funding, despite public appeals by the community and
community advocates that the administration continue these life-saving payments.
WHEREAS, without such payments, Roseland Community Hospital is at immediate risk of layoffs,
service shutdowns and institutional closure.
WHEREAS, despite the intervention ofa Federal judge ordering the continued flow of Federal Medicaid
funding the the institution, Roseland Community Hospital continues to face the risk of closure, and its

Page 280 of 292

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

residents an increased risk of death and devastating health outcomes, due to the lack of current state
funding and the threat of funding cuts in the state budget currently being negotiated .

WHEREAS, the refusal of the Rauner administration and the state legislature to seek out progressive
revenue solutions greatly increases the risk that Roseland Community Hospital will face continued
funding shortages in the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners calls upon
Governor Bruce Rauner to release all necessary funds to keep Roseland Community Hospital fully
funded for the present-and for the Governor and the state legislature to fully fund the hospital in the
upcoming budget through progressive revenue-so that the hospital is able to continue to provide vital
services to the community.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be presented to the Secretary of State of
the State of Illinois, the Clerk of the House of the Illinois House of Representatives, and the Secretary
of the Senate of the lllinois Senate.

A motion was made by Commissioner Sims, seconded by Commissioner Garcia, that this

real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction in the level of assessment from
the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been completed, or in the case of abandoned property
from the date of substantial re-occupancy. Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at I 0% of the
market value for I 0 years, 15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
