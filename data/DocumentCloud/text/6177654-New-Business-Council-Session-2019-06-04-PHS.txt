At the end of the deferral period, the owner must contact this department to arrange an inspection to evidence that conditions of the deferral

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF FORMER 2017 SENATE BILL 363

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

WHEREAS,

RESOLVED,

RESOLVED,

May 23, 2019

The mission of the Detroit City Council is to promote the economic, cultural and
physical welfare of Detroit?s citizens through Charter-mandated legislative
functions; and

In 2017, in its wisdom the Michigan State Senate, approved Senate Bill 363, the
?Michigan Mined Preference Bill,? by an overwhelming 36-2 margin.
Unfortunately however, after being referred to Michigan State House Committee
on Commerce and Trade, the bill unceremoniously died in the State House; and

Senate Bill 363 was drafted to require the Michigan Department of Technology,
Management, and Budget, to give a preference of 8% of the amount of a contract
to Michigan-based ?rms for products mined in the State, against a bidder that was
not a Michigan-based ?rm and was located outside of the United States, by
amending the Management and Budget Act, PA 431 of 1984 (MCL 18.1261); and

One product that the State purchases is road salt, and the Detroit Salt Company is
a supplier that provides the salt from its mine located in Detroit. However, there
are Canadian salt mining operations that are exporting their product to Michigan
and are unfairly undercutting the Detroit Salt Company?s price; and

The Detroit Salt Company is a roughly 100-year?old mining company that operates
the Detroit Salt Mine, one of approximately 15 salt mines in the entire United States
and the only one in Michigan. The Detroit Salt employs around 60 people, and it
produces approximately 1 million tons of salt per year. Based on its revenue from
taxes, supplier and other ancillary jobs, etc., the Detroit Salt Company has a positive
economic impact on both the local and State economies; NOW THEREFORE BE
IT

The Detroit City Council, as an advocate of the ef?cient use of tax payer dollars,
and a strong supporter of Detroit based and headquartered company, expresses its
unwavering support of a bill drafted in the spirit of former 2017 Senate Bill 363
and for its passage by both houses of the legislature; NOW THEREFORE BE IT
FINALLY

That this resolution be forwarded to the City of Detroit?s Lansing Lobbyist, the
Detroit Delegation in Lansing and the Governor.

RE: Rodent Mitigation Plan

 

Pursuant to your request for Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department
(B SEED) to address your concerns regarding a plan for Rodent Mitigation Plan, for the residents
near the Brush Street 1-94 overpass construction, we submit the following:

The site runs from Brush Street to French Road along a three mile stretch of 1-94. To conduct an
area-wide rodent mitigation in an area this large would not be the best use of our staff and would

quickly exhaust our rodent bait supply.

The better option is to encourage citizens to report increased rodent activity that they notice for
their individual properties to Environmental Control at 313-876-0426. Typically, when a rodent
investigation is conducted, the inspector will inspect the property where the complaint came from,
properties on either side of the complainant, and the three properties behind the
complainant. Wherever a heavy infestation is found, additional staff and supplies can be called in

to address it.

If there are any questions regarding this matter, do not hesitate to contact me.

RE: 36th District Court Parking

 

In consultation With the 36th District Court regarding its budget priorities, my
of?ce became aware of signi?cant parking challenges experienced by Court
employees and visitors. Generally, Court employees and visitors are having a
dif?cult time ?nding affordable parking in the area. This has caused the Court to
subsidize parking for its employees, provide same-day cash payments to jurors,
and cancel dockets on game days, all in an effort to help mitigate the adverse
impact that parking has on the Court?s operations.

I am requesting that the Administration work with my of?ce and the Court to
determine if there are any alternative parking solutions for the Court?s visitors
and employees, including but not limited to off-site parking at City-controlled
facilities with shuttle options.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact DeAndree
Watson of my of?ce at (313) 224?0278.
