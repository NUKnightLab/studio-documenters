EDWARD M. MOODY, STANLEY MOORE, SEAN M. MORRISON, DEBORAH SIMS,

URGING CONGRESS TO PROTECT ACCESS TO QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
PROVIDED TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND THOUSANDS OF COOK COUNTY
RESIDENTS BY THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
WHEREAS, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly called the Affordable Care Act
(“ACA”) was adopted in 2010 to dramatically reduce the number of uninsured Americans and improve
overall public health for the American people; and
WHEREAS, the ACA protects our working families against health insurance discrimination and denial for
pre-existing conditions, provides subsidies to working families to offset the cost of health insurance,
incentivizes states to expand Medicaid coverage for the working poor, and requires coverage of basic family
health care needs in health insurance plans; and
WHEREAS, the Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”), the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency, estimated
that between 2010-2019 the ACA would yield a projected reduction in the Country’s deficits of more than
$150 billion over that period; and
WHEREAS, the ACA, over the last six (6) years, has cut the overall uninsured rate in the United States
from 15.7% to 8.6% and, among those ages 18-64, from 22.3% to 11.9%, and reduced the number of
uninsured at our County health system from 70% to 30%; and
WHEREAS, thanks to the ACA, more than 1 million people in Illinois get insurance through the ACA
marketplace or the expansion of Medicaid, and through CountyCare, the Cook County Health and Hospital
System (“CCHHS”) which provides 140,000 Medicaid recipients with health care coverage, a number that
could double in 2018; and
WHEREAS, the repeal of ACA would lead to a significant negative economic impact for Illinois as the
Illinois Health and Hospital Association predicted the state could lose as much as $11.6 billion to $13.1
billion in annual economic activity, translating into a potential loss of 84,000 to 95,000 jobs, if Congress
and President Trump repeal coverage for those 1 million people without a viable and comprehensive
replacement plan; and
WHEREAS, thanks in large part to the ACA, the Cook County Health and Hospitals System (“CCHHS”)
has been able to reduce its reliance on the annual taxpayer allocation by more than $370 million due to the
ACA and Medicaid expansion, a 75 percent decrease in local tax support since 2009, from $481 million to
$111.5 million; and
WHEREAS, should the ACA be repealed or severely diminished, the annual loss of revenue for care
provided by the Cook County Health & Hospitals System may likely exceed $300 million annually and
could be as high as $800 million. Additionally, other hospitals and providers in Cook County would stand
10

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 13, 2017

to lose more than $300 million in reimbursements from our CountyCare Health Plan, which is on top of the
hundreds of millions more dollars lost from other Medicaid health plans, and cuts mentioned in ACA repeal
proposals thus far are unsustainable, unfair, callous and would require increased state or local revenues to
meet the needs of the uninsured in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, a significant increase in the uninsured rate and amount of uncompensated care in the County
and the region due to the loss of health insurance coverage for working families because of any repeal of
the ACA would undermine the “patient mix” of the CCHHS, reducing the financial success of the system
and diminishing the quality of life of our residents; and
WHEREAS, the Republican-led Congress has made repeated efforts to repeal parts or all of the ACA, with
the Senate recently passing the elimination of the individual mandate, a central tenet of the ACA that health
policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work; and
WHEREAS, the CBO reported that repealing said mandate would increase the number of uninsured by 13
million by 2027 and that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over the
next decade in the individual market created by the Affordable Care Act; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners, believes that access to quality, affordable health
care is a human right, not a privilege, and is essential to the quality of life of families and individuals in
Cook County and everywhere throughout our country; and
WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of our federal, state and local officials to defend the issues and interests
of their constituents, including advocating for access to quality, affordable health care coverage provided
for by the Affordable Care Act.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners
oppose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with any alternative that would not improve
access to quality, affordable health care for all of our residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of Commissioners oppose
any measure that results in a loss of health insurance coverage by any American, weakens the ACA’s
protection against health insurance discrimination or denial based on preexisting conditions, reduces the
ACA’s subsidies to individuals for buying health care, or reduces the incentives for states to cover
individuals through expanding Medicaid; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County urges the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Illinois
General Assembly, the Governor and members of the general public to oppose and resist any weakening of
the protections of the Affordable Care Act for working families; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution be sent to the President of the United
States, U.S. Speaker of the House, U.S. Senate Majority Leader, U.S. House Minority Leader, U.S. Senate
Minority Leader, the Illinois Congressional Delegation, Governor of Illinois, President of the Illinois
Senate, and Speaker of the Illinois House.

REQUESTING TO PRESENT AN ADVISORY PUBLIC QUESTION
VIA A COUNTYWIDE REFERENDUM TO COOK COUNTY VOTERS
ON WHETHER THE STATE OF ILLINOIS SHOULD LEGALIZE, REGULATE AND TAX
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA USE FOR ADULTS 21 AND OVER
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Illinois Election Code, 10 ILCS 5/28-1, et seq., and the Counties Code, 55
ILCS 5/5-1005.5, the corporate authorities of a county have the authority to submit a public question to the
electors of the county by means of a referendum; and
WHEREAS, despite spending more than $1 trillion over the last 40 years, the efforts of the “War on
Drugs”, the health and social costs of drugs increase every year, drugs are no less available than before, and
treatment is not available to the vast majority of people who need it; and
WHEREAS, existing evidence from other states and countries show there is no indication that
decriminalization or legalization of marijuana leads to a measurable increase in its use; and
WHEREAS, eight (8) states and Washington, D.C. have already legalized the recreational use of
marijuana; and
WHEREAS, marijuana-related arrests in every Cook County municipality, including Chicago, result in
staggering costs to Cook County government by virtue of the necessary involvement of the County jail,
Sheriff’s department, State’s Attorney, Clerk of the Court, judiciary, and often times, the Public Defender,
annually costing Cook County taxpayers tens of millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, most arrests for marijuana possession do not lead to trials or prison terms. Instead, a large
number of these arrests are plea-bargained, continued without a finding, dismissed, or otherwise handled in
a manner that places unnecessary burdens on already-limited criminal justice system resources; and
WHEREAS, as Illinois and Cook County continually face severe budget and financial constraints and
lawmakers repeatedly face the undesirable choice of deciding between increasing taxes or substantial
service cuts, or both, creating an intelligent, practical framework of cannabis legalization, regulation and
taxation can help address a myriad of problems such as improved health and public safety, reduced criminal
justice and jail costs, law enforcement efficacy, black market drug displacement as well as increased
revenue for education and treatment protocols; and
WHEREAS, legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana use for adults 21 and over and would
have an estimated revenue impact of $350 to $699 million at the state level and would also have a positive
multi-million dollar impact for Cook County via sales tax proceeds and other public and private revenue
streams; and

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 13, 2017

WHEREAS, a recent 2017 Gallup poll has shown that 64% of Americans are in favor of legalizing
marijuana; and
WHEREAS, a recent 2017 poll conducted by the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute finds that two-thirds
of Illinois voters, support or strongly support legalization of recreational marijuana if it is taxed and
regulated like alcohol, and in Chicago, 74 percent of voters support or strongly support legalization of
marijuana while in suburban Cook and the collar counties support or strong support is at 70 percent; and
WHEREAS, 55 ILCS 5/5-1005.5 states, “By a vote of the majority of the members of the county board,
the board may authorize an advisory question of public policy to be placed on the ballot at the next regularly
scheduled election in the county.”; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners seeks to place an advisory public question before
the electorate via a referendum on the March 20, 2018, countywide ballot seeking to ask Cook County
residents if they are in favor of legalizing, regulating and taxing recreational marijuana use for adults 21
and over in Illinois, as follows:
“Shall the State of Illinois legalize the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, testing, and sale of
marijuana and marijuana products for recreational use by adults 21 and older subject to state
regulation, taxation and local ordinance?"
[ ] Yes
[ ] No
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that this Board
present the aforementioned question to the electorate via a countywide advisory referendum on the March

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

Department: Bureau of Finance
Other Part(ies): Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Cook County (the “Pension Fund”), 33 North
Dearborn, Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60602
Request: We respectfully submit for your approval the attached FY 2018 Intergovernmental Agreement
(FY 2018 IGA) between the County and the Pension Fund relative to an additional appropriation of
$353,436,000.00, above the amount anticipated to be contributed by way of the County’s real-estate tax
levy.
Goods or Services: This proposed FY 2018 IGA, already approved by the Pension Fund, reflects the
undertaking made by the County Board and the County Board President when the decision was made to
increase the County’s sale tax by 1%, relative to the contribution of a portion of sales tax revenues to the
Pension Fund as appropriated by the County Board of Commissioners.
Agreement Number(s): N/A
Agreement Period: 12/31/2017 - 11/30/2018.
Fiscal Impact: 12/31/2017 in the amount of $25,000,000. Subsequent disbursements of the Additional
Funds shall be made as follows: $25,000,000 on or before the last day of the month during January
through October of 2018; and $78,436,000 on or before 11/30/2018.
Accounts: 1490- 580033
Summary: This proposed FY 2018 IGA, already approved by the Pension Fund, reflects the undertaking
made by the County Board and the County Board President when the decision was made to increase the
County’s sale tax by 1%, relative to the contribution of a portion of sales tax revenues to the Pension Fund
as appropriated by the County Board of Commissioners. This proposed FY 2018 IGA will terminate, by
its terms, on 11/30/2018. Except for revisions associated with the total amount of the additional
contribution and the payment schedule, this proposed FY 2018 is substantively identical to the FY 2017
IGA. For example, under Section Six, the additional contribution in FY 2018 will be limited in use to
reduce the Pension Fund’s unfunded liabilities. In addition, during FY 2018 the Pension Fund will provide
relevant information to the Board of Commissioners, including information associated with its actuarial
status and its relative investment performance.

A motion was made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, that the

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

(i) Public testimony. The Board encourages public participation in the legislative process. To preserve order
and decorum and in the interest of efficiency, the presiding officer may impose time and subject matter limits
on public comment or testimony. The following rules shall apply at any meeting of the Board and its
committees at which public comment or testimony is taken:
Subject to the provisions herein, public testimony will be permitted at regular and special meetings of the
Board.
(1)

Authorization as a public speaker shall only be granted to those individuals who have
submitted in writing, their name, address, subject matter, and organization (if any) to the
Secretary 24 hours in advance of the meeting. Duly authorized public speakers shall be
called upon to deliver testimony at a time specified in the meeting agenda. Public testimony
must be germane to a specific item or items (s) on the meeting agenda, and the testimony
must not exceed three minutes; the Secretary will keep track of the time and advise when
the time for public testimony has expired. Persons authorized to provide public testimony
shall not use vulgar, abusive or otherwise inappropriate language when addressing the
Board. Failure to act appropriately; failure to speak to an item that is germane to the
meeting, or failure to adhere to the time requirements may result in expulsion from the
meeting and/or disqualify the person from providing future testimony.

(2) Disruptions of meetings are prohibited. Disruptions include, but are not limited to:
a.

Speech by an individual after expiration of the time allotted for the speaker's public
comment or testimony;

b.

Speech by an individual that is not germane to a specific item or items on the meeting
agenda;

c.

Speech by an individual who has not been recognized by the presiding officer for
public comment or testimony, who is speaking in a volume louder than a low,
conversational level appropriate for communication between persons seated next to
each other in the chamber, or whose speech is audible by others; or

d.

Holding or placing a banner or sign during a meeting in a way that may endanger
other individuals or that obstructs the free passage or view of others attending or
viewing the meeting.

Verbal comments must be conducted in respectful speech with no personal attacks.
(3)

If an individual engages in disruption of the meeting, including but not limited to any of the
actions described above, the presiding officer may rule the individual out of order, direct the
individual to cease the activity and impose other reasonable conditions for the individual's
continued presence at the meeting. If the individual does not immediately comply with the
presiding officer’s order, the presiding officer may direct the removal of the individual from
the meeting. Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, any individual ordered to be
removed from a meeting is excluded from returning to that meeting, unless the decision of
the presiding officer is overruled by a majority vote of those members in attendance. Any
138

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

December 13, 2017

two members may place before the body the question of whether to permit the individual to
return to the same meeting.
(4)

(5)

If an individual is removed either from two or more committee meetings within a fifteen day
period or from two or more consecutive meetings of the Board, the Board President may
exclude the individual from participation in public comment or testimony periods at future
Board or committee meetings.
a.

The Board President shall notify the individual in writing of the type of exclusion,
the specific reasons for the exclusion and the specific terms and length of the
exclusion.

b.

The notice of exclusion shall advise that the individual may submit written
comments to the Clerk for distribution to the Board members at future public
comment or testimony periods.

c.

The notice of exclusion shall be filed with the Clerk, who shall post it on the door to
the Board chambers and on the Board’s web page, provide a copy of the notice to
Board members and mail the notice to the individual's last known address, if any.
The notice is effective when posted. The exclusion order shall remain posted on the
door to the chambers for the duration of the exclusion period.

In determining the scope and length of an individual's exclusion allowed under subsection (i)
of this section 2-105, the Board President may consider the seriousness of the disruptions to
the orderly conduct of the meeting, the number of disruptions in which the individual
participated and other reasons deemed relevant by the President.
a.

The Board President may issue an exclusion from future participation in public
comment or testimony periods for up to twenty-eight calendar days.

b.

At the next regular meeting of the Board, following the filing and posting of the
exclusion notice, the exclusion order may be overruled or modified by a majority
vote of those Commissioners in attendance. Any two members may place before the
body the question of whether to overrule or modify the exclusion decision.

(6) Any individual excluded from participation in future public comment or testimony periods may appeal the
exclusion by submitting a written appeal to the Clerk within five calendar days after the exclusion notice is
posted. The Clerk shall distribute copies of the appeal to all Board members. The Board shall consider the
appeal at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting if any two members place it before the body. The
individual's exclusion from public comment or testimony periods shall remain in effect during the Board’s
consideration of the appeal.
