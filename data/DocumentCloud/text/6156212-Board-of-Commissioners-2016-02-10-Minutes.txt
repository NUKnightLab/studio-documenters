ROBERT B. STEELE AND J EFFREY R. TOBOLSKI , CO UNTY COMM ISSION ERS
COMMEMORATING TH E EXC EPTIONAL LIFE, CO URAG EO US SPIRIT AND
GENEROSITY OF WA LTER REED
WH EREAS , Walter Reed died at the age of91 having lived a remarkable life that was touched by the
deepest sadness and the greatest joy. He was a successful businessman, an inspiring author and speaker,
and a tireless advocate for those who struggled with special needs. While he never forgot the anti-Semitism
he faced in Gennany that killed his family, or the prejudice that led him to change his name and hide his
past for 50 years he had a strong desire to never be a prisoner of the past; and
WHEREAS, Walter Reed was born Werner Rindsberg in Germany in 1924 and spent his early childhood
in Bavaria. In June 1939, his family put him on a train for Brussels as part of a children' s refugee rescue
program . Eventually he made his way to La Hille, France, where he and 100 other Jewish children were
hidden from the Gennans, barely surviving at an abandoned French estate called Chateau de La Hille. He
was able to leave France in 1941 for New York, where hi s mother had relatives, however, his parents and
siblings perished during the Holocaust; and
WHEREAS, when Walter Reed arrived in New York he became an apprentice to a tool-and-die maker and
enrolled in high school. In 1943, when he was 19, he was drafted into the army. The anny offered U.S.
citizenship and Walter changed his name as part of that process. He shed his Gennan name of Werner
Rindsberg along with his German accent. He worked at Allied headquarters in Paris as a Gennan translator
who assisted with prisoner interrogation. One of his assignments was the denazification of the university at
Marburg. Despite having only a high school education, he played a major role in deciding which of the
eminent faculty could teach. After the Gennan surrender he served in the Counter Intelligence Corps which
had the task of denazifying the Germans; and

WHEREAS, after the war, Walter Reed attended the University of Missouri where he received a degree in
journalism and worked successfully for many years in the public relations field. He settled in Chicago and
worked for decades as the public relations director of the National Automatic Merchandising Association,
the national organization of vending-machine businesses. Walter and his wife Jeanne moved to Wilmette
where they raised three sons Brian, Andrew and McRae; and
WHEREAS, following the birth of their first son, Brian, who was born with cerebral palsy, Walter Reed
became a special needs advocate. He spoke publicly about his son's condition and about how people treat
the disabled, and in 1977 he became one of 16 Illinois delegates to the White House Conference on Persons
With Disabilities. In the mid-80s he began a nine-year tenn on the board of directors of the Anixter Center,
a service agency helping people with disabilities in the Chicago region, and he cofounded and served as the
first president of the Parents Alliance of the Northern Suburban Special Education District; working closely
with the local school district. In recognition for his tireless work the District 39 Educational Foundation
presented him with the 2010 Distinguished Citizen Award; and
WHEREAS, Walter Reed retired in 1989 and started a consulting business. After he read a Chicago
Tribune article about Steven Spielberg's foundation collecting oral histories from Holocaust survivors he
shared his story with Spielberg' s Shoah project. Afterwards, Walter Reed traveled with his family back to
France. He learned that the owner of the barn where he had lived for ten months was still alive and that 90

out of the I00 now-grown Children of La Hille had been holding regular reunions. He organized a reunion
in Wilmette in 1998 and later wrote a well-reviewed 2015 book, "The Children of La Hille: Eluding Nazi
Capture During World War II," describing how he and the other Jewish boys and girls from 4 to 18 years
old survived part of the war in France; and
WHEREAS for many years Walter Reed never revealed the truth about his past to his friends or coworkers.
But the struggles of his formative years quietly inspired the activism of his later years. He spent his life
opposing discrimination. "The activism on behalf of the disabled grows out of the sense that if good citizens
don't take part in the life of their country, bad things will flourish. To me, it's not just the Nazis. It's
Cambodia. It's Ethiopia. It's burning books or forbidding books to be read, because I remember when the
Nazis burned books and kicked out artists they didn't like."; and
WHEREAS, Walter Reed was a treasured member of the Wilmette Harbor Rotary Club. He was the weekly
newsletter editor for many years. He was involved with the Vocational Service Committee and was
instrumental in initiating involvement with local adults with serious mental/physical challenges. He and his
wife, Jeanne, were also active in the Club's Youth Exchange program as host parents. One of the
organization ' s traditions was to have members to share their stories. He had been active with the
organization working alongside people for years who thought they knew him but they were surprised to
hear of his fleeing the Nazis; and
WHEREAS, Walter Reed spent nearly his entire life in service to others in one way or another. He served
on the Boards of the Chicago Metropolitan Planning Council and the Anixter Center. He was a nineteenyear Rotarian and was active with the Illinois Holocaust Museum. fn 2015 he was appointed to the village
of Wilmette' s Housing Our Own Wilmette board of directors; and
WHEREAS, Walter Reed was a tireless advocate up until his last moment despite having had a serious
heart attack in the l 980' s. He regularly gave speeches about his life; he called it "The Triumph of the
Human Spirit." He chose that title because "even in the darkest times and the most horrible situations,
humans can rise and do rise above the circumstances.

URGING THE ILLINOIS STA TE LEGISLATURE TO RESTORE COOK COUNTY' S 12MONT H G RACE PERIOD BEFORE PROPERTIES ARE OFFERED TO TAX BUYERS
WHEREAS, second installment Cook County property taxes are due in early August each year; and
WHEREAS, taxpayers historically have had until August of the following year before the Cook County
Treasurer was required to offer their unpaid taxes for sale to tax buyers; and
WHEREAS, tax buyers "purchase" the unpaid taxes at annually held tax sales. In exchange for fronting
the money, tax buyers also buy a guarantee that indebted property owners will either repay them the full
tax amount plus fees and interest, or else tax buyers have a right-two years later-to take title to the property;
and

Page 49 of241

 Board of Commissioners

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS

February 10, 2016

Wll EREAS, as the law stands today, taxpayers will lose two months of the cun-ent twel ve-month grace
period for tax year 2014 (tax sale June 20 16 instead of August 20 16); they will lose two additional months
for tax year 20 15, and lose fou r add itional months for tax year 2016. In tax year 20 16 and in subsequent
years, tl/.\payers will hm•e only four months after the due date to pay their taxes i11 full before their taxes
are offered to tax buyers; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Treasurer cun-ently receives 1.5% interest per month on delinquent taxes;
and
WH E R EAS, the Cook County Treasurer estimates that the aggregate loss of tax sale revenue to Cook
County over the next three years alone will be $84 million. Specifically, in tax year 201 4 when the sale is
two months earlier the County is estimated to lose $12 million in revenue; in tax year 20 15 when the sale
is four mo nths earlier the County is estimated to lose $24 million in revenue; and in tax year 2016 when the
sale is eight months earlier the County is estimated to lose $48 million in revenue; and
WHEREAS, the property tax burden on Chicago residents and on all Cook County residents continues to
rise even without this change; and
WHEREAS, although having more taxes auctioned would bring revenues more quickly to tax ing districts,
this accelerated schedule comes at the expense of taxpayers and benefits tax buyers the most; and
WHEREAS, Cook County taxpayers deserve more than four months to pay their taxes before they are
offered to tax buyers.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners contact state
legislators and urge them to restore the tax sale schedule' s twelve-month grace period, the way it has been
in the past; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that a copy of this Resolution be distributed to the Illinois State
Legislature.

Summary: This proposed amendment exercises the first year renewal option available in the Cook
County contract with Sentinel Offender Services, LLC for electronic monitoring and Global Positioning
System (GPS) services for the Adult Probation Department and Juvenile Probation and Court Services
Department minor and adult clients who are ordered by the court to wear electronic monitoring devices.
Sentinel provides GPS monitoring equipment and services for adult probationers and pretrial defendants
in order to comply with Public Act 95-0773, also known as the Cindy Bischof Law, which calls for the
monitoring of certain domestic violence offenders through GPS technology. The law allows the court to
order adults charged with certain domestic violence offenses to be monitored electronically by the Adult
Probation Department Home Confinement Unit as a condition of bail or probation. Offenders are ordered
to wear a GPS tracking device to help monitor compliance with orders to stay away from the
complaining witness, the complaining witness 's home/workplace, or any other protected address
specified. There are currently more than I 70 adults under GPS monitoring and 80 victims who carry GPS
devices to create mobile exclusion zones. Effective on 1/1/20 I 5, new legislation (Public Act 98-10 I 2,
725 ILCS 5/ 110-5) significantly expanded the types of charges required to be considered for GPS
monitoring as a condition of bail.
GPS technology is also used by the Juvenile Probation and Court Services Department to monitor
high-risk minors in home confinement as an alternative to secure detention or as a condition of release
into the community. These devices are deployed at various points of the judicial process from
pre-adjudication through post-dispositional stages of court proceedings. There are currently more than
230 court-involved youth under GPS electronic surveillance.
The contract was awarded through the Request for Proposals (RFP) process in accordance with the Cook
County Procurement Code. Sentinel Offender Services, LLC. was awarded this contract based on
established evaluation criteria.

A motion was made by Commissioner Garcia, seconded by Commissioner Moore, that this Contract
