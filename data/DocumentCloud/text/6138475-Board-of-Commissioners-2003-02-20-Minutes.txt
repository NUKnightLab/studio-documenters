WHEREAS, Almighty God, in His infinite wisdom, has called Chicago's "Matriarch," Eleanor " Sis"

WHEREAS, she married the future mayor of Chicago, Richard J. Daley, in 1936; they had seven
children: Patricia, Mary Carol, Eleanor, Richard, Michael, John and William; and
WHEREAS, as a devout Roman Catholic, like her husband, Mrs. Daley strongly believed in what we

with family; in keeping with this philosophy, she devoted her energies toward raising her children and
being a source of unwavering support for her husband; and
WHEREAS, although she was an unrelenting source of support of her husband and family, Mrs. Daley
was not afraid to speak her mind ; a classic example was her strong stance on preserving our city's
beautiful architecture such as the old Chicago Public Library's central branch, which was built in 1897
and ultimately became the glorious Chicago Cultural Center; and
WHEREAS, with the passing of Mrs. Daley, we have lost an elegant, understated and proud woman, a
woman who was committed to her family, championed issues that were important to her, and loved this
city to her final moments with us; she truly was Chicago' s Matriarch.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners, on behalf
of the more than five million residents of Cook County, does hereby express its deepest condolences and
most heartfelt sympathy to the family as well as the many friends and loved ones of Eleanor "S is" Daley.

the payment be processed as indicated on the payment voucher. The office has conferred with this vendor
and sub-contractors and are confident a similar lag in billing will not occur again.

Nursing shortage at Stroger and Cem1ak Hospitals.

Following the Roll Call, Chairman Maldonado stated that the purpose of this meeting is to address the
shortage of nurses in the Stroger and Cennak Hospitals of Cook County.
Chairman Maldonado stated that he had met with the Presidents of the Puerto Rican Nurses Association
and the Puerto Rican Practical Nurses Association to explore the extent of the nursing shortage in Puerto
Rico. Their research revealed that Puerto Rico, in fact, has a surplus of nurses. Based on that
information, Chainnan Maldonado began exploring the possibility of recruiting nurses from Puerto Rico
to work in the Cook County public health system. He spoke with President Stroger, Ruth Rothstein, Lacy
Thomas and other officials in the Bureau of Health Services and received a positive response and called
this hearing as a first step in the process.
Chainnan Maldonado asked the Secretary to call each of the witnesses that testified at the hearing.

Dr. Flores-Rodriguez outlined the educational requirements for nurses in Puerto Rico. She shared her
experience with Florida and its use of the legislature to help combat the nursing shortage. She explained
that Florida amended the law to allow "licensing by endorsement" for nurses from Puerto Rico. As a
result, Florida has recruited over 945 nurses since May of 2002. Dr. Flores-Rodriguez stated that all of
the nurses are happy with their work and have adapted very well.
Chairman Maldonado asked Dr. Flores-Rodriguez about the curriculum developed by the Puerto Rican
Nurses Association to help nurses transition from Puerto Rico to the United States.
Dr. Flores-Rodriguez replied that the curriculum is mandatory and includes hospital and patient
management.
State Senator Miguel del Valle testified that he will amend his recently introduced Senate Bill 78, which
allows licensing by endorsement, to clarify and strengthen the role of the Department of Professional
Regulations in working with nurses from Puerto Rico and other countries.
Chairman Maldonado asked Senator de! Valle to clarify whether or not Illinois already has licensing by
endorsement.
Senator del Valle stated that nurses coming from Puerto Rico who have submitted proof of passing the
National Council Licensing Examination would be licensed by endorsement in Illinois.
State Representative Cynthia Soto testified that she would be supporting del Valle's legislation in the
House.
Ruth Rothstein testified that currently there is a severe shortage in the critical care areas of Stroger and
Cermak Hospitals.

731

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2003
Linda Strickland stated that recruiting nurses from Puerto Rico would be a good idea even without a
nursing shortage because it is extremely important to have bilingual nurses to provide services to the
growing Hispanic patient base. She said she would be in collaboration with the Bureau of Human
Resources to streamline the hiring process .
Magali Moreno spoke about the nursing conference she attended in Puerto Rico as a representative of the
Bureau of Health Services. She stated that over seventy-five nurses signed up at the Bureau's booth, and
at least thirty-five of those nurses were fully bilingual.
Mary Muse stated she also attended the conference and said that the Puerto Rican nurses were
overwhelming interested in Cook County and the opportunities in our public health system.
After the presentation from the Bureau of Health Services, Chairman Maldonado raised a question
regarding the process used in hiring registered nurses in the Bureau of Health.
Representatives from the Bureau of Health and the Cook County Human Resources Department
responded that the hiring process takes approximately six months and there are fourteen steps in the
process.
Chairman Maldonado suggested to Mark Kilgallon, Chief of the Bureau of Human Resources, to meet
with the Bureau of Health to review the process and determine if it can be shortened.
Ruth Rothstein stated that the Bureau is working on the problem and a meeting is scheduled for next
week with the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources. She concluded by stating that some steps have
already been eliminated.
Chairman Maldonado asked when the Commissioners could expect a report on the streamlined process.
Ruth Rothstein stated within two weeks, or a month, at the most.
Chairman Maldonado adjourned the meeting.
The transcript for this meeting is available in the Office of the Secretary to the Board, 118 North Clark

Commissioner Collins remarked that it is very important that the lobbyists introduce themselves to the
commissioners and infonn them of important issues that could impact the County. The commissioner
further stated that Board members should also know what other issues or contracts the lobbyists may be
working on in Springfield.
Chairman Suffredin agreed with Commi ssioner Collins, and stated that the County 's plan is to coordinate
these efforts through the Coordinator of Intergovernmental Affairs, Tim Casey.
The Chairman stated that the contract from the Cook County Clerk for Michael Kreloff is important
because the issues in this session center on how the $170 million dollars that Illinois has under the
Federal Election Act will be distributed, and if Cook County will receive its share to purchase the type of
election equipment required.
Chairman Suffredin asked Tim Casey to introduce himself to the committee. Tim Casey informed the
committee that he distributes legislative updates and user files to the members on a weekly basis. He also
said he holds weekly meetings in Springfield with the lobbyists to better to coordinate the County's
position on issues.
Commissioner Daley stated that he believes that appropriate language should be included in all contracts
for lobbyists. He stated that the committee should draft and adopt the language in committee so the
Purchasing Agent has the authorization. Further, he stated that he concurs with Commissioner Collins,
that Board Members should know whether an individual or firm is lobbying for other county elected
officials or business entities.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR FEBRUARY 20, 2003

Commissioner Silvestri stated his concern regarding contracts not being uniform and coordinated. He
said with respect to the various offices, an effort should be made to consolidate the lobbying services into
one general lobbying service for the entire County.
Chairman Suffredin stated that in late December the President held a meeting with all the constitutional
office holders and indicated that he wanted to devise procedures that would address what impact State and
Federal legislation would have on the County. The President also asked the elected officials to present
their legislative agendas to his office so Tim Casey could begin to review the agenda items. The items
would then be forwarded to the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee for consideration
and hearings as necessary. Finally, he stated that one of the President's goals is to let all the lobbyist's
know that they work for Cook County and not for one elected official.
Chairman Suffredin stated that Tim Casey has started the process of distributing a User File of all bills
introduced through last Friday that affect the County. He stated that Mr. Casey's plan is to have someone
in the President's office prepare a fiscal note on the bills which will then come before the Legislation and
Intergovernmental Relations Committee.
Commissioner Peraica asked the number of county lobbyists?
Chairman Suffredin responded that the County currently has approximately seven lobbyists.
Commissioner Daley stated that anyone who is a lobbyist must have a contract with the County.
Commissioner Peraica stated that he doesn' t think the money is being well spent, the County needs to
look at the situation and have a firm that will take the leadership position on coordinating all activities
with the Legislation and Intergovernmental Relations Committee. He said the County needs to streamline
and look for ways to cut costs.
Commissioner Claypool expressed skepticism on the lobbyist issue. He indicated that he believes there is
a philosophical difference between having the County Board contract with its two lobbyists and the Board
approving contracts for lobbyists for individuals elected officials. He concluded by remarking that he
hopes this difference will be resolved.
Commissioner Daley stated that it should be made clear to the elected officials that if something is passed
and there is a fiscal impact on the County, the funds will be taken from their respective budget.
Chairman Suffredin stated that when the Morrill and Barnes contracts were presented to the Board, one of
the contracts is being paid from the President's office and the other is being paid by the Board of
Commissioner's so that they would become the commissioner's principal lobbyists. He said their
contracts would be the largest because they will be doing more work in coordinating with the Department
of Intergovernmental Affairs.
Michael Kreloff stated that the commissioner's points are well taken. He stated that he will work closely
with the official County lobbyists and with the commissioners.
Commissioner Sims moved approval of Item 256938, seconded by Commissioner Claypool.
Chairman Suffredin called for a Roll Call, the vote of yeas and nays being as follows:
