LINCOLNYYARDS
Master Plan

January 2019

 

Executive
Summary
Lincoln Yards offers a once in a lifetime
opportunity to transform an under-utilized area
of the City into a neighborhood built for the
needs of Chicagoans.
Lincoln Yards is an exceptional development
that looks to the future, while preserving and
revitalizing the area in a way that blends its
unique industrial heritage with generous parks,
riverfront open spaces and new amenities for
local residents.
It is rare to find 55+ acres under visionary
ownership in a city with such strong assets as the
Lincoln Park and Bucktown neighborhoods, the
Chicago River and The 606 Trail.
Although the site is currently disconnected
from these assets by infrastructure barriers
and the remnants of previous industrial uses, a
combination of both careful and bold urban
design moves will open the site and its riverfront
to all as public spaces.
Lincoln Yards embraces the goals set forth in the
North Branch Framework Plan, to advance the
City's and the local communities' shared vision.
It will promote job-creating economic growth,
transit-oriented development and formation of a
natural riverfront environment. As a result, it will
generate a truly unique, mixed-use North Branch
neighborhood and a regional destination.
Lincoln Yards is not just an opportunity to benefit
the surrounding communities but the entire city.

 Introduction
The City of Chicago’s North Branch
Framework Plan rezoned the
Lincoln Yards site and unlocked
an opportunity for the creation
of a mixed-use neighborhood
that promotes economic growth,
transit-oriented development and
the creation of a natural riverfront
environment. Sterling Bay, the City
of Chicago and the surrounding
communities will collaborate, to
ensure that Lincoln Yards is
successfully implemented, and meets
these objectives while creating an
inviting place for all.

 Purpose of the Plan
The Lincoln Yards Master Plan provides a vision for the
development of the former industrial land, including the
objectives for the comprehensive development of the
site, and guidance around the relationship of built form
and the public realm, and how it will relate to adjacent
neighborhoods and communities.
Lincoln Yards is a new mixed-use community that will be
developed on 55+ acres of former industrial land along
the North Branch of the Chicago River. This site is uniquely
located at the bend in the Chicago River and between
some of the City’s most iconic neighborhoods: Bucktown,
Wicker Park and Lincoln Park.
Lincoln Yards is located within the larger North Branch
Industrial Corridor and applies the recommendations of
the City of Chicago’s Industrial Modernization Initiative,
which is intended to promote employment and economic
activity while creating diverse public open space and
a collection of unique places for everyone. Lincoln
Yards will catalyze a dynamic, mixed-use economic
engine for Chicago.
The Master Plan vision for Lincoln Yards draws on
this unique location by using a full range of planning
strategies to create a dynamic place, while delivering
a diversity of experiences that complement adjacent
neighborhoods.

Lincoln Yards Master Plan

Relationship to Other
Planning Documents
To create an active community centered around
walkability, mixed use, diversity and expanded open space,
several key factors were considered:
• 

• 

• 

• 

Urban form matters as a way to deliver high-quality,
publicly accessible open spaces and balance increased density and building height.
Vibrant and livable neighborhoods are sustained by a
mix of uses that feed streets with activity throughout
the day.
The layout of smaller scaled blocks around larger
open spaces provides the foundation for the layering
of buildings and mix of uses that give Lincoln Yards a
vibrant identity.
A major expansion of the public realm will open the
riverfront to the community.

This document is intended to ensure that the future
development of Lincoln Yards is consistent with goals and
principles laid out in the North Branch Framework Plan.
The Master Plan document has been organized
into five sections.
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Urban design vision and principles
Urban design framework
Open space and public realm
Transportation
Character zones

Since 2010, multiple studies and plans have been
completed for the North Branch Industrial Corridor.
Several of these themes and key principles are applied
to the Master Plan, including improved connectivity, new
experiences for walking and biking, and adding public
transit to the existing transit network. Other principles
regarding site design, open space and massing have been
further studied to create a balanced and optimal outcome.
These include stepping down the height of buildings to
adjacent neighborhoods.
The North Branch Framework (approved in 2017) sets a
vision for transforming this stretch of industrial waterfront:
turning Chicago’s neglected back yard into a vibrant
neighborhood front yard along our River. It is critical for
the city to regenerate brownfield sites, connect them
back into the fabric of the City, and create attractive new
developments to compete with suburban sprawl.
Several of the North Branch Framework Plan’s key
principles are applied to the Master Plan, including
improved connectivity, new experiences for walking
and biking, and adding public transit to the existing
transit network.
The North Branch Framework Plan recommends and
supports increases in density and height in relation to
publicly-accessible open spaces through the Planned
Development process.

The development of Lincoln Yards will be guided by
two new Planned Development documents: one for
Lincoln Yards North and another for Lincoln Yards
South. Lincoln Yards North is primarily the former site of
Finkl Steel, as well as several smaller adjacent parcels.
Lincoln Yards South comprises the former City-owned
Fleet Management site, as well as former industrial
and manufacturing sites along the west side of the
Chicago River.
Under the new Planned Development, the Lincoln Yards
development will construct approximately 15 million
square feet of buildable area, which is within the allowable
densities identified in the North Branch Framework Plan.
The FAR of 6.5 for Lincoln Yards is in alignment and
proportion with the current zoning strategy for the
adjacent Clybourn Corridor, which allows for re-zoning
requests up to a FAR of 5.0.
The Lincoln Yards Master Plan synthesizes many of the
access and transportation improvements identified in the
North Branch Framework Plan.
Infrastructure improvements recommended in this
document contemplate what can be delivered as part of
the Planned Development and allow for future off-site
improvements in the adjacent community.

 The Next Big
Transformation
Every great city has a handful of projects that over
time have truly transformed its urban form, function
and future. In the context of Chicago's major events
and developments, it becomes evident that Lincoln
Yards holds this same transformative potential with its
natural assets, size of land, and proximity to multiple
transit systems. By implementing thoughtful planning
principles and a flexible framework, Lincoln Yards will
set the stage for the next great transformation in the
history of Chicago.

Park Boulevard System
Established in the mid-1800s to create healthy,
accessible, and livable neighborhoods, the Park
Boulevard System was the first such major
comprehensive system in the country. The network
includes 1,700 acres of open space and extends 26 miles.
The system was originally planned to connect South Park,
West Chicago Park, and Lincoln Park to provide natural
respite and recreation.

Chicago Fire and Rebuilding
In October 1871, a fire destroyed one-third of the City
including the business district. The Great Rebuilding
efforts following the fire led to innovative building
designs and technologies. In 1885, Chicago produced the
world's first skyscraper.

City Beautiful and 1893 Worlds Fair
In response to the industrialized and overcrowded city,
the City Beautiful Movement emerged. Led by Daniel
Burnham, the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893
displayed the model city of the future and attracted
millions of visitors to Chicago.

1909 Plan of Chicago
Architect planners Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett
scripted a bold plan for the City and surrounding
region, recommending the creation of new and widened
streets, a continuous public lakefront and park system,
new railroad, harbor, and civic buildings. The plan also
included forest preserves, park expansions, and a
network of highways around the City.

Transportation Investments
Public transportation has served the City since the late
1800s. The network has included local and regional train
systems, street cars, bus systems and water taxis. The
elevated train passenger system called the "L" opened in
1897, and continues to expand today. Lake Shore Drive,
originally an unpaved path for carriages, has seen many
expansions, re-routes, and landfills overtime. The Outer
Drive's transformations connected the City north to south.

Infrastructure Investments
Chicago's location on the Illinois Michigan Canal connecting
the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River positioned the
City for incredible growth and transformation into a major
transportation hub for the country. In order to address the
need for a comprehensive sewage system, the flow of the
Chicago River was reversed to preserve the water quality
of Lake Michigan.

Lincoln Yards will
be Chicago's next
exemplary planned
development

Parks and Public Open Space
The integration of public parks, open spaces and lakefront
access into the City is central to the City's design. Long
before the City was incorporated, land along the lakefront
where Grant Park is today was labeled “Public Ground—
Common to Remain Forever Open, Clear and Free of
Any Buildings, or Other Obstruction Whatever.” The City
includes many notable parks that have guided adjacent
development and transformation. Millennium Park,
completed in 2004, revitalized a neglected downtown site
into an international destination. The City has recently
seen major investments in connective public open spaces.
The Chicago Riverfront has reconnected the City to
the Chicago River with active uses, redevelopment and
recreational paths. The 606 Trail, once an abandoned rail
line, was converted into an elevated greenway connecting
many Chicago neighborhoods.

Historic Parks and Boulevards

Planned Developments
Many developments are notable in the evolution of
the urban fabric of the City. In recent times, major
redevelopment plans and projects have brought
revitalizing transformations to entire city districts. These
include the Central Area Plan, the Central Station
Development, Lakeshore East, Dearborn Station, the
Riverwalk and Fulton Market. And now, Lincoln Yards.

 North Branch
Industrial Corridor
The North Branch Industrial Corridor is one of 26
industrial corridors in Chicago and is also the first
component of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Industrial
Modernization Initiative. It is a 760-acre area
along the Chicago River between Kinzie Street and
Fullerton Avenue and is surrounded by many different
residential and mixed-use neighborhoods. The North
Branch Industrial Corridor has supported important
manufacturing, warehousing and transportation uses
for generations.
However, much of the land today is vacant and underperforming. This is in part due to the area’s longtime
industrial zoning, which prohibited it from responding to
market demands for non-industrial uses such as housing,
retail and commerce for many years. The City and the
Corridor's surrounding communities have collectively
identified a formal plan to revitalize this area as a mixeduse economic engine for today’s age of innovation.

Goal 1
Maintain the North Branch Industrial Corridor
as an important economic engine and vital job
center within the City of Chicago.

Goal 2
Provide better access for all transportation modes.

Goal 3
Build upon the North Branch Industrial Corridor's
unique natural and built environment.

By looking at the North Branch Industrial Corridor within
the context of the surrounding neighborhoods and the
City as a whole, it is possible to reinvent this site in a way
that respects and celebrates its long history and many
contributions to Chicago.

North Branch Framework Plan
In May 2017, the Chicago Plan Commission adopted the
North Branch Framework Plan and Design Guidelines
following an in-depth community engagement process.
This thoughtful document considers the City's and the
community’s needs to create a flexible and actionable,
mixed-use development plan for this industrial corridor.
Today, the Plan is embedded in the City’s long-term plan
and is ready to be implemented.

Land Use

Zoning Implementation

3 Distinct Zones
Each has unique assets, demands and
development potential.
• 

North Sub Area (dynamic zone)

• 

Central Sub Area (stable zone)

• 

South Sub Area (transitional zone)

The Plan's three main goals are to maintain the corridor
as an economic engine and vital job center, provide
better access to all transportation modes, and enhance
the area’s unique natural and built environment. Sterling
Bay has embraced all three of these goals and looks
forward to putting them to work to build a better and
more beautiful North Branch community.

Opportunities
As is the case with many post-industrial sites, the Lincoln
Yards’ site developed an internal logic independent of
its adjacent contexts and disconnected from the urban
fabric. Despite its relative isolation, the site possesses
some extraordinary assets that have the potential to
create a memorable district when integrated carefully
into the Master Plan.
First and foremost is the Chicago River that offers
an extraordinary opportunity to create a natural
environment supported by great redevelopment. The
development should strive to strengthen both visual and
physical connections to the river and to create a cohesive
riverwalk experience. The site also enjoys unparalleled
views of the downtown skyline. This offers a great
opportunity to create unique public and private spaces.
Additionally, much of the site has been cleared of existing
buildings, making it readily available for development.
The popular and successful 606 bike trail comes near
the site, ending at Walsh Park just west of I-90/I-94. The
site also enjoys close proximity to public transit – the
key to success for any new urban development today.
This site is just a five-minute walk from the Clybourn
Metra Station and less than a ten-minute walk from the
Armitage CTA Station.
While these assets surround the site, the connectivity
through and to the site is challenged by existing
infrastructure barriers, including I-90/94, the Metra
tracks, and a dysfunctional traffic interchange
at Ashland Avenue, Armitage Avenue, and Elston
Avenue. Additionally, within the site, the Cortland
Bridge is currently the only point of access across
the Chicago River.
In order to make the site a truly transportationoriented development, significant improvements
to both the Metra station and the surrounding
infrastructure are required.

 Community Process
To date, Sterling Bay has worked earnestly to engage
many stakeholders and community members in the
planning process for Lincoln Yards. Some of the
most important design ideas have come from local
community members.
Sterling Bay believes deeply that the success of
developments like Lincoln Yards relies on finding common
ground with the community and stakeholders. Based on
the “Listening Tour” with the local community, the team
has identified the following eight shared community
values and has tailored the Lincoln Yards Master Plan to
respect and respond to them.
The team will continue its community and stakeholder
outreach throughout the master planning process using
various means, including open houses, formal community
presentations and charrettes. It is Sterling Bay’s goal
to continually engage the adjacent communities, in
order to keep them informed and to get feedback,
working hard to maintain positive communication
throughout the process.

 Vision
Lincoln Yards will be Chicago’s
next transformational project,
connecting Chicagoans to the River's
North Branch as well as The 606. It
will provide new parks and public
open spaces along the waterfront
and throughout the neighborhood.
It will also tie together surrounding
neighborhoods, including Lincoln
Park, Wicker Park and Bucktown.
This riverfront neighborhood’s fun
shops, food & beverage spots, great
innovation spaces and skyline views
will attract entrepreneurs, young
professionals, local families, long-time
Chicagoans, East-Coast transplants,
West-Coast adventurers, academics
and artists alike.

 Economic Development
The development of Lincoln Yards will catalyze a dynamic, mixed-use economic engine for the
City of Chicago. The vision includes a diversity of use and program that will support dynamic
and inclusive growth for the city.

Sustainability

Lincoln Yards is a defining moment for our
city. This project will knit together this site
with countless connections — to new economic
opportunities, new transportation options, new
environmental benefits for everyone to enjoy.

In addition to the significant environmental remediation that has already been achieved on
site, much of the existing infrastructure in the area was built at a time when standards for
conserving energy and managing water quality did not exist as they do today.
The Master Plan supports the City of Chicago’s goals for sustainable development by
setting a target to achieve LEED-ND certification for the entire development. Lincoln Yards
will incorporate high performance sustainable design that will positively contribute to the
sustainability of the overall development and will be a leading model for the regeneration of
other industrial sites along the Chicago River.

Transit Oriented
The City is shifting to a more sustainable model of development, away from low-density
sprawl and excessive reliance on the car. Chicago can dramatically boost the number of
people living in urban areas, where transit and nearby amenities help foster more sustainable
lifestyles, connect residents to nature, and complement the unique elements and fabric of
surrounding neighborhoods. Higher density is good, more sustainable, and comes with many
benefits for the City and region, as long as it is well-connected to public transport and its
environment is well-designed.

Activated Ground Floor
The master plan places great emphasis on the importance of human-scale, and adheres to
the principle that creating a great ground floor is essential to good urbanism. Smaller-scaled
blocks allowing for turning corners frequently, and create a pleasant walking experience with
a mix of active uses that feeds sidewalks with activity throughout the day. Together the design
of streetscapes and buildings that abut and activate sidewalk frontages reinforce the sense
of place while serving as transition zones between land use and density.

Heritage and Character
Although most of the industrial buildings on the site have already been removed, the Master
Plan enhances the connectivity between the site’s heritage, the scale and texture of the site,
and retains and creatively restores the important and authentic sense of place. Elements of
the site's industrial past are preserved when possible and integrated into the fabric of the
site's overall design.

Density
The North Branch Framework Plan recommends and supports increases in density and height
in relation to publicly-accessible open spaces through the Planned Development process.
Utilization of the available floor area bonuses behind the North Branch Framework Plan will
provide for much-needed investments in open space, public transportation and community
services. Increased building heights and densities are emerging along neighborhood
commercial corridors and major transit routes throughout the City. As part of the vision
outlined in the North Branch Framework Plan, the increase in density and population will
ensure continued vibrancy of Lincoln Park and Bucktown.

Affordability
The Lincoln Yards Master Plan calls for 6,000 housing units. This increased supply of
residential units will allow for more affordable housing in the area. Further, Lincoln Yards will
meet all ARO requirements and have affordable units on site.

infrastructure. These physical connections are coupled
with visual connections to make the Lincoln Yards'
public realm and riverfront inviting parts of the larger
community. A fine-grain, but unique urban fabric will also
stitch the neighborhood into the surrounding City grid,
while still making a bold statement for the future.

 The Exchange
One of the long-term goals of the Lincoln Yards Master
Plan is to relocate the current Clybourn Metra Station
further south and link it to The 606, the center of
development, and other modes of transit. Rebranded
as The Exchange, the new transit hub will combine the
various transit modalities with activated programs,
naturally making Lincoln Yards the next must-see
destination in Chicago.
Together with DPD, CDOT, Metra, and the community, the
new Exchange will be designed to make the transition
through the infrastructural barrier -- such as the highway
overpass and the railroad -- a unique experience. The
extension of The 606 will be accompanied by a community
amenity such as a skate park and a beautifully landscaped
plaza will be integrated as the new station's arrival point.

Transform the disconnected transit systems
into a unified Exchange
•  Transit-centered new development
•  Magnet north side multi-modal hub
•  Catalyst for sustained neighborhood investment
and job creation
•  Provide alternate solutions to current capacity
issues on CTA lines

Collection
of Experiences
Lincoln Yards includes a series of smaller character
zones that respond to specific land use, open space
and transitions to adjacent community areas while
siting buildings to frame and animate public spaces at
the street level.
The North Dominick Corridor
A prominent office address lined with active publiclyoriented ground floor uses that frame multiple wellscaled, pedestrian pathways leading to river.
The Kingsbury Corridor
Primarily residential zone that serves as a transition in
use and building height to the Clybourn Avenue Corridor
and Lincoln Park neighborhood.

The West Riverfront Gateway
A mixed-use development that will extend amenities
and experiences in Lincoln Yards across the River, while
creating an iconic urban gateway to the North Branch.
The South DomInick Corridor
Located directly adjacent to the large recreational
amenities, the corridor will be a unique mixed-use
area with its own character and identity, defined by a
continuous pedestrian experience from the north.
The South Riverfront District
Bridges the gap between the natural
experiences along the riverfront, existing businesses
and the urban fabric surrounding Lincoln Yards.

 Public/Central
Open Space
Lincoln Yards will provide publicly accessible open spaces
of all shapes and sizes throughout the development.
A major central open space will act as the heart of the
development, with breathtaking views down the river to
downtown Chicago. This large riverfront park will ensure
the site’s views – one of its most defining features – are
enjoyed by all, rather than being a privatized space
for just a few.
Lincoln Yards North Park provides a large central open
space for the development and surrounding community,
and the Lincoln Yards South Park will provide recreational
programming for the larger community.
Smaller parks will be sprinkled throughout the development
to act as pedestrian connectors between neighborhoods.
These smaller public open spaces and pocket parks will help
to create a range of public realm experiences.

Accessible
Waterfront
The diversity and number of parks included in the
Lincoln Yards Master Plan creates a new destination
open space for the entire community.

The Chicago River waterfront should be accessible
for the community and surrounding neighborhoods.
Today, however, this channelized river’s vertical
bulkheads prevent public enjoyment. Lincoln Yards hopes
to do its part to help create a contiguous riverwalk from
downtown Chicago all the way to Avondale. This will also
help to connect Lincoln Yards to other communities up
and down the river.

Contiguous
and accessible
waterfront

Design improvements to the waterfront on the site will
allow Lincoln Yards residents, employees and visitors to
benefit from the river as both a source of transportation
and recreation. Whether strolling along the Riverwalk,
enjoying dinner overlooking the river, grabbing a
water taxi, biking, jogging or taking out a kayak, the
river will become an integral part of this unique
community’s daily life.

 Crafted Skyline
The massing of the buildings in Lincoln Yards is designed
to create an attractive skyline from both near and
far. Carefully articulated towers create a hierarchy of
heights throughout the development. These towers
are married to well-scaled podiums with active
ground floor uses, simultaneously creating urban and
human-scaled spaces.

36 

Lincoln Yards Master Plan

Building heights and densities are also carefully crafted to
maximize views to the Chicago skyline as well as the river
and nearby neighborhoods and parks. Furthermore, the
massing of buildings minimizes shadows on the public
realm, ensuring that the development’s public open spaces
– and their great views – are enjoyed by all.

January 2019

37 

 View Corridors
The Master Plan takes into account neighborhood
surroundings by utilizing a series of existing conditions
that provide broad natural transitions within the
development and to adjacent residential areas. The
current zoning strategy along the Clybourn Corridor
could allow for re-zoning requests that would provide an
FAR of up to 5.0, which would contribute to the 300+ foot
wide transition zone and buffer to Lincoln Park.

At an average width of 175 feet, the Chicago River
provides another transition to step up to taller buildings
proposed along the Expressway. Taller commercial and
mixed-use buildings west of the River take advantage
of closer proximity to two existing Metra lines and
plans for a new multi-modal station, further leveraging
transit-oriented development and reducing the impact of
increased personal vehicle trips to the area.

Within the development site, the central park in Lincoln
Yards North creates a 280+ foot transition to the larger
office buildings along the Dominick Street corridor.
Commercial buildings along the North Dominick Corridor
are planned to open onto the Riverwalk, and have been
sited to allow multiple spaces for the public to access
the river. The height of the buildings proposed along this
corridor averages 20 stories.

The combined width of the Expressway and Ashland
Avenue creates a 400+ foot buffer and transition zone
to step height down toward the Bucktown and Wicker
Park neighborhoods.

The urban design vision prioritizes a vibrant mix of
uses (live, work, shopping and recreation) that provide
countless opportunities for social interaction on broad
tree-lined sidewalks and in generous open space on
both sides of the river, bringing access and amenities to
adjacent neighborhoods.

The design of the ground floor will contain active uses
with a variety of character and experiences, all containing
elements scaled for pedestrians.

AV
E

It is at the street level that the public will experience
Lincoln Yards. Great importance has been placed on the
ground floor design to enhance the quality and vitality of
the public realm.

RT

The Master Plan places great emphasis on the importance
of human-scale, and adheres to the principle that creating
a great ground floor is essential to good urbanism. The
plan does this through small blocks allowing for turning
corners frequently, and a pleasant walking experience
with a mix of active uses that feeds sidewalks with activity
throughout the day. Together the design of streetscapes
and buildings that abut and activate sidewalk frontages
reinforce the sense of place while serving as transition
zones between land use and density.

Buildings step down in height moving from the Expressway
toward Lincoln Park. Additionally, views to and of the river
are key considerations of what makes the site special. The
network of streets, plazas and open spaces intentionally
provides open view corridors from both within Lincoln
Yards and the surrounding neighborhoods.

AR

ST

Through this blending of taller and shorter buildings
and careful spacing of higher-rise elements, the master
plan can achieve the allowable density without blocking
the view of the city skyline or creating a “wall of towers”
blocking views to the riverfront.

AS

E

EB

Viewsheds, vistas, and sight lines were studied from
various locations in Lincoln Park, other surrounding areas,
and from more distant locations.

Taller buildings are sited to complement key views by
providing a visual frame. The design team has carefully
studied this relationship, where taller buildings have been
shaped to be thinner and spacing between buildings
is maximized to ensure plenty of views to the sky and
access to sunlight.

This approach creates an environment that holds your
focus on the vibrant, pedestrian-oriented street activity
rather than the large-scale building. The Master Plan
applies the same concept on the river’s edge, where lowscale buildings define the public spaces and the Riverwalk,
and the towers are set back and away.

AS

AR

UE

From a distance, tall buildings can be fantastic, but they
can dominate the individual if their ground plane is not
thoughtfully planned. Therefore, we created a podium of
about 4-6 floors which relates to the pedestrian areas in
a human context.

The towers sit back from the sidewalk and area open the
sky above it. You have two scales: one is urban and adds
to Chicago’s great skyline, the other is at the scale of the
individual and adds to Chicago’s neighborhood experience
with quality spaces at the street level.

RT

The urban design strategy draws on the combination
building typologies to achieve a range of living and
working environments while maintaining a consistent
and high level of pedestrian comfort. Building heights
have been carefully developed to appropriately scale
the pedestrian experience in relation to tall buildings and
develop a welcoming and inviting sidewalk environment.

 Master Plan
Framework:
Public Realm
The Lincoln Yards Master Plan is
arranged around a comprehensive
network of open spaces that are
well connected to the surrounding
community. The plan offers a
diversity of scales and types of open
spaces, and it celebrates the River's
North Branch, while simultaneously
creating tremendous value for
real estate development. This
approximately 21-acre open space
network demonstrates Sterling
Bay's commitment to achieving the
goals of the City’s North Branch
Framework Plan.

 Public Open Space
Create Publicly Accessible Open Spaces
and Waterfront
Public open space, accessible and welcoming to all, will
be at the heart of the Lincoln Yards neighborhood. The
comprehensive approach to open space is integral to
the entire development. Substantial open space on both
sides of the river will be programmed to attract a broad
diversity of users from Lincoln Yards, the surrounding
neighborhoods and across the city. Offering expansive
views of Chicago's skyline, the park is positioned with
multiple connections to the surrounding community.
Connections between the open spaces, the Riverwalk,
The 606, the Metra station, and surrounding
neighborhoods will encourage walking and cycling
throughout the neighborhood and beyond. The
intersection of the Riverwalk and The 606 and their
connections to the open space at Lincoln Yards will make
this an important hub in the recreational trail system in
this part of the City.
The open spaces will create a lively public realm
throughout all four seasons. The park in Lincoln Yards
North will include, a children’s playground, gathering
areas, and shaded lawns to attract daily use. Space for
a farmers’ market will also be used for small events, and
a sledding hill will create a center of activity in the winter,
becoming a south-facing sloped lawn with stunning
views of the downtown skyline in other seasons.

On the south side of the river, a variety of recreational
fields will provide another type of landscape program.
In addition to these major landscape spaces, smaller
pocket parks and plazas are designed to connect all parts
of the public realm and provide more intimate spaces
where cafés or restaurants will spill out onto the sidewalk.
These plazas will connect the central open space to the
surrounding communities and the Riverwalk.
Enhancing the river is a priority of the City as well as
Sterling Bay, and it will become an integral part of
Lincoln Yards’ transportation strategy and recreational
program. Water taxi stops will be a key component of
the neighborhood’s multi-modal transportation strategy,
as will the shared bicycle and pedestrian trails of the
Riverwalk. A part from the strong connections between
the Riverwalk and park space, many other connections
will be made to the river. The trails will be designed to
rise and fall to create a variety of contiguous experiences
along the river, and to pass underneath existing and
proposed bridges.

 Open Space Network
Lincoln Yards North Parks
The park spaces are animated on three sides by
residential and commercial buildings. The fourth side
of the park, however, gently slopes down to the river
offering stunning views of the water and the downtown
skyline beyond. The program for these parks includes
self directed play and gathering areas such as flat and
sloped lawns, a sledding hill, market plaza and a landing
for launching kayaks, canoes and small boats.

Lincoln Yards South Park
The park in Lincoln Yards South offers the wider
community many recreation opportunities with sports
fields, Riverwalk and public plazas. The large lawn
includes various sports fields that have the flexibility to
host larger gatherings and events as well.

The core program of the Riverwalk, a pair of multi-use
pedestrian and bicycle trails, will be enhanced by a
variety of connections to the river itself, and to the
adjacent buildings. The trails will pass under bridges and
will drop closer to river level in places to allow for access
to canoe launches, the river taxi and riverside seating
places. It will rise in places to connect to a series of small
plazas and pocket parks between buildings, and to the
program on the ground floor of the adjacent buildings,
including cafes, restaurants, and retail. The Riverwalk
will be shaded by trees along the river and animated by
programs spilling out of the adjacent buildings, including
café and restaurant terraces. This will create a lively
urban riverside.

The 606 Extension
The multi-use 606 extension trail will link Bucktown
and Wicker Park to Lincoln Park and the lakefront. It
will connect to the historic swing bridge, which will be
maintained in an open position as a viewing platform
over the river. The 606 will connect both sides of
the Riverwalk and central open space, and it will
connect to bike trails in the Lincoln Park neighborhood
and points east.

 Lincoln Yards North Park
The creation of publicly accessible open space at Lincoln
Yards is vital and offers new opportunities for recreation,
play, community gathering, experiencing nature, and
celebrating urban life.
The Lincoln Yards North and South sites are an important
nexus and connector focused along the Chicago River.
Lincoln Yards South is a hub for recreation, while Lincoln
Yards North features an extended 606 and Central Park.
A one-mile Riverwalk lines the entire waterfront of the
length of the two sites.
Together these features and places compose a site that
will be transformative— a new green oasis, a place to bring
people together, and to celebrate the variety and vibrancy
of urban life in Chicago.

The design of the open space takes advantage of this
unique location along the bend of the river, and offers
the potential to look down its length to the Chicago
skyline to celebrate it as a new natural resource within
this urban context.
The Master Plan offers a wide range of spaces that will
enliven the area and speak to the uniqueness of this
place. These spaces include extending existing streets
into the site via a pedestrian oriented Slipway and river
overlook, a pedestrian retail promenade along Dominick
Street, undulating hills that create an interior urban oasis,
seasonally dynamic gardens, an adventure play area, a
furnace garden showcasing industrial relics, a continuous
mixed-use trail along the river, and several active
recreational fields

The open space design pulls inspiration from the site’s
industrial history, while reimagining it for today’s uses and
needs. Lincoln Yards North will re-use and provide new
expression for historic site artifacts throughout the project,
but acknowledge the primary opportunity to rediscover
the river amidst this post-industrial site.

 The Riverwalk
Building on the core goals to provide better access and
to build upon the industrial corridor’s unique and natural
built environment of the North Branch Framework Plan,
the Lincoln Yards North Riverwalk has been envisioned
to have three distinct zones - the Green Edge, the Social
Edge, and the 606 Extension. Each zone will have a
unique character and focus on addressing several
key issues. They will be woven seamlessly together
with a shared multi-use shared path that will connect
to the 606 Trail and stretch north and south along
the Chicago River.

60 

Lincoln Yards Master Plan

Key design features will accentuate each zone - overlooks
along the Green Edge allowing closer observation of new
ecological systems in place, active seating in the form of
grand stairs and nets to engage the water at the Social
Edge, and a new pedestrian bridge and water taxi stop at
the 606 Extension.
The consistent shared multi-use path will accommodate
pedestrians and cyclists in both directions at a minimum
width of 16 feet, and will be held at an elevation of +7.5
CCD to avoid being inundated with water during flood
events. The finished floor for the adjacent development
will be located at an assumed +10 CCD.

The North Branch Framework Plan includes several
connectivity principles which should be implemented
to connect Lincoln Yards to other local and regional
destinations. They are organized into short-, mediumand long-term plans. The goals of these principles
are to improve vehicular circulation, implement new
transportation technologies, increase multi-modal
connections and coordinate traffic management options.

Lincoln Yards embraces these connectivity principles,
goals and strategies wholeheartedly. Through its urban
plan, Lincoln Yards will promote transit-oriented lifestyles
and create a continuous pedestrian experience. The
design of the buildings and neighborhood will help to
encourage those that live there to seek out alternative
modes of transportation. For example, locally serving
retail will promote pedestrian activities and alleviate
the need to drive for many conveniences. Also, the plan
will conform to complete streets design guidelines to
maximize efficiency and enhance pedestrian and vehicular
experiences. Finally, improving the access to the Clybourn
Metra Station by moving it south to connect to The 606
will provide greater access to and from the site.

Connectivity

In today’s fast-paced society, where connectivity is so
important, proper infrastructure planning is vital. As
multi-modal transportation methods such as bikeways,
pedestrian paths, transit ways, and even water taxis
are increasingly embraced, there is a critical need to
lay the groundwork to implement and expand these
modes over time.

 Multi-Modal
Transportation
CTA Train
Multiple CTA train stations are in the adjacent
neighborhoods of Lincoln Park, Wicker Park and Bucktown,
connecting the area to downtown and Chicago's larger
urban context. Train lines include the blue, brown, purple
and red. Adjacent stations include Fullerton, Armitage,
North/Clybourn, Fullerton, and Damen.

METRA Station
Both the Union Pacific North and Union Pacific Northwest
Metra lines run directly next to the site, connecting
downtown Chicago to Harvard/McHenry and Kenosha.
The existing Metra station will be improved while a future
relocation is implemented. The relocated station will be a
full multi-modal transit hub which incorporates connections
to The 606, buses, shuttles and water taxis.

Bus
Lincoln Yards is well served by multiple CTA bus routes.
East/West bound buses include the 72, 73, and 74; northsouth bound buses include the 8, 9, and 50; and bus 56
runs diagonally along Milwaukee Avenue. The future transit
hub at the relocated Exchange will include dedicated areas
for adjacent bus lines to connect to the station.

Water Taxi
The existing water taxi network will be extended north
to the Lincoln Yards development. Three water taxi
stops are planned.

Transit Way
The North Branch Framework Plan proposed that a transit
way be extended into Lincoln Yards connecting south to
Goose Island and Ogilvie Center. The transit way is planned
to loop through the development with multiple stops serving
the entire site.

 Improving
Traffic Circulation

Parking
Shared Parking

Key intersection and traffic signal improvements have
been identified to help mitigate projected traffic volumes
and improve the efficiency of both the existing and
expanded street network.

The office and retail uses will be served by shared
parking structures. These structures are positioned
on the site to ensure easy access from the expressway,
as well as to promote walkability throughout
the development.

Key intersection and traffic signal improvements include
signal timing, signal modifications, signal offset and other
geometric intersections improvements.

The parking plan includes large structures adjacent to the
expressway that will serve the adjacent office programs,
but will also be sized to provide parking for users of the
Exchange and 606 Trail.

Transportation Demand Management
The Transportation Demand Management Plan
incorporates the proposed opportunities for people to
both live and work at Lincoln Yards, to go from work to
retail, and make walkable trips instead of driving off site.
The following provides a summary of those factors:
• 
• 
• 
• 

Greater Jobs-Housing Balance
Increased Transit Access
Bicycle Connectivity
Pedestrian Convenience and Safety

Development Specific Parking
Parking for residential uses will be accommodated
within building podiums. These structures will include
activated ground floor uses and architecturally screened
upper levels. The facades facing the public park and
adjacent public streets will relate to the pedestrian scale
and activation.
Traffic Signalization Improvements

Stacked Parking System and Future Uses

Proposed Shared Parking Locations

As time goes by, the parking need will potentially
decrease. One potential parking strategy being explored
is to have a stacked parking system. This would provide
an increased parking capacity initially. However, levels
originally designated for stacked parking systems could
be reconfigured to a standard size office height or
generous residential height. Another potential strategy is
to maintain standard parking floor-to-floor heights at the
podium levels, and to remove every other floor, creating
a generous height for commercial and/or residential uses.

Lincoln Yards is committed to providing a variety
of TDM measures to promote an array of mobility
choices, including programs and physical infrastructure
for future users.

Mitigating Existing Traffic Congestion
Several intersection improvements are critical for both
improved traffic management and pedestrian safety.
A redesigned intersection to fix the “spaghetti bowl”
at Armitage, Ashland and Elston is a priority. CDOT is
currently following up with engineering studies to expedite
this important project.
As demonstrated with similar improvements north at
Fullerton, the redesign of the Armitage, Ashland, Elston
intersection will unlock significant benefits that reduce
congestion and improve connectivity.

74 

Lincoln Yards Master Plan

Elston, Damen, Fullerton intersection improvements
following December 2016 realignment:
• 
• 

70%-80% travel time improvement at intersections
70%-80% travel time improvement within network

Ongoing coordination with CDOT to achieve the following:
• 
Provide significant operational and safety benefits
compared to existing conditions
•  The three closely spaced traffic lights will be
separated
• 
Increased spacing between intersections allows for
longer turn lanes and increased stacking
• 
Angled intersections will be replaced with more
perpendicular intersections
• 
Enhanced pedestrian safety

The urban framework is based on a pattern of well-scaled
streets establishing a connected community with a variety
of ways to move through the site and across the river.
Public streets create the framework for a city. they
establish the necessary connections for vehicles,
pedestrians and bicyclists. The design of streets is a key
component to establishing a vibrant, walkable urban
district. Working closely with the City of Chicago’s
Department of Transportation, the Master Plan
emphasizes the design of Complete Streets – with a
balanced street design that prioritizes pedestrian safety,
the integration of bike lanes, and drop-offs for rideshare,
while maintaining an appropriate number of lanes to
accommodate projected traffic demands.

Each of the streets has been designed to ensure
pedestrian accessibility and safety throughout the site,
and to incorporate these pathways within the urban fabric
of the surrounding neighborhoods. Generous sidewalk
widths coordinated with publicly-oriented ground floor
activities and distinctive landscape treatments will create
a strong pedestrian environment.
The following street types and sections respond to the
anticipated levels of vehicular traffic, while establishing
a connected network of well-scaled, pedestrianoriented streets.

 Character Zone
Guidelines
Lincoln Yards includes a series of
character zones based on primary
building use, surrounding site
features, and the relationship to
adjacent open spaces. Buildings
within a character zone should
complement each other through a
series of unified design principles.
These guidelines reinforce the urban
design vision by prioritizing a vibrant
mix of uses (live, work, shopping and
recreation) that provides countless
opportunities for social interaction
along broad tree-lined sidewalks
and in generous open spaces
proposed on both sides of the river,
bringing access and amenities to
adjacent neighborhoods.

The Master Plan for Lincoln Yards sets up several unique
environments for the distribution of density and built form,
including: a special riverfront edge, a vibrant commercial
corridor, a large central park at the bend in the river, and
a transitional neighborhood edge along Kingsbury. In
addition to responding to these unique conditions, the
arrangement of buildings and height contributes to the
sense of place for each, while creating a comfortable and
desirable environment for residents and visitors alike.

Character Zones

January 2019

87 

 North Dominick Corridor
Character Zone
Located along the eastern edge of the river, the North
Dominick Corridor has a continuous river relationship, as
well as a prominent address for future offices along an
extended Dominick Street. Along the length of this street
wall, there will be active publicly-oriented ground floor
uses with generous floor-to-ceiling heights and a high
degree of transparency.

Building Typology and Massing
• 
Primarily office and mixed-use.
• 
Building podium heights range from 2-5 floors.
• 
Building siting and massing should ensure visual
permeability beyond.
•  Consider building steps, recesses and setbacks to
delineate the massing into smaller elements.

As many of the buildings have a direct relationship with
the Lincoln Yards North Park and the riverfront, these
buildings will focus activity along the generous tree-lined
promenade lining the western edge of the park and
frame multiple well-scaled, pedestrian pathways leading
to river. Each building overlooks the continuous, publicly
accessible Riverwalk and creates an active frontage
including building amenities, cafes, and other uses that
support an active linear space defined by pedestrian
and bicycle circulation and a range of experiences
along the river.

Activation
•  The most public, active uses are to be located along
Dominick Street.
• 
Primary building entrances are to be located along
Dominick Street.
• 
Building siting should reinforce the urban street
framework along Dominick Street.
• 
Locate building amenity areas and commercial uses
along the Riverwalk.
•  Secondary building entrances are to be located
along the Riverwalk.

88 

Lincoln Yards Master Plan

Access
• 
Integrate accessible pedestrian connections between
the buildings from Dominick Street to the Riverwalk.
•  Where possible, locate vehicular access points for
parking and loading from areas north and south
of the buildings.
•  Site constraints such as the River and bridge
conditions may require alternative access points from
Dominick Street.
• 
Locate dedicated drop-off zones adjacent to primary
building entrances on Dominick Street
•  The parking for the commercial buildings is primarily
located in a shared parking garage on Parcel A.3.
Iconic Sites
• 
Parcel E.1 located south of Cortland Street, at the
bend in the river, is an important, iconic site. As a
highly visible location, the building design requires a
higher design expectation.

 Kingsbury Corridor
Character Zone
Located between Kingsbury Street and the central open
space in Lincoln Yards North, the Kingsbury Corridor is
a primarily residential zone that serves as a transition
in use and building height to the Clybourn Avenue
Corridor and Lincoln Park neighborhood. Defined by a
continuous pattern of buildings that reinforce active
pedestrian life along the street and mid-block pathways
that connect to LY North Park. Widely spaced, smallerfootprint residential towers sit on a midrise base that
defines both a park edge and an urban street edge lined
with residential lobbies, neighborhood amenities, and
restaurants. As a transition zone, this area emphasizes
the pedestrian connections from Kingsbury and the
neighborhood areas east through the mid-block
laneways to the central park space. The base of buildings
will be coordinated with the improvements to Kingsbury
Street as designed to provide parking, drop-off for car
sharing and public transit stops where appropriate.

Bounded by the River, Cortland Street, a reconfigured
Elston Avenue and the extension of the 606 Trail, the
West Riverfront Zone represents an extraordinary
opportunity to enhance pedestrian connectivity between
Bucktown, Wicker Park and the Metra Exchange. Future
development will extend amenities and experiences
in Lincoln Yards across the River, while creating an
iconic urban gateway to the North Branch. Located
at a pivotal site between the river and multiple transit
choices, the development of the site should consider
ways to seamlessly and safely connect these by utilizing
landscaped terraces that are setback from the river
while optimizing solar access and provide outdoor
rooftop spaces.

Located along the future extension of Dominick Street,
the corridor has a prominent building address and direct
adjacency to the large recreational park in Lincoln Yards
South. Here, a continuous pedestrian experience from
Lincoln Yards North will be reinforced by its outlook to
the riverfront and large publicly accessible park.
The South Dominick Corridor will be a unique experience
within Lincoln Yards with its own character and identity.
Its western edge will be defined by retail and active
uses along the base of buildings. This formal street
address will frame the large park to the east by creating
a podium of about 4-6 floors which relates to the
pedestrian areas in a human context. Residential and
office towers are setback from the streetwall and open
the sky above it. Its eastern edge will flow seamlessly
from the new bridge crossing the river, to the park and
the South Riverfront District.

 South Riverfront District
Character Zone
The South Riverfront District has a unique relationship
with the river that defines its eastern boundary and the
large recreational park to the north. It also bridges the
gap between the natural experience along the riverfront,
existing businesses and the urban fabric of Lincoln Yards.
This district will be a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented place
lined with a mix of uses, restaurants, and shopping,
along an internal network of smaller-scaled laneways.
A series of small blocks allow for turning corners
frequently, creating a pleasant walking experience with
a mix of active uses that feeds sidewalks with activity
throughout the day. The South Riverfront will establish
its own distinct identity as a memorable mixed-use
waterfront district defined by lower-scaled buildings
and sustained by a mix of uses that feeds streets with
activity throughout the day. Varying scales of outdoor
spaces and pedestrian-oriented laneways are woven
throughout the district and connect the riverfront
and park spaces, which can host gatherings, festivals,
performances and public art as well as the day-to-day
needs of residents, workers and visitors.

and integrated into the overall building façade.

 Master Plan
Framework:
Phasing
The phasing plan for Lincoln
Yards is intended to align
infrastructure, transportation, and
development. Implementation of
key infrastructure projects and
expanded transportation systems
will be coordinated with the City.
The phasing strategy is divided into
four geographic zones to directly
tie infrastructure projects with
adjacent development.

 Development and
Infrastructure Alignment
Multiple infrastructure projects have been identified
outside of the Planned Development boundaries.
Many of these improvements will be addressing
existing constraints and needs within the North
Branch Framework Plan. The off-site infrastructure
projects include roadway improvements, bridge
repairs, and transportation expansions.
The full development of Lincoln Yards will likely occur
over the next 10+ years.
The Lincoln Yards master plan illustrates the
aspirations and design strategies for a vibrant
urban place and synthesizes many of the access
and transportation improvements identified in the
North Branch Framework Plan, including certain off
site improvements.
As future plans are carried forward, continued
coordination with city agencies will be necessary
to achieve the maximum public benefit for
the community.

 Initial Phase Development
Extending south from CH Robinson on the north end
of the site, two new office buildings and a shared
parking garage are proposed as the initial phase
of development.
Several infrastructure investments are planned to
support this phase. These include the extension of
Dominick to Cortland, the construction of Armitage
Avenue from Dominick to Southport, and street
improvements to both Southport and Dickens.
The existing riverwalk will be extended to meet
Cortland Street, and additional landscaped, outdoor
plaza areas will connect pedestrians from Dominick
Street to the river.
