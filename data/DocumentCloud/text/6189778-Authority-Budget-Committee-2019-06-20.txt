SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM

TO:

Budget Committee Members

FROM:

Greg Stevens, Acting Associate Director, Federal and State Grants Unit

DATE:

June 20, 2019

RE:

State Program Appropriations:
SFY20 Violence Prevention and Street Intervention Programming

Illinois’s SFY20 State budget includes $12,000,000 for Violence Prevention and Street Intervention
Programming (VP-SIP). Staff recommends that approximately $10,800,000 be made available to
support programming for related violence prevention activities. We anticipate that more than one Notice
of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will be let. One NOFO will be a maximum of $2,250,000 for
Metropolitan Family Services to conduct violence prevention activities within the City of Chicago. We
anticipate that a second NOFO will be let in July 2019 with a start date during Quarter 2. Designations
as a result of these NOFOs will be presented at a future Budget Committee meeting.
Available funds are anticipated to be:
• A maximum of $4,500,000 for municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or greater;
• A maximum of $3,600,000 for municipalities with a population less than 1,000,000 in DuPage,
Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will, and Cook Counties; and
• A maximum of $2,700,000 for municipalities not in DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, Will, and
Cook Counties.
