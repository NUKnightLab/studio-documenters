EXPLANATION

The Chicago Housing Authority?s Plan for Transformation represents a new beginning for public
housing in Chicago. The CHA has partnered with since 2005 to establish education and
training programs for CHA residents and families living in the private market with a Housing
Choice Voucher who have a right of return. In 201], CHA expanded the target population to
allow all Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) participants to enroll in through the IGA. The goal
of the has been to support self-suf?ciency for families by creating a continuum of education
and training Opportunities that allow residents to advance over time to progressively higher
levels of education, and obtain certi?cation and employment that should ultimately result in
better paying careers in areas of economic importance.

Under the IGA, existing degree and certi?cation programs have continued to be made available
to CHA residents at no cost in a variety of industries. In addition, CHA and have
collaborated to develop specialized training programs Pathways to Green Jobs) that have
enabled residents nwding more extensive educational support to move towards entry into degree
and certi?cation programs or directly to employment. This IGA also provides funding for three

2?5

part-time coordinators at who are dedicated to support residents as they attend educational
programs. coordinators assist residents with navigating enrollment procedures, help
residents with decision making about educational and employment tracks and ensure continued
attendance in educational programs through tutoring and retention services. In 2012, the
IGA will continue to provide for the delivery of educational services to CHA residents at a
variety of educational levels as well? as to provide support while residents are engaged in
educational activities.

staff dedication and CHA participants? desire to achieve self-suf?ciency is demonstrated
by 2011 program outcomes. As of December 20, 2011, 233 residents have completed a
degree/certi?cate program and an additional 108 are currently enrolled in programs. In addition,
93% of 2011 program registrants have completed or still remain in their degree/certi?cate
program, an 8% increase in retention from 2010. staff have conducted educational sessions
with case management providers FamilyWorks), and over 510 residents have attended
an orientation.

Based on the foregoing, it is in the best interest of the CHA to authorize the Chief Executive
Of?cer, or his designee, to enter into an IGA with the City Colleges of Chicago for the period of
January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 in an amount not-to-exceed $1,000,000.
