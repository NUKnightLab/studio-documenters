6 Map of NEZ New and Rehab Districts

Geographic Limits to the NEZ Area7

An NEZ containing new facilities, rehabilitated facilities, or a combination of both shall not
exceed 15% of the total acreage contained within the boundaries of the LGU. An NEZ
containing only homestead facilities shall not exceed 10% of the total acreage contained within
the boundaries of the LGU. As we have tracked, the City of Detroit is well within its limits
(approximately 40%) of the allowable NEZ new and rehab zone allocation.

Conversely, an NEZ containing only homestead facilities shall not exceed 10% of the total
acreage contained within the boundaries of the LGU. if approved by the board of commissioners
of the county or a county executive, if the county has an elected or appointed county executive,
the homestead facility NEZ can contain up to 15% of the total acreage of the so, an
additional 5% would be permitted if approved by the County Executive. To our knowledge
(LPD) the Wayne County Executive has not granted the City an approval for the extra 5% and it
appears the City of Detroit is near its 10% discretionary limit of NEZ Homestead zones.

Local Government Process to Designate a New and Rehab NEZ8

1. The governing body of a quali?ed local unit of government by resolution may
designate one or more NEZs within that local governmental unit. The NEZ must contain,
at a minimum, platted parcels of land and the land must be compact and contiguous.
Minimum number of parcels and maximum percent of acreage vary depending on type of

designation.

2. Written notice is provided to the assessor and to the governing body of each taxing
unit not less than 60 days before passing the resolution designating a NEZ.

3. The governing body makes a ?nding that the proposed NEZ is consistent with the

master plan, neighborhood preservation and economic development goals of the local
governmental unit.

4. The governing body adopts a statement of the local unit of govemment?s goals,
objectives and policies relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement and
development of housing for all persons regardless of income level living within the
proposed NEZ.

5. The governing body passes a housing inspection ordinance that, at a minimum,
requires that before the sale of a unit in a new or rehabilitated facility for which a NEZ
certi?cate is in effect, an inspection is made of the unit to determine compliance with any
local construction or safety codes and that a sale may not be ?nalized until there is
compliance with those local codes.

6. The governing body holds a public hearing not later than 45 days after the date the
notice is sent but before acting upon resolution.
7. Assessor determines and furnishes the governing body the amount of true cash

value of the property located within the proposed NEZ and any other information
considered necessary by the governing body.

8. The clerk of the governing body noti?es the state tax commission of resolution
passage, including a copy of the resolution and a listing of each parcel located in the
NEZ, showing parcel code numbers and addresses.

Unlike the NEZ New and Rehab Certi?cates, the LGU, via the assessing of?ce, has ?nal
authority in approving homestead NEZ certi?cates. The resolution approving the application
must include the number of years the LGU is granting the abatement.

An individual or entity may apply with the Assessors Of?ce if the following conditions are met
for:

A New Facility as de?ned by the following in the NEZ statute:

$5,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is less.

I $7,500.00 per non owner-occupied unit or 50% of the true cash value, whichever is
less.

- Improvements done by the owner and not a licensed contractor and the cost of the

materials would be in excess of $3,000.00 per owner-occupied unit or $4,500.00 per non
owner?occupied unit and will bring the structure into conformance with minimum local
building code standards for occupancy or improve the livability of the units while
meeting minimum local building code standards.

- Rehabilitated facility also includes:

0 Units available for rent or lease.

0 An individual condominium unit, in a structure with 1 or more condominium units
that has as its primary purpose residential housing, the owner of which proposes
the above described improvements.

oExisting or proposed condominium units in a quali?ed historic building with 1 or
more existing or proposed condominium units.

oRehabilitated facilities DO NOT include a facility rehabilitated with roceeaiv
afar: insurance policy tar property or casualty loss.

Applying for a Homestead NEZ

A Neighborhood Enterprise ?Homestead?9 Zone covers only pre-existing residential property,
located within a subdivision platted pursuant to state law before January 1, 1968?, thereby
expanding the number of residential facilities that are eligible to receive a Prior to the
amendment of the NEZ act in 2005, there was no provision in the Act that would allow for a
NEZ certi?cates to existing housing that is not in need of substantial renovation.12 Individual
resident homeowners13 in these districts are able to apply with the Finance Assessors Of?ce.

Can an Application for a NEZ Certi?cate be Denied and what is the Term for One?

Once a NEZ zone is established, an eligible applicant can only be denied if said applicant is
found to have delinquent taxes in the jurisdiction or it the applicant submits a faulty application.

The term of a NEZ certi?cate may be for ?a neighborhood enterprise zone certi?cate issued
before January 1, 2006 shall remain in effect for 6 to 12 years and a neighborhood enterprise
zone certi?cate issued after December 31, 2005 shall remain in effect for 6 to 15 years from the
effective date of the certi?cate as determined by the governing body of the local governmental
unit. The governing body of a local governmental unit that issued a neighborhood enterprise
zone certi?cate for a new facility or a rehabilitated facility before January 1, 2006 may extend
the certi?cate for an additional 3 years if the extension is approved by resolution before the
original neighborhood enterprise zone certi?cate expires or after the original certi?cate expires if
the certi?cate expired on or after January 1, 2004 and on or before January 3, 2006.?14

However, ?all or a portion of a quali?ed historic building shall remain in effect for 11 to 17 years
as determined by the governing body of the local governmental unit.?15

Conclusion
The last time the City made any major additions to the City?s NEZ homestead areas was over 10

years ago. Council may recommend that the Assessors Of?ce recommend some modi?cations to
those areas, in order to utilize this provision of the Act to its fullest.

By statute, every NEZ must contain not less than 10 platted parcels of land which are compact
and contiguous. The statute allows for an exception if a NEZ is located in a downtown
revitalization district. In a downtown revitalization district,2 a NEZ may contain less than 10
platted parcels if the platted parcels together contain 10 or more facilities.

THRU: Council Member James Tate, Planning Economic Development Committee
FROM: Gabe Leland 
Council Mani, er
DATE: September 25, 2018
RE: DETROIT 0% INTEREST HOME REPAIR LOAN PROGRAM

1. Once an applicant is approved for a 0% Interest Home Repair Loan, does s/he have a role
in the contractor selection process? If not, why not? If yes, please explain the approved
applicant?s role.

2. Who is required to review sign the contractor?s bid contract document(s)?

3. What is the rational for limiting property owners who are approved for a 0% Interest
Home Repair Loan to hiring only those contractors on the approved City of Detroit
contractor list?

4. Can an approved 0% Interest Home Repair Loan recipient opt-out of hiring a contractor
from the approved City of Detroit contractor list? If yes, what is the opt-out process?
