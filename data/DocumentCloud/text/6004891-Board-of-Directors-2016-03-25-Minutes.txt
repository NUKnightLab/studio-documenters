Revenue
• Most Medicaid monies including Disproportionate
Share Hospital (DSH) payments, Medicaid Fee for
Service (FFS), Benefits Improvement and Protection Act
(BIPA) Funds are based on cost
• They are also based on Cook County Health and
Hospitals System paying the state share of the cost
• Medicaid managed care capitation payments are based
on actuarial soundness
• Medicaid managed care payments to providers are
primarily based on fee schedules
• Accountable Care Act funding was game changer, but
still has challenges

Strategic Discussion March 25, 2016

 Revenue
• Historically the combination of County funding
and the 50% of cost from federal sources
worked
• As the County funding shrinks, the challenge
increases
• ACA, Medicare, Commercial, and Medicaid
MCO patients become key to future success

Stroger Hospital’s Trauma Unit was pleased to host the re-enlistment ceremony of United States Navy Hospital
Corpsman Second Class Jose Tamez on March 12th. Corpsman Tamez is participating in the U.S. Navy/Stroger training
program that provides ongoing trauma training to active duty members of the U.S. Navy. We were honored to have
Senator Richard Durbin join us for the ceremony. Following the ceremony, Senator Durbin toured the trauma unit and
met with the Navy personnel and our trauma team to discuss the program and the impact it has had on both teams.
Chicago Sun Times columnist Mark Brown attended the event. His story (attached) ran on Sunday, March 20th.
Patient Experience Recognition
The difference between CountyCare and other Medicaid managed care plans can be seen very clearly from this story as
told by Rachel Reichlin, Manager of Care Management, CountyCare.
A CountyCare patient was notified that his therapy would be discontinued because his Medicaid benefits were being
terminated as a result of not completing the redetermination process. The patient and facility reached out to Latonja
Simmons-Holmes at the CountyCare Call Center. Ms. Simmons-Holmes was able to connect him with Rachel Reichlin,
Manager of Care Management, CountyCare. The patient was also provided with contact information for Heather
Holberg, Enrollment Manager, CountyCare and Michelle Graham-Brown, Clinical Case Manager, CountyCare. Although
he initially understood that his rede paperwork could be processed in 24hrs, he later learned that it could take 7-10 days.
He informed me (Ms. Reichlin) that the facility would discontinue his PT/OT because his insurance had expired. Then he
met with Daniel, an administrator at the facility. The patient stated, “There are no chiefs and Indians here, he wanted
me to call him Daniel.” The patient informed our team that Daniel was going to reinstate the PT/OT and the care that he
needed. He did inform him that if, for some reason he wasn’t reinstated in Medicaid, the patient would get a bill. Our
patient understood stating, “I know, they have to get paid.” He confirmed that he had no increase or change in income
since his medical condition occurred last year. Ms. Reichlin reinforced Daniel’s message that it was very unlikely that he
wouldn’t be reinstated, though no guarantees. As soon as he is redetermined, it would be retroactive to 3/1 and the care
would be covered. The patient sighed and stated, “you don’t know how much it means to me that you called, thank
you.” He spoke of the mental burden for somebody in his situation to carry the potential of incurring great debt and the
instability in the midst of a health crisis/need.
He went on to say that the staff at the facility he has been receiving care at is really different. They are all passionate
and dedicated and really care. He said, “I’m going to be writing complimentary letters, you should know about the good
ones!” Between the social worker at the facility, the providers, Daniel and Latonja in the call center, he expressed a lot of
gratitude.
This story is indicative of the commitment of the CountyCare team in making the health of our members the first
priority. Few, if any, other managed care plans would go to these lengths to ensure continuity of care regardless of the
member’s insurance status. Rather they likely would have dropped this patient from coverage leaving the individual with
significant medical bills.

 Activities and Announcements
•

The Joint Commission completed its follow-up survey of Stroger Hospital March 11 and
12, 2016. Stroger Hospital’s three year accreditation is effective March 12, 2016.

•

The nation’s first blood bank opened at Cook County Hospital on March 15, 1937. The
blood bank was founded by Dr. Bernard Fantus, an inventive Cook County Hospital
physician. The cost to open the blood bank was $1,500 and it helped facilitate 1,354 blood transfusions in its
first year. The ability to store and transfuse blood has made modern surgery and resuscitation in critical care,
trauma and obstetrics possible.
Today, the blood bank at Stroger Hospital supports more than 15,000 transfusions a year, including over 100
massive (large volume) transfusions for patients with traumatic injuries or hemorrhagic shock from other
causes.
Through the Decades, a daily time capsule of significant events on Decades Network featured the blood bank
last week. View the video here: http://www.decades.com/videos/view/first-blood-bank

•

The new CCHHS Patient Support Center officially opened last week. The new PSC is located on the first floor of
the administration building and has allowed for the entire PSC staff to be centrally located. The PSC is currently
taking more than 2,000 calls daily. Board members are encouraged to join us for a quick visit to the PSC
following today’s board meeting.

•

On Monday, March 7, CCHHS/CountyCare hosted its 4th redetermination event for CountyCare members at the
Lawndale Christian Health Center located at 3860 W. Ogden Avenue in Chicago. More than 50 CountyCare
members attended the event for assistance with redetermination paperwork and other enrollment questions.
Most of the attendees utilize the health centers within the Central Chicago geographical area which included the
CCHHS Fantus and Prieto Health Centers, Lawndale Christian, Esperanza, Access and Alivio Health Centers.
About half of the people who attended were Spanish speakers. Overall, we received extremely positive
feedback from the CountyCare members, with one member who said that her “County” doctors are awesome
and that “..she and her children were born there and it’s a great place”. Our next redetermination event will
take place on Wednesday, April 27th at the CCHHS Cottage Grove Health Center in Ford Heights. In addition, we
are reaching out to Alivio to host an event in April at their Berwyn site.

•

The second issue of the CCHHS community newsletter was sent on March 18th. The distribution list has grown to
approximately 2,400 individuals and organizations.

•

Upcoming Events:

 Legislative Update
State
•

In April, Illinois will begin its 10th month without a comprehensive state budget in place. Despite the lack of a
budget, the state is on pace to spend well over projected revenues. Earlier this month, the Illinois Comptroller
said that the state’s bill backlog could be at $10 billion by June 2016.

•

The Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) reported to a Senate committee that 800 entities contracted
with IDHS are owed more than $168M for services provided since July 1, 2015. Institutions of higher education
have also not been paid since July 1, 2015 and many have announced layoffs and mandatory furlough days in an
effort to keep their doors open.

•

The Illinois Senate passed a $3.8B appropriations bill (SB2059) that would authorize spending for higher
education, MAP grants, and human services programs. SB2059 includes no new revenue. The bill now goes to
the House for consideration.

•

The House will return to Springfield on April 4, 2016 and the Senate returns on April 5, 2016. The General
Assembly is scheduled to adjourn May 31, 2016.

Federal
• In late February, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Letitia Close, Executive Director of
Governmental Affairs, CCHHS, attended the National Association of County Organizations (NACo) Legislative
Conference in Washington, D.C. Cook County presented two Resolutions on behalf of CCHHS to NACo’s Health
Steering Committee.
The first Resolution pertains to Section 1905 of the Social Security Act which prohibits Medicaid from paying for
detainees’ health care when in county facilities even while they are pre-trial and presumed innocent. The
Resolution urges the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to utilize all necessary measures,
including waivers, to enhance flexibility within the Medicaid program to improve the continuity of health care
for justice-involved individuals.
The second Resolution pertains to a proposed regulation on Medicaid Managed Care. Federal
limitations on supplemental payments as described in the proposed rule would inhibit counties’ ability
to serve as safety net providers and provide access to critical health services to their residents. The
Resolution urges CMS to consider modifying the proposed rule to preserve the ability of states to
provide supplemental support to targeted local government providers for services provided to Medicaid
managed care enrollees.
NACo’s Health Steering Committee unanimously approved both Resolutions. The Resolutions have been
presented to NACo’s Policy Committee and will be considered for inclusion in NACo’s National Policy Platform at
the Annual Conference in July 2016.
•

Last month President Obama released his 2017 budget proposals which contained no cuts to Medicaid or key
public health programs. Congress will soon release a budget resolution which will serve as a blueprint for future
Congressional action on the FY2017 budget.
On March 15, 2016 the House Committee on Budget released their budget proposal which would cut close to $7
trillion off the federal deficit over next decade. The proposal repeals Obamacare including Medicaid expansion
and supports a work requirement for Medicaid. The Freedom Caucus has announced their opposition to the
proposal and which is unlikely to pass the House.

The House Committee on Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing earlier this month. The
purpose of the hearing was to discuss the Administration’s Health and Human Services (HHS) budget; however,
members of Congress used the hearing as an opportunity to questions HHS Secretary Burwell on a wide range of
health related matters. Questions focused on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)and
Medicaid expansion in particular. Secretary Burwell mentioned repeatedly that Medicaid expansion saves
money as people are now getting primary and preventative care and emergency rooms use is dropping. A
number of members spoke of the need to innovate, but no specific ideas were shared.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for CCHHS at both the State and Federal level.
