There being a quorum present, Mr. Carroll called the meeting to order at approximately 3:06
p.m. Board members Emmanuel Glover, William Reidy, and Matt Carroll were present. No
Board members were absent. Also present were Todd Greathouse, Brian Kelly, and Daniella
Nunnally of Gateway, as well as Dennis Wilcox and Scott Simpkins as Gateway?s General
Counsel. Present for the County Council was Michael King and for the City of Cleveland Ken
Silliman. Present from the media was Karen Farkas of Clevelandcom and RT Andrews of the
Real Deal Press.

Mr. Carroll opened the meeting by asking if there was any public comment. No public
comment.

Next, was the Executive Director?s report. Mr. Greathouse gave a short narrative on each project.

Mr. Greathouse ?rst discussed security and stated he will be having a meeting with the Cavs and
the Indians on Friday to research a more permanent bollard solution for the streets around the
Gateway facilities and hopes to add this item to the 2018 budget. Mr. Greathouse then discussed
maintenance at the site including ?nishing up a large pour of concrete near Gate A in the plaza.
Because of the use of heavy salts and chemicals, replacement of concrete at the site is a constant
work in process. While Gateway is replacing the large areas of concrete, they are also replacing
the crosswalks in the area to ensure ADA compliance.

Mr. Greathouse then reported on Quicken Loans Arena. He reviewed major capital projects and
passed out printouts of the roof repairs which include the installation of numerous fasteners as
set forth on page three of the handout and as determined based on wind studies. Mr. Greathouse
stated that the ?rst high roof renovations budget of $4,174,050 was previously approved by the
Cuyahoga County Council and the additional budget of $3,060,000 was approved by the
Gateway Board and is pending Cuyahoga County Council approval. Therefore, the total Arena
Roof budget request is for $7,234,050 of which Gateway has paid out $2,289.965 to date.
Gateway is projecting completion of the high roof project by the end of September and is
projecting to be under budget by $271,000. Gateway plans to use the savings from the high roof
of $220,000 as well as the Cavs credit for certain amounts caused by the Arena?s Roof Sign of

$246,000 and savings from other projects in order to proceed with needed lower roof repairs,
thereby avoiding any set up or break down fees from the contractors on site.

Mr. Greathouse next discussed the major capital projects at Progressive Field. He stated that
these projects were going well and closeouts were in process for six different projects: 1)
(2) safety and security systems; (3) suite and press box glazing; (4) high steel painting;
(5) concrete resurfacing; and (6) ?eld lighting system. With regard to HVAC, Gateway is in
closeout on Phase I of the HVAC project and is 95 percent complete for Phase II. There are two
areas comprised of the executive of?ces where the contractor will be installing two more air
handling units in the off season. The safety and security project is also 95 percent complete and,
other than tweaking some cameras and doors, the project will be closed out soon. The suite and
press box glazing is likewise at 95 percent complete and will be closing out in the next couple of
weeks. The high steel painting is on-going and there will be continued painting throughout the
season and well into the spring. Concrete resurfacing continues with areas in the upper
concourse needing addressed now. The ?eld lighting system project is ongoing and once some
minor issues regarding controls are corrected, Gateway should be making the ?nal payment. He
noted there is a 20-year warranty on the Field Lights. It is anticipated that the potential total
savings on all of the projects could be as much as $774,000, which would need to be Spent per
budget by December 2018. Mr. Greathouse will be working with Gateway?s consulting engineer
to make recommendations as to where the money should be invested.

The next item of business was to approve the minutes of the May 4, 2017 meeting. Upon motion
made by Mr. Reidy, and seconded by Mr. Glover, the minutes of the May 4, 2017 Board meeting
were unanimously approved.

Ms. Nunnally then gave the inclusion report which included handouts to the Board. Ms.
Nunnally began the report by discussing the Ballpark concrete resurfacing project. Out of the
$1,500,000 budget for the project, $474,670 has been spent to date. Ms. Nunnally then discussed
the status of the MBE, FBE and CSB percentage goals and current actual percentages. Mr.
Carroll asked where Gateway would end up on this issue. Mr. Greathouse stated that the lower
CSB percentage to date is likely the result of the fact that Gateway?s engineer stated that the
resurfacing project did not need as much waterproo?ng as initially contemplated. On the high
steel paint project, the budget is $2,184,230 and $427,755 has been spent to date and the MBE,
FBE and CSB goals are being met. Mr. Greathouse also added that Gateway does not double
count on MBE, FBE and CSB reporting even if a contractor may qualifying for more than one
category. Ms. Nunnally then moved on to discussing the QLA roof, stating that of the
$4,174,050 budget, $1,960,598 has been spent and MBE, FBE and CSB percentages are on
course to meet the Gateway community bene?t goals. At the conclusion of Ms. Nunnally?s
presentation, Mr. Carroll asked if there were any questions and there were none.

Mr. Kelly then gave the ?nancial reports. He ?rst presented a statement as of July 31, 2017 of
the Operating Account with a $192,383 beginning balance on July 1, $1,092,747 in total receipts,
$1,100,455 total disbursements for the month, and a July 31 balance of $184,674. Mr. Kelly
reminded the Board that July payments included over one million dollars for property taxes and
the business improvement district assessments.

He then reviewed the ballpark capital account for the month of July 2017. He reported the
opening balance to be $124,761, with $150,500 total receipts, $188,509 total disbursements, and
an ending balance of $86,751.

Mr. Kelly then reviewed the 3-month projections for August-October showing a total account
balance as of August 1 of $184,674. Anticipated revenues equal $701,988. The estimated
balance as of October 31, 2017 before disbursements is $886,662. The forecasted disbursements
are $800,702, for an estimated operating account balance as of October 31, 2017 of $85,960.
Mr. Kelly noted that the forecast takes into account that the employee parking lot expenses were
more signi?cant than initially budgeted for safety personnel including off-duty CPD.

equal $2,480,984. Total receipts from 2014 through 2017 equal $40,277,531.
