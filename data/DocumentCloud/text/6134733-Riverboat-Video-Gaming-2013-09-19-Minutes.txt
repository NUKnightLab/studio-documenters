PUBLIC COMMENTRARY –
•

Tom Swoik, Illinois Casino Gaming Association –

Mr. Swoik addressed the Board and represented the casinos in voicing their opinion that 24 hour
gaming should be legalized.

 GOOD MORNING. I AM HERE THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE
OPERATING CASINOS IN THE STATE AND WE APPRECIATE THE BOARD’S
DECISION TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF 24 HOUR GAMING AND
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE INDUSTRY’S POSITION ON THIS IMPORTANT
ISSUE. DUE TO THE UNITY OF THE INDUSTRY ON THIS ISSUE, AND IN THE
INTEREST OF TIME, IT WAS DECIDED THAT I WOULD BE THE SOLE PRESENTER ON
BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY. MY SOLE PRESENCE HERE SHOULD NOT BE
INTERPRETED AS A LACK OF INTEREST OR CONCERN BY THE INDUSTRY.
TODAY I WILL ADDRESS THE BENEFITS OF 24 HOUR GAMING. I WILL ALSO
ADDRESS SOME POINTS I BELIEVE YOU WILL HEAR TODAY FROM OPPONENTS OF
24 HOUR GAMING.
AS YOU ARE AWARE, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GAMBLING
EXPANSION IN THE STATE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE REALITY IS THE
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUFFERING. THE REVENUES OF THE ORIGINAL 9
OPERATING CASINOS AND THEREFORE THE SUPPORT TO THE STATE AND LOCAL
COMMUNITIES HAVE DECREASED BY OVER 38% SINCE 2007 AND WE HAVE LOST
OVER 2000 JOBS. IN RESPONSE TO THIS DROP, THE CASINO INDUSTRY MUST
LOOK AT OPTIONS TO INCREASE REVENUES FOR THE INDUSTRY, THE STATE AND
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.
LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS IS NOT AN EXPANSION OF GAMING. THERE ARE NO NEW
FACILITIES AND THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A POSITIVE BUSINESS DECISION, BETTER UTILIZE
RESOURCES ALREADY AVAILABLE, CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND MAXIMIZE
REVENUE TO OUR BUSINESSES AND THE STATE.
ESTIMATED ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE STATE INCLUDE:
• FOR EVERY 1% INCREASE IN STATEWIDE AGR, THERE WILL BE IN EXCESS
OF $5 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL TAXES PAID TO THE STATE.
• RIVERS CASINO ALONE HAS ESTIMATED THAT THEIR REVENUES WOULD
INCREASE APPROXIMATELY 3%, WHICH WOULD GENERATE ABOUT $7.2
MILLION IN ADDITIONAL TAXES.
THIS PROPOSAL WILL ALSO ASSIST IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BY
INCREASING TOURISM AND REVENUES. I HAVE FORWARDED YOU LETTERS OF
SUPPORT FROM THE CHICAGOLAND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE
ILLINOIS HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION, AND I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM THE ILLINOIS STATE CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE.
OUR REQUEST FOR 24 HOUR GAMING IS NOT PROPOSING A MANDATE FOR ALL
LOCATIONS TO STAY OPEN. WE ARE SIMPLY REQUESTING THE OPTION TO DO SO.

2

 THE ADDITIONAL HOURS OF OPERATION WILL CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AT
THE LOCATIONS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE.
• FOR EXAMPLE, RIVERS CASINO ESTIMATES INCREASING STAFF BY 44
WITH ESTIMATED ANNUAL SALARIES OF $2.2 MILLION
24 HOUR GAMING ALREADY EXISTS IN ILLINOIS WITH THE OPERATION OF VIDEO
GAMBLING AT TRUCK STOPS.
• FIRST, THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE AS MUCH REVENUE FROM TRUCK
STOPS AS THEY DO CASINOS BECAUSE WE PAY A HIGHER TAX RATE.
• ALSO, GAMBLING AT TRUCK STOPS IS HAPPENING IN A FAR LESS
REGULATED ENVIRONMENT THAN IN CASINOS, WHICH ARE IN A MUCH
BETTER POSITION TO PREVENT PROBLEM GAMBLING AND ENFORCE
GAMING BOARD REGULATIONS AT ALL TIMES.
• FOR EXAMPLE, WE SUPPORT THE STATEWIDE SELF-EXCLUSION PROGRAM.
ILLINOIS CASINOS TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND ARE PENALIZED IF
THEY VIOLATE THE RULES OF THE PROGRAM. YET, THOSE WHO HAVE
ENROLLED IN OUR SELF-EXCLUSION PROGRAM ARE FREE TO GAMBLE AT
THESE 24 HOUR TRUCK STOPS. THERE, THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE VENUE
FACE NO FINE OR PENALTY.
• 24 HOUR GAMING IS ALSO AVAILABLE VIA ADVANCED DEPOSIT
WAGERING AT RACETRACKS, WHERE PEOPLE CAN PLACE BETS VIA THE
INTERNET OR OVER THE PHONE 24/7, AND 24 HOUR IS ALSO AVAILABLE
VIA INTERNET GAMING, WHETHER LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY AND WHICH
MAY BE LEGALIZED IN ILLINOIS IN THE FUTURE.
NOT ONLY DO OUR CASINOS FACE COMPETITION WITHIN THE STATE BUT 24
HOUR GAMING IS ALREADY AVAILABLE IN EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE
COUNTRY INCLUDING OUR BORDERING COMPETITORS IN INDIANA, MISSOURI,
WISCONSIN AND IOWA. ILLINOIS CASINOS ARE CURRENTLY COMPETING AT A
DISADVANTAGE. 24 HOUR GAMING WILL ALLOW OUR CASINOS TO OPERATE
WITH THE SAME STRUCTURE AS THEIR COMPETITORS.
YOU WILL HEAR TODAY ABOUT THE SOCIAL ILLS ASSOCIATED WITH GAMBLING.
SOME WILL SAY BEING OPEN 24 HOURS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR
EFFORTS TO THWART COMPULSIVE GAMBLING. WE HAVE WORKED WITH
BENSINGER DUPONT AND ASSOCIATES, AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY
RESEARCH OR DATA TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION.
FURHER, THE CASINO INDUSTRY IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO CONTROL AND
REGULATE PROBLEM GAMBLING. AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, ALL ILLINOIS
CASINOS SUPPORT THE STATEWIDE SELF-EXCLUSION PROGRAM, WHICH IS NOT
IN EFFECT AT ANY OF THE VIDEO GAMING ESTABLISHMENTS.
ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED THE PROBLEM GAMBLER HOT LINE SINCE
1996 AND THOSE SERVICES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE 24/7.

3

 THE CASINO INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE GAMING BOARD ARE ALSO MEMBERS
OF THE ILLINOIS ALLIANCE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING, A GROUP COMPRISED OF
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY, SERVICE PROVIDERS, GAMBLING
REGULATORS AND OTHERS WHO SHARE A COMMON INTEREST TO EDUCATE ON
THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF PROBLEM GAMBLING, TO PREVENT UNDERAGE
PLAY, AND TO COORDINATE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TO ASSIST
PROBLEM GAMBLERS, THEIR FAMILIES AND THE PUBLIC.
LASTLY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL IGB REGULATIONS WILL REMAIN
IN PLACE AND WILL BE ENFORCED AT ALL TIMES. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME WILL
SAY BEING OPEN 24 HOURS WILL CAUSE DRINKING PROBLEMS. IGB RULES
CURRENTLY ALLOW US TO SERVE LIQUOR ONLY FROM 9:30 A.M. TO 4:00 A.M.OR
UNTIL 1 HOUR BEFORE CLOSING IF CLOSING IS BEFORE 4:00 A.M. THIS WILL NOT
CHANGE.
IN CONCLUSION, THIS PROPOSAL FOR 24 HOUR GAMBLING IS CONSISTENT WITH
THE RIVERBOAT GAMBLING ACT WHICH STATES:
“THIS ACT IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS BY ASSISTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTING
ILLINOIS TOURISM AND BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES
AVAILABLE TO THE STATE TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT EDUCATION.”
WE BELIEVE 24 HOUR GAMING MEETS THE LEGISLATIVE GOALS OF THIS
STATUTE BY:
• INCREASING STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE BY KEEPING
BUSINESS IN THE STATE
• BOOSTING LOCAL TOURISM
• CREATING JOB OPPORTUNITIES
• AND SINCE AGENTS ARE CURRENTLY AT THE CASINOS 24/7 THERE
WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE STATE.
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT AND WE SEEK YOUR
APPROVAL TO OFFER 24 HOUR GAMING.

Anita Bedell, Illinois Church Action on Alcohol & Addiction Problems -

Ms. Bedell addressed the Board and voiced her opinion opposing 24 hour gaming.
I ask the Illinois Gaming Board to oppose 24 hour, non-stop gambling at the casinos. This is not
about staying open two hours longer, it is about round the clock gambling, with no break in the
action.
A Chicago Sun-Times article on January 14, 2013, addressed an issue of concern about
casinos never closing—Children left alone. A grandmother left her four grandchildren, ages 8
months, 1, 8, and 11 outside the Hollywood Casino in Aurora while she went inside to play the
slots. She couldn’t resist! It was one of 52 incidents involving 85 children left unsupervised at

4

 Illinois casinos between January 1, 2010 and July 31, 2012. How many more incidents have
gone unreported, and how many more children will be left alone if the casinos never close?
A 2011 study by scientists in the United States and Singapore using MRI scans, found
that in sleep deprived individuals, the part of the brain tasked with assessing positive economic
outcomes was over-activated, while the part tasked with assessing negative outcomes was
depressed. In other words, gambling in the early hours of the morning is particularly risky,
according to the scientists, who have found that sleep deprivation makes people more likely
to think they will win. Extending the hours would negatively impact problem and pathological
gamblers who are the most vulnerable.
I have also heard of instances where gamblers use illicit stimulant drugs to stay awake so
they can gamble 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, or longer. This is a danger to the gambler and to
the public.
Professor Earl Grinols, in independent studies, estimated that three-eighths to one-half of
casino revenue will come from problem and pathological gamblers. The Illinois Gaming Board
conducted a survey of casino gamblers one time and found that 15 to 20 percent of all gamblers
accounted for half of all visits. The increase in revenue from round the clock gambling would
come from problem and pathological gamblers.
A few years ago, I met a couple whose 27 year old son took his life following a casino
gambling binge at an Illinois casino. His parents wrote that once he gambled for 30 hours at a
casino in Wisconsin. “Those extra few hours of action might simply be a convenience for some,
but it will be a death sentence for others. So please don’t do this. The casinos want to increase
profits, but you must also include the cost of gambling addiction. . . . At our house, the price is
insurmountable.”
I know a woman who spoke before this Board several years ago, whose husband began
drinking when he gambled and lost at Illinois casinos. He had several DUIs and lost his driver’s
license. A 1997 study by the Louisiana Insurance commissioner found that the highest rates of
injury due to drunk- driving crashes occurred in parishes that surround the state’s casinos.
According to a new report, Why Casinos Matter, “the new regional casinos depend
decisively on attracting gamblers who live in the region.” Most people drive to Illinois casinos,
some of which are located in densely populated areas. Allowing 24 hour gambling and drinking
at casinos will impact public safety.
According to Dr. Valerie Lorenz, a pioneer in treatment for gambling addiction in
Baltimore, addicted gamblers drive like drunk drivers. Addicted gamblers seem more hurried
and take more risks during their heavier gambling activity. Common civil violations include
speeding, reckless driving, driving without a license or with a suspended license, driving with no
insurance, and driving under unsafe conditions.
Alcohol impairs judgment. The combination of alcohol and gambling has lead to serious
suicide attempts. I have spoken with gambling addicts who closed their eyes while driving in the
hopes that they would have a car crash so their families could collect money from an insurance
policy. If the casinos never close, we can expect more fatalities and injuries.

 There were 10, 219 gamblers on the Self-Exclusion list at casinos last week, with 3,280
incidents of self-excluded gamblers getting caught at Illinois casinos. The son of one of the
people on this list, who continued to gamble undetected, e-mailed you a letter and said, “If you
allow riverboat casinos to stay open for 24 hours, what plan would you have for protecting
Illinois citizens from turning into addicts? Illinois did not protect my mother. . . . The reality is
the amount of time she will be able to work is limited, and if she can't work, and she has no
savings left, will Illinois be forced to care for her as she ages? Certainly, she would have been
self-sufficient had Illinois been more diligent in monitoring these casinos. . . . How many
thousands of others have similar stories? How many thousands more will become addicts if they
never have to leave Illinois casinos? We all know the state is desperate for revenue, but
how desperate?
Please follow the precedence set by previous Gaming Boards and reject 24 hour casino
gambling. Do not make Illinois the Las Vegas of the Midwest.

Kathy Gilroy –
Ms. Gilroy addressed the Board and voiced her opinion in opposing 24 hour gaming.
Good morning, Chairman Jaffe, Board members, and staff. My name is Kathy Gilroy. I
request that you maintain the requirement that Illinois casinos close for two hours each
day.
With many addictions, such as smoking and drinking, as the dangers have become
known, more and more protections have been put in place to protect potential addicts,
their families, co-workers, and neighbors. For example, smoking is no longer allowed in
public places, even casinos. Drinking is not allowed in cars, and taverns must close by
certain hours.
The same increase in protections should be taking place for gambling. Unfortunately,
protections for potential gambling addicts, their families, co-workers, and neighbors have
been lessened over the years. When riverboat gambling was first approved, a limit on the
amount of money that could be lost, such as Missouri and Iowa had, was proposed, but
somehow left out of the final legislation. When Illinois casinos first opened, the timing
of cruises caused a natural break in the “zone” for gamblers. However, cruising has been
eliminated. Less-addictive table games have been replaced by more-addictive slot
machines. Even slot machines themselves, changing from mechanical to electronic, have
become more efficient at separating gamblers from their money. Vouchers have replaced
coins, meaning that gamblers no longer have to wait for someone to pay them a jackpot.
Protections for gamblers are being whittled away one at a time.
That is why it is so important that you not allow Illinois casinos to remain open roundthe-clock. This is not about just two more hours of gambling. This is about allowing
gamblers to continue gambling non-stop for days. Casinos are implying that they may
remain open 24 hours on only certain occasions. However, holidays are dangerous times
for potential addicts. On holidays, people often drink too much, and they may not have
to go to work the next morning. When potential addicted gamblers are forced to leave at

6

 closing time, it is an interruption in the what‘s called the “zone”. Who is at casinos at
6:00 a.m., 7:00 a.m., or 8:00 a.m.? Maybe a few shift workers. But, more likely addicted
gamblers. The extra revenue that Illinois casinos are hoping to garner from gamblers
during those two hours and the subsequent hours and days they stay there would be off
the backs of those in the throes of their gambling addictions. There may be no studies on
it. But, no thinking person can deny it.
Just Monday, the Chicago Tribune ran a story about a rabbi who was so addicted to
gambling that he had self-excluded himself from casinos in three states. His addiction
was so strong that after being arrested at a casino for trespassing, he still could not resist
the urge to gamble again. At a conference of our national organization, I roomed with
one of the speakers. She had been a young, ambitious lawyer in New York, representing
victims of 9/11. Her stress-reducing trips to gamble in Connecticut casinos turned into a
gambling addiction so gripping that she would go days without eating or sleeping. She
once gambled for five days without stopping, gambling away client funds. She passed
out at the tables. She survived on orange juice and Snickers bars that casino staff gave
her. She played seven hands of blackjack at a time, taking an entire table, and losing
$5,000 per hour. After serving time in jail, she now sells jewelry for a living.
Illinois casinos want gambling addicts like her to provide them with more profit. Don’t
let them. You’ve denied them before. You have responsibility over an addictive
activity. Truck-stops should have slot machines turned off for two hours. That would
level the playing field in the right direction, providing more protection for Illinois
gamblers. Illinois gamblers deserve a break today and every day. Please, do the right
thing. Thank you.
•

Melynda Litchfield Ms. Litchfield addressed the Board and staff gave a brief summary how her life has
changed the last 3 years from her gambling addiction. Ms. Litchfield is opposed to 24
hour gambling. She reiterated that the casinos should not have 24 hour gambling; the 2
to 4 hour window when the casinos close give the problem gamblers time to back out of
the situation and go home and collect themselves and give them a little time of self
reflection. If the casinos stay open 24 hours a day the gambler can go non-stop without
interruption.

•

Jim Blue, Illinois Church Action on Alcohol & Addiction Problems –
Mr. Blue voiced his opinion in opposing 24 hour gaming. He stated how problem
gambling will become more severe with 24 hour gaming. He also voiced his opinion on
the legality of truck stops not needing liquor licenses and legally hosting video gaming
whereas other licensees are required to have a liquor license.

Chris Anderson, Director, Gambling Recovery Center of Illinois –
Mr. Anderson addressed the Board and staff and strongly opposes 24 hour gaming. Mr.
Anderson went on to explain the benefits to the problem gambler of the casinos closing
for a period of 4 hours.

•

Rev. Bill Bryan, Board Member of Illinois Church Action on Alcohol and Addiction
Problems –
Pastor Bryan addressed the Board and voiced his opinion opposing 24 hour gaming.
I am Pastor Bill Bryan, an ordained minister on the staff of Grace United Methodist in
Naperville. I am also a member of the Board of Illinois Church Action on Alcohol and
Addiction Problems (ILCAAAP).
I come before you today to urge you not to approve the requests of two of our casinos for
24 hour operation.
Allowing round the clock operation for any of the casinos you license and monitor would
only lead to greater problems for our state and especially for the local municipalities and
communities in which they are located. The original legislative action authorizing the
establishment of river boat casinos required that they cruise and dock every four hours
with no gambling to be conducted while they were docked. Thus, the many problems
associated with unlimited gambling were acknowledged. Now these safeguards have
been lifted, and allowing round the clock operation will remove yet another safeguard. In
addition, allowing some of the casinos to have 24 hour operation will undoubtedly
prompt other casinos to demand the same out of “fairness”.
With unlimited time for gambling, some compulsive gamblers will continue to play for
many hours – possibly 36, 52 or 72 hours-until all their money is gone and their credit is
used up as well. Thus, a policy decision on the part of you, the Board, would be
contributing to more bankruptcy and poverty among our citizens. And this would be
done with the highest percent of the profit going to the companies and the casino owners
with a very small percentage coming back to the state. The additional gambling hours
would place many persons at greater risk while benefitting only a few.
Surely we do not want to approve a policy that would lead to the developing of more
problem pathological gamblers. Over 10,000 persons are currently on the self-exclusion
list in Illinois. I appeal to the Board to not take any action that would increase the size of
this list.
There is also the problem of drinking alcohol at the casinos. Persons who have lost large
sums of money are likely to drink heavily out of frustration. In Illinois, the casinos are
located in densely populated areas. Increased hours will place more drivers with
impaired judgment and slower reflexes on our streets and highways. This will affect
public safety. More law enforcement would be required.

8

 Rather than adding operational hours to any of the casinos, the 24 hour gambling at the
truck stops in the state should be stopped. Such action would end the “advantage” that
those businesses now have over the casinos.
We realize that your task is not easy. Thank you for your hard work on behalf of the
people of Illinois. But do please make the protection of the financial and personal well
being of our citizens your highest consideration.
Thank you for the privilege of speaking before you.

Karen Hayes, Illinois Family Institute –
Ms. Hayes addressed the Board and voiced her opinion opposing 24 hour gaming.
Chairman and members of the Illinois Gaming board – My name is Karen Hayes, and I’m
here today on behalf of the Illinois Family Institute to strongly urge you to again reject
any attempt to embrace round-the-clock legalized casino gambling.
As our public gatekeeper of legalized gambling in Illinois, we appeal to you to firmly
oppose removing the very minimal gambling hour limits currently in place. Keeping a
definitive end to the day of casino gamblers avoids troubling non-stop never-ending
round-the-clock access, temptation and exploitation of the most vulnerable gamblers
which include senior citizens, women and young adults. There would be nothing to stop
problem gamblers from literally gambling for days.
To be clear, as a statewide non-profit and non-partisan pro-family ministry, firm reliance
on time-tested Judeo-Christian principles is the foundation of what we support and
advocate as good public policy. This includes Jesus’ admonition that we can’t serve both
God and money, and the Apostle Paul’s warning that the “. . . the love of money is a root
of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and
pierced themselves with many griefs.” Today those griefs include the harmful
consequences to Illinois families. I know a former addicted gambler whose young family
was directly threatened as a result of his out-of-control gambling. The threat wasn’t
theoretical, it wasn’t speculative, it wasn’t included in any study, and there were no
public hearings about it – but it happened right here in Illinois.
Gambling which was once widely accepted as vice and plainly understood to be harmful
to individuals, families, and local communities, has already been expanded beyond
anyone’s imagination in just a few years. Unfettered access to legalized casino gambling
despite the increased harm is a bad bet for Illinois, and should continue to be roundly
rejected.
It’s easy to foresee the causes and effects of non-stop gambling:
Non-stop round-the-clock access to legalized casino gambling will promote more
gambling addiction;

9

 Which will cause more harm to Illinois individuals and families;
Which will result in increased social costs, at a rate of $3 for every $1 gambled;
Which will lead to more “revenue enhancements”/taxes;
Which will put an even heavier burden on Illinois families;
Which will increase desperation and lead to more non-stop round-the-clock gambling.
In other words, this bad bet fosters more bad bets. Any hope of an increase to the socalled “entertainment value” of non-stop round-the-clock legalized gambling just isn’t
worth the non-stop round-the-clock price we will all share.
If I may add another timely concern I think for all Illinois citizens-Just two months ago,
Pew Research Center announced findings of economists Douglas M. Walker and Peter T.
Calcagno; and the bottom line was reported as this: “When casinos come to town, an
increase in public corruption is likely to follow.” Furthermore, “Mississippi led the list
(of most corrupt states)…followed by Louisiana, Illinois and South Dakota. At the same
time, none of the five states with the lowest corruption rates had legalized casino
gambling during the study period.”
With due respect, it’s hard to fathom any serious regulation if all time constraints are
thrown out. This proposal only increases the favored odds of profiteers and decreases the
odds of their necessary losers, and it will be even more harmful to Illinois families. In
fact, with such minimal, lenient hour restrictions currently in place, this Gaming Board
may do well to seriously consider rolling them back instead,
Thank you for considering our concerns.

Clarence Rak –
Mr. Rak addressed the Board and voiced his opinion opposing 24 hour gaming.
Mr. Rak gave an emotional testimony of how his ex-wife’s gambling addiction changed
their lives forever. He also went on to state that due to the gambling addiction he and his
wife of 18 years divorced and also added that on today’s date 5 years ago his ex-wife had
ended her life.

Loan ‘B’ Facility in the amount of $250 million maturing 7 years after the closing
date. Also included will be $300 million in Senior Notes maturing in 5 years; terms
yet to be finalized. The Illinois properties are to be subsidiary guarantors on these
debt instruments. In addition, pursuant to Rule 235(a), I move to approve any
Illinois real estate transfers to Penn National Gaming, Inc. or to Gaming and
Leisure Properties, Inc. Final approval of the Board’s actions regarding the
restructuring is subject to the following conditions.
