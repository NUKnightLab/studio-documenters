In addition to the benefits granted to members and spouses each month, the Secretary will also be
presenting, for informational purposes only, items of interest that may affect our members.
Questions regarding any member’s specific situation should be addressed directly to the Fund
Office.
MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM THE FUND SECRETARY
3% COLA
SB 42 was put in the recent budget bill that passed into law despite Governor Rauner's veto. SB 42,
which became PA 100-0023, addressed the technical corrections required to properly grant the 3%
COLA and retroactive calculations to all members born within the 11-year period before 1966. At the
July monthly meeting, the Pension Board instructed staff to calculate the retroactive payments now due
to these members. The Pension Board Trustees will vote to formally grant the benefits to the individual
members, back to the January 1, 2017 date, at the August meeting. Assuming the vote is in the
affirmative to grant the benefit, I anticipate the members will receive their increased benefits, back to
the January 1, 2017 date, in connection with the September 1st benefit payment. In each check, there
will be a letter explaining how the calculation was made so members can make sure they receive the
proper amount. Although I cannot speak for the entire Board on this matter, I think anyone in
attendance at recent Board meetings who heard the discussions amongst the Trustees, would reasonably
expect the Board will be voting to grant the benefit and hopefully resolve this issue once and for all. It
was imperative, for the Board as a whole, that there be clear language that supported this benefit before
the Board granted it, otherwise the Board felt it would be diminishing the integrity of how the Fund is
administered.
If you have been paying attention to this long, drawn-out process, it has been frustrating to watch. But I
think the entire Board would agree that it was a necessary process to go through. The benefits members
are entitled to should be legislatively enacted into the pension code in clear, concise language so that
members, as well as your Board, can easily reference and understand what was intended. The members
should have confidence that their pension fund is being administered honestly, efficiently and with
integrity. It would not have been wise to simply grant benefits to members just because people were
pushing for the benefit, unless the pension code clearly granted those benefits. Obviously, the Illinois
Legislator agreed with the Board that the language needed to be clarified and, with Local 2’s help, the
new language makes clear who is entitled to what and how the benefit is to be determined.
I would like to commend Trustee Dan Fortuna, who represents the members that were affected by the
poorly drafted language. It would have been easy for Dan to vote against his fellow Trustees to appease
the retirees which he represents. But ultimately, Dan recognized the issues with the poorly written
language and the long-term implications of not administering the Fund with integrity. It is Dan's

 willingness to see the long-term ramifications over the short term political expediency that earns him
respect as a long-term Local 2 member and former executive board member. Dan's willingness to remain
steadfast on principle in this matter makes it apparent why he has been elected as the President of the
National Conference of Public Employee Retirement Systems (NCPERS), an organization that fights for
fiscal responsibility and sustainability of public pension funds.
Trustee Fortuna asked on more than one occasion if we were going to help Local 2 get the technical
corrections passed. So when Local 2 President Jim Tracy asked me to help draft language that the
Pension Fund could accept to solve this issue I emailed him the language as soon as possible. For reasons
that still aren't clear to me, Local 2 distributed a different draft to the Pension Board at the Fund’s June
monthly meeting that they said they intended to submit to the Legislature. There was some back and forth
between the Pension Fund and Local 2, namely Rob Tebbens and myself. For the most part, we were in
agreement and had the same goals, but something was getting lost in translation. I understand Rob was
being rushed; legislation moves fast down in Springfield, especially in the environment of getting a
budget bill passed. Nevertheless, any issues between Local 2 and the Pension Fund concerning the
technical corrections were resolved when House Speaker Madigan's office reached out to the Pension
Fund for clarification on the language submitted. Any issues that the Pension Fund had with Local 2's
language were resolved because the language that I had emailed to Local 2 President Jim Tracy was
included in the final legislation introduced by Speaker Madigan.
In short, the Pension Board's position is that we were presented with a bad situation due to the poor
drafting of the language inserted into the pension code and we worked with stakeholders, particularly with
Local 2, within our limited capacity, to rectify the situation. The process engaged in by the Pension
Board was open, straightforward and clear, and as I mentioned above, it appears very probable that the
benefit will be granted at the August meeting. As a pension fund member, looking at this entire situation
in hindsight, I think you would be hard pressed to not agree that your Pension Board acted in an honest,
transparent and prudent manner.
FUNDING
As you may be aware the Pension Fund sent former Local 2 President Tom Ryan a letter urging the Union
to consider a lawsuit against the City for adequate funding due to the current funding status of the Pension
Fund. At the time, the funding level was 22.7%, as of the end of 2016 it is 20.2%.
I have heard people ask how the funding level could go down when the City is giving us more money and
the market has been doing well. One of the reasons is because from the time the actuaries calculated the
2015 figure until the 2016 figure, the pension code was changed, with a notable change providing
additional COLA benefits for members born during the 11-year period before 1966. The additional
money the City is providing is still woefully inadequate and does not cover the costs of these new benefits
and certainly does not reduce the unfunded liability that continues to grow. This is exactly why the
Pension Fund does not support new unfunded benefits; such increased benefits, if not properly paid for,
harm the long-term solvency of the Fund and puts all of our pensions at risk. The Pension Fund has a
long-term horizon and has to invest and be ready to fund the retirement of the firefighter jumping on the
rig for the first time this year who won't start retirement for another 30 years. These members are just as
important as the currently retired member or the one getting ready to retire this year. Nevertheless, the
Pension Fund Trustees are not opposed to new benefits if they are properly funded.
I get criticism from some that say I spend too much time discussing funding because I have a background
in finance and budgeting and formerly worked as a municipal finance director. But I contend funding is
the most critical issue facing our long term financial security. I urge Local 2 to not ignore the Pension
Fund's previous pleas to work on getting additional funding. As I have indicated in previous letters, the

 Fund is considering suing the City for specific funding for the "Brass Bill". Prior to the Local 2 supported
legislation, known as SB777 (Casino Bill), the City paid the entire amount statutorily required in the
pension code, including the "Brass Bill." Since the implementation of SB777, supported by Local 2, the
City has not complied with the funding required by the pension code. Nevertheless, if the current Local 2
executive board is serious about addressing funding, I would be willing to personally work with Local 2
to help them understand the intricacies of the funding mechanisms found in the pension code. Some
Local 2 candidates in the last election reached out to me about funding; I walked them through the cash
flows, legislative implications and actuarial process as they relate to our Fund. I would be more than
willing to continue doing that for any Local 2 executive board member that requests it.
It is important that members understand this is a public pension fund, there are many differing
stakeholders involved that may have different views on how our Fund is administered, benefits are
granted and funding is obtained. There will be disagreements. But if the process is respected and
stakeholders bring their concerns in good faith, I think members will be well served and gain comfort that
the critical issues facing our poorly funded plan can be addressed in a non-political, non-self serving
manner.

Fraternally,

Timothy McPhillips
Fund Secretary
