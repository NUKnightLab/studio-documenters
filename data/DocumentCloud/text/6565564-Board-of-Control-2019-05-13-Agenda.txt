A. – Tabled Items
The following item was amended to reduce the time period and the amount of the contract.
BC2019-334
Department of Health and Human Services/Division of Children and Family Services, submitting an
amendment to Contract No. CE1600142 with Community of Hope for group mentoring services,
previously referred to as the Open Table Model, for transition age young adults who were previously or
are currently in foster care for the period 7/1/2016 – 6/30/2019 to extend the time period to 6/30/2020
12/31/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $150,000.00 $75,000.00.
Funding Source: 30% Title IV-E Admin; 70% HHS Levy
Robert Math, Cuyahoga Job and Family Services, on behalf of the Division of Children and Family Services,
presented. Matt Carroll concurred with Mr. Math’s assessment that further discussion is needed among
the board members to determine whether it is best to proceed with a one-year contract or a six-month
contract, while a Request for Proposals (RFP) process can be conducted. Mr. Carroll asked if this open

11

 table model is a licensed intervention and whether any other vendors have requested information or to
participate in this type of service.
Mr. McAleer said that this vendor is no longer a sole source provider and after discussions with Council
President Brady, Councilwoman Baker and Councilman Miller he recommended decreasing the contract
time and funding by six months to complete the RFP process, which is a reasonable time frame, as the
proposal is ready to be issued as this will ensure that the County is getting the best value for services
received with the money expended from the Health and Human Services Levy Fund.
Mr. Carroll agreed that bidding for services is a priority but expressed concern about reducing the time
period and the impact it may have on the services being provided and recommended that the RFP be
issued immediately and allow this contract to continue for the next year pending final evaluation of the
response to the RFP.
Nan Baker said that issuing an RFP should reinforce whether we are on the right track and determine if
there are any other potential vendors for this service; and stated that this vendor, based on experience,
would most likely be the strongest bidder, and that the chances of losing this vendor should be minimal
because the vendor believes they are doing the best job at a reasonable cost.
Matt Carroll stated that this assumption may not the best message to send to other organizations.
Further discussion ensued. Mr. McAleer motioned to amend the item to extend the time period to
12/31/2019 and for additional funds in the amount not-to-exceed $75,000.00; Michael Dever seconded.
Andria Richardson, Clerk of the Board of Control, clarified the motion by reading the proposed amended
item into the record.
The motion to amend the item was approved by majority vote with Matt Carroll, Dale Miller and Michael
Dever casting dissenting votes.
Dale Miller motioned to approve the item; Trevor McAleer seconded. Item BC2019-334 was unanimously
approved.

and Department of Internal Audit are still reviewing this matter and that a report will be complete in the
next few weeks; and indicated that the report is separate from this item to return the grant funds.

13

 Nan Baker stated that while the funds must be returned, she did not understand why this item is being
presented to the Board of Control, as a vote is not legally required.
Angela Rich asked if a letter has been presented to the County, by Ohio Emergency Management Agency,
to request the return of the grant funds, as one will be needed for audit purposes and does not believe
that all the facts and information are yet available to vote on this item today. Ms. Rich asked whether the
State has completed their review of this matter and produced an official communication to the County
requesting reimbursement.
Matt Carroll stated that this reimbursement may be approved when the timing is appropriate, whether it
appears on the agenda for a vote or not but may require further discussion.
Trevor McAleer asked if the Fiscal Office can issue payment to the State once the letter has been received
and without Board of Control approval.
Ms. Rich stated once all the facts are available, notice from the State is received, and the Board of Control
approves, that a check may be issued and believes each piece is necessary for audit purposes and to
ensure everyone is on the same page.
Mr. McAleer recommended that this item be held pending receipt of additional information and, if not
legally required, that the item not be returned to the Board of Control for voting purposes.
Mr. Carroll stated that he would defer to the Law Department to recommend whether this item be
returned for a vote of the Board of Control, as this is an unusual situation; and further stated that it would
be a good discretionary move to bring forward, even if it is not legally required and is comfortable with
the Board of Control acting upon this item. Mr. Carroll also recommended that this item be held.
BC2019-345
Department of Public Safety and Justice Services, submitting an agreement with The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation in the amount not to-exceed $100,800.00 to provide vendor-hosted next generation 9-1-1

This procurement is for security cameras, videostorage, and related equipment in the two dormitories
being built in Jail 1. In addition, intercoms are being installed. The space being renovated has no existing
security cameras or intercoms. This purchase will provide a higher level of security for staff and inmates.
The installation of cameras will provide Corrections Administration with video records to minimize
assaults and other inappropriate activity of staff and inmates. This installation will assist in meeting the
goals of PREA and other standards set forth in various reviews and reports.
These recommendations are based upon reviewing existing security architecture throughout the County
and reviewing reports and data from several sources. Having conducted interviews with departmental
stakeholders, drawings and schedules have been created, reviewed, and revised, resulting in the existing
proposal.
While hiring additional staff is part of the solution, it is not a solution or replacement of security cameras
and systems. No other solution meets the purpose of security cameras. This will be used at the Jail 1, 4th
Floor new dormitories. The current contract is for maintenance. One year of
If this equipment is added to the master maintenance agreement, for years 2 and three after installation,
the cost will be $7,092.09. After that, the annual maintenance cost will be $8,865.12.
An RFP exemption is needed as Integrated Precision Systems, Inc. (IPS) is able to provide the needed
Security Camera and Storage and intercom solutions under Ohio STS #800545 which expires on January
31, 2021. In order to provide consistency in the management of the large enterprise networked security
system, it is essential that a single vendor provide and maintain any equipment that is being added to
this system. Had another vendor been selected, the County would be running multiple independent
security camera systems. Such a decision would have returned the County to the Balkanized nature of
the security systems that are being upgraded and replaced.
The cost, customer service level, systems knowledge, among other characteristics were considered in
evaluating the services and equipment provided by IPS. The equipment and services provided meet the
County standards for such equipment as defined by DoIT. Video storage was last competitively bid in 2012.

for lunch and a keynote address and cannot accommodate our preferred dates.
Cuyahoga Community College, Corporate College Conference Center is the best option for us, as they
are available on our preferred dates, can accommodate all our food and audio/visual needs within their
