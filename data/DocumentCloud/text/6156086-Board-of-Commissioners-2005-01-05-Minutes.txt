PROPOSED COOK COUNTY VEHICLE POLICY ORDINANCE. Transmitting a
Communication, dated October 12, 2004 from John H. Stroger Jr., President, Cook County
Board of Commissioners, John P. Daley, Finance Chairman and Gregg Goslin, Tax and
Revenue Subcommittee Chairman:
Transmitting herewith a proposed Cook County Vehicle Policy to be considered by this
Honorable Body.
In order to serve the health, safety and welfare of its citizens, Cook County requires a fleet of
vehicles in order to carry on the duties and responsibilities of government. To assure that the
fleet of vehicles is maintained in a safe and cost efficient manner, uniform policies and long
range strategies will be instituted. All Cook County Elected Officials, Departments,
supervisors, and employees are directed to adhere to the Cook County Vehicle Policy. This
policy applies to any Cook County owned, leased or rented motorized vehicle and to any
privately owned vehicle borrowed and/or used to conduct Cook County business.
The following is a synopsis of the proposed Cook County Vehicle Policy.
COOK COUNTY VEHICLE POLICY ORDINANCE
1. Establishment of a Countywide Vehicle Steering Committee
2. Responsibilities of Elected Officials, Departments, and Employees and Assignment of
Vehicle Coordinator
3. Authorized Use of County Vehicles
4. Miscellaneous
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 10/19/04.
** Amendments to the Proposed Cook County Vehicle Policy will be considered at the
12/16/04 meeting.

The Chairman next considered the following amendments to the proposed Cook County Vehicle Policy.
AMENDMENT #1
Sponsors:

Commissioners Forrest Claypool, John P. Daley and Mike Quigley

Commissioners Larry Suffredin and Anthony J. Peraica

Amends:

(1)

Retain on file a copy of the valid license of each employee authorized to drive a
County Vehicle. The employee must at all times hold a valid proper class Illinois
license for the vehicle operated that is not revoked or under suspension. The
County’s Human Resource Staff shall consult on a monthly basis with the Illinois
Secretary of State to check the license status of all employees required to operate
vehicles as part of their job duties. The file is to be reviewed and updated
annually on no less than a monthly basis and forwarded to the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on no less than a quarterly basis.

Leave was granted to add Commissioner Quigley as a sponsor.

Section 2, Subsection b. ii. (1) [page 2]:
(1)

Retain on file a copy of the valid license of each employee authorized to drive a
County Vehicle. The employee must at all times hold a valid proper class Illinois
license for the vehicle operated that is not revoked or under suspension. The
County’s Human Resource Staff shall consult on a monthly basis with the Illinois
Secretary of State to check the license status of all employees required to operate
vehicles as part of their job duties. The file is to be reviewed and updated
annually on no less than a monthly basis and forwarded to the Cook County
Board of Commissioners on no less than a quarterly basis. Verification of valid
licenses of Sheriff’s undercover officers shall be made without requiring pictures
of such officers to be maintained on file except as held in the internal files of the
Sheriff’s Department.

Commissioner Suffredin explained that the intent of the Amendment to Amendment #1 is to protect
undercover police. To this end, the County’s Bureau of Human Resources would refrain from retaining
file copies of police licenses and police photos.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether the Secretary of State’s Office and the Bureau of Human
Resources possess the manpower to process the information involved.
Commissioner Claypool replied that other agencies, such as the Illinois Department of Transportation,
conduct similar checks routinely, with more frequency than the program currently under consideration.
Vice Chairman Steele stated that identify theft could pose a problem, and voiced her strong concern that
there be personal accountability in the collection of social security numbers and drivers’ licenses.
Mark Kilgallon, Chief, Bureau of Human Resources, stated that currently when an individual applies for
appointment with Cook County, both the individual’s driver’s license and social security number are
procured. Mr. Kilgallon reassured the Board that his staff adheres to confidentiality laws.
Following discussion, a vote was taken on the motion to approve the amendment to Amendment #1.
The motion to amend carried.
A vote was taken on the main motion, to approve Amendment #1 as amended. The motion carried.

Leave was granted to add all members as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved approval of Amendment #9.
Commissioner Silvestri asked for a financial estimate, assuming each County vehicle would be equipped
with Global Positioning System (GPS) technology.
Catherine Maras O’Leary, Chief Information Officer, responded to outfit each vehicle with a transponder
would cost $200 per vehicle. A monthly cost of $30 would pay for location capability for each vehicle.
A charge would apply for vehicle location software; the County, however, could use its existing GIS map
instead. For 1,000 vehicles the cost would be approximately $1 million. The County’s fleet of vehicles
numbers 1,800; Mrs. Maras O’Leary surmised, however, that some vehicles would not be equipped with
GPS capability.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired as to the purpose of this technology.
Commissioner Quigley replied that the best dividend of a GPS would be accountability. The Chicago
Park District recently implemented this technology, and the Sheriff’s Office has a GPS that functions
mainly to help officers in emergencies.

364

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 5, 2005
Chairman Daley voiced his concern that the cost was possibly prohibitive.
Commissioner Silvestri stated that the existing supervisors should be tracking those in their professional
charge. He also questioned who would monitor a GPS.
Commissioner Quigley responded that there are several types of GPSs. One type has a tape that is
analyzed at a later date. A supervisor could examine this tape weekly or monthly.
Chairman Daley related that Mr. Whigham indicated to him that the Administration supports the
amendments that pertain to obtaining a GPS system.
Commissioner Hansen inquired again what the cost of a GPS would be.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary responded that for a more accurate estimate she would need to define the GPS’s
functionality.
Commissioner Maldonado stated that as a result of his research on the Internet, he found two GPSs, one
priced at $600 per vehicle and one priced at $750 per vehicle.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether transponders are fixed in the vehicle or movable.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary responded the transponders are fixed in the vehicle to the extent that the driver
cannot remove them.
Commissioner Peraica asked whether the County’s GIS mapping system could be used in any GPS
system.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary replied in the affirmative. She explained this GIS mapping system would be
overlaid with the vehicle location software; this would result in a database which would then have to be
configured. The following additional costs would apply: licensing, GPS cell coverage, hardware,
software, maintenance and training.
Commissioner Goslin asked whether transponders could be transferred among vehicles.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Gorman voiced the following concerns: the cost of supervisors; a first year cost of $360
per vehicle and a second year cost of $560 per vehicle.
Vice Chairman Steele asked whether Mrs. Maras O’Leary knew what the cost of the software would be.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary replied in the negative. She further explained that she would work with the County
to designate GPS needs, then she would draft an RFP, and lastly she would solicit proposals to this RFP.
Vice Chairman Steele stated her concern that Mrs. Maras O’Leary’s RFP be inclusive of all costs.
Mrs. Maras O’Leary assured her that the RFP would meet this criterion.
Commissioner Quigley asked for a time frame for an RFP.

365

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 5, 2005
Mrs. Maras O’Leary said her goal would be to develop an RFP and report within six (6) months to the
County Board, to equip all County Vehicles with Global Positioning System (GPS) locators within one
year of the approval of the RFP.
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved to amend Section 3, the first
sentence of Subsection iii., to read as follows: “The Chief Information Officer shall develop an RFP
and report within six (6) months to the County Board, to equip all County Vehicles with Global
Positioning System (GPS) locators within one year of the approval of the RFP.” The motion to

Establishment of personnel disciplinary procedures relating to the operation of
vehicles during the course of employment, and
(g) Other matters deemed appropriate.

Leave was granted to add all members as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved approval of Amendment #10.
Commissioner Hansen inquired with regard to Item 4.1, does there exist a cost estimate for developing a
centralized fleet of vehicles. Centralizing a fleet of vehicles is similar to creating a motor pool: there is a
centralized point and distant points; and the process is very difficult.
Commissioner Quigley stated that the Vehicle Steering Committee will provide more exact estimates of
costs and benefits to the Commissioners. The City of Chicago now manages all vehicles for the City, the
Police Department, the Park District and the Public School System. Evidence suggests that a centralized
fleet would result in more cohesion and cost savings. The Board of Commissioners is not dictating that
the County create a centralized fleet. The expectation, rather, is that the Vehicle Steering Committee
would put together and recommend a comprehensive plan.
Commissioner Sims suggested that the Vehicle Steering Committee model its plan on the City of
Chicago’s plan.
Commissioner Hansen stated language should be added to the amendment to the effect that a cost analysis
will be performed
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Hansen, moved to amend Section 1, Subsection
iv, by inserting “, including projected costs and potential cost savings,” between the words
“ordinance(s)” and “necessary”. The motion to amend carried.
A vote was taken on the main motion to approve Amendment #10 as amended. The motion carried.

Purchase and Salvage Procedures
(1)

Requests for new or replacement vehicles (owned or leased) shall be submitted for
review by the VSC prior to any such request being approved for purchase or
acquisition. Requests for authorization to remove a vehicle from inventory shall be
submitted to the VSC. No vehicle shall be purchased, acquired, leased, or removed
from inventory without the approval of the VSC.

(2)

The following guidelines will set the minimum vehicle replacement goals.
(a)

In general, automobiles should be replaced when they reach eight (8) years of
service or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first.

(b)

Departments shall request the smallest possible vehicle for the intended use.

(b c)

Requests that do not meet these criteria will not be considered for
replacement unless the Department Head submits a written justification to
the VSC for the exception which documents the extenuating circumstances.

(c d)

Only specialized equipment; such as heavy highway construction equipment
will be allowed to use other criteria such as hours of service, however the
criteria utilized by the Department should be submitted to justify the vehicle
replacement request, and the VSC will determine if this information is
adequate and the maintenance cost information required.

(d e)

A request for a new vehicle which increases the number of vehicles in the
department’s vehicle inventory shall be submitted to the VSC with a written
justification as to why the additional vehicles will be required. Such request
must demonstrate that reassignment of existing vehicles would be unable to
meet department needs and that sufficient funding is available for both the
purchase and the cost of operating and maintaining the vehicle. The request
to purchase must state the use intended for the vehicle, whether the vehicle
will be assigned with ‘take home’ privileges and whether the vehicle will
bear a municipal license plate.

(e f)

If sufficient funds are available and other conditions of the policy have been
complied with, the VSC may concur in the request for new or replacement
vehicle(s). Such concurrence shall be transmitted to the Purchasing Agent,
and where County Board approval is required for the purchase, such
concurrence shall be reflected on the County Board’s Agenda.
********************

d.

Failure of Department Heads to provide information in accordance with the County Vehicle
Policy may shall result in the Department’s inability to acquire County vehicles, and other
actions deemed necessary by the VSC, until this information is received.

Leave was granted to add all members as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Goslin, moved approval of Amendment #11.

368

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 5, 2005
Commissioner Quigley stated the City of Denver developed a centralized fleet policy and decreased their
fuel expenditures by 1% per year and their CO2 by 1.5% per year. Monterrey, California, developed a
centralized fleet and saves 10,000 gallons of gasoline per year.
Commissioner Hansen asked how “smallest possible vehicle” is defined.
Commissioner Quigley replied that the Sheriff’s Office is using hybrids; he noted that the amendment
specifies that the smallest appropriate car be used.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his concern that vehicles might be bought that are too small for County
employees.
Commissioner Silvestri asked why no language was inserted into the amendment concerning purchasing
American-made cars.
Chairman Daley stated that he would research this specification and get back to the Committee.
Commissioner Sims cited 2a of the amendment and inquired what the fiscal impact of this ordinance
would be, if all vehicles were replaced which were older than eight years or had more than one hundred
thousand miles.
Joseph Hogan, Administrative Analyst, Department of Budget and Management Services, responded that
it is currently the Budget Departments’ practice to replace all vehicles that are older than eight years or
have more than one hundred thousand miles.
Commissioner Hansen suggested replacing the word “smallest” with the words “least expensive.”
Commissioner Quigley replied that this change in language would alter the intended policy of the
amendment. He added that the goal of cost savings is inherent in the County’s bidding process.
Commissioner Hansen replied that the word “smallest” does not imply the phrase “least expensive.”
Commissioner Hansen moved to amend Section 2, Subsection c (2) (b), by replacing the words
“smallest possible” with “least expensive”, as follows: “Departments shall request the smallest
possible least expensive vehicle for the intended use. The motion died for lack of a second.
A vote was taken on the motion to approve Amendment #11. The motion carried. Commissioner
Hansen voted “no” on the paragraph in Section 2, Subsection c (2) (b) relating to “smallest possible
vehicle”.

Chairman Collins explained that the County has entered into contracts with the agencies and, because the
County does not want to lose the grant from the State, the item should be approved. Chairman Collins

the conditions that the Department of the President’s Office of Employment Training and the Workforce
Investment Board provide the Commissioners with the information to answer the questions that were
raised by the Commissioners at today’s meeting.

Re: Supplement to the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance
requesting approval of an ordinance supplementing an ordinance adopted by the Board on September 19,
2002, entitled, “Ordinance Authorizing the Issuance of One or More Series of General Obligation
Refunding Bonds of the County of Cook, Illinois and Approving Certain Other Matters.” The 2002

and 2004E Bonds, into the refunding bond plan. The supplement also extends the tax levy two years to
be consistent with the original ordinance of the refunding bonds having stated maturity of 35 years.

that “a County which has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the electors of the County ... (is) a Home
Rule Unit” and The County of Cook, Illinois (the “County”), has a Chief Executive Officer elected by the
electors of the County and is therefore a Home Rule Unit and may, under the power granted by said
Section 6(a) of Article VII of the Constitution of 1970, as supplemented by the Local Government Debt
Reform Act, as amended, the (“Act”), exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its
government and affairs, including, but not limited to, the power to tax and to incur debt; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the County has the power to incur debt
payable from ad valorem property tax receipts or from any other lawful source and maturing within 40
years from the time it is incurred without prior referendum approval; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the County (the “Corporate Authorities”) has not
adopted any ordinance, resolution, order or motion or provided any County Code provisions which
restrict or limit the exercise of the home rule powers of the County in the issuance of general obligation
bonds without referendum for corporate purposes or which provides any special rules or procedures for
the exercise of such power; and
WHEREAS, the Corporate Authorities did heretofore adopt on the 19th day of September, 2002,
an ordinance entitled, “Ordinance Authorizing the Issuance of One or More Series of General Obligation
Refunding Bonds of The County of Cook, Illinois and Approving Certain Other Matters” (the “2002
Refunding Bond Ordinance”); and
WHEREAS, the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance authorizes the issuance from time to time of
general obligation bonds of the County (the “Bonds”) for refunding purposes in order to achieve a debt
service savings for the County or restructure the debt service on the general obligation bonds of the
County then outstanding and identified in Section 2.2 of the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance (being,
collectively, the “Prior Bonds” as defined in the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance); and
WHEREAS, for the purpose of providing the moneys required to pay the interest on the Bonds
when and as the same becomes due and to pay and discharge the principal of the Bonds as the same shall
mature, the Corporate Authorities levied in Section 4.1 of the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance a direct
annual tax sufficient for that purpose in and for each of the tax levy years 2002 to 2036, inclusive (the
“Full Faith and Credit Taxes”); and
WHEREAS, by levying Full Faith and Credit Taxes for the year 2036 (collectible in 2037) the
Corporate Authorities intended that Bonds could be issued with a Stated Maturity (as defined in the 2002
Refunding Bond Ordinance) of 35 years; and
WHEREAS, subsequent to the adoption of the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance, the County has
issued and there are now outstanding certain additional general obligation bonds described in Section 2.2
hereof (being “Additional Bonds”), which general obligation bonds are in addition to the Prior Bonds;
and

451

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JANUARY 5, 2005
WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the inhabitants of the County and necessary for the
government and affairs of the County also to authorize the issuance from time to time of general
obligation bonds of the County for refunding purposes in order to achieve a debt service savings or to
restructure the debt service on such Additional Bonds; and
WHEREAS, it is also necessary and desirable to provide that Bonds could now be issued with a
Stated Maturity of 35 years in order to achieve a debt service savings or restructure the debt service on the
Additional Bonds, and accordingly it is necessary to levy Full Faith and Credit Taxes for the years 2037
and 2038, inclusive; and
WHEREAS, the County expressly reserved in the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance the right to
adopt ordinances supplemental thereto in order to specify, determine or authorize any and all matters and
things relative to the Bonds or the proceeds thereof that are not contrary to or inconsistent with the 2002
Refunding Bond Ordinance, all as provided in Article VIII of the 2002 Refunding Bond Ordinance; and

Authorities now adopt this supplemental ordinance so to specify, determine and authorize:
