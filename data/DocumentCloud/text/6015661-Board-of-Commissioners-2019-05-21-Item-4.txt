The requested action complies in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local
laws, and Chicago Housing Authority board policies. Staff have completed all necessary due
diligence to support the submission of this initiative.
Background
The Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership was created in 2012 to provide workforce development
services for the city of Chicago and Cook county, with targeted efforts in line with local jobs that
are in demand and/or projected to be in demand. The CCWP mission is to create, promote, and
effectively manage a network of workforce development organizations that designs innovative
solutions to address business needs and prepares individuals for and connects them to career
opportunities. CCWP is the local workforce authority designated by the U.S. Department of Labor
and is the conduit for employers and job seekers.
CCWP services are impacted by state of Illinois workforce strategic planning elements, which
includes analyses of the state’s economic conditions, workforce characteristics, and workforce
development activities. These analyses drive the required vision and goals for the state’s
workforce development system and align strategies for workforce development programs to
support economic growth.

 The contract with CCWP has allowed CHA to receive customized services and allows for flexibility
to meet the needs of CHA residents. This includes allowing CHA residents to receive workforce
services regardless of meeting eligibility requirements for public workforce services. Through this
partnership, CCWP will enroll 600 CHA residents at five American Job Centers throughout
Chicago. CHA residents can access services including, but not limited to, training and education
through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), career coaching, digital literacy,
job search and job placement.
CHA has approved a non-competitive procurement (sole source) for CCWP services in advance of
this Board request, based on CCWP’s unique role as the fiscal agent, sub-recipient and
administrative entity for the local workforce innovation area that provides public workforce
services to Chicago and Cook County.
Respectfully Submitted:
