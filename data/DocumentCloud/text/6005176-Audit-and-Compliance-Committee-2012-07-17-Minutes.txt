Action Items
A. Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting, March 6, 2012
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Chairman Muñoz, moved to accept the minutes of the
Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting of March 6, 2012. THE MOTION
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY.

B. **CCHHS Financial Statements, for the year ended November 30, 2011; and the CCHHS
Management Letter, for the year ended November 30, 2011 (Attachment #3)
The following representatives from McGladrey & Pullen, LLP, provided an overview of the CCHHS
Financial Statements and Management Letter, for the year ended November 30, 2011: Pat Kitchen,
Partner; Tim Heinrichs, Director; and Pat Hagen, National Managing Partner – State and Local
Government. The Committee reviewed and discussed the information.
The Committee discussed the following subjects: inventory control system, as referenced in the
management letter and response; whether Hektoen grants are incorporated in the System’s totals; and
status of the overall County audit. Additional information was provided regarding CCHHS Management
Letter Responses (Attachment #4) by John Cookinham, System Chief Financial Officer.
With regard to the Committee’s discussion of the question of whether Hektoen grants are incorporated in
the System’s financials, Dorothy Loving, Executive Director of Finance, provided information. She stated
that Hektoen’s numbers are not incorporated into the System’s financials. Hektoen is a 501(c)3 taxexempt organization; each year, the System receives a copy of Hektoen’s annual filing of Form 990 with
the Internal Revenue Service (Form 990 is the Return from Organization Exempt from Income Tax),
which is given to the County’s auditors for their information and records.
In his review of the status of the overall County audit, Mr. Hagen noted that the County’s Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) was issued and dated by May 31st; this is the first time in ten (10) years
that this has been accomplished. Additionally, during his review, he provided information on
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 68, which was recently released. He
stated that this could have a significant effect on the County and the System, because it will require
pension liabilities to be recorded on the books. Right now, pension liabilities are disclosed; however, they
would have to be recorded, probably beginning in FY2013.
Mr. Hagen indicated that the County Board’s Audit Committee will be reviewing the CAFR at a meeting
scheduled for Monday, July 23rd; representatives from McGladrey & Pullen, LLP will report on the
overall CAFR and will be available to take any questions from the Audit Committee as to any of the
components.

D. Discussion of Personnel Matters
Director O’Donnell, seconded by Chairman Muñoz, moved to recess the regular session
and convene into closed session, pursuant to the following exceptions to the Illinois Open
