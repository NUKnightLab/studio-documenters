While on the topic of Trustee Election, Ms. Tuczak discussed the procedures concerning
returned ballots for bad or insufficient addresses. Procedures were discussed and it was
agreed to continue the procedures used in the previous elections.

•

Ms. Tuczak provided an update on the matter of the widow of Chester Hornowski. The
Executive Director contacted Mrs. Hornowski, as the Board directed, to recapture the
$15,177.00 overpayment of annuity received by her late husband, Chester Hornowski.
The widow suggested an offer to forfeit the $6,000 death benefit and settle the
overpayment. After discussion, the Trustees did not accept the offer and suggested that if
the death benefit be forfeited a reasonable payment plan be developed to extinguish the
remaining indebtedness.

•

The Executive Director provided a draft letter to be sent to members that are or were in
receipt of duty disability benefits, who have made inquiry concerning their disability
calculation. Such members are interested in whether duty availability was included in the
calculation. Previously, the Board approved a letter, which was directed to the Fraternal
Order of Police on this matter. The Board approved the drafted response to be directed to
members who inquire about the specifics of their calculations.
