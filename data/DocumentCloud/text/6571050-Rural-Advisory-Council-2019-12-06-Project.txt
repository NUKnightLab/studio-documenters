BACKGROUND

Improvements along Cleveland Street in Elyria (PID 110986)
Recommendation *

Completed

A transition for the bike lane into the roundabout should be provided, such as
wide sidewalks/shared use paths and signage for bike traffic moving through
the roundabout intersection.
Consider utilizing ladder-style crosswalk markings across Cleveland Street, in
addition to the contrasting pavement. The visual contrast of a differing
pavement type tends to fade over time, and ladder-style markings would
maintain the safety benefit of a high-visibility crosswalk.
Consider utilizing the center turn lane to create median refuge islands to
improve the safety of crosswalks along the corridor. Median refuge islands are
an FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasure.
Maintain stormwater runoff on-site for as long as possible to keep nonpoint
source pollutants from reaching the Black River. Consider incorporating
habitat restoration along the river wherever possible.
* Recommendations have been forwarded to the project sponsor for consideration and coordination..
