RE:

Monthly Update

Board Members,
Heraclitus, a Greek philosopher, has been quoted as saying “change is the only constant in life.”
The constant we now realize daily at METRO RTA is change. As we have moved to reinvent the
way we, and others, think about public transportation options in Summit County, the METRO
Team is thinking about how their departments fit into that reinvention. You will see in your packet
today that many of the directors have renamed their departments and members of their team.
What’s in a name? A name is often the first thing you acquire about someone or something and
we form conclusions very quickly. Those conclusions accumulate, so the first piece of information
is particularly important. It can lean you in a positive direction or a negative direction. First
impressions set the stage for future interactions. With this in mind, the leaders of our organization
put great thought into their names, and their teams reinvented themselves into how they want to
be perceived and what they want to “be” to those they serve internally and externally. They began
by reinventing the committees they serve on and now they are working hard to put real goals and
objectives to what they do. They are diligently working on KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) by
which to measure their successes. As we continue to constantly change the way we do business,
let us always be #METROProud.
Yours in accessible transportation,

Dawn Distler
Executive Director
