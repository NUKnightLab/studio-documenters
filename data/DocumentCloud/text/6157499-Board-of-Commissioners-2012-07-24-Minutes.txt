WHEREAS, Ramadan, celebrated the world over by more than one billion Muslims, is the month when
Muslims believe God gave the first verses of the Koran to the Prophet Muhammad, and is a sacred
Muslim holiday, spanning the ninth month of the Islamic calendar; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan is one of the five “pillars” or duties in the religion of Islam, and observance of
Ramadan is considered necessary to the strengthening of one’s faith; and
WHEREAS, Ramadan is a time to spiritually purify one’s soul through self-sacrifice, more frequent

submissiveness to God; it is also a time to mend troubled relationships, forgive others, and give to charity;
and
WHEREAS, the month of Ramadan involves daily fasting from sunrise to sunset and, because everyone
is eating dinner after sunset, Muslims often invite friends and family to share in the evening meal during
Ramadan ; and

struggle toward a higher spiritual state.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Toni Preckwinkle, as Cook County Board President

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Business Enterprise Ordinance, for your approval.
Dear Commissioners:
Attached hereto, please find a proposed amendment to Item No. 318664, initially introduced June 19,
2012. The changes generally facilitate M/WBE certification reciprocity, define the CPO’s authority
with respect to contract amendments, and clarify invoicing requirements. The changes are described
in greater detail as follows:
1. The CPO’s authority to approve and execute amendments to contracts is more clearly limited
to the $150,000 authority included in Section 34-123;
2. The definition of “County Marketplace” is modified to include the counties of Cook,
DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will;
3. The initial fee for M/WBE certification is increased to $250, and the fee for filing a “no
change” affidavit is eliminated;
4. The construction M/WBE ordinance includes language from the Interim Construction
M/WBE ordinance passed in June of 2011 so that it is more clearly severable from the nonconstruction portion of the ordinance;
5. The Chief Procurement Officer is granted the ability to use prequalification as one of her
innovative procurement methods; and
6. The invoice requirements in Section 310 are modified to address Professional Services and
Consulting
contracts.
Please call me with any questions. Thank you in advance for your assistance.
Very truly yours,
Kesner Bienvenu
Assistant Special Legal Counsel

the bids received from all subcontractors for County construction contracts and the expenditures to
subcontractors utilized by prime Contractors on County construction contracts;
(i) At the discretion of the CC Director, letting a representative sample of County construction
contracts without goals, to determine MBE and WBE utilization in the absence of goals;
(j) Maintaining information on all firms bidding on County prime contracts and subcontracts; and
(k) Referring complaints of discrimination to Cook County's Commission on Human Relations,
or other appropriate authority, for investigation.
Sec. 34-293. Program eligibility.
(a) Only Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a an MBE or WBE may participate
in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.
(b) Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be certified
as an MBE or WBE.
(1) The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in
ownership documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and
share in the risks and profits commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2) The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise is relied
upon as part of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire
ownership, the Expertise must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized
field, in areas critical to the firm's operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success,
specific to the type of work the firm performs and documented in the firm's records. The
individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a commensurate financial investment in
the firm.
(c) Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1) A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no
restrictions through corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other
formal or informal devices that prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any non-Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm, including the making
of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as
well as long-term decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and

37

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Economically Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any
such person. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise
control over the firm's operations, work, management and policy.
(4) The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding
of, and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the
firm's operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must
have the ability to intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other
participants in the firm's activities and to make independent decisions concerning the firm's
daily operations, work, management, and policymaking.
(5) If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a
particular license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the
Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or
credential. If state law, County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not require
that the owner posses the license or credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or
credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in determining whether the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6) A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner
from devoting sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its
day to day activities.
(d) Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is one
whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as a
separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC
Director will:
(1) Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities,
equipment, financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2) Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons
associated with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3) Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern
of exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's
independence.
(4) Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with
normal industry practice.
(e) An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f) The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and nonCertified Firms, provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or WBE.

38

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a Certified
Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint Venture
which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property, capital,
efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the
contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of the
relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g) In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h) The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the Office of
Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary documentation
with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.
(i) It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another
agency. Failure to do so may result in the firm's decertification.
(j) The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility criteria.
(k) Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l) A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may protest
the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m) A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n) A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified Firm
as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect
until the CC Director renders a final decision.
Sec. 34-294. Annual aspirational goals.
The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works
contracts and subcontracts shall be twenty-four (24%) percent for MBEs and ten (10%) percent for
WBEs.
Sec. 34-295. Project specific goals.
The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals
for construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform
the anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.

39

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Sec. 34-296. Counting MBE and WBE participation.
(a) The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the
work ofn the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies
and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's
Affiliate).
(b) The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona
fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c) When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the
total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint
Venture's contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is
separately at risk, shall be counted.
(d) Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function
shall be counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function,
the County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the
MBE or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing
and other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e) One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f) If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g) In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE
shall not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297. Contract pre-award compliance procedures.
(a) For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.

40

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012

(b) Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires
that the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c) Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will
determine whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this
determination, the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings,
advertising and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of
work of the contract. The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely,
adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to
allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial
solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.
(2) Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate,
breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE
participation, even when the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items
with its own forces. It is the Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work
available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those portions of the work or material needs
consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their participation.
(3) Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation
includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were
contacted; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for
the work selected for subcontracting; and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs
and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs and WBEs as being unqualified without
sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities. That there may be some
additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is not in itself sufficient
reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such costs are
reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its
own organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all
scopes of work that could be subcontracted.
(4) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5) Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6) Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women
business assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the
recruitment and placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(ed) In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project

41

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(fe) A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(gf) The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in
writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity
to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(hg) If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the
CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Procurement Officer Department.
(ih) If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC
Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-298. Contract administration procedures.
(a) Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project
Specific Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b) The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of
the contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment
submitted to the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User
Department shall monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall
have full and timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll
records, tax returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its
commitment to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion
of the contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision
allowing inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c) The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs
named in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Procurement Officer
and the User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision
and a breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause
termination of the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor
to contract penalties or other sanctions.
(1) All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Procurement Officer and the User
Department in writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A
Contractor shall not substitute a MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated
for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its own forces unless and until the CC Director,
Procurement Officer in consultation with the User Department, approves such substitution in
writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted subcontractor to begin work until both the
Director, Procurement Officer and the User Department have approved the substitution.

42

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012

(2) The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is
prohibited. The Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the
problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE
or WBE can be substituted only where an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price
for the correct scope of work.
(3) Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:
(i) Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.
(ii) Failure of performance.
(iii) Financial incapacity.
(iv) Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.
(v) Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where
agreement upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi) Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or
(vii) The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.
(4) The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any
denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5) Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The
Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new
MBE or WBE. If the Project Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have
been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(6) If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the
Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization
Plan. The Contractor may seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in
obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor. If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good
Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute with a non-Certified Firm.
(d) If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e) Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time they
arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f) Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of the
contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the contract's
scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE commitments

43

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach of the contract
or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the contract.
Sec. 34-299. Sanctions and penalties.
(a) The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:
(1) Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of a
bid, responses to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts documentation,
post award compliance, or other Program operations.
(2) Committing any other violations of this subdivision.
(b) A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract,
termination of the contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed non-responsive in
future County solicitations and contracts as determined by the County's Procurement Officer, if it is found
to have:
(1) Provided false or misleading information in connection with an application for certification or
recertification or colluded with others to do so;
(2) Provided false or misleading information in connection with the submission of a bid or
proposal or documentation of Good Faith Efforts, post-award compliance, or other Program
operations or colluded with others to do so;
(3) Failed in bad faith to fulfill Project Specific Goals, thereby materially breaching the contract;
or
(4) Failed to comply in good faith with substantive provisions of this subdivision.

the CC Director detailing the County's performance under the Program.
(b) The President and the Board of Commissioners will review these reports, including the
Annual Participation Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating
discrimination in its contracting activities and marketplace.
(c) Within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, the County will review the
operation of the Program and the evidentiary basis for the Program in order to determine whether it the
County has a continuing compelling interest in remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its
construction marketplace, and the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress
discrimination against MBEs or WBEs so that the County will not function as a passive participant in a
discriminatory marketplace.
(d) This subdivision shall sunset on or before June 30, 2016.

accordance with all applicable laws. It is hereby found, determined and declared that the purpose of this
Ordinance is to ensure the full and equitable participation of Minority- and Women-Owned Business
Enterprises in the County's procurement process as both prime and subcontractors in the County's Public

all Public Works contracts, regardless of the sources of other funds; provided that any Public Works

expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. In addition, to perform a Commercially Useful Function, the PCE must be responsible, with
respect to materials, equipment and supplies used in performing its portion of the Contract, for
negotiating price, determining whether quality meets specifications, ordering the material, installing
(where applicable) and paying for the material itself. If any section, subsection, clause or provision of
this subdivision is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the subdivision
shall not be affected by such invalidity.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012

(a)
Only Businesses that meet the criteria for certification as a an MBE or WBE may
participate in the Program. The applicant has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the
evidence.
(b)
Only a firm owned by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person(s) may be
certified as an MBE or WBE.
(1)
The firm's ownership by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person must be real,
substantial, and continuing, going beyond pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in ownership
documents. The owner(s) must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership and share in the risks and
profits commensurate with that ownership interest.
(2)
The contributions of capital or Expertise by the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
owner(s) to acquire the ownership interest must be real and substantial. If Expertise is relied upon as part
of a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner's contribution to acquire ownership, the Expertise
must be of the requisite quality generally recognized in a specialized field, in areas critical to the firm's
operations, indispensable to the firm's potential success, specific to the type of work the firm performs
and documented in the firm's records. The individual whose Expertise is relied upon must have a
commensurate financial investment in the firm.
(c)
Only a firm that is managed and controlled by a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged
person(s) may be certified as a MBE or WBE.
(1)
A firm must not be subject to any formal or informal restrictions that limit the customary
discretion of the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s). There can be no restrictions through
corporate charter provisions, by-law provisions, contracts or any other formal or informal devices that
prevent the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s), without the cooperation or vote of any
non-Socially and Economically Disadvantaged person, from making any business decision of the firm,
including the making of obligations or the disbursing of funds.
(2)
The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make day-to-day as well as longterm decisions on management, policy, operations and work.
(3)
The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) may delegate various areas of the
management or daily operations of the firm to persons who are not Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged. Such delegations of authority must be revocable, and the Socially and Economically
Disadvantaged owner(s) must retain the power to hire and fire any such person. The Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must actually exercise control over the firm's operations, work,
management and policy.
(4)
The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have an overall understanding of,
and managerial and technical competence, experience and Expertise, directly related to the firm's
operations and work. The Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must have the ability to
intelligently and critically evaluate information presented by other participants in the firm's activities and
to make independent decisions concerning the firm's daily operations, work, management, and
policymaking.
(5)
If federal, state and/or local laws, regulations or statutes require the owner(s) to have a particular
license or other credential to own and/or control a certain type of firm, then the Socially and

59

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) must possess the required license or credential. If state law,
County ordinance or other law regulations or statute does not require that the owner possess the license or
credential, that the owner(s) lacks such license or credential is a factor, but is not dispositive, in
determining whether the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) actually controls the firm.
(6)
A Socially and Economically Disadvantaged owner cannot engage in outside employment or
other business interests that conflict with the management of the firm or prevent the owner from devoting
sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the firm to manage and control its day to day activities.
(d)
Only an independent firm may be certified as a MBE or WBE. An independent firm is
one whose viability does not depend on its relationship with another firm. Recognition of an applicant as
a separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate that a firm is
independent and non-Affiliated. In determining whether an applicant is an independent Business, the CC
Director will:
(1)
Scrutinize relationships with non-Certified Firms in such areas as personnel, facilities, equipment,
financial and/or bonding support, and other resources.
(2)
Consider whether present or recent employer/employee relationships between the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) of the applicant and non-Certified Firms or persons associated
with non-Certified Firms compromise the applicant's independence.
(3)
Examine the applicant's relationships with non-Certified Firms to determine whether a pattern of
exclusive or primary dealings with non-Certified Firm compromises the applicant's independence.
(4)
Consider the consistency of relationships between the applicant and non-Certified Firms with
normal industry practice.
(e)
An applicant shall be certified only for specific types of work in which the Socially and
Economically Disadvantaged owner(s) has the ability and Expertise to manage and control the firm's
operations and work.
(f)
The County shall certify the eligibility of Joint Ventures involving MBEs or WBEs and
non-Certified Firms, provided that the Joint Venture meets the criteria for certification as an MBE or
WBE. To be considered an eligible Joint Venture, at least one partner of the Joint Venture must be a
Certified Firm, with a share in the capital contribution, control, management, risks, and profits of the Joint
Venture which is equal to its ownership interest. Each Certified Firm partner must contribute property,
capital, efforts, skill and knowledge and be responsible for a distinct, clearly defined portion of the work
of the contract. Joint Ventures must have an agreement in writing specifying the terms and conditions of
the relationships between the partners and their relationship and responsibility to the contract.
(g)
In lieu of conducting its own certifications, the CC Director by rule may accept formal
certifications by other entities as meeting the requirements of the Program, if the CC Director determines
that the certification standards of such entities are comparable to those of the County.
(h)
The certification status of all MBEs and WBEs shall be reviewed periodically by the
Office of Contract Compliance. Failure of the firm to seek recertification by filing the necessary
documentation with the CC Director as provided by rule may result in decertification.

It is the responsibility of the Certified Firm to notify the CC Director of any change in its
circumstances affecting its continued eligibility for the Program, including decertification by another

criteria.

The CC Director shall decertify a firm that does not continuously meet the eligibility

(k)
Decertification by another agency shall create a prima facie case for decertification by the
County. The challenged firm shall have the burden of proving that its County certification should be
maintained.
(l)
A firm that has been denied certification or recertification or has been decertified may
protest the denial or decertification as provided by rule.
(m)
A firm found to be ineligible may not apply for certification for six (6) months after the
effective date of the final decision.
(n)
A third party may challenge the eligibility of an applicant for certification or a Certified
Firm as provided by rule. Such challenges shall be signed and sworn by the individual challenging the
eligibility of an applicant for certification or a certified form. The burden of proof shall rest with the
complainant. Such challenges to eligibility shall be subject to an appeal. The CC Director shall be the
final arbiter of all challenges. The presumption that the challenged firm is eligible shall remain in effect

Sec. 34-294.

Annual aspirational goals.

The Annual Aspirational Goals for the utilization of MBEs and WBEs on County Public Works contracts
and subcontracts shall be twenty-four (24%) percent for MBEs and ten (10%) percent for WBEs.
Sec. 34-295.

Project specific goals.

The CC Director, in consultation with the User Department, shall establish Project Specific Goals for
construction Contracts based upon the availability of at least three MBEs and three WBEs to perform the
anticipated subcontracting functions of the project and the County's utilization of MBEs and WBEs to
date.
Sec. 34-296.

Counting MBE and WBE participation.

(a)
The entire amount of that portion of a contract that is performed by the MBEs or WBEs own
forces shall be counted, including the cost of supplies and materials obtained by the MBE or WBE for the
work ofn the contract, and supplies purchased or equipment leased by the MBE or WBE (except supplies
and equipment the MBE or WBE purchases or leases from the prime Contractor or the prime Contractor's
Affiliate).
(b)
The entire amount of fees or commissions charged by a MBE or WBE for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services, or for providing bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of a contract, shall be counted, provided the fee is
reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily charged for similar services.
(c)
When a MBE or WBE performs as a participant in a Joint Venture, only the portion of the total
dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the Joint Venture's

61

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
contract that is performed by the MBE or WBE with its own forces and for which it is separately at risk,
shall be counted.
(d)
Only expenditures to a MBE or WBE that is performing a Commercially Useful Function shall be
counted. To determine whether a MBE or WBE is performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
County will evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, whether the amount the MBE
or WBE is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and
other relevant factors. To perform a Commercially Useful Function, the MBE or WBE must be
responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining
quality and quantity, ordering the material, installing (where applicable) and paying for the material itself.
A MBE or WBE does not perform a Commercially Useful Function if its role is limited to that of an extra
participant in the contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain the appearance of MBE or
WBE participation. If a MBE or WBE subcontracts a greater portion of the work of a contract than would
be expected based on normal industry practice, it is presumed not to perform a Commercially Useful
Function. When a MBE or WBE is presumed not to be performing a Commercially Useful Function, the
Certified Firm may present evidence to rebut this presumption.
(e)
One hundred percent of the cost of the materials or supplies obtained from a MBE or WBE
Manufacturer or Regular Dealer shall be counted. One hundred percent of the fees or transportation
charges for the delivery of materials or supplies required on a job site shall be counted only if the
payment of such fees is a customary industry practice and are commensurate with fees customarily
charged for similar services.
(f)
If a firm ceases to be a Certified Firm for any other reason than graduation from the M/WBE
Construction Program during its performance on a contract, the dollar value of work performed under a
contract with that firm after it has ceased to be certified shall not be counted.
(g)
In determining achievement of Project Specific Goals, the participation of a MBE or WBE shall
not be counted until that amount has been paid to the MBE or WBE.
Sec. 34-297.

Contract pre-award compliance procedures.

(a)
For all solicitations, the bidder/proposer shall submit a Utilization Plan detailing all
subcontractors from which the Contractor solicited bids or quotations, and if Project Specific Goals have
been established, its achievement of the Goals or its Good Faith Efforts to do so. The Utilization Plan
shall be due at the time the bid / proposal is due.
(b)
Any agreement between a Contractor and a MBE or WBE in which the Contractor requires that
the MBE or WBE not provide subcontracting quotations to other Contractors is prohibited.
(c)
Where the Contractor cannot achieve the Project Specific Goal(s), the CC Director will determine
whether the Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts to meet the Goal(s). In making this determination,
the Director will consider, at a minimum, the Contractor's efforts to:
(1) Solicit through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising
and written notices) the interest of all MBEs and WBEs certified in the scopes of work of the contract.
The Contractor shall provide interested MBEs and WBEs with timely, adequate information about the
plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract to allow MBEs and WBEs to respond to the
solicitation. The Contractor must follow up initial solicitations with interested MBEs and WBEs.

62

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
(2)
Select portions of the work to be performed by MBEs and WBEs in order to increase the
likelihood that the Project Specific Goals will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out
contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate MBE and WBE participation, even when
the Contractor would otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces. It is the
Contractor's responsibility to make a portion of the work available to MBEs and WBEs and to select those
portions of the work or material needs consistent with the availability MBEs and WBEs to facilitate their
participation.
(3)
Negotiate in good faith with interested MBEs and WBEs. Evidence of such negotiation includes
the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of MBEs and WBEs that were contacted; a description of
the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting;
and why agreements could not be reached with MBEs and WBEs. The Contractor may not reject MBEs
and WBEs as being unqualified without sound reasons based on a thorough investigation of their
capabilities. That there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using MBEs and WBEs is
not in itself sufficient reason for a Contractor's failure to meet the Project Specific Goals, as long as such
costs are reasonable. The ability or desire of a Contractor to perform the work of a contract with its own
organization does not relieve it of the responsibility to make Good Faith Efforts on all scopes of work that
could be subcontracted.
(4)
Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, or
insurance as required by the County or the prime Contractor, where appropriate.
(5)
Make efforts to assist interested MBEs and WBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies,
materials, or related assistance or services, where appropriate.
(6)
Use the services of the Office of Contract Compliance, available minority/women community
organizations, minority/women contractors' groups, government sponsored minority/women business
assistance offices and other appropriate organizations to provide assistance in the recruitment and
placement of MBEs and WBEs.
(ed)
In determining whether a Contractor has made Good Faith Efforts, the performance of other
Contractors in meeting the Project Specific Goals may be considered. For example, when the apparent
successful Contractor fails to meet the Project Specific Goals but others meet it, it may be reasonably
questioned whether, with additional reasonable efforts, the apparent successful Contractor could have met
the Project Specific Goals. Similarly, if the apparent successful Contractor fails to meet the Project
Specific Goals, but meets or exceeds the average MBE or WBE participation obtained by other
Contractors, this may be evidence that the apparent successful Contractor made Good Faith Efforts.
(fe)
A signed letter of intent from each listed MBE or WBE, describing the work, materials,
equipment or services to be performed or provided by the MBE or WBE and the agreed upon dollar value
shall be due at the time of bid proposal or within three days after such submission.
(gf)
The CC Director shall timely review the Utilization Plan before award, including the scope of
work and the letters of intent from MBEs and WBEs. The CC Director may request clarification in
writing of items listed in the Utilization Plan, provided such clarification shall not include the opportunity
to augment listed participation or Good Faith Efforts.
(hg)
If the CC Director determines that the Utilization Plan demonstrates that the Project Specific
Goals have been achieved or Good Faith Efforts made, with the concurrence of the User Department, the
CC Director and User Department shall recommend award to Procurement Officer Department.

63

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
(ih)
If the CC Director finds that a Contractor did not make sufficient Good Faith Efforts, the CC
Director shall communicate this finding to the User Purchasing Department and recommend that the
bid/proposal be rejected. A Contractor may protest this determination pursuant to the County's bid protest
procedures.
Sec. 34-298.

Contract administration procedures.

(a)
Upon award of a contract by the County that includes Project Specific Goals, the Project Specific
Goals become covenants of performance by the Contractors and incorporated in the contract.
(b)
The Contractor shall provide a listing of all subcontractors to be used in the performance of the
contract, and detailed subcontractor information to the County with each request for payment submitted to
the County or as otherwise directed by the County. The CC Director and the User Department shall
monitor subcontractor participation during the course of the contract. The County shall have full and
timely access to the Contractor's books and records, including without limitation payroll records, tax
returns and records and books of account, to determine the Contractor's compliance with its commitment
to MBE and WBE participation and the status of any MBE or WBE performing any portion of the
contract. This provision shall be in addition to, and not a substitute for, any other provision allowing
inspection of the Contractor's records by any officer or official of the County for any purpose.
(c)
The Contractor cannot make changes to the Utilization Plan or substitute MBEs or WBEs named
in the Utilization Plan without the prior written approval of the CC Director, Procurement Officer and the
User Department. Unauthorized changes or substitutions shall be a violation of this subdivision and a
breach of contract, and may constitute grounds for rejection of the bid or proposal or cause termination of
the executed contract for breach, the withholding of payment and/or subject the Contractor to contract
penalties or other sanctions.
(1)
All requests for changes or substitutions of a MBE or WBE Subcontractor(s) named in the
Utilization Plan shall be made to the CC Director, Procurement Officer and the User Department in
writing, and shall clearly and fully set forth the basis for the request. A Contractor shall not substitute a
MBE or WBE subcontractor or perform the work designated for a MBE or WBE subcontractor with its
own forces unless and until the CC Director, Procurement Officer in consultation with the User
Department, approves such substitution in writing. A Contractor shall not allow a substituted
subcontractor to begin work until both the Director, Procurement Officer and the User Department have
approved the substitution.
(2)
The facts supporting the request must not have been known nor reasonably should have been
known by either party before the submission of the Utilization Plan. Bid shopping is prohibited. The
Contractor must negotiate with the MBE or WBE subcontractor to resolve the problem. Where there has
been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the MBE or WBE can be substituted only where
an agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price for the correct scope of work.
(3)

Substitutions of the subcontractor shall be permitted only on the following bases:

(i)

Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed.

(ii)

Failure of performance.

(iii)

Financial incapacity.

(iv)

Refusal by the subcontractor to honor the bid or proposal price.

64

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012

(v)
Mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where agreement
upon a reasonable price cannot be reached.
(vi)

Failure of the subcontractor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; or

(vii)

The subcontractor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal.

(4)
The final decision whether to permit or deny the proposed substitution, and the basis of any
denial, shall be communicated to the parties in writing by the CC Director.
(5)
Where the Contractor has established the basis for the substitution to the satisfaction of the
County, the Contractor shall make Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may
seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE. If the Project
Specific Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute
with a non-Certified Firm.
(6)
If the County requires the substitution of a MBE or WBE subcontractor listed in the Utilization
Plan, the Contractor shall undertake Good Faith Efforts to fulfill the Utilization Plan. The Contractor may
seek the assistance of the Office of Contract Compliance in obtaining a new MBE or WBE subcontractor.
If the Goal(s) cannot be reached and Good Faith Efforts have been made, the Contractor may substitute
with a non-Certified Firm.
(d)
If a Contractor plans to hire a subcontractor on any scope of work that was not previously
disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the CC Director to modify the
Utilization Plan and must make Good Faith Efforts to ensure that MBES and WBEs have a fair
opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.
(e)
Changes to the scopes of work shall be documented by the User Department at the time
they arise to establish the reasons for the change and the effect on achievement of the MBE or WBE goal.
(f)
Prior to contract closeout, the CC Director shall evaluate the Contractor's fulfillment of
the contracted goals, taking into account all approved substitutions, terminations and changes to the
contract's scope of work. If the County determines that Good Faith Efforts to meet the MBE or WBE
commitments were not made, or that fraudulent misrepresentations have been made, or any other breach
of the contract or violation of this subdivision, a remedy or sanction may be imposed, as provided in the
contract.
Sec. 34-299.
(a)

Sanctions and penalties.

The following violations of this subdivision may result in a breach of contract:

(1)
Providing false or misleading information to the County in connection with submission of a bid,
responses to requests for qualifications or proposals, Good Faith Efforts documentation, post award
compliance, or other Program operations.
(2)

Committing any other violations of this subdivision.

(b)
A Contractor or subcontractor is subject to withholding of payments under the contract,
termination of the contract for breach, contract penalties, or being barred or deemed non-responsive in

65

Participation Goals and the County's progress towards meeting those Goals and eliminating
discrimination in its contracting activities and marketplace.
(c)
Within five years after the effective date of this ordinance, the County will review the operation
of the Program and the evidentiary basis for the Program in order to determine whether it the County has
a continuing compelling interest in remedying discrimination against MBEs and WBEs in its construction
marketplace, and the permissible scope of any narrowly tailored remedies to redress discrimination
against MBEs or WBEs so that the County will not function as a passive participant in a discriminatory
marketplace.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Commissioners of the County of Cook,
Illinois, as follows:
Section 1. Findings. The Corporate Authorities hereby find that all of the recitals contained in the
preambles to this Ordinance are full, true and correct and do hereby incorporate them into this Ordinance
by this reference. It is hereby found and determined that the Corporate Authorities have been authorized
by law to issue the Series 2012 Bonds to pay the costs of the Series 2012 Project. It is hereby found and
determined that such borrowing of money pertains to the government and affairs of the County, is
necessary for the welfare of the government and affairs of the County, is for a proper public purpose or

determinations shall be deemed conclusive. The issuance of the Series 2012 Bonds is authorized by the

the First Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the County, such Master Trust Indenture to be in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and such First Supplemental Indenture to be in

with such changes therein as shall be approved by the President or Chief Financial Officer executing the

Authorities’ approval of any changes or revisions therein from the form attached hereto. All capitalized
terms used in this Ordinance without definition shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the

Trustee or Registrar shall be cancelled by the Trustee in accordance with Section 1205 hereof. Any such
new Bonds issued pursuant to this Section in substitution for Bonds alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost

conditions as the definitive Bonds except as to the denominations thereof and as to exchangeability, one
or more temporary Bonds substantially of the tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which such
temporary Bond or Bonds are issued, in Authorized Denominations, and with such omissions, insertions
and variations as may be appropriate to temporary Bonds. The County at its own expense shall prepare

ARTICLE IV
REDEMPTION OF BONDS

Section 401.
Privilege of Redemption and Redemption Price. Bonds subject to redemption
prior to maturity shall be redeemable, upon notice given as provided in this Article IV, at such times, at
such Redemption Prices and upon such terms, in addition to the terms contained in Article IV, as may be
specified in the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Series.
Section 402.
Redemption at the Election or Direction of the County. In the case of any
redemption of Bonds at the election or direction of the County, the County shall give written notice to the
Trustee of its election or direction so to redeem, of the date fixed for redemption, of the Series, and of the

110

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
principal amounts of the Bonds of each maturity of such Series to be redeemed. Such notice shall be
given at least thirty-five (35) days prior to the specified redemption date or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Trustee. In the event notice of redemption shall have been given as in Section 405
provided, there shall be paid on or prior to the specified redemption date to the Trustee an amount in cash
or Government Obligations maturing on or before the specified redemption date which; together with
other moneys, if any, available therefor held by the Trustee, will be sufficient to redeem all of the Bonds
to be redeemed on the specified redemption date at their Redemption Price plus interest accrued and
unpaid to the date fixed for redemption; such amount and moneys shall be held in a separate, segregated
account for the benefit of the Owners of the Bonds so called for redemption.
Section 403.
Redemption Otherwise Than at County’s Election or Direction. Whenever by the
terms of this Master Indenture the Trustee is required or authorized to redeem Bonds otherwise than at the
election or direction of the County, the Trustee shall select the Bonds to be redeemed, give the notice of
redemption and pay the Redemption Price thereof, plus interest accrued and unpaid to the date fixed for
redemption, in accordance with the terms of Articles IV and V to the extent applicable.
Section 404.
Selection of Bonds to Be Redeemed. Unless otherwise provided by Supplemental
Indenture, if less than all of the Bonds of like maturity of any Series shall be called for prior redemption,
the particular Bonds or portion of Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected at random by the Trustee not
more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such manner as the Trustee in its discretion
may deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that the portion of any Bond of a denomination of
more than the minimum Authorized Denomination for the Bonds of such Series to be redeemed shall be
in the principal amount of an Authorized Denomination for the Bonds of such Series and that, in selecting
portions of such Bonds for redemption, the Trustee shall treat each such Bond as representing that number
of Bonds of said minimum Authorized Denomination which is obtained by dividing the principal amount
of such Bond to be redeemed in part by said minimum Authorized Denomination. If all Bonds of any
Series are held in book-entry only form, the particular Bonds or portions thereof of such Series to be
redeemed shall be selected by the securities depository for such Series of Bonds in such manner as such
securities depository shall determine.
Section 405.
Notice of Redemption. When the Trustee shall receive notice from the County of
its election or direction to redeem Bonds pursuant to Section 402, and when redemption of Bonds is
authorized or required pursuant to Section 403, the Trustee shall give notice, in the name of the County,
of the redemption of such Bonds, which notice shall specify the Series and maturities of the Bonds to be
redeemed, the date fixed for redemption and the place or places where amounts due upon such date fixed
for redemption will be -payable and, if fewer than all of the Bonds of any like Series and maturity are to
be redeemed, the letters and numbers or other distinguishing marks of such Bonds so to be redeemed, and,
in the case of Bonds to be redeemed in part only, such notice shall also specify the respective portions of
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Such notice shall further state that on such date there shall
become due and payable the Redemption Price of each Bond to be redeemed, or the Redemption Price of
the specified portions of the principal thereof in the case of Bonds to be redeemed in part only, together
with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and that from and after such date interest thereon
shall cease to accrue and be payable. The Trustee shall mail copies of such notice by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, not less than 30 (thirty) days before the date fixed for redemption, to the Owners of the
Bonds to be redeemed at their addresses as shown on the registration books of the County maintained by
the Registrar. If the Trustee mails notices of redemption as herein provided, notice shall be conclusively
presumed to have been given to all Owners.
With respect to an optional redemption of any Bonds, unless moneys sufficient to pay the
Redemption Price of the Bonds to be redeemed shall have been received by the Trustee prior to the giving
of such notice of redemption, such notice may, at the option of the County, state that said redemption
shall be conditional upon the receipt of such moneys by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for

111

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
redemption. If such moneys are not received, such notice shall be of no force and effect, the County shall
not redeem such Bonds and the Trustee shall give notice, in the same manner in which the notice of
redemption was given, that such moneys were not so received and that such Bonds will not be redeemed.
If the notice of redemption to be given in connection with an optional redemption of any Series of
Bonds is not made expressly conditional as provided in the preceding paragraph, the Trustee will not give
any such unconditional notice of redemption unless sufficient funds to pay the full Redemption Price of
such Series of Bonds to be redeemed are on deposit with the Trustee at the time such notice is given.
Section 406.
Payment of Redeemed Bonds. Notice having been given in the manner provided
in Section 405, the Bonds or portions thereof so called for redemption shall become due and payable on
the date fixed for redemption at the Redemption Price, plus interest accrued and unpaid to such date, and,
upon presentation and surrender thereof at any place specified in such notice, such Bonds, or portions
thereof, shall be paid at the Redemption Price, plus interest accrued and unpaid to such date. If there shall
be called for redemption less than all of a Bond, the County shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and the appropriate Fiduciary shall deliver, upon the surrender of such Bond, without charge
to the Owner thereof, for the unredeemed balance of the principal amount of the Bond so surrendered,
fully registered Bonds of like Series and maturity in any Authorized Denominations. If, on the date fixed
for redemption, moneys for the redemption of all the Bonds or portions thereof of any like Series and
maturity to be redeemed, together with interest to such date, shall be held by the Trustee so as to be
available therefor on said date and if notice of redemption shall have been given as aforesaid, then, from
and after the date fixed for redemption, interest on the Bonds or portions thereof of such Series and
maturity so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and become payable. If said moneys shall not be
so available on the date fixed for redemption, such Bonds or portions thereof shall continue to bear
interest until paid at the same rate as they would have borne had they not been called for redemption.

Payment Date on which a Sinking Fund Installment is due, to the purchase of
Outstanding Bonds of the Series and maturity for which such Sinking Fund Installment
was established. That portion of the purchase price attributable to accrued interest shall
be paid from the Interest Sub-Account. All such purchases of Outstanding Bonds shall
be made at prices not exceeding the applicable sinking fund Redemption Price of such
Bonds plus accrued interest, and such purchases shall be made in such manner as the
County shall determine. The principal amount of any Bonds so purchased shall be
deemed to constitute part of the Principal Sub-Account until the Principal Payment Date
on which such Sinking Fund Installment is due, for the purpose of calculating the amount
on deposit in such Sub-Account.

(2)

At any time up to the thirty-fifth (35th) day next preceding the next Principal Payment
Date on which a Sinking Fund Installment is due, the County may purchase with any
available funds Outstanding Bonds of the Series and of the maturity for which such

proceed to call for redemption on such Principal Payment Date Outstanding Bonds of the
Series and maturity for which such Sinking Fund Installment was established in such
amount as shall be necessary to complete the retirement of the unsatisfied portion of such
Sinking Fund Installment. The Trustee shall pay out of the Principal Sub-Account (after
transfers thereto from the Debt Service Reserve Fund, if required) to the appropriate
Paying Agents, on or before the day preceding such redemption date, the Redemption
Price required for the redemption of the Outstanding Bonds so called for redemption, and

such Outstanding Bonds surrendered by the County for such date or (ii) the amounts
remaining to the credit of all Sub-Accounts of the Debt Service Fund in excess of the
amounts required to be on deposit to the credit thereof. The transfer described in this
paragraph (4) shall be made prior to the transfer described in Section 505(D), below.

(5)

If the principal amount of Outstanding Bonds retired pursuant to this subsection through
application of amounts in satisfaction of any Sinking Fund Installment shall exceed such

other than from the Principal Sub-Account of Outstanding Bonds of any Series and
maturity for which Sinking Fund Installments have been established, such excess or the
principal amount of Outstanding Bonds so purchased or redeemed, as the case may be,
shall be credited toward future scheduled Sinking Fund Installments either (i) in the order
of their due dates or (ii) in such order as the County establishes in a certificate signed by

in Section 603(A) hereof. Investment income earned as a result of such investment shall be retained in
said Sub-Accounts.
(D)
On each Principal Payment Date, the Trustee shall determine the amount, if any,
remaining in the Principal Sub-Account after all requirements for the payment of principal of the Bonds
on such Principal Payment Date have been satisfied. Any such amount shall be transferred promptly from
the Principal Sub-Account to the County and deposited in the Pledged Sales Tax Revenue Fund and
applied pursuant to Section 504(B) hereof; provided, however, that no amounts derived from the
investment of moneys in the Principal Sub-Account shall be so transferred but shall be retained therein.

Outstanding Bonds shall be set aside in such Sub-Account and applied to the payment of the interest on
the Bonds with respect to which such proceeds were deposited in accordance with the provisions of the
Supplemental Indenture authorizing the issuance of such Bonds.

(A)
In lieu of the required deposits into any Series Sub-Account of the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, the County may cause to be deposited into such Series Sub-Account a surety bond, an insurance
policy, a letter of credit or other credit facility (any such instrument referred to herein as a “Debt Reserve
Credit Facility”) which, in each case, shall be in an amount equal to the difference between the applicable
Series Debt Service Reserve Requirement and the sums then on deposit to the credit of such Series SubAccount. Any Debt Service Credit Facility shall be payable to the Trustee for the equal and ratable
benefit of all of the Owners of the Outstanding Bonds of such Series on any date on which moneys shall
be required to be withdrawn from such Series Sub-Account and applied to the payment of the Principal of
or interest on any such Series of Bonds which withdrawal cannot be met by any cash on deposit to the
credit of such Series Sub-Account. The insurer providing such surety bond or insurance policy shall be
an insurer whose municipal bond insurance policies insuring the payment, when due, of the principal of
and interest on municipal bond issues results in such issues being rated in either of the two highest rating
categories by any of the Rating Agencies, or any insurer who holds either of the two highest policyholder
ratings accorded insurers by A.M. Best & Co. (or any comparable service) at the time of deposit. The
letter of credit issuer shall be a bank or trust company and any other credit facility issuer shall be a
company or other legal entity which is rated in either of the two highest rating categories by any of the
Rating Agencies, and the letter of credit or other credit facility itself shall be rated in either of the two
highest categories of each of such Rating Agencies at the time of deposit. If a disbursement is made
pursuant to any Debt Reserve Credit Facility pursuant to this subparagraph 506(A), the County shall be
obligated either (i) to reinstate the maximum limits of such Debt Reserve Credit Facility in accordance
with the terms thereof or (ii) to deposit to the credit of such Series Sub-Account, funds in the amount of
the disbursement made under such Debt Reserve Credit Facility, or a combination of such alternatives, as
shall provide that the amount to the credit of such Series Sub-Account equals the Series Debt Service

117

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
Reserve Requirement within a time period not longer than would have been required to restore such
Series Sub-Account by operation of Section 504(B)(3) hereof.
(B)
In the event that any Debt Reserve Credit Facility deposited with the Trustee as provided
in subparagraph (A) above is withdrawn by the issuer thereof or expires and is not renewed, the County
shall fund the resulting deficiency with respect to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement (a) by
depositing in the applicable Series Sub-Account a new Debt Reserve Credit Facility meeting the
requirements of subparagraph (A) above or (b) by funding the Series Debt Service Reserve Requirement
from Pledged Sales Tax Revenues as provided in subparagraph (A) above.

Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

(A)
The recitals of fact herein and in the Bonds contained shall be taken as the statements of
the County and no Fiduciary assumes any responsibility for the correctness of the same. No Fiduciary
makes any representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Master Indenture or of any Bonds issued
hereunder or as to the security afforded by this Master Indenture, and no Fiduciary shall incur any liability
in respect thereof. The Trustee shall, however, be responsible for any representation contained in its
certificate on the Bonds. No Fiduciary shall be under any responsibility or duty with respect to the
application of any moneys paid to the County or to any other Fiduciary. No Fiduciary shall be under any
obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in expense or liability or to institute or
defend any suit in respect hereof, or to advance any of its own moneys, unless properly indemnified.
Subject to the provisions of paragraph (B) of this Section, no Fiduciary shall be liable in connection with
the performance of its duties hereunder except for its own negligence or misconduct.
(B)
In case an Event of Default has occurred and has not been remedied, the Trustee shall
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Master Indenture, and shall use the same degree
of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the
conduct of his or her own affairs. Any provision of this Master Indenture relating to action taken or to be
taken by the Trustee or to evidence upon which the Trustee may rely shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section.

thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as
it may deem reasonable.

the Trustee or the Owners.

Section 1002. Supplemental Indentures Effective upon Consent of Owners. Any Supplemental
Indenture not effective in accordance with Section 1001 shall take effect only if permitted and approved
and in the manner prescribed by Article XI.
Section 1003. Filing of Counsel’s Opinion. Each Supplemental Indenture described in Section

Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized by the County in accordance with the provisions of this
Master Indenture, is authorized or permitted by this Master Indenture and, when executed and delivered,
will be valid and binding upon the County, the Owners and the Trustee.
ARTICLE XI
AMENDMENTS
Section 1101. Mailing. Any provision in this Article for the mailing of a notice or other
information to Owners shall be fully complied with if it is mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid or
delivered only to each Owner of Bonds then Outstanding at its address, if any, appearing upon the
registration books of the County kept by the Registrar.
Section 1102. Powers of Amendment. Except for Supplemental Indentures described in Section
1001, any modification or amendment of this Master Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the
County and of the Owners of the Bonds hereunder, in any particular, may be made by a Supplemental
Indenture with the written consent given as provided in Section 1103 hereof (i) of the Owners of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding at the time such consent is given, and (ii) in case
less than all of the several Series of Bonds then outstanding are affected by the modification or
amendment, of the Owners of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds of each Series so
affected and Outstanding at the time such consent is given; provided, however, that if such modification
or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any specified like Series and
maturity remain Outstanding, the consent of the Owners of such Bonds shall not be required and such
Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation of Outstanding Bonds
under this Section. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption
or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bonds, or of any installment of interest thereon or a
reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon
without the consent of the Owner of such Bond, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the
classes of Bonds the consent of the Owners of which is required to effect any such modification or
amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its written
assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section, a Series shall be deemed to be affected by a modification
or amendment of this Master Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the
Owners of Bonds of such Series. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not the rights of

132

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
the Owners of Bonds of any particular Series or maturity would be adversely affected or diminished by
any such modification or amendment, and its determination shall be binding and conclusive on the
County and all Owners of the Bonds.
Consent of Owners. The County may at any time authorize the execution and delivery of a Supplemental
Indenture making a modification or amendment permitted by the provisions of Section 1102, to take
effect when and as provided in this Section. Upon the authorization of such Supplemental Indenture, a
copy thereof shall be delivered to and held by the Trustee for the inspection of the Owners. A copy of
such Supplemental Indenture (or summary thereof or reference thereto in form approved by the Trustee)
together with a request to Owners for their consent thereto in form satisfactory to the Trustee, shall be
mailed to the Owners, but failure to mail such copy and request shall not affect the validity of such
Supplemental Indenture when consented to as in this Section provided. Such Supplemental Indenture
shall not be effective unless and until, and shall take effect in accordance with its terms when (a) there
shall have been filed with the Trustee (i) the written consents of the Owners of the required principal
amount of Outstanding Bonds, and (ii) a Counsel’s Opinion stating that the execution and delivery of
such Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized by the County in accordance with the provisions
of this Master Indenture, is authorized or permitted by this Master Indenture and, when effective, will be
valid and binding upon the County, the Owners and the Trustee, and (b) a notice shall have been mailed
as hereinafter in this Section provided. A certificate or certificates by the Trustee delivered to the County
that consents have been given by the Owners of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of
the Trustee shall be conclusive. Any such consent shall be binding upon the Owner of the Bonds giving
such consent and upon any subsequent Owner of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange
therefor whether or not such subsequent Owner has notice thereof; provided, however, that any consent
may be revoked by any Owner of such Bonds by filing with the Trustee, prior to the time when the
Trustee’s written statement hereafter in this Section referred to is filed, a written revocation, with proof
that such Bonds are held by the signer of such revocation. The fact that a consent has not been revoked
may be proved by a certificate of the Trustee to the effect that no revocation thereof is on file with it.
Any consent, or revocation thereof, may be delivered or filed prior to any mailing or publication required
by this Article and shall not be deemed ineffective by reason of such prior delivery or filing. Within 30
days of any date on which the consents on file with the Trustee and not theretofore revoked shall be
sufficient under this Section, the Trustee shall make and deliver to the County a written statement that the
consents of the Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Bonds have been filed with the
Trustee. Such written statement shall be conclusive that such consents have been so filed. Any time
thereafter notice, stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture has been consented to by the
Owners of the required principal amount of Outstanding Bonds and will be effective as provided in this
Section, shall be given by mailing to the Owners (but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein
shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming effective and binding). The Trustee shall
deliver to the County proof of the mailing of such notice. A record, consisting of the information required
or permitted by this Section to be delivered by or to the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein
stated.
Section 1103. Modifications by Unanimous Action. The Indenture and the rights and
obligations of the County and of the Owners of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended in any
respect by a Supplemental Indenture effecting such modification or amendment and with the consents of
the Owners of all the Bonds then Outstanding, each such consent to be accompanied by proof of the
holding at the date of such consent of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given. Such
Supplemental Indenture shall take effect upon the filing (a) with the Trustee of (i) a copy thereof, (ii) such
consents and accompanying proofs and (iii) the Counsel’s Opinion referred to in Section 1103 and (b)
with the County of the Trustee’s written statement that the consents of the Owners of all Outstanding
Bonds have been filed with it. No mailing or publication of any Supplemental Indenture (or reference
thereto or summary thereof) or of any request or notice shall be required. No such modification or

133

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
amendment, however, shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its
written assent thereto.
Section 1104. Exclusion of Bonds. Bonds owned or held by or for the account of the County
shall not be deemed Outstanding and shall be excluded for the purpose of any calculation required by this
Article. At the time of any consent or other action taken under this Article, the County shall furnish the
Trustee a certificate of an Authorized Officer, upon which the Trustee may rely, identifying all Bonds so
to be excluded.
Section 1105. Notation on Bonds. Bonds authenticated and delivered after the effective date of
any action taken as in Article X or this Article provided may, and if the Trustee so determines shall, bear
a notation by endorsement or otherwise in form approved by the County and the Trustee as to such action,
and upon demand of the Owner of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date and presentation of its
Bond to the Trustee, suitable notation shall be made on such Bond by the Trustee as to any such action. If
the County or the Trustee shall so determine, new Bonds so modified which, in the opinion of the Trustee
and the County, conform to such action may be prepared, authenticated and delivered, and upon demand
of the Owner of any Bond then Outstanding shall be exchanged, without cost to such Owner, for such
Bond then Outstanding.
ARTICLE XII
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 1201.

Defeasance.

(A)
If the County shall pay or cause to be paid or there shall otherwise be paid to the Owners
of all Bonds the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due thereon,
at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Master Indenture, then the pledge of any
Pledged Sales Tax Revenues and other moneys and securities pledged under this Master Indenture and all
covenants, agreements and other obligations of the County to the Owners shall thereupon be discharged
and satisfied. In such event, the Trustee, upon request of the County, shall provide an accounting of the
assets managed by the Trustee to be prepared and filed with the County for any year or part thereof
requested, and shall execute and deliver to the County all such instruments as may be desirable to
evidence such discharge and satisfaction, and the Fiduciaries shall pay over or deliver to the County all
moneys and securities held by them pursuant to this Master Indenture which are not required for the
payment of Bonds not previously surrendered for such payment or redemption. If the County shall pay or
cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Owners of all Outstanding Bonds of a particular
Series, maturity within a Series or portion of any maturity within a Series (which portion shall be selected
by lot by the Trustee in the manner provided in Section 404 hereof for the selection of Bonds to be
redeemed in part), the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, thereof and interest due or to become
due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Master Indenture, such Bonds
shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Master Indenture, and all covenants,
agreements and obligations of the County to the Owners of such Bonds and to the Trustee shall thereupon
be discharged and satisfied.
(B)
Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall have
been set aside and held in trust by the Escrow Agent at or prior to their maturity or redemption date shall
be deemed to have been paid within the meaning of and with the effect expressed in this Section 1201 if
the County shall have delivered to or deposited with the Escrow Agent (a) irrevocable instructions to pay
or redeem all of said Bonds in specified amounts no less than the respective amounts of, and on specified
dates no later than the respective due dates of, their principal, (b) irrevocable instructions to publish or

134

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
mail the required notice of redemption of any Bonds so to be redeemed, (c) either moneys in an amount
which shall be sufficient, or Defeasance Obligations the principal of and the interest on which when due
will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time,
shall be sufficient, to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and
to become due on said Bonds on and prior to each specified redemption date or maturity date thereof, as
the case may be, and (d) if any of said Bonds are not to be redeemed within the next succeeding 60 days,
irrevocable instructions to mail to all Owners of said Bonds a notice that such deposit has been made with
the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section and stating
the maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are to be available for the payment of the principal or
Redemption Price, if applicable, of said Bonds. The Defeasance Obligations and moneys deposited with
the Trustee pursuant to this Section shall be held in trust for the payment of the principal or Redemption
Price, if applicable, and interest on said Bonds. No payments of principal of any such Defeasance
Obligations or interest thereon shall be withdrawn or used for any purpose other than the payment of such
principal or Redemption Price of, or interest on, said Bonds unless after such withdrawal the amount held
by the Trustee and interest to accrue on Defeasance Obligations so held shall be sufficient to provide fully
for the payment of the principal of or Redemption Price and interest on such Bonds, at maturity or upon
redemption, as the case may be.
(C)
Amounts deposited with the Trustee for the payment of the principal of and interest on
any Bonds deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201, if so directed by the County, shall be applied
by the Trustee to the purchase of such Bonds in accordance with this subsection. Bonds for which a
redemption date has been established may be purchased on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding
the redemption date. The principal amount of Bonds to be redeemed shall be reduced by the principal
amount of Bonds so purchased. Bonds which mature on a single future date may be purchased at any
time prior to the maturity date. All such purchases shall be made at prices not exceeding the applicable
principal amount or Redemption Price established pursuant to paragraph (B) of this Section 1201, plus
accrued interest, and such purchases shall be made in such manner as the Trustee shall determine. No
purchase shall be made by the Trustee pursuant to this subsection if such purchase would result in the
Trustee holding less than the moneys and Defeasance Obligations required to be held for the payment of
all other Bonds deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201.
(D)
The County may purchase with any available funds any Bonds deemed to be paid
pursuant to this Section 1201 in accordance with this subsection. Bonds for which a redemption date has
been established may be purchased by the County on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the
redemption date. On or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the redemption date the County shall
give notice to the Trustee of its intention to surrender such Bonds on the redemption date. The Trustee
shall proceed to call for redemption the remainder of the Bonds due on the redemption date and shall pay
to the County on the redemption date the Redemption Price of and interest on such Bonds upon surrender
of such Bonds to the Trustee. Bonds which mature on a single future date may be purchased at any time
prior to the maturity date. The Trustee shall pay to the County the principal amount of and interest on
such Bonds upon surrender of such Bonds on the maturity date.
(E)
Any time after any Bonds are deemed to be paid pursuant to this Section 1201, the
County shall not at any time permit any of the proceeds of the Bonds or any other funds of the County to
be used directly or indirectly to acquire any securities or obligations the acquisition of which would cause
any Bond to be an “arbitrage bond” as defined in the Code and Regulations.
(F)
Each Fiduciary shall continue to be entitled to reasonable compensation for all services
rendered under this Master Indenture, notwithstanding that any Bonds are deemed to be paid pursuant to
this Section 1201.

135

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
(G)
Anything in this Master Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by a
Fiduciary in trust for the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds which remain unclaimed for two
years after the date when such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates
or by call for earlier redemption, if such moneys were held by the Fiduciary at such date, or for two years
after the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited with the Fiduciary after the said date when such
Bonds become due and payable, shall, at the written request of the County, be repaid by the Fiduciary to
the County, as its absolute property and free from trust, and the Fiduciary shall thereupon be released and
discharged with respect thereto and the Owners of such Bonds shall look only to the County for the

Commissioners agreed to the entry of the subject order during its meeting of July 31, 2007.
On June 18, 2008, the District Court entered an order amending this portion of the TA
Order permitting the Transitional Administrator to maintain the OTA funds in a separate

The Transitional Administrator has now presented invoice payment records evidencing
payments and a balance in the account as of May 23, 2012 in the amount of $121,984.59
which has been reviewed and accepted by the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. The
TA has requested the District Court to enter an order providing for an additional
disbursement of $500,000.00 into the OTA account which was approved by the Court on
June 13, 2012.
Upon approval, the Cook County Comptroller will transfer $500,000.00 from the SelfInsurance Fund to an account managed by the Transitional Administrator account in
accordance with the terms of the aforementioned court order. From July 22, 2008 to date,
inclusive of this court order, $6,800,000.00 has been transferred from the Self-Insurance

Compensation Commission approved a settlement contract entered into with the advice and
consent of the Finance Subcommittee on Workers’ Compensation. The Petitioner

COOK COUNTY CEMETERY (PROPOSED RESOLUTION).
Submitting a
Proposed Resolution sponsored by John A. Fritchey, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY CEMETERY
WHEREAS, recent events as well as investigations by the Cook County Sheriff have
brought into serious question and unfortunate light, the manner by which the Cook
County’s indigent, unclaimed and unknown individuals have been buried; and
WHEREAS, disturbing practices have included persons stacked eight coffins high, bodies
placed in coffins with unidentified limbs and skeletal remains from other bodies, medical
waste and non-human debris, and coffins buried haphazardly in a manner making future
location for personal or law enforcement purposes, difficult if not impossible; and
WHEREAS, such practices not only demonstrate an unacceptable lack of respect for the
least fortunate among us and are unbecoming of a civilized society, but additionally
impede ongoing criminal investigations in cases of unknown decedents, as the identifying
characteristics of hundreds of unidentified remains buried by the County have failed to be

171

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
entered into the NCIC (National Crime Information Center), the nationally recognized
database for tracking crime-related information; and
WHEREAS, the discovery of the above-mentioned practices led to the introduction and
passage of an ordinance on May 4, 2011, setting new standards and safeguards for the
manner in which burials of the indigent, unclaimed and unknown are handled in Cook
County; and
WHEREAS, said ordinance clarified the role and responsibilities of the Office of the
Medical Examiner in preparing the bodies for burial as well as the methods by which
burials are to be conducted by cemeteries that have contracts with the county for such
burials; and
WHEREAS, this Government is ultimately responsible for these individuals, and
consequently it is the in the best interest of the County and its residents for the County to
once again operate a cemetery for the burial of our County’s indigent, unclaimed and
unknown persons; and
WHEREAS, for over a century, from 1854-1971, Cook County operated, maintained and
administered its own cemetery, the most recent site having been located on the land
adjacent to the Oak Forest Hospital, known as the Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent,
where tens of thousands of individuals have previously been laid to rest; and
WHEREAS, the reestablishment of a permanent Cook County Cemetery would not only
ensure that our indigent are put to rest in a respectful manner, but it would also facilitate
proper documentation for law enforcement purposes, proper maintenance, as well as save
the County millions of dollars; and
WHEREAS, with the use of approximately 5 acres of land contiguous to the location of
the former Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent, the County could establish a cemetery
capable of meeting the needs of the County for the next 100 years; and
WHEREAS, the aforesaid land is presently owned and maintained by the Forest Preserve
District of Cook County; and
WHEREAS, since the Forest Preserve acquired said cemetery, no plan for addressing the
former cemetery site has been forthcoming, and as such, ample opportunity still exists to
determine a proper use of that parcel and the surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, there exist several precedents for the co-existence of cemeteries on Forest
Preserve property, including Bachelors Grove Cemetery, Sauerbier-Burkhardt Cemetery
and the above-mentioned Cook County Cemetery for the Indigent; and
WHEREAS, the County Highway Department already owns the equipment necessary to

BUREAU OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND
DEVELOPMENT (PROPOSED RESOLUTION). Transmitting a Communication, dated
June 20, 2012 from Herman Brewer, Chief:

185

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012

respectfully submitting this Resolution regarding Brighton Trading Inc.'s request for a
Class 6b property tax incentive for special circumstances and substantial rehabilitation for
an industrial building located at 4920 South Monitor, Chicago, Illinois in unincorporated
Cook County. The applicant has leased the facility to Aqua Ocean for the warehousing and
distribution of frozen fish.
Brighton Trading, Inc. requests approval of the tax incentive based on the special
circumstances that the property has been vacant for more than 24 months; and there has
been no purchase for value under the Class 6b Ordinance. This Resolution is required so
that the company can complete its application to the Assessor of Cook County.
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Toni Preckwinkle, President and John P.
Daley, County Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has adopted a Real Property
Assessment Classification 6b incentive that provides an applicant a reduction in the
assessment level for an industrial facility; and
WHEREAS, the County Board of Commissioners has received and reviewed an
application from Brighton Trading Inc. located in an unincorporated area of Cook County
for an abandoned industrial facility located at 4902 South Monitor, Chicago, Cook County,
Illinois, County Board District #11, Property Index Number: 19-08-202-032-0000; and
WHEREAS, Cook County has defined abandoned property as buildings and other
structures that, after having been vacant and unused for at least 24 months, are purchased
for value by a purchaser in whom the seller has no direct financial interest; and
WHEREAS, industrial real estate is normally assessed at 25% of its market value.
Qualifying industrial real estate eligible for the Class 6b can receive a significant reduction
in the level of assessment from the date that new construction or rehabilitation has been
completed, or in the case of abandoned property from the date of substantial re-occupancy.
Properties receiving Class 6b will be assessed at 10% of the market value for 10 years,
15% for the 11th year and 20% in the 12th year; and
WHEREAS, in the instance where the property does not meet the definition of abandoned
property, the municipality or the Board of Commissioners, may determine that special
circumstances justify finding that the property is abandoned for the purpose of Class 6b;
and
WHEREAS, the real estate is located in an unincorporated area of Cook County, the Cook
County Board must by lawful Resolution or Ordinance, expressly state that it supports and
consents to the filling of a Class 6b Application and that it finds Class 6b necessary for
development to occur on the subject property; and
WHEREAS, in the case of abandonment of over 24 months and no purchase for value by
a disinterested buyer, the County may determine that special circumstances justify finding
the property is deemed abandoned; and

186

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners has determined that the building
was abandoned for 41 months at the time of application, with no purchase for value and
that special circumstances are present; and
WHEREAS, the applicant estimates that the re-occupancy will create 3 new full-time jobs
and 4 part-time jobs; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook finds that the Class 6b tax incentive is necessary for
development to occur on this specific real estate. The County of Cook further cites that the
subject property has been vacant and unused for more than 24 months and there will be no
purchase for value; and
WHEREAS, the applicant acknowledges that it must provide an affidavit to the Assessor's
Office stipulating that it is in compliance with the County’s Living Wage Ordinance prior
to receiving the Class 6b incentive on the subject property.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the President and Board of
Commissioners of the County of Cook, State of Illinois, that the President and Board of
Commissioners validate the property located at 4902 South Monitor, Chicago, Cook
County, Illinois, is deemed abandoned with special circumstances under the Class 6b; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County Clerk is hereby authorized and directed
to forward a certified copy of this Resolution to the Office of the Cook County Assessor.

The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Resolution:
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
ESTABLISHING A COOK COUNTY LAND BANK ADVISORY COMMITTEE
WHEREAS, the current housing and economic crisis has deep and wide-ranging
consequences in Cook County; and
WHEREAS, the growing incidence of vacant, abandoned, tax-delinquent, and foreclosed
properties in neighborhoods throughout the region have had a chilling effect on economic
development and cause harm to overall economic health; and
WHEREAS, the problem only threatens to deepen as more than 85,000 foreclosure cases

194

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
are currently pending in Cook County which may lead to the lowering of neighbors’
property values, weakening the tax base, and imposing additional costs on local
government; and
WHEREAS, foreclosure and vacant buildings cannot be contained by suburban borders,
ward boundaries or districts; we must tackle vacant and abandoned properties throughout
the County by repurposing the tools and resources that reside in our home rule authority;
and
NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the President of the Cook County Board
assemble a Cook County Land Bank Advisory Committee (“Advisory Committee”) that
may include but not be limited to representatives from the President's Office, Cook
County Bureau of Economic Development, City of Chicago, Housing Authority of Cook
County, Office of the Cook County State’s Attorney, Suburban Elected Officials,
Suburban Mayors and Managers Associations, regional planning agencies, civic leaders,
affordable housing developers, and local realtors within 60 days of the passage of this
Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Advisory Committee shall consider potential
models for a Cook County Land Bank, including but not limited to: (1) creation of a notfor-profit redevelopment authority established under the County’s charter in partnership
with the Bureau of Economic Development; (2) creation of a permanent Countywide
Advisory Board established by the Cook County Board President to work with a
designated not-for-profit development authority or the Cook County Bureau of Economic

the Cook County; or (3) creation of a not-for-profit redevelopment authority established
under the Housing Authority of Cook County in partnership with Cook County; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in determining the recommended Cook County Land
Bank model, the Advisory Committee shall consider at a minimum the following goals: (1)
ability to eliminate harms caused by vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties by
returning them to productive use; (2) ability to eliminate barriers to returning properties to
productive use, such as cloudy title; and (3) ability to hold properties for a limited duration
until they can be effectively conveyed to new owners in accordance with redevelopment
plans; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, in determining the recommended Cook County Land
Bank model, the Advisory Committee shall at a minimum consider the following benefits
of creating a Countywide Land Bank: (1) vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties
that have been allowed to become growing liabilities to communities could be returned to
productive use; (2) the tax base could be strengthened by returning unproductive properties
to productive use; (3) planning capacity available to local communities could be increased;
and (4) property targeted for redevelopment could be held in trust, reducing the number of
repeated transfers of low value property by speculators; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee should take into consideration
the potential budget, target areas, scope of services and governance of a Cook County Land
Bank with the goals stated above; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Advisory Committee shall further evaluate methods
and recommend initiatives to further market existing tax credit classes via the Cook
County Bureau of Economic Development which would allow for the conveyance of

195

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
various tax exemptions upon the authorization of the Cook County Board that could lead to
revitalization, incentivize economic growth, facilitate affordable housing and increase open
space; and

within 60 days of appointment of the Advisory Committee, to the President and Board of
Commissioners of Cook County recommending a model or models for a countywide Cook
County Land Bank; and

Violations and Penalty of the Cook County Code is hereby amended as follows:
Sec. 30-213.
Violations and Penalty.
(a)
After any person has been previously notified of three or more violations of this chapter
within any consecutive 12-month period in respect to the emission of smoke, particulate, or other matter
by the same piece of equipment in excess of the emission limitations herein provided or in respect to
violations of other requirements provided in this chapter, such person shall be notified in writing to show
cause before the Director on a day certain, not less than 20 days from date of service of such notice, why
the equipment or process causing such violations should not be sealed. The Director may refer the
violation notice to the Cook County Department of Administrative Hearings for a hearing to be conducted
by an administrative law officer or an administrative law judge following all rules and procedures set
forth in Chapter 2, Article IX of the Cook County Code. This last notice herein provided for may be given
by mail, directed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or if such person or the
whereabouts of such person is unknown, then by posting a notice on or near the premises at which the
violations shall have occurred. Upon the date specified in the notice such person may appear at such
hearing in person or by representative, with or without counsel. If such person fails to appear at such
hearing or if upon such hearing the administrative law officer or administrative law judge shall find and
determine that the violations are due to defective equipment or equipment which is incapable of being
operated within the maximum emission limitations established by or under this chapter, or that corrective
measures previously ordered by the Director have not been employed to eliminate the causes producing
the violations, the administrative law officer or administrative law judge may enter an order revoking any
certificate or permit outstanding for such equipment or process and directing that the same be sealed by
an inspector or other authorized agent of the Director. In making the finding and determination
hereinabove referred to, the administrative law officer or administrative law judge shall, in the case of
smoke density or opacity measurements, take into consideration whether the equipment is capable of
being operated within the particulate matter limitations provided in Division 3 of this article.
(b)
Upon notice and hearing, if notice and hearing has not previously been provided, the
Director may order that the use of any fuel-burning, combustion, or process equipment or device shall be
discontinued and may seal such equipment or process:
(1)
When a certificate of operation is refused in the case of any original, annual, or
subsequent inspection, because the person required to procure such certificate has not
complied with the provisions of this chapter;
(2)
In the case of movable equipment, or portable boilers, or vehicles, when immediate
correction of a condition causing a violation of this chapter is not made by the operator of
such equipment, portable boiler, or vehicle when ordered to do so by the Director or
authorized representative.
(a)
Persons liable.
(1)
Unless otherwise specifically provided, the owner, the owner's agent for the purpose of
managing, controlling, or collecting rents, and any other person managing or controlling
a building or premises, in any part of which there is a violation of the provisions of this

249

managing or controlling the vehicle, and any other person managing or controlling the
vehicle shall be liable for any violation therein, existing or occurring, or which may have
existed or occurred, at or during any time when such person is or was the person owning
or managing or controlling, or acting as agent in regard to the vehicle. Wherever used in
the provisions of this chapter, the term "owner" shall include any person entitled under
any agreement to the control or direction of the management or disposition of the vehicle.

management, or control, unless the trustee in a proceeding under the provisions of this
chapter discloses in a verified pleading or in an affidavit filed with the court or the
Department of Administrative Hearings, the name and last known address of each person
who was a beneficiary of the trust at the time of the alleged violation and of each person,
if any, who was then acting as agent for the purpose of managing, controlling, or
collecting rents, as the same may appear on the records of the trust.

Sec. 30-962. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish a program for recycling and salvaging
of construction and demolition waste consistent with the Cook County Solid Waste Plan.
This Ordinance is intended to introduce reuse and recycling requirements that will help
achieve Cook County’s goal to:
(1)

Reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste generated at the

source;
(2)
Regulate the salvage and transport of salvageable construction and
demolition material and to prevent the improper disposal of construction and
demolition debris within the County of Cook; and,
(3)
Recover materials for the purpose of recycling and reuse that would
otherwise be discarded and return them to the economy.
Sec. 30-963. Findings.
(a)

The County finds and determines that:

(1)

The County is committed to protecting the public health, safety, welfare
and environment and in order to meet these commitments it is necessary
that the County promote the reduction of solid waste and reduce the stream
of solid waste going to landfills.

(2)

The debris generated in construction and demolition projects accounts
for a significant portion of the materials disposed of in landfills and a
large percentage of such debris is comprised of materials particularly
suitable for recycling.

(3)

The reuse and recycling of certain portions of construction and

252

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JULY 24, 2012
demolition debris is essential to further the County’s efforts to reduce solid
waste.

(a) After any person has been previously notified of three or more violations of this
chapter within any consecutive 12-month period in respect to the emission of
smoke, particulate, or other matter by the same piece of equipment in excess of the
emission limitations herein provided or in respect to violations of other
requirements provided in this chapter, such person shall be notified in writing to
show cause before the Director on a day certain, not less than 20 days from date of

employed to eliminate the causes producing the violations, the administrative law
officer or administrative law judge may enter an order revoking any certificate or
permit outstanding for such equipment or process and directing that the same be
sealed by an inspector or other authorized agent of the Director. In making the
finding and determination hereinabove referred to, the administrative law officer or
administrative law judge shall, in the case of smoke density or opacity
measurements, take into consideration whether the equipment is capable of being
operated within the particulate matter limitations provided in Division 3 of this
article.

have existed or occurred, at or during any time when such person is or
was the person owning or managing, controlling, or acting as agent in
regard to the buildings or premises. Wherever used in the provisions of
this chapter, the term "owner" shall include any person entitled under
any agreement to the control or direction of the management or
disposition of the building or premises or of any part of the building or

for any violation therein, existing or occurring, or which may have
existed or occurred, at or during any time when such person is or was
the person owning or managing or controlling, or acting as agent in
regard to the vehicle. Wherever used in the provisions of this chapter,
the term "owner" shall include any person entitled under any agreement
to the control or direction of the management or disposition of the
vehicle.
(2) The liabilities hereunder imposed on an owner shall attach to a
trustee under a land trust, holding title to such building, structure, or
premises without the right of possession, management, or control, unless
the trustee in a proceeding under the provisions of this chapter discloses
in a verified pleading or in an affidavit filed with the court or the
Department of Administrative Hearings, the name and last known
address of each person who was a beneficiary of the trust at the time of
the alleged violation and of each person, if any, who was then acting as
agent for the purpose of managing, controlling, or collecting rents, as the
same may appear on the records of the trust.
(b) Penalty clause. Any person, firm, or corporation or agents, employees or
contractors of such who violate, disobey, omit, neglect or refuse to comply with or
who resist enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to
fines of not less than any of the values detailed in the following table but not more
than $10,000.00. Violations of the ordinance not listed in the following table are
subject to fines not less than $300.00 and not more than $10,000.00. Collected fines

not honored by a financial institution. The Cook County Department of
Administrative Hearings shall set the matter for a hearing to be conducted by an
administrative law judge following all rules and procedures set forth in Chapter
2, Article IX, of the Cook County Code. In addition to assessing a fine, the
administrative law judge may, as a sanction, order the respondent to pay any
outstanding compliance fees alleged in the citation and found by the
administrative law judge to be due and owing to the Department. In determining
the amount of the fine the following factors shall be taken into consideration:
(1)The gravity of the offense,
(2)The respondent's past history with respect to compliance with the
provisions of this chapter,
(3)The respondent's financial situation,
(4)The extent of respondent's cooperation,
(5)The likelihood that the respondent will violate the provisions of this
chapter in the future, unless deterred from doing so by the imposition of
the maximum fine, and

Violations and Penalty.

(a)
After any person has been previously notified of three or more violations of this chapter
within any consecutive 12-month period in respect to the emission of smoke, particulate, or other matter
by the same piece of equipment in excess of the emission limitations herein provided or in respect to
violations of other requirements provided in this chapter, such person shall be notified in writing to show
cause before the Director on a day certain, not less than 20 days from date of service of such notice, why
the equipment or process causing such violations should not be sealed. The Director may refer the
violation notice to the Cook County Department of Administrative Hearings for a hearing to be
conducted by an administrative law officer or an administrative law judge following all rules and
procedures set forth in Chapter 2, Article IX of the Cook County Code. This last notice herein provided
for may be given by mail, directed to the last known address of the person to be notified, or if such
person or the whereabouts of such person is unknown, then by posting a notice on or near the premises at
which the violations shall have occurred. Upon the date specified in the notice such person may appear at
such hearing in person or by representative, with or without counsel. If such person fails to appear at such
hearing or if upon such hearing the administrative law officer or administrative law judge shall find and
determine that the violations are due to defective equipment or equipment which is incapable of being
operated within the maximum emission limitations established by or under this chapter, or that corrective
measures previously ordered by the Director have not been employed to eliminate the causes producing
the violations, the administrative law officer or administrative law judge may enter an order revoking any
certificate or permit outstanding for such equipment or process and directing that the same be sealed by
an inspector or other authorized agent of the Director. In making the finding and determination
hereinabove referred to, the administrative law officer or administrative law judge shall, in the case of
smoke density or opacity measurements, take into consideration whether the equipment is capable of
being operated within the particulate matter limitations provided in Division 3 of this article.
(b)
Upon notice and hearing, if notice and hearing has not previously been provided, the
Director may order that the use of any fuel-burning, combustion, or process equipment or device shall be
discontinued and may seal such equipment or process:
(1)

When a certificate of operation is refused in the case of any original, annual, or
subsequent inspection, because the person required to procure such certificate has not
complied with the provisions of this chapter;

(2)

In the case of movable equipment, or portable boilers, or vehicles, when immediate
correction of a condition causing a violation of this chapter is not made by the operator of
such equipment, portable boiler, or vehicle when ordered to do so by the Director or
authorized representative.

requesting authorization for the Chief Procurement Officer to enter into and execute a contract with A
Safe Haven, LLC, Chicago, Illinois, to provide housing and appropriate support services to
eligible participants as referred and space availability for a minimum of eight (8) eligible participants of
the Cook County Sheriff's Electronic Monitoring Program.
Reason:

As of June 2, 2012, there were approximately 104 detainees who were eligible for release
from the Cook County Department of Corrections into the Electronic Monitoring Program,
but had no residence to accommodate the electronic monitoring equipment.
In an effort to reduce the population at the Cook County Department of Corrections and to
provide rehabilitative services to qualifying detainees, the Cook County Sheriff's Office and
the Cook County Justice Advisory Council have worked together to find suitable residency
for these detainees. A Safe Haven, LLC was chosen because they could accommodate our
security requirements and currently provide similar services to the Illinois Department of
Corrections.
The funding for this contract will be paid partially by the Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund
and the Justice Advisory Council. The Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund will cover the
approximate cost of room and board and the Justice Advisory Council will cover the cost of
treatment services. A Safe Haven, LLC will allow housing and appropriate support services
for participants as referred and space availability for a minimum of eight (8) participants
every day of the week.
The total cost per day per participant will be $51.67.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: not to exceed $62,850.00. Sheriff's Inmate Welfare Fund.
