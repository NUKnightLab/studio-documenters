COMMISSIONERS
PROPOSED ORDINANCES

Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by
MIKE QUIGLEY, FORREST CLAYPOOL, EARLEAN COLLINS, GREGG GOSLIN,
ROBERTO MALDONADO and JOHN P. DALEY, County Commissioners
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
COOK COUNTY FACILITY SMOKING POLICY
WHEREAS, in 1988, the City of Chicago enacted the "Clean Indoor Air Ordinance" that requires all
employers located within Chicago to enact a smoking policy; and
WHEREAS, in response to the City of Chicago Ordinance, the Cook County Board of Commissioners
adopted a resolution setting forth a smoking policy for County facilities; and
WHEREAS, since that time there has been new research as to the effects of secondhand smoke; and
WHEREAS, secondhand smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, of which 200 are known
poisons including carbon monoxide, arsenic, cyanide, benzene and formaldehyde; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies secondhand smoke as a " Class A
Carcinogen"; and

191

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

WHEREAS, secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in America and causes
cancer, stroke, heart disease, SIDS and asthma; and
WHEREAS, employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack
and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory
disease and measurable decrease in lung function; and
WHEREAS, there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and
WHEREAS, (I) the U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and
nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to
secondhand smoke, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has detennined that second hand smoke
cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation, (3) air cleaners, which are only
capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in
secondhand smoke, (4) ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments because it cannot determine
a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer-causing chemicals, and ASHRAE
acknowledges that the technology does not exist that can remove chemicals from the air that cause cancer;
and
WHEREAS, persons with business in County facilities should not be required to subject themselves to
smoke as a part of their conducting business in those facilities; and
WHEREAS, both the City of Chicago "Clean Indoor Air Ordinance" and the " Illinois Clean Indoor Air
Act" permit the banning of smoking in public places; and
WHEREAS, in response to the risks associated with smoking, the Sheriff of Cook County has banned
smoking throughout the Department of Corrections; and
WHEREAS, providing a healthful and safe work place for all employees and member of the public using
County facilities should be given priority over providing a convenient place for persons to smoke.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that
smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes or tobacco in any other fonn is not permitted in any areas of any
facility owned or operated by Cook County, including without limitation those facilities housing
administrative offices, courthouses, detention facilities or jails; and that this ban on smoking applies to all
public areas of Cook County fac ilities as well as all areas used only by County employees or officials,
including without limitation individual offices; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that smoking is also prohibited in all vehicles owned or leased by the
County of Cook; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that smoking is prohibited within a reasonable distance of 25 feet
outside of an enclosed area, owned or operated by the County of Cook, where smoking is prohibited, so
to prohibit congestion at exits that could constitute a fire hazard in the event of an emergency evacuation
of the building; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED, that the Board of Commissioners of Cook County directs that all

COOK COUNTY INVOLUNTARY SMOKE REDUCTION ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, secondhand smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, of which 200 are known
poisons including carbon monoxide, arsenic, cyanide, benzene and formaldehyde; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies secondhand smoke as a "Class A
Carcinogen"; and
WHEREAS, secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in America and causes
cancer, stroke, heart disease, SIDS and asthma; and
WHEREAS, employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack
and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory
disease and measurable decrease in lung function; and
WHEREAS, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to
public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability and a workplace with
exposure to secondhand smoke could therefore be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and
WHEREAS, there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and
WHEREAS, (I) the U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and
nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to
secondhand smoke, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency has determined that second hand smoke
cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation, (3) air cleaners, which are only
capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in
secondhand smoke, (4) ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers) bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke-free environments because it cannot detennine
a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains cancer-causing chemicals, and ASHRAE
acknowledges that the technology does not exist that can remove chemicals from the air that cause cancer;
and

193

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

WHEREAS, exposure to secondhand smoke costs the nation $5 billion in direct medical costs and $5
billion in indirect medical costs annually; and
WHEREAS, limiting the exposure to secondhand smoke will result in considerable savings to taxpayers
through the reduction of direct and indirect medical costs to County employees and taxpayers utilizing
County health facilities; and
WHEREAS, the states of California, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Utah, Vennont, Idaho, Connecticut,
South Dakota, Maine, Delaware and Florida adopted protective clean indoor air laws that eliminate
workers', patrons' and visitors' exposure to secondhand smoke; and
WHEREAS, since 2002, 90 independent studies have concluded that there is either no impact or there is
a positive impact after the implementation of smoke-free restaurant/bar Jaws and Jaws banning smoking in
the workplace; and
WHEREAS, the Cook County Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this
Ordinance are (1) to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public places and
places of employment, and (2) the guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air which
shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
COOK COUNTY RUBBERIZED ASPHALT PILOT PROJECT
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt, also known as asphalt-rubber or A-R, is a blend of asphalt cement,
reclaimed tire rubber, and certain additives, in which the rubber component is at least 15 percent by
weight of the total blend; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is routinely used in paving projects in Arizona, California, and Texas,
among other states; and
WHEREAS, use of rubberized asphalt takes scrap tires out of the waste stream, alleviating the
environmental and fiscal costs of tire disposal; and
WHEREAS, every lane mile of roadway constructed with rubberized asphalt requires between 500 and
2,000 used tires; and
WHEREAS, repaving just five percent of the nation' s roads each year with rubberi zed asphalt would
remove all scrap tires from the waste stream; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt reduces highway noise by 60 percent compared to conventional asphalt,
according to a study conducted by Sacramento County, California; and
WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is used successfully in cold climates, including the Sierra Nevada
mountains in California and areas in Arizona at elevations exceeding 7 ,000 feet, where winter
temperatures dip to -20 degrees Fahrenheit; and
WHEREAS, increased use of rubberized asphalt by local governments such as Cook County could have
a transformative effect on the market for paving materials, given local governments' status among the
largest purchasers of goods and services in the United States; and

WHEREAS, rubberized asphalt is more durable and therefore more economical than conventional
asphalt, with several recent studies confirming that rubberized asphalt has lower life-cycle costs; and

reducing the frequency with which traffic is disrupted by road reconstruction projects; and
WHEREAS, a study by the Arizona Department of Transportation found that 10-year maintenance costs
for rubberized asphalt were $500 per lane-mile, compared to $1,400 per Jane-mile for conventional
asphalt; and
WHEREAS, widespread use of rubberized asphalt by Cook County has the potential to save taxpayers
money by reducing spending on road construction and repair over the Jong term.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, that the Highway Department is hereby directed to select a capital improvement project
related to roads, parking lots, sidewalks, biking or walking paths, or other pedestrian or vehicular

Resolution; and
BE IT FURTHER ORDAINED RESOLVED, that the Highway Department report back to the Board
no later than 3 months after completion of the project with an initial evaluation of the perfonnance of

Matthew F. Walsh - Deputy Chief, Cook County Sheriffs Police

Vice Chainnan Steele inquired how the Ordinance defines the scope of enforceable area.

262

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

Commissioner Suffredin replied that enforceable area is defined under Section 13-74, Right to Inspect
and under Section 13-75, Penalty for Ordinance Violation. The State's Attorney's Office has determined
that private property is not an enforceable area. Enforceable areas are comprised of public streets,
parking Jots that are open to pedestrians and anywhere that Cook County Sheriffs police are invited onto
the property.
Vice Chairman Steele inquired what measures are taken to ensure that fines are paid by violators.
Commissioner Suffredin responded fines are enforced in the Circuit Court. Additionally, the fined person
will have to provide proof that he/she has purchased a vehicle sticker.
Vice Chairman Steele inquired as to the cost of the fines.
Commissioner Suffredin replied the judge determines all fines within the following parameters: the fine
for the Jack of a vehicle sticker is, at minimum, $75 per offense. If a person steals a vehicle sticker, the
fine ranges from $200 to $500.

Vice Chairman Steele, seconded by Commissioner Gorman, moved to amend Section 13-75(c) of the
Substitute Ordinance by inserting "nor more than $150 per offense" at the end of the first sentence.
The motion to amend carried, and Section 13-75(c) now reads as follows:
(c) Penalty for Failure to Properly Display Sticker
Any owner, driver or motor vehicle in violation of these provisions
requiring a license shall be fined not less than seventy-five dollars
($75.00) per offense nor more than one hundred fifty dollars ($ J 50) per
offense.
In response to Commissioner Hansen's concern relative to Section 13-74, Assistant State's Attorney
Helen Haynes, suggested additional language in Section 13-74, Right to Inspect, as referenced in the
following motion.

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Suffredin, moved to amend Section 13-74 by
inserting "registered to an address in unincorporated Cook County" after "any vehicle" and
inserting "Cook County" after "not displaying a". The motion to amend carried, and Section 13-74
now reads as follows :
13-74 Right to Inspect
The Cook County Sheriffs Police are hereby authorized to issue
citations to any vehicle registered to an address in unincorporated Cook
County on the public way in unincorporated Cook County that is not
displaying a Cook County vehicle sticker and furthermore, officers of
the Cook County Sheriffs Police shall have the authority to enter the
following places for purposes of ascertaining whether vehicles parked
therein are in compliance with this Ordinance and issue citations
accordingly:

263

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

ill

Any parking lot that is open to pedestrian traffic.

Nothing in this section authorizes any officer to force, break, or remove
any lock or door in order to gain entry to any of the foregoing places.
In response to an inquiry by Commissioner Sims, Commissioner Suffredin clarified that Forest Preserve
police have no authority under this Ordinance because they do not have patrol authority outside of Forest
Preserve District lands. However, because some Forest Preserve land is in unincorporated Cook County,
Commissioner Suffredin agreed to look into the matter for the future.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the Ordinance's expected revenue generation.
Barbara Bruno, Director of the Cook County Department of Revenue, responded that $I million to $2
million in new revenue is expected. The additional revenue will result from the increased fees and
enhanced enforcement. Currently, $1 million in revenue is generated annually.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired as to the current fine payment compliance rate.
Ms. Bruno replied approximately 91,000 forms are mailed out each year. Last year approximately 45,000
forms were returned with payment. Hence the compliance rate last year was approximately 50%. Most
of these forms are renewal applications. A second mailing is sent out to those people who do not respond
to the first mailing.
In response to Com missioner Silvestri 's concern regarding the vehicle sticker purchasing compliance rate,
Ms. Bruno suggested that the Department of Revenue could supply the SherifPs Office with a list of
those persons not in compliance.
Commissioner Suffredin noted the Ordinance mm1m1zes administrative costs with regard to senior
citizens. Their stickers currently cost $ 1 and are renewed annuall y. The Substitute Ordinance charges
senior citizens $5 for a vehicle sticker that is valid for as long as that senior citizen owns the vehicle.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired whether vehicle stickers are sold through township offices.
Ms. Bruno replied in the affirmative. She further stated a percentage of the County's revenue is obtained
from township offices. The County supplies township offices with blank applications. Applications
received from the County can be turned in at township offices.
Commissioner Silvestri inquired how the senior citizen stickers will be differentiated from all other
stickers.
Ms. Bruno replied that senior citizen stickers will constitute a distinct class.
Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved to amend Section 13-75(c), by
striking the second sentence, "Each vehicle in violation and each day a violation continues shall
constitute a separate, distinct and chargeable offense separate and apart from any other fees for
purchase of said license(s) or any applicable late fees." The motion to amend carried, and Section
13-75(c) now reads as follows :

264

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

(c) Penalty for Failure to Properly Display Sticker
Any owner, driver or motor vehicle in violation of these provisions

N. Silvestri, County Commissioners.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the Purchasing Agent of Cook County is charged with the responsibility of
soliciting bids and entering into contracts for commodities and services as specified by all
Cook County agencies; and
WHEREAS, the Office of the Cook County Purchasing Agent strives to serve the
citizens of the County of Cook through the use of sound, prudent, and consistent
procurement practices for those departments and agencies which report to the President

certain commodities and services are appropriate for procurement under terms outlined in
the issuance of a Request for Proposal, commonly referred to as an " RFP"; and
WHEREAS, the technical and detailed nature of the process for development of an
effective RFP may in certain cases require assistance, advice, or oversight from
professional consultants who are compensated accordingly for their work product; and
WHEREAS, in such cases, a conflict of interest may exist in the event that a professional
consultant, acting as either an individual or business entity and party to a contractual
relationship with Cook County, under terms providing for services related to the

County in the performance of duties or provision of goods and/or services as described in
the RFP; and
WHEREAS, among purchasing professionals in both the private and public sectors,
commonly known best practices in the industry are specifically designed to prevent such
conflicts of interest when the purchaser is acquiring goods and services under the aegis of
an RFP process; now, therefore
BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the Board
does hereby amend the Cook County Purchasing Act to incorporate these industry best
practices, and to prohibit the awarding of contracts for goods and/or services to any
individual or business entity under the tenns of a Request for Proposal, when said
individual or business entity was directly and substantially involved in drafting, writing,
researching or preparing the RFP and any ancillary documents related to same; and

ORDINANCE). Submitting a Proposed Ordinance sponsored by Larry Suffredin, Bobbie
L. Steele and Peter N. Silvestri, County Commissioners; Co-Sponsored by Joan Patricia
Murphy, County Commissioner.
The following is a synopsis of the Proposed Ordinance:
PROPOSED ORDINANCE
WHEREAS, conducting fair and impartial elections is one of the most important
functions of government to insure confidence in the democratic process; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook often faces shortages of election workers with
technological skills on Election Day; and
WHEREAS, recruiting reliable Precinct Assistants who can devote Election Day to
assisting judges in technical trouble-shooting and setting up equipment is essential to the
integrity of the electoral process; and
WHEREAS, such temporary assignments have had a favorable impact on the election
process.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED THAT:
the County of Cook, in conjunction with the Cook County Clerk's Office, wi ll
undertake a pilot program to recruit, train and assign 100 employees of Cook County
from selected offices of County officials to serve as Precinct Assistants on Election Day
in suburban Cook County. The pilot program will be in effect for the elections on March
2 1 and November 7, 2006.

regular work assignment with the pennission of the chief executive of their department,
agency or bureau to assist with Election Day activities in suburban Cook County. They
will serve as Precinct Assistants to ensure that all polling places are operated efficiently
and accurately. These employees will receive a one-time stipend, the amount depending
on specific work assignments, in addition to their nonnal day' s pay.
(3)
The Cook County Clerk's Office and the President's Office will implement this
pilot program.
*Referred to the Committee on Finance on 12/06/05.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

SUBSTITUTE ORDINANCE FOR COMMUNICATION NO. 274516
PROPOSED ORDINANCE CREATING A PILOT
COOK COUNTY ELECTION TECHNICAL ASSISTANT PROGRAM
WHEREAS, conducting fair and impartial elections is one of the most important
functions of government to insure confidence in and the integrity of the democratic
process; and
WHEREAS, elections within Cook County, excluding that portion of those elections
which is conducted within the City of Chicago, ("suburban elections") are the
responsibility of the Cook County Clerk; and
WHEREAS, suburban elections are conducted at polling places for each election
precinct which are under the supervision of Election Judges appointed by the Cook
County Clerk; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with the federal Help America Vote Act ("HA VA"), the
Cook County Clerk is implementing new voting equipment ("System") beginning with
the March 21, 2006 primary election, which System will replace the punch card system
which has been in use during suburban elections for many years; and
WHEREAS, the new System will include several new types of equipment which
represent the latest in election technology and which will be easier for voters to use; and
WHEREAS, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new System, it is critical that
reliable and qualified personnel be trained and available in the precinct polling places to
set up and operate the new System equipment; and
WHEREAS, even in previous suburban elections using the older punch card voting
equipment, the Cook County Clerk has experienced difficulties in identifying and training
a sufficient number of workers with technological skills to assist on election day; and
WHEREAS, the Clerk, the President and the Board have identified a cost effective and
reliable solution to deploy trained technical assistants to provide technical troubleshooting and equipment set up assistance on behalf of the Clerk on election day and
desire to implement this solution on a pilot basis.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED THAT:
( 1)
Pilot Program Established. The County of Cook, in conjunction with
the Cook County Clerk's Office and the Board President's Office and with the
voluntary cooperation of the elected officials comprising County government,
will undertake a pilot program to recruit, train and assign 100 employees working
within Cook County government to serve as technical assistants for the March
21, 2006 primary and the November 7, 2006 General Election.

277

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21 , 2005

(2)

Compensation and T raining of Technical Assistants. Cook County employees
who qualify for, are selected and agree to participate as technical assistants in the
pilot program will be excused from their regular work assignments with the
pennission of the chief executive of their department, agency or bureau to attend
a mandatory two-hour training workshop. If they successfully complete this
training workshop, technical assistants shall also be excused from their regular
work assignment with the permission of the chief executive of their department,
agency or bureau on Election Day to provide technical assistance in suburban
Cook County. In addition to their regular salaries, these election assistants will
receive either overtime pay or a stipend payment, the amount of which shall
depend on the specific work assignment, to compensate them for h ours worked
beyond a normal eight hour day for each suburban election worked.

(3)

Implementation. The Cook County Clerk's office, the President's Office and
the Cook County elected officials who voluntarily participate in this pilot
program shall enter into an interagency agreement setting forth the details of their
participation in the program for each election.

(4)

Effective Date. This Ordinance shall go into effect immediately upon passage
by the Board of Commissioners.

Chairman Daley inquired whether funds for this program are currently available to the Clerk's Office.
Brandon Neese, Deputy County Clerk, replied in the affinnative. He specified that funds are available in
the 120 Account (Overtime), and in the 133 Account (Per D iem). He noted that the latter account is used
specifically for election-day employees. He further noted that there should be sufficient funds allocated
for these accounts.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to amend the Substitute
Ordinance by inserting at the end of sub-point (2), the following: "Such compensation shall be paid
only from funds available to the Clerk of Cook County". The motion to amend carried.
Commissioner Peraica inquired as to the timing of the implementation of the Ordinance and the purpose
of the technical election assistants.
Mr. Neese replied that the County is converting to more technically sophisticated equipment, namely,
optical scan and touch screen. Also this is the first equipment change in 25-27 years. For both of these
reasons, there will be a learning curve for all involved. While the County has used technical election
assistants since 2000, the new equipment will require more extensive assistance, in terms of set-up, usage
and procedures. Other large counties and some states have converted to this equipment, and the Clerk' s
Office has reviewed their usage of technical election assistants. Ohio, for example, uses all of its
employees on election days. This is also true of Clark County, Nevada. The expected need for Cook
County is one assistant per every two polling places.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether this Ordinance applies only to suburban Cook County.
Mr. Neese replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how long Cook County has utilized technical election assistants.

278

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

Mr. Neese replied that the City has used them since at least 2000 and that Cook County has used them for
at least this long.
Commissioner Peraica inquired what scope of training the technical election assistants will receive.
Mr. Neese defined this scope as setting up and starting equipment, trouble shooting and assisting the
12,000 election judges. Some of these judges possess no technical skills.
Mr. Neese assured Commissioner Peraica that the issue of electioneering has been addressed m
discussions between the Clerk's Office and the State' s Attorney's Office.
Michael Prinzi, Assistant State's Attorney, State's Attorney's Office, further addressed Commissioner
Peraica's concern regarding electioneering. He stated there is a good faith component involved, however,
the Clerk's Office will make explicit the constraints of the election Jaw, during the training of the
technical election assistants.
Commissioner Peraica inquired from which pay grade levels the assistants will be drawn.
Mr. Neese replied that there is no targeted pay grade, however, the Clerk's Office is seeking employees
with technical aptitude. The technical election assistants must successfully complete training and pass an
exam. Because this is a pilot program, only 100 County employees are being used.
Commissioner Peraica inquired whether the technical election assistants will earn overtime pay consistent
with their pay grade.
Mr. Neese replied in the affirmative.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how long it will take to compute the votes.
Mr. Neese replied that the Clerk's Office, in conjunction with Sequoia Voting Systems, Inc. , is currently
performing a dry run of the election; the Clerk's Office will provide the results to the Commissioners.
The computing time varies among polling places depending upon the type of ballots cast; nursing home
ballots and absentee ballots in particular require more time to process.
Commissioner Peraica inquired how early votes are handled in the computing process.
Mr. Neese replied that early ballots must be cast through the optical scan system on paper ballots at one of
the approximately 100 municipal voting sites. Under current law, these ballots must be forwarded to the
polling places for counting. There is pending legislation, initiated collectively by all Illinois clerks, to
instead forward early votes to one centralized location. This legislation is scheduled to be considered in
January, and the Commissioners will be kept abreast of any changes in the law.
Commissioner Collins stated that she thought it would have been more effective to recruit technical
election assistants from elsewhere than among Cook County employees, particularly from area colleges.
Mr. Neese replied that the Clerk's Office has recruited technical election assistants not only from area
colleges, but also from high schools, the League of Women Voters and the private sector, including Sears,
Coldwell Banker (which is supplying 100 technical election assistants) and other banks. There will be
more high school and college students involved this year, and they will receive academic credit for their
work.

279

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

Commissioner Hansen inquired as to the ratio of technical election assistants to polling places.
Mr. Neese replied that the ratio is approximately one technical election assistant per two polling places.
Commissioner Hansen inquired as to who selects the technical election assistants.
Mr. Neese replied that the Office of the Clerk makes all of the selections.
Commissioner Hansen voiced his fear that the technical election assistants might electioneer at the polling
places. He inquired whether the technical election assistants will have any judicial responsibility.
Mr. Neese replied that in no way do the technical election assistants supersede the statutory and legal
responsibility of the judges. They are merely agents of the Clerk. The judges have the authority to
remove any technical election assistant. The judges will be instructed as to the role of technical election
assistants. Mr. Neese reiterated that the technical election assistants will be strictly instructed that they
must remain non-partisan while discharging their duties.
Commissioner Hansen inquired whether a tape of the voting, including early voting, could be available at
each polling place at the time of the poll's closing.
Mr. Neese replied in the negative. He stated that the early voting results could be obtained fifteen
minutes after the election ends on the Clerk' s Office website.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired who receives the stipend mentioned in the Ordinance.
Mr. Neese replied that stipends are awarded to Cook County employees who work more than eight hours
per day but who are not entitled to overtime pay in their pennanent position.
Commissioner Maldonado inquired how much the stipend is and whether all stipends are the same
amount.
Mr. Neese stated that the stipend amount has not yet been detennined, but that it will be approximately
$250.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that the technical election assistants would almost certainly work
overtime, given that they would be required to be at the polling places before and after the voting; this
would total approximately 14 hours. He asked for clarification regarding how technical election
assistants could move back and forth between polling places after the polls are closed.
Mr. Neese stated that the technical election assistants, as agents of the County Clerk, are authorized to
leave and re-enter polling places after they are closed.
Commissioner Hansen asked for further clarification of the current statute as it pertains to where early
votes are counted.
Mr. Neese replied that under the current statute, touch screen votes are counted centrally and optical scan
votes are counted in each individual precinct.

280

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21 , 2005

Chairman Daley raised the concern that election judges are required to use vacation or personal time to
serve in their capacity, and that it is inconsistent that County employees who are working as technical
election assistants are not required to use vacation or personal time and, further, some technical election
assistants receive stipends, which amount to pay above and beyond what they are usually entitled to.
Shalom Gliksman, Budget Analyst, Department of Budget Management Services, stated that funds are
available in Fund 524-129 (Seasonal) and Fund 524-133 (Per Diem).
Chairman Daley clarified that the 524 fund pertains to elections.
Commissioner Suffredin, seconded by Commissioner Claypool, moved to amend the Substitute
Ordinance by further amending sub-point (2), as follows: "Such compensation shall be paid only
from funds available to the Clerk of Cook County in Funds 524-129 (Seasonal Employees) or 524133 (Per Diem Employees). The motion to amend carried.
Commissioner Silvestri requested that Mr. Neese clarify the purpose of the stipends.
Mr. Neese replied that a stipend provides compensation for any work perfonned beyond eight hours on
election day by eligible technical election assistants. The technical election assistants who are eligible for
stipends are those Cook County employees who are salaried and who therefore are not entitled to
overtime pay in the course of their permanent positions with the County or in their capacity as technical
election assistants .
Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved that the Substitute Ordinance
(Communication No. 274516) be approved and adopted, as amended. The motion carried.

preparation of an RFP, subsequently seeks to be awarded additional business with Cook
County in the performance of duties or provision of goods and/or services as described in
the RFP; and
WHEREAS, among purchasing professionals in both the private and public sectors,
commonly known best practices in the industry are specifically designed to prevent such

BE IT ORDAINED by the Board of Commissioners of Cook County that the Board does
hereby amend Section I 9 of Chapter 10 (Contracting and Purchasing Ordinance of Cook
County) to incorporate these industry best practices, and to prohibit the awarding of

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

Section 1. Section 19 of Chapter I 0 is hereby amended to add the following:
Award of Contracts Not Adaptable to Competitive Bidding
I 0-19. Contracts which by their nature are not adapted to award by competitive biddings,
such as contracts for the services of individuals possessing a high degree of professional
skill where the ability or fitness of the individual plays an important part, contracts for
printing of Finance Committee pamphlets, Comptroller's estimates, and departmental
reports, contracts for the printing or engraving of bonds, tax warrants, and other evidence
of indebtedness, contracts for utility services such as heat, light, water, telephone, or
telegraph, and contracts for the purchase of books, magazines, periodicals, and other
similar articles of an educational or instructional nature, and the binding of such books,
magazines, periodicals, pamphlets, reports, or similar articles shall not be subject to the
competitive bidding requirements of this ordinance. The Purchasing Agent is expressly
authorized to procure from any Federal, State, or local government unit or agency thereof
such surplus materials, supplies, commodities, or equipment as may be made available
through the operation of any legislation heretofore or hereinafter enacted without
conforming to the competitive bidding requirements of this ordinance. Regular
employment contracts in the County service, whether with respect to the classified
services or otherwise, shall not be subject to the provisions of this ordinance, nor shall
this ordinance be applicable to the granting or issuance pursuant to powers conferred by
laws, ordinances, or resolutions, or franchises, licenses, permits, or other authorizations
by the County Board, or by departments, offices, institutions, boards, commissions,
agencies, or other instrumentalities of the County, nor to contracts or transactions, other
than the sale or lease of personal property pursuant to which the County is the recipient of
money. (Ord. adopted Feb 20, 1973, amend. Oct. 20, 1975 , p. 547 1; July 7, 1980,
p.6078)
In addition to the specific exemptions from the competitive bidding process contained in
Section I 0-19, there are certain contracts which may be more advantageously or
practicably procured through the development and issuance of a request for proposal,
commonly referred to as an "RFP". The development of an effective RFP pursuant to
Chapter I0, or the development of competitive bid documents pursuant to the provisions
of Section 10-18, may in some cases involve the retention of professional consultants
who are compensated for their work product. In such cases, a conflict of interest may
arise in the event said professional consultant, acting either as an individual or as part of
the same or another business entity, subsequently participates in the preparation of a
proposal or bid which is submitted in response to the competitive bid or RFP at issue.
These professional consultants shall be prohibited from participating in the preparation of
a proposal or bid which is submitted in response to the RFP or bid documents where the
professional consultant participated in the development of the RFP or bid documents.
The Purchasing Agent shall have the authority to adopt procedures and promulgate rules
with respect to this section, and
Section 2. This amendment to Chapter I 0 of the Ordinances of Cook County 1s
immediately effective upon becoming law.

purchasing process.

precluded from submitting a bid on the contract.

(Communication No. 274519) be approved and adopted. The motion carried.

285

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21 , 2005

WHEREAS, in such cases, a conflict of interest may exist in the event that a professional consultant,
acting as either an individual or business entity and party to a contractual relationship with Cook County,

additional business with Cook County in the perfonnance of duties or provision of goods and/or services

best practices in the industry are specifically designed to prevent such conflicts of interest when the

Re:

HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME Program)

respectfully request approval of a HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME
Program) Loan in the amount of $1,500,000.00.
Cook County has received a request totaling $1,500,000.00 in HOME funds from Cook
County Housing Development Corporation, d/b/a Turnstone Development, for the
construction of 70 units of senior independent rental apartments in the Village of Calumet
Park. The subject site is located just south of the comer of l 24th and Morgan Streets in
Calumet Park, Cook County, Illinois.
The Village of Calumet Park approached Turnstone Development and requested they
build 70 units of senior independent rental apartments in the Village of Calumet Park.
The Village has made several commitments to the project, including the creation of a
single purpose TIF for this project, donation of 2.9 acres of land, approximately
$700,000.00 in bond proceeds, other TIF revenues, as available, and the forgiveness of
building pennits. These commitments will be supplemented by 1st mortgage financing
from HOME funds from IHDA, Cook County, and Low Income Housing Tax Credits.
The proposed budget is estimated at $11,614,798.00 which includes all construction and
soft costs associated with the development. The HOME loan of $1,500,000.00 accounts
for 12.9% of the estimated project costs and represents an investment of $42,857.00 per
HOME unit in the development.

331

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 2 1, 2005

The terms of the HOME Program loan will be structured as a 40-year amortization period
at 1% interest. The County HOME Program will receive annual principal and interest
payments of $45,514.00 to be used for other HOME eligible activities.
I respectfully request approval of this project, and that the Chief Administrative Officer
of the County of Cook, or his designee, authorize execution on behalf of the County of
Cook, any and all documents necessary to further the project approved herein, including
but not limited to the HOME Loan agreement and any modifications thereto. The
approval of this loan by this Honorable Body will pennit staff to issue necessary
commitments to allow this project to move forward.
Fiscal Impact: None. Grant funds: $ 1,500,000.00. (772-298 Account).

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21 , 2005

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Committee on Construction of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to notice
on Wednesday, December 14, 2005 at the hour of 9:30 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569, County
Building, 118 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Committee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
274495

OFFICE OF CAPITAL PLANNING AND POLICY, by Michael E. LaMont, Director,
transmitting a Communication, dated November 17, 2005:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for the Purchasing Agent to advertise
for bids for the Hawthorne Warehouse Renovation, Phase 1 Roof Replacement. It is
respectfully requested that this Honorable Body approve this request.
Reason:

This project phase provides for the tear off and replacement of approximately
413,000 square feet of deteriorated roof. The site is a multi-level facility
comprised of 22 different roof areas of varying size. The work is to include
the removal of all unused, obsolete, and abandoned equipment from the roof
and all associated structural restoration, and repairs of deteriorated parapet
walls and broken masonry. The roof is of an undetermined age and is
showing signs of leakage and damage. This work will provide for a safe and
dry environment for the various departments that will be occupying the
facility.

Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.

*Referred to the Committee on Construction on 12/06/05.
Commissioner Hansen stated that what is lacking is an analysis of the comprehensive cost impact to the
tax payers and on the County Budget. This analysis must include an estimate of the needs of the County
Clerk and the Clerk of the Circuit Court.
Michael LaMont replied that before the warehouse was purchased, the main proposed tenants were in
attendance for the site visits with the Office of Capital Planning and Policy team. Since that time many
meetings have been conducted with all of the users. At this time it is still being detennined what exactly
the Clerk of the Circuit Court is going to need in the warehouse. $1.6 million has been budgeted for
telecom wiring in the warehouse; this was not included in the thought process because the County Clerk
had not yet determined what type of election equipment was going to be purchased.

Commissioner Hansen requested that the Committee on Construction receive a comprehensive
report from whomever President Stroger dictates. This comprehensive report should include what
will be going inside the warehouse, the estimated costs and the compatibility of the systems that will
be in the warehouse so that they will be interchangeable. T he report should be received by the
Committee on Construction within one month.
Al Riley, Planner, Office of Capital Planning and Policy, stated that the report dated September 5, 2003,
states that all of the figures are estimates.

333

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21, 2005

Mr. LaMont stated that on December 13, 2005, he received a letter from the Clerk of the Circuit Court
stating that they were working with individuals to develop the retrieval systems; this letter also stated that
in January the Clerk of Circuit Court would have something to discuss with the Office of Capital Planning
and Policy. At this time, the County Clerk is having consultants examine warehousing systems for the
voting machines; they have come to the conclusion that the racking systems will not work. The industrial
engineers are the best individuals to conduct the study. He is not certain that the study will be completed
within one month.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the industrial engineers need to review material handling system
options and submit estimates to the Commissioners.
Commissioner Hansen stated that the industrial engineers need to develop a system and submit estimates
to the Commissioners.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Silvestri, moved the approval of Communication
No. 274495. The motion carried.

Patrick Driscoll, Deputy State's Attorney, Chief, Civil Actions Bureau, delivered the following
comments: There is a pending case in the United States District Court before Judge John A. Nordberg,
entitled Doe v. Cook County. The defendants in this case are Cook County and Jerry Robinson in his
official capacity as Superintendent of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center. This case arises out of a
suit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union several years ago. There was a Memorandum of
Agreement relating to the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center entered into by both parties, the plaintiff
(a class action group) and Cook County. Presently, the Memorandum of Agreement is still in force and is
enforceable. Recently there have been additional filings by the plaintiff to compel enforcement of the
Memorandum of Agreement. The County has responded to that petition and has filed a response. The
Court has not issued a formal rule to show cause. The County is due next before the Court on January 11 ,
2006.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DECEMBER 21 , 2005
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Your Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County met pursuant to
notice on Wednesday, December 14, 2005 at the hour of 11 :00 A.M. in the Board Room, Room 569,
County Building, 11 8 North Clark Street, Chicago, Illinois.
Your Subcommittee has considered the following items and, upon adoption of this report, the
recommendations are as follows:
274510

CITY OF CHICAGO (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication
from Deborah Sims, Chairman, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request
from Lori T. Healy, Commissioner, City of Chicago.
The City of Chicago would like to request your support for its upcoming no-cash bid
under the Tax Reactivation Program (TRP). The issue will come before the Board in
next month's meeting. The TRP has proven itself to be an exceedingly beneficial
program for the City of Chicago. It has facilitated the acquisition and development of tax
delinquent parcels.
The objective of the Tax Reactivation Program is to produce affordable housing for low
and moderate income citizens. Also, the program develops blighted, vacant, dilapidated
and tax delinquent properties in commercial and industrial areas.
In the upcoming Scavenger Sale the City hopes to acquire parcels using the TRP. The
City has no " Third Party Requestor". The City of Chicago is excited by the prospect of
transforming tax delinquent properties into revenue properties benefiting their immediate
communities and the city as a whole.

2745 I I

CITY OF MARKHAM (NO CASH BID REQUEST). Transmitting a Communication
from Deborah Sims, Chainnan, Tax Delinquency Subcommittee, submitting a request
from David Webb, Jr., Mayor, City of Markham.
Re:

Cook County No Cash Bid Request from the City of Markham

The City of Markham is hereby submitting a no cash bid application of 70 parcels for
scavenger sale or over-the-counter bids. Redevelopment will benefit the City with new
tax revenue, new residents and new economic activity.
Project Description: This project is in the very beginning stage and the no cash bid
request is the first step. The parcels are in an area that was unincorporated Cook County
until recently. The City annexed the parcels in the past year. The parcels are vacant land
and lack full infrastructure. The City seeks to build new single family homes. Site plans
have not been drawn as the City is researching density issues and plating to best facilitate
new residential use. Infrastructure upgrades and layout are also being researched in order
to best determine the development scope and layout. The acquisition of land from
adjacent owners is also being researched. Columbia Properties, Inc. is the third party
requester. Columbia Properties has an excellent track record with Markham and has the
confidence of the City Council and the City Administration. Completed projects by
Columbia include one single family home and a new commercial building for a
Walgreen's. Columbia is also going forward on new construction of a residential town
home project that has been approved by the City.
The City will retain legal counsel, obtain tax deeds and pay all acquisition costs. The City
will report as required to the Cook County Office of Economic Development annually
from the date of sale on each parcel for five years or until the development is completed,
whichever occurs last.

Jacqueline K. Harder, Economic Development Project Director, Department of Planning and
Development, noted that the volume numbers submitted for the agenda were incorrect; the correct volume
numbers, are Volume 32 and Volume 212.
Ms. Harder made the following recommendations: Of the 70 pins 65 pins are recommended for no cash
bid; and five pins are not recommended for no cash bid because the Markham Park District is the deed
holder and the Department of Planning and Development would require a separate resolution from the
Markham Park District in order to approve these pins for the Scavenger Sale.
Commissioner Butler asked Ms. Harder to further clarify the nature of the five pins which are not being
recommended for no cash bid. Ms. Harder stated that these five pins are in Volume 212 and that they can
be acquired by the City of Markham by application to the Markham Park District.

Ms. Harder noted that there was a scrivener's error on the Board Agenda; the corrected pin 180 31 -36200-025-1119 is not being recommended by the Department of Planning and Development for no cash
bid because it is a residential condominium. The Village of Park Forest also requested that an additional
pin be withdrawn pin 179 31-23-412-058-000. The remaining 17 pins are being recommended for no
cash bid.

Commissioner Collins, seconded by Commissioner Moreno, moved to amend Communication No.
274512 by deleting pins 179 31-23-412-058-0000 and 180 31-36-200-025-00001119. The motion to
