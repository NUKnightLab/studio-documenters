Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County is requesting approval to increase Purchase Order No. I 03155, in
the amount of $8,850.00 in order to complete the work of cleaning the last of two water reservoirs.
While inspecting and cleaning the three million gallon reservoir, it was found that over the years, piles of
tile and mortar from the ceiling have been falling to the floor. The tiles cannot be drawn up through the
suction equipment used to clean the tank without clogging the hoses. Removing the tiles will require at

would require only an additional three days of work at a cost of $2,850.00 per day for a total of

transmitting a Communication, dated May 5, 2000:
Transmitted herewith for your approval is a request for authorization for the Purchasing
Agent to advertise for bids for Shuttle Bus Service for the Second District Courthouse in
Skokie. It is respectfully requested that this honorable body approve this request.
This contract will provide for shuttle bus service for staff and the public between the Skokie
Courthouse and various temporary parking lots. The buses will run Monday through Friday
from 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The period of the contract will be two (2) years from the date of
the award.
Bond Issue (20000 Account).
Sufficient funds have been appropriated to cover this request.
*Referred to the Construction Committee on 5/16/00.

Commissioner Silvestri asked a question regarding shuttle bus service between the Skokie Courthouse
and locations of the proposed parking lots.
Michael LaMont responded that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is looking at several options
including the Forest Preserve District parking lots to the west of the courthouse. He also stated that the
Office is currently negotiating with the property owners to the south, Old Orchard Woods which has
excess paved parking for approximately four hundred vehicles. He further stated that negotiations with
property owners to the east, the Portland Cement Association, are not going well.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the goal is to secure all of the lots that have been mentioned?
Michael LaMont responded that the goal is to secure between eight hundred and nine hundred parking
spaces without disturbing any of the grassy area in the front of the Skokie Courthouse.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if the Office of Capital Planning and Policy had considered the parking lot
at Niles High School?
Michael LaMont responded that this location had not been considered but there have been discussions
with the Old Orchard Shopping Center. He further stated that the Office of Capital Planning and Policy is
looking at space where there is no signalized intersection and where there is easy access.

1958

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2000
Commissioner Silvestri asked how can the request for shuttle bus service be bid if the lots have not been
determined?
Michael LaMont responded that the request will be bid on an hourly basis and per bus which is similar to
the shuttle operation currently underway at Cook County Hospital.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that the Maywood Courthouse is in a deplorable condition, and asked
the status of any renovation.
Michael LaMont stated that he needs to speak with the Maywood Village Manager for an update.
Commissioner Silvestri informed the committee that the Maywood Village Manager had recently
resigned and suggested that Mr. LaMont follow-up with the new village manager.
Commissioner Sutker expressed concerns regarding cooperation with the Sheriff's office and shuttle bus
security.
Michael LaMont responded that the plan has always been to talk to the Sheriffs Office, but he has not
spoken to them yet because the Office of Capital Planning and Policy wanted to determine exactly what
sites are available. He stated that security, lighting and signage are all being considered. He further
stated that he has met with Presiding Judge Salyers and she is aware of the issues.
Commissioner Sutker asked a question regarding the rear area of the courthouse because of the flooding.
He also stated that he has received numerous telephone calls from the Glenview area residents concerning
the possibility of flooding ifthe area is upgraded.
Michael LaMont responded that the plans are to upgrade, clean and widen the areas on the north and west
sides of the courthouse.
Commissioner Sutker requested that he be advised on improvements in the above areas of the courthouse.
The commissioner further asked a question regarding the fiscal impact of the shuttle bus service. He
asked if the cost is closer to $325,000 rather than the estimated $800,000?
Michael LaMont stated that the cost is closer to $325,000. He also informed the committee that Cook
County must present a comprehensive plan for the parking to the Village of Skokie prior to the issuance
of permits. Further he stated that there is full cooperation between the two government bodies.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 7, 2000

WHEREAS, his parents, Ross and Mindy Deutsch established the Rory Foundation to increase funding

last summer through its Lemonade for Life campaign. Mr. Deutsch hopes to repeat the event this year,
with children across the country selling glasses of lemonade for $1, and
WHEREAS, the Lemonade campaign is sponsored by the Chicago based Fitigues clothing store, which

kids sold lemonade in honor of a child they never met, just to help out other kids who have pediatric
cancer, and

foundation. "Kids would knock on the door and say 'we sold $14 from our lemonade stand and we want

basketball tourney, selling chocolate bars and performing at various children's theatres, and

of his son who loved to study the solar system and who considered President Clinton among his closest

Rory through letters, and
WHEREAS, two patients have started to receive the new drug therapy and Dr. Stewart Goldman of the
Rory David Deutsch Brain Tumor Research Program, expects a total of 40 children to undergo the

United States each year. The Research Program is located at Children's Memorial Hospital, and

opportunities are emerging as a result of the multi-dimensional and multi-institutional studies being
