supportive living services arises. The Developer, Evergreen Real Estate Development Corporation, will
rehabilitate and reconfigure the former Ravenswood Hospital into two separate senior facilities: a 74unit senior ILF on floors 5 through 9 and a 119-unit senior SLF on floors 1 through 4. The Ravenswood
Senior Living project will provide 74 Independent Living Senior units for seniors referred by CHA
(CHA ILF Units) and the Supportive Living Facility will have a priority for seniors referred by CHA.
The CHA-controlled entity, Ravenswood Senior Housing LLC, is anticipated to have a 10% ownership

financing, management, and senior services required for the long-term operations of the Ravenswood
