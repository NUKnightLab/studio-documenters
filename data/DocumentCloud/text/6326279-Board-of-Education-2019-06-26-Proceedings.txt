President del Valle provided the following remarks:

Before we proceed with the agenda today, l?d like to take a moment to thank Mayor
Lightfoot for the opportunity to serve the students and families of the Chicago Public Schools as
Board President. It is an important responsibility that I will devote myself to entirely. When you?re
retired, you can take the time.

I am excited about serving with this excellent group of Board Members, and they are truly
excellent. I?ve been very, very impressed with each and every one of them. The talent, the skills, the
track record, the backgrounds that they have, the expertise that they bring to the Board is just
going to be very, very useful for all of us as we proceed to improve our education system beyond
where we are at today.

Each and every board member is a leader in their community, with expertise that will
tremendously benefit the district. As I?ve shared with each board member, I want them to be vocal
and to engage at every level. Even if we disagree, or do not share the same opinion, it is necessary
to hear the diverse voices of this Board. Our diversity is a re?ection of the diversity of our schools.
This tone of transparency will be the cornerstone of our leadership. It is critically important in
order to build and maintain trust with the communities we serve.

[Board Members provided individual comments]

In keeping with our commitment of increased transparency, we have made the following changes
to how the Board conducts its business.

The ?rst change is to include a new section to the Board Meeting to discuss select public
agenda items prior to public participation. It is important that the public hears from Board Members
on the items they will vote on. This should lead to a better informed public before the Board casts
its vote.

The second change is that the Board will now vote earlier in the process on the majority of
the items. The Board used to vote on all of the items at the very end of the meeting after Executive
Session. Now for those members of the public that want to follow the voting, they will not have to
wait until the very end of the meeting except for Executive Session items. We will vote on all of the
Public Agenda items after public participation.

The third change will require new rules and policies and amendments to rules and policies,
that these new rules and polices be subject to a 30-day public comment period. The comments
generated from the public will be shared with all of the Board Members. The Board rule change will
be introduced at the July Board Meeting.

The fourth change is to make translation services a permanent feature of every Board
Meeting. This was successfully piloted at the last Board Meeting, and our goal is to accommodate
as many people in need of translation services as possible.

The ?fth change is to begin livestreaming our Board Meetings starting in July. This will
allow for the Board Meetings to be watched in real-time and to further increase access to our
meetings.

The sixth change is to create a committee structure starting in July. Although we have one
committee now, the ?nance and audit committee, a committee of the whole, we will be adding
additional committees chaired by specific Board Members. These will be committees based on
critical education policy issues, and will follow a hearing format that includes meetings out in
community locations such as schools, community colleges, libraries, and non-profits to allow for
vital public participation and engagement.

And our seventh change will be to hold some Board Meetings out in the community in the
later hours. These changes will add additional time to the Board Meetings as I already indicated.
This time will be used to generate more information and shed more light on the actions before the
Board. We will attempt to strike a balance between deeper engagement and ef?ciency, but believe
these changes are critical to a more transparent process. We will continue to ?ne tune our process
with the goal of continuing to increase our transparency and accessibility.

As discussed, we are starting a new order for today?s Meeting that includes Honoring
Excellence, CEO Report, Discussion of Public Agenda Items, Public Participation, Voting on Public
Agenda items, Executive Session, and lastly, return to vote on Executive Session agenda items.

Now, on Executive Session, I would like to note that in Executive Session the Board will not
discuss any Public Agenda items and will only discuss matters as defined in the Open Meetings
Act that includes Counsel Retention, Significant Litigation Developments, Settlements, Personnel,

2

June 26, 2019

Discipline, Real Estate and Closed Session Minutes. That is what will be discussed in Executive
Session. I know people have said over the years you guys you go back there and you have this
Executive Session and then you come out and you vote and all we hear is a number, that is
changing. And we want to make it clear that in Executive Session what we discuss is dictated by
law.

Before we move into the next section of our program, Honoring Excellence, I?d like to echo
and amplify the Mayor?s commitment to our immigrant community given the current climate and
rhetoric from Washington. As a Board, we are committed to continue to operate as a welcoming
district, and we are committed to supporting all students and families regardless of their race,
ethnicity, country of origin, or immigration status. Although Dr. Jackson will get into the details in
her report to convey how CPS serves as a welcoming district, I want to restate that we will do
everything in our power to protect the students and families in our District. If ICE were to show up
at a school, unless they have a criminal warrant, we will not let them in, we will not provide ICE
with information on our students and staff, and we will not allow our staff to assist with any
enforcement action. I want that to be clear.

President del Valle thereupon opened the ?oor to the Honoring Excellence segment of the
Board Meeting: 1) Lincoln Park High School Wind 2) Earle Elementary School Chess
Team; 3) State Seal of Biliteracy Award Recipients; and 4) National Board Certi?ed Teachers.

President del Valle thereupon opened the ?oor to the CEO report segment of the Board
meeting. Dr. Janice Jackson, Chief Executive Officer, welcomed the new Board Members and
provided remarks on how CPS continues to serve as a welcoming district; the rates of graduation
and retention; how the Annual Regional Analysis lead to largest programmatic
implementation; the 5 Year Vision; the creation of the Equity Office and Office of Student
Protections; and the success of the Safe Passage program.

President del Valle opened the ?oor to the Discussion on the following presentation items.
Ms. Anna Alvarado, Chief Teaching and Learning Of?cer, provided a presentation on the
Accelerated Placement Policy Mr. Jeffrey Broom, Director of Performance and Data
Policy, provided a presentation on the School Quality and Rating Policy 2.0

14-11 19-P01, and and adopt a new School Quality Rating Policy effective for
the 2020-2021 school year.

POLICY TEXT:
I. Purpose and Goals

This policy shall establish the standards and criteria for issuing a School Quality Rating and Accountability
Status to each school that is either Good Standing status, Remediation status (which indicates the need
for Provisional Support) or Probation status (which indicates the need for intensive Support) per Section
5134-83 of the Illinois School Code. This policy will take effect beginning with a School Quality Rating and
Accountability Status issued to each school for the 2020.2021 school year based on school performance
data gathered during the prior school year. This policy will also apply to subsequent school years unless
amended or rescinded by the Board. A school?s Accountability Status from the prior school year shall remain
in effect until such time as the school is noti?ed of its new status for the then-current school year that is
issued in accordance with this policy.

This policy sets out a systematic means for measuring a school?s performance and identifying schools in
need of support and increased oversight due to insuf?cient levels of achievement and growth based on the
Key indicators and School Quality Rating system as de?ned by the Board herein. Section 5134?83 of the
School Code provides for the remediation and probation of schools and requires the Chief Executive
Officer of the Chicago Public Schools to monitor the performance of each school using the
criteria and rating system established by the Board to identify those schools in which: (1) there is a failure
to develop, implement. or comply with the school improvement plan; (2) there is a pervasive breakdown in
the educational program as indicated by various factors such as the absence of improvement in reading
and math achievement scores. an increased drop-cut rate. a decreased graduation rate, or a decrease in
the rate of student attendance: or (3) there is a failure or refusal to comply with the provisions of the School
Code. other applicable laws. collective bargaining agreements. court orders. or with applicable Board rules
and policies.

The Board recognizes that an effective and fair School Quality Rating system considers a broad range of
indicators of success. including, but not limited to student test score performance and student academic
growth. closing of opportunity gaps. school culture and climate, attendance, graduation, and preparation
for post-graduation success. Therefore, this policy establishes a comprehensive system to assess school
performance in order to identify, monitor and assist schools with low student performance in these areas,
as well as provide a framework for action to intervene in schools with stagnant or insuf?cient rates of student
improvement. The School Quality Rating system also provides a means for recognition of schools who have
demonstrated distinguished levels of performance.

ll. Scope of the Policy

All CPS schools are subject to this policy. including. but not limited to, neighborhood schools. magnet
schools, selective enrollment schools, contract schools. Option Schools, and schools with non-traditional
grade structures. CPS charter schools are subject to the performance standards set out in this policy by
and through the accountability provisions in their charter contract with the Board and shall annually receive
a School Quality Rating.

ACCOUNTABILITY INDICATORS, STANDARDS AND SCORING

A. Accountability Status Determination

A school shall receive a School Quality Rating and Accountability Status based upon its level of
performance and growth. Charter school accountability is determined by and through the accountability
provisions in the charter contract with the Board. and is based on the rating designations set forth in this
Policy. The school?s School Quality Rating is determined based on a point system. A school is evaluated
on each of the indicators identi?ed in Sections through and receives points ranging from 1 to 5
on each indicator as speci?ed. The points for each indicator are then weighted as described in Section
below and averaged to determine the school's overall weighted score, which will also range from 1 to
5. The school?s overall weighted score is used to determine the school's School Quality Rating of either
Level Level 1, Level Level 2, or Level 3 as described in Section below.

June 26, 2019

The level rating issued to a school is then used in combination with other factors to determine whether the
school is identi?ed with an Accountability Status of Good Standing. Remediation or Probation, as follows:

1. Schools newly established by the Board shall receive an annual School Quality Rating as soon as
suf?cient data is available, but will remain in Good Standing status until completing the second
year of operation or until such time as adequate measures of student achievement become
available as de?ned in the SQRP Handbook.

A school with a School Quality Rating of Level 3 shall receive Probation status.
3. A school with a School Quality Rating of Level 2 shall receive Remediation status, except when:

i. The school has been on Probation status for two or more consecutive years, in which
case the school must receive a Level Level 1. Level or Level 2 rating for two
consecutive years to? be eligible for another Accountability Status and removal from
Probation;

ii. The Board has taken an action under 105 or (4) at the school. in
which case the school must remain on Probation for a minimum of ?ve years; or

The CEO has determined that the school faces academic problems that may not be
sul?ciently addressed through the Remediation process. in which case the school will
receive Probation status. In making this determination. the CEO will consider various
factors including the length of time the school has had a Level 2 rating status. long-tenn
academic trends. school culture and climate, and quality of school leadership.

4. A school with a School Quality Rating of Level Level 1. or Level 2+ shall receive Good
Standing status, except when:

i. The school has been on Probation status for two or more consecutive years. in which
case the school must receive a Level Level 1, Level 2+ or Level 2 rating for two
consecutive years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and removal from
Probation;

ii. The school has been on Remediation status for two or more consecutive years, in which
case the school must receive a Level Level 1. or Level 2+ rating for two consecutive
years to be eligible for another Accountability Status and removal from Remediation;

ill. The school has been on a combination of Remediation and Probation status for the last
two consacutive years, in which case the school will receive Remediation status and must
receive a Level Level 1. or Level 2+ rating for two consecutive years to be eligible for
another Accountability Status and removal from Remediation; or

iv. The Board has taken an action under 105 or (4) at the school. in
which case the school must remain on Probation for a minimum of ?ve years.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the CEO may at any time place any school on Probation status itthe CEO
determines that s/he must take necessary steps to satisfy legal requirements or other mandates.
including, but not limited to, when the CEO determines: that a school has failed or refused to comply
with the provisions of the School Code. other appliwble laws. collective bargaining agreements. court
orders, or with applicable Board rules and policies: or that a school with state or federal school
improvement status has a school improvement plan, budget or any amendment thereto that may
compromise, limit or othentvise impair the implementation of the remedial measures required by or
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). Nothing herein shall limit the Board's ability to take action in
accordance with 105

B. Weighting for Schools Serving both High School and Elementary School Grade Levels

Schools serving both elementary and high school grades will receive separate weighted scores and
School Quality Ratings for their elementary program and their high school program. However. the
school's overall School Quality Rating and Accountability Status is determined by combining the weighted
scores from the school?s elementary and the high school programs, and further weighting the combined
score by the proportion of students in each program.

i. Assignment of a School Quality Rating

Each school will be assigned a School Quality Rating based on either its number of weighted points
earned or its School Attainment Score, as de?ned in the table below. if a school quali?es for one rating
based on its number of weighted points and another rating based on its School Attainment Score. the
school will be granted the higher of the two ratings as its School Quality Rating. For elementary schools,
the School Attainment Score is based on NWEA Reading and Mathematics assessments in Grades 3-8
or in Grade 3 if the school's highest grade served is Grade 3. An elementary school must meet the
National School Attainment percentile minimum in both Reading and Mathematics to qualify for a School
Quality Rating based on attainment percentile. For high schools, the School Attainment Score is based on
the PSATISAT series of assessments. A high school must have a minimum percentage of students
meeting college readiness benchmarks to qualify for a School Quality Rating based on attainment score.
For a school to earn a School Quality Rating based on the attainment score rather than weighted points
earned, the school must have a minimum 95% participation rate on all assessments that determine the
school?s attainment score.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Elementary High School
WeiggzergeZOInts Minimum Minimum Attainment
Attainment Score Score

Level 1+ 4.0 or more OR 90?" percentile 80% of Students
Level 1 Between 3.5 and 3.9 70'h percentile 60% of Students
Level 2+ Between 3.0 and 3.4 50" percentile 40% of Students
Level 2 Between 2.0 and 2.9 40" percentile 20% of Students
Level 3 Less than 2.0 - -

 

For schools serving both elementary and high school grades, the school receives weighted scores and
ratings for the elementary and high school programs separately, which are then combined into a single
overall School Quality Rating as described in Section if either the elementary andlor high school
program achieves a higher program rating based on their School Attainment Score than their weighted
points earned, that program will receive the higher level rating. When combining both program scores into
a single overall School Quality Rating, any program rating based on School Attainment Score shall be
converted into the lowest score associated with that level for purposes of performing the weighted
calculation as described in Section The lowest score associated with each level are as follows:
Level 1+ 4 points, Level 1 3.5 points, Level 2+ 3 points, Level 2 2 points.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it a District-operated school with a Level 1+ or Level 1 rating experienced
conditions or an event that had a signi?cant impact on the school, the school may receive a School
Quality Rating of Level 1. in making this determination, the CEO will consider the following factors: (1)a
signi?cant change in student population, exclusive of students in new or entry-level grades; (2) a
signi?cant change of the school's teaching staff as compared to the prior year: (3) a change of principal;
(4) a signi?cant change in the school's academic program; or (5) any other event that had a signi?cant
impact. Such a CEO determination shall not be applied in consecutive years.

in the event the CEO determines that the performance indicators speci?ed in this policy are not
appropriate for measuring a school's performance, the CEO may recommend to the Board the use of
other speci?ed performance indicators to evaluate the school and issue its School Quality Rating and
Accountability Status. The CEO shall use such alternate performance indicators when approved by the
Board.

IV. SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING REMEDIAL ASSISTANCE

On a date to be determined by the CEO or his/her designee, after school performance data is available.
schools will be noti?ed as to their Accountability Status hereunder.

Schools Placed on Remediation
Any school that receives a Remediation status as described in Section  il.A above shall participate in a

remedial program in which a Remediation Plan is developed by the CEO andlor the designees. A
Remediation Plan may include one or more of the following components:

1. Drafting a new school improvement plan (currently known as the Continuous Improvement Work
Plan, or 

2. Additional training for the local school council;

3. Directing the implementation of the school improvement plan; and

4 Mediating disputes or other obstacles to reform or improvement at the school.

16

June 26, 2019

A Remediation Plan is intended to provide the Support and oversight necessary to prevent schools with
declining or flat performance from entering Probation status, and to help schools that are exiting
Probation reach Good Standing status. In creating a Remediation Plan, the CEO or designee shall give
assistance to the school to ensure that all aspects of the plan, including the school budget. address the
educational de?ciencies at these schools.

Any updates to such school improvement plan to address new data on the de?ciencies at Remediation
schools with a school improvement status shall be approved by the Board in accordance with the Illinois
State Board of Education's timeline for Board approval of school improvement plans.

The CEO or designee shall monitor each Remediation school's implementation of the ?nal plan and the
progress the school makes toward implementation of the plan and the correction of its educational
de?ciencies.

Schools Placed on Probation

School Improvement Plan and Budget: Each school placed on Probation shall have a school
improvement plan and a school budget for correcting de?ciencies identi?ed by the Board. The CEO or
designee shall develop a school improvement plan (currently known as the CIWP) that shall contain
speci?c steps that the local school council and the school staff must take to comect identi?ed de?ciencies.
The school?s CIWP may serve as the school?s Probation plan. The school budget shall include speci?c
expenditures that support the implementation of this plan and that are directly calculated to correct
educational and operational de?ciencies identi?ed at the school.

In creating or updating the required plan, the CEO or designee shall give assistance to Probation schools
to ensure that all aspects of the plan, including the school budget, re?ect and are tailored to the individual
needs of the school and that the plan addresses the educational de?ciencies at these schools.

The Board shall approve school improvement plans for schools placed on Probation. Any updates to such
school improvement plan or school budget to address new data on the de?ciencies at Probation schools

POLICE NOTIFICATION GUIDELINES

School administrators contact the Chicago Police Department (CPD) in two situations: (1) to seek
assistance with an emergency situation, or (2) to notify law enforcement of a criminal act

Emergency
School administrators have the responsibility to call 9-1-1 in situations they determine to be emergencies.

In an emergency situation. administrators must make reasonable efforts to notify 
immediately after contacting CPD.

Criminal Acts

When a student engages in illegal activity, it may be necessary for school staff to report the act to CPD. In
this situation. school of?cials contact CPD to report violations of the law. School of?cials must not contact
CPD merely to request removal of a disruptive student from the school in a non-emergency situation.

In a non-emergency situation. administrators must make reasonable efforts to contact 
prior to contacting CPD.

Sexual Misconduct 

Ii school administrators are made aware of a criminal act of sexual misconduct that is in progress. they
must contact CPD. When made aware of an allegation of sexual misconduct, including but not limited.
sexual harassment, sexual bullying, sexual assault, dating violence. or discrimination related to sex, sexual
orientation, gender. or gender expression, contact the Of?ce of Student Protections and Title IX to assist in
assessing whether police noti?cation is needed at the USP Hotline: (773) 535-4400. DCFS mandatory
reporter obligations are separate from reporting to CPD and must always be followed; please consult the
Policy on Child Abuse and Neglect if needed.

The inappropriate behaviors-that are clear violations of criminal law are identi?ed in the next section with
an asterisk before the speci?c inappropriate behavior. The inappropriate behaviors that may be
violations of criminal law are identi?ed in the next section with a double asterisk before the speci?c
inappropriate behavior.

School officials must assess the situation before determining whether or not to contact CPD to report a
criminal act. School officials should consider factors including:

0 Whether the student distributed or was in possession of illegal drugs, narcotics, controlled
substances. or?look-alikes? of such substances. If so, CPD must be noti?ed.
Whether the student was in possession of a firearm.2 if so, CPD must be noti?ed.
The severity of the criminal violation and the degree of harm to the school community.
Whether a person was physically injured as a result of the student?s conduct.
Whether the student presents an imminent danger to the health, safety, or welfare of others, and
The student's age. For a student in ?fth grade or below, school staff must consult with the Law
Department (773 553-1700) prior to reporting the act to CPD. 

Once school staff members contact CPD, the responding police of?cers ultimately will determine whether
or not to investigate, arrest. and/or take any other steps in response. School principals and staff do not
have the authority to decide whether a student will be arrested. Moreover, responding police of?cers do
not have the authority to decide whether a student will receive interventions or consequences at school.
The school principal will use the 806 to determine the appropriate intervention(s) andlor consequence(s)
to address a student?s behavior.

STUDENT BEHAVIORS COVERED BY THE SCC

This section identi?es the speci?c inappropriate behaviors for which students will receive interventions
and/or consequences. The behaviors are listed in six different groups, according to the degree of disruption
to the learning environment.
0 Group 1 lists behaviors that are inappropriate.
Group 2 lists behaviors that disrupt.
Group 3 lists behaviors that seriously disrupt.
Group 4 lists behaviors that very seriously disrupt.
Group 5 lists behaviors that most seriously disrupt.
Group 6 lists behaviors that are illegal and most seriously disrupt.

Special Notes:

Sghooi Rules and Academic Progress

individual schools may develop school rules that are consistent with this SCC and may address
inappropriate student behaviors not speci?catiy included in this SCC. However. poor academic
achievement is not an inappropriate behavior. The SCC and school rules may not be used to discipline
students for poor academic progress or failure to complete in-class and homework assignments. Instead,
struggling students should be considered for academic or behavioral interventions to help them improve.
Also. students must not be disciplined for the parents/guardians' refusal to consent to the administration of
medication.

Cellular Phgnes and Other Information Technology Devices3

A principal may allow students to possess cellular phones or other information technology devices by
creating a school policy identifying when the items may be authorized, used, and how they must be kept.
A principal may alsoprohibit cellular phones and other information technology devices but allow individual
students to possess them for any good cause after considering a written request from a parent/guardian.
If a principal denies a parent/guardians reddest. the parent may appeal to the Network Chief or his/her
designee. Unless approved by the principal. cellular phones and other information technology devices are
not allowed at school.

School Dress Codes and Uniform Policies

Local School Councils may adopt a dress code policy that forbids students from wearing certain items or a
uniform policy that requires students to wear aspeci?c uniform. Dress codes and uniform policies should
be gender?neutral. Students who fail to follow a school's dress code or uniform policy may be given
detentions or excluded from extracurricular activities, but may not be barred from attending class. A student
may receive additional consequences for violating a school's dress code or uniform policy if the student's
dress disrupts or may disrupt the educational process. For example, a student may receive a consequence
for wearing clothing or accessories that display gang af?liation. This paragraph does not apply to students
enrolled in Military Academies or JROTC Programs.

Military and JROTC Programs

Board-designated military academies and other JROTC programs may enforce standards of conduct and
intervention or consequences that are consistent with the military nature of those schools and programs. in
addition to the standards of conduct and intervention or consequences described in this SCC. Students
enrolled in a military academy who repeatedly engage in acts of gross misconduct or insubordination
(student act that de?es a lawful and appropriate direct order of a superior ranked of?cer. staff member or
another student), or who repeatedly fail or refuse to wear the required military uniform, may be subject to
administrative transfer by the military academy principal to another school (or in the case of a JROTC
program, dismissal from the program). Prior to an administrative transfer, a conference must be held with

the student, military academy principal, and a designee of the Chief Executive Of?cer.
Students who have been transferred for administrative reasons from any military academy must be
accepted by their attendance area school. Students who have been given an administrative transfer to
another Chicago public school or expelled from the Chicago Public Schools lose all rank and privileges at
the JROTC military academies and must reapply to the JROTC program and the military academies for
enrollment. Upon their child's enrollment at a military academy, parents/guardians shall be informed of the
uniform policy, expectations of the military academy, and the administrative transfer policy, and shall
indicate by signature their agreement to adhere to the terms of these policies.

Dating Violence Statement

Any school employee who is noti?ed by a parent. guardian or student, or who reasonably suspects, that a
student has been the victim of dating violence shall immediately report that information to the
principal/designee. Dating violence is defined as violent. controlling, or intimidating behavior that an
individual uses against a current or former dating partner. It can include emotional, physical and sexual
abuse. stalking, yelling. harassing. threatening. namecalling. threats of suicide. obsessive phone calling or
text messaging, extreme jealousy and possessiveness._These allegations or suspicions should be reported
to the Of?ce of Student Protections and Title IX immediately. The principal shall ensure that the student
victim of dating violence receives appropriate support services in accordance with the Board's Policy on
Domestic \flolence. . Dating Violence and Court orders of Protection, Restraint or No Contact



SCC and Other Laws. Policies, RulesI and Contracts

The inappropriate behaviors and range of possible consequences and interventions listed in this policy are
consistent with the Illinois School Code. Board Rules and Policies. negotiated agreements, and all other
applicable state and federal laws.

 

The SCC applies to CPS contract and performance schools.

CPS charter schools are exempt from local school board policies under lliinois law (105 ?.08 512M).
Charter schools may choose to adopt the 800 or establish their own discipline policies. Charter schools
are not exempt from federal and most state laws, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or
from federal and state regulations as they pertain to discipline of students with disabilities/impairments. If
a charter school establishes its own discipline policy. it must incorporate language from and comply with
the guidelines for suspension and expulsion of students with disabilities?mpairments outlined in this policy.
Charter schools must also comply with policies and procedures established by the Office of Diverse Learner
Supports and Services for the discipline of students with disabilities. Students expelled from charter schools
should contact the Department of Student Adjudication at (773) 553-2249 for assistance.

Corporal punishment is expressly prohibited. Chicago Board of Education Rule 6-21 states: "No employee
of the Board of Education may in?ict corporal punishment of any kind upon persons attending the public
schools of the City of Chicago."

ANTI-BULLYING POLICY

Purpose
The Illinois General Assembly has found that a safe and civil school environment is necessary for students

to learn and achieve and that bullying causes physical. and emotional harm to students and
interferes with their ability to learn and participate in school activities. Bullying has been linked to other
forms of antisocial behavior. such as vandalism, shoplifting. skipping and dropping out of school. ?ghting.
using drugs and alcohol. sexual harassment. and violence. It is the goal of the Chicago Board of Education
("Board?) to create a learning environment in all its school communities where all students feel safe and
supported, are protected from bullying, and are able to succeed academically and develop socially and
emotionally into responsible. caring individuals.

The Board asks every Chicago Public School student, with the support of hislher parent(s).
guardian(s) and the adults at school. to commit to the following principles. which will apply to everyone on
school property and at school-related activities:

0 I will not bully others.

0 I will try to help anyone I suspect is being bullied.

I will work to include students who are left out.

if someone is being bullied, will tell an adult at school and an adult at home.

Scogg
Bullying is contrary to Illinois law and this Policy is consistent with the Illinois School Code. This Policy

protects CPS students against bullying and harassmenton the basis of actual or perceived race or ethnicity,
color. religion. sex. national origin or immigration status. ancestry. age, marital status. physical or mental
disability, military status. sexual orientation. gender or sex (includes gender identity, gender expression.

unfavorable discharge from military service. political belief or affiliation, or on the basis of a person's
association with a person or group with 'one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived
characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic. The Board recognizes the particular vulnerability
of students with actual or perceived disabilities and those who identify as or are perceived to be lesbian.
gay. bisexual or tran?sgender. Nothing in this Policy is intended to infringe upon any expression protected
by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or Section 3 of Article I of the Illinois Constitution.

This Policy is based on the engagement of. a range of school stakeholders. including students and
parents/guardians. The Board or its designee will re-evaiuate this Policy every two (2) years based on an
assessment of its outcomes and effectiveness. including. but not limited to. factors such as the frequency
of victimization; student. staff and family observations of safety at school: identi?cation of areas of a school
where bullying occurs; the types of bullying utilized; and bystander intervention or participation. The
information developed will be made available on the District's website.

Bullying and harassment are prohibited:

(1) during any school-sponsored or school~sanctloned program or activity;

(2) in school, on school property, on school buses or other Board-provided transportation. and at designated
locaticns for students to wait for buses and other Board-provided transportation (?bus stops?);

(as de?ned below).

(2) The behaviors are severe or pervasive (repeated over time), or there is a high likelihood that
behaviors will be repeated. While bullying is often characterized by repeated acts. sometimes a

present.

(3) The intent of the person(s) engaging in the behavior is to cause physical or emotional harm to the
targeted student(s)

(4) The behavior has or can be reasonably predicted to have one or more of the following effects:

perceived race, color. religion. sex, national origin or immigration status, ancestry, age. marital status,

relationships among students, families, schools, and communities, .and reduce the likelihood of future
disruption by balancing accountability with an understanding of students? behavioral health needs.

guidance in determining an appropriate response. contact the Of?ce of Social Emotional Learning at
(773) 553-1830. or see cps.eduISEL.

(1) Identify school risk factors and ensure a universal strategy for school climate improvement and
social and emotional development. Assess and address any issues in supervision, expectations,
relationship-building. and emotional learning.

(2) Support the targeted student. Assign school staff to create and implement a plan that will restore a
sense of safety for the targeted student and other students who have been impacted. Determine any
other interventions that may be appropriate.

if the targeted student has a disability, the school shall convene the Team to determine whether
additional or different Special education or related services are needed to address the student?s
individual needs and revise the accordingly. For example, if the student's disability affects social
skill development or makes the student vulnerable to bullying, the Principal/Designee shall ask the
student?s Team to consider whether the IEP should include provisions to reduce vulnerability to
bullying.

(3) Detennlne interventions andlor consequences that address the root cause of the students?
bullying behaviors. Consider the nature of the behavior, the developmental age of the student, and
the student's history of problem behaviors and performance. Follow the Student Code of Conduct and
the Guidelines for Effective Discipline. and identify opportunities to teach. build empathy, and repair
harm. While suspensions may be necessary in some cases to ensure the safety of the targeted student,
keep in mind that suspending or expelling students who bully does not reduce bullying behavior.

if the student who engaged in bullying behavior is a student with a disability, the school shall convene
the Team to determine if additional supports and services are needed to address the 
behavior and develop the student?s social and emotional skills. The team may also consider examining
the environment in which the bullying occurred to determine if changes to the environment are
warranted. For example, the Team should consider a behavior intervention plan for the student or
review a current behavior intervention plan and revise if necessary. The Principal/Designee shall
comply with the Procedural Safeguards for Discipline of Students with Disabilitiesilmpairments when
considering interventions and consequences for students with disabilities.

Contact the Of?ce of Social Emotional Learning for school-wide climate and skill-building practices
that prevent bullying, and the CPS Law Department for more information about the appropriate and
legal consequences for student misconduct.

For incidents that impact the larger school community, provide opportunities in safe, structured
envirohments for affected students, staff, andlor parents to speak about the incident, its impact,
and what is needed to repair the harm.

E. What Not To Do: .

Soiicit an apology from the student who engaged in bullying to the targeted student or mandate a public
apology. use peace circles, victimioffender conferences, or any form of mediation that puts the student
who engaged in bullying in contact with the targeted student in an immediate attempt to resolve the
bullying. Restorative measures may be helpful to repair relationships between the student who
engaged in bullying and targeted student, but only if used after other interventions have balanced the
power differential between the perpetrator and target.

0 Dismiss bullying as typical student behavior or assume it is not serious.

PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARDS FOR DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS WITH
DISABILITIESIIMPAIRM 

School of?cials may suspend students with disabilities?mpairrnents and cease educational services for a
total of up to 10 consecutive or 10 cumulative school days in one school year without providing procedural
safeguards. Saturday, and before- and after-school detentions do not count toward the 10-day limit
Additionally, if students with disabilities continue to participate in the general education curriculum, continue
to receive their services,_and continue to participate with non-disabled peers to the same extent as
speci?ed in the lEPs, in-school suspensions and lunch detentions do not count toward the 10-day limit
Administrators are not required to suspend students with disabilities for the recommended periods set forth
in this Code for a single incident. Speci?cally, the Principal or his/her designee has discretion to suspend
students with disabilities fewer days than set forth for a single incident. Federal regulations offer some
?exibility in suspending students with disabilities in excess of iotschool days in the school year in certain
circumstances. In order to determine whether the circumstances permit a suspension in excess of 10 days
per school year, consultation by the school with the Of?ce of Diverse Learners Supports and Services (773
553-1905) is absolutely necessary. Without such consultation and approval from the Of?ce of Diverse
Learners Supports and Services, the 10 school day limit on out of school suspensions will continue

to apply.

When school officials anticipate a referral for expulsion, including referrals requesting emergency
assignment pursuant to the CPS $00, the following apply:

1. School must provide written notice to the parent/guardian or surrogate parent of the request
for an expulsion hearing and the date of an individualized Education Program 
Manifestation Determination Review (MDR) meeting, which must be held within 10 school days
of the date of the decision to request the expulsion hearing. School must also provide
parent/guardianlsurrogate with a written copy of the Notice of Procedural Safeguards.

2. The team must:
A. Determine whether the misconduct is related to the student?s disability by
reviewing all current and relevant information, including evaluation and diagnostic results,
information from the parent/guardian, observations of the student, and the student?s 
The behavior is a manifestation of the student's disability if:
1) the conduct in question was caused by the student's disability or has a direct and
substantial relationship to the student's disability; and/or
2) the conduct in question was the direct result of the school's failure to implement
the student's 

8. Review, and revise if necessary, the student's existing behavior intervention plan or
develop a functional behavior assessment and behavior intervention plan (FBAIBIP) to
address the misconduct. The behavior intervention plan must address the misconduct for
which the student is being disciplined.

If the studept's behavior is not a manifestation of the disability, school of?cials may apply the SCC, taking
into consideration the students special education and disciplinary records. In no event, however, may the
student be suspended for more than 10 consecutive or cumulative school days in a school year without
providing appropriate educational services.

If the student?s behavior is a manifestation of the disability, a disciplinary change in placement (expulsion) 
cannot occur. Students with disabilities, even if expelled, must be provided with an appropriate education
in an alternative educational setting.

All MDRs are subject to legal review by the Department of Procedural Safeguards and Parental Supports.

 

38 All procedural safeguards contained in the SCC and this Appendix are equally applicable to those students with ?504 plans.

Section 3. MITIGATING FACTORS

The COOGAO may, in the public interest, recommend that the Board debar a Respondent for any of the
causes in Section 2 of this Policy, using the procedures in Section 4. The existence of a cause for
Debarment, however, does not necessarily require that the COOGAQ seek to debar any Person; the
seriousness of the Person?s acts or omissions and any mitigating factors should be considered in making
any Debarment recommendations. Before recommending any Debarment decision, the COOGAG should
consider factors such as the following, if documented and veri?able information is provided by the
Respondent in its submission as provided by Section 4.5(c) of this Policy:

Whether the Respondent had effective standards of conduct and intemal control systems in
place at the time of the activity for which Debarment is being considered, or had adopted such
procedures prior to any Board or OIG investigation of the activity cited as a cause for Debarment;

Whether the Respondent brought the activity cited as a cause for Debarment to the attention
of the OIG or other appropriate Board personnel in a timely manner;

Whether the Respondent has fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for
Debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the CPO or the 

Whether the Respondent cooperated fully with Board personnel during any and all
investigations and in any court or administrative actions;

Whether the Respondent has paid or has agreed to pay all criminal and administrative ?nes
and Civil Judgments for the improper activity;

Whether the Respondent has paid or has offered to pay any investigative or administrative costs
incurred by the Board, and/or has made or offered to make full restitution;

(9) Whether the Respondent has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individual(s)
responsible for the activity which constitutes cause for Debarment,

Whether the Respondent has implemented or agreed to implement remedial measures,
including any identi?ed by the Board;

Whether the Respondent has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control
procedures and ethics training programs;

Whether the Respondent has had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within the
Respondent's organization that led to the cause for Debarment, and

(it) Whether the Respondent andlor its management recognizes and understands the seriousness
of the misconduct giving rise to the cause for Debarment and has taken appropriate steps to
prevent recurrence.

The presence of any mitigating factors such as those set forth above does not necessarily mean that
Debarment is unwarranted. Accordingly, the Respondent has the burden of demonstrating, to the
satisfaction of the Board, that Debarment is not warranted due to these potentially mitigating factors.
