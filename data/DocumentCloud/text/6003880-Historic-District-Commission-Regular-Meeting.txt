APPLICATION NUMBER 19-6176
ADDRESS: 2224 W. BOSTON BLVD.
HISTORIC DISTRICT: BOSTON EDISON
APPLICANT: JASON SENIOR
DATE OF STAFF VISIT: 05-02-2019

PREPARED BY: B. CAGNEY

PROPOSAL
The building located at 2224 West Boston Boulevard is a Tudor-Style, English Revival home built in 1924.
It sits toward the eastern end of the block on West Boston Boulevard between 14th Street and LaSalle Blvd.
The home features a prominent front facing gable with a two-story bay window and ornamental half-timber
details. The brick façade is composed of several character defining architectural elements: A steeply
pitched roof, a centrally located chimney with ornamental brick work and half-timbering around a
secondary front gable that features an oriel window.
The home originally had a garage in the rear yard, bordering the alley that was accessible through
the alleyway. The applicant states in the description of existing conditions that “the garage was razed
many years ago and we could not find any information on it.”
With the current proposal, the applicant is seeking the Commission’s approval to complete the following
work associated with the overall rehabilitation of the building as per the attached drawings:
•

The erection of a new 20’ x 20’ garage at the approximate location of the previous garage with
the following features:
o The garage walls will be 8’ ht.
 Total height is 17’-3” at roof peak
o Two-car garage with (1) overhead garage door [7’x17’] - brown
o (1) door on the side [36”] - brown
o HardiePlank lap siding [6” exposed width]
 Trim and siding to be painted “brown”
o The roof will be covered in dimensional shingles by Owens Corning in “brown” color to
match the roof on the home
 The roof will feature 1’ overhangs at the gable and the eaves
 Roof pitch: 10/12

ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
(7)

Relationship of materials. The majority of houses are faced with brick, while many are partially or
totally stucco. There are some stone buildings, sometimes combined with stucco; clapboard is rare, and
is extremely rare as the sole material. Roofing includes slate, tile and asphalt shingles. Wood shingle
roofs were once common and have generally been replaced with asphalt. Wood shake does not exist and
there is no known evidence that it was ever used in the district. Stone trim is common. Wood is almost
universally used for window frames and other functional trim and is used in many examples for all trim.

(8)

Relationship of textures. The most common relationship of textures in the district is that of a low-relief

(9)

pattern of mortar joints in brick contrasted with the smooth surface of wood or stone trim. There are a
few houses with rough or rusticated stone surfaces. The use of stucco or concrete, with or without halftimbering, as a contrast to brick surfaces, is not unusual. Tile, slate, or wood shingle roofs have
particular textural values where they exist. Asphalt shingles generally have little textural interest, even in
those types which purport to imitate some other variety.
Relationship of colors. Natural brick colors (such as red, yellow, brown, buff) predominate in wall
surfaces. Natural stone colors also exist. Where stucco or concrete exists, it usually remains in its
natural state, or is painted in a shade of cream. Roofs are in natural colors (tile and slate colors, natural
and stained wood colors), and asphalt shingles are predominantly within this same dark color range.
Paint colors often relate to style. The buildings derived from classical precedents, particularly those of
neo-georgian style, generally have woodwork painted white, cream, or in the range of those colors
including "putty"; doors and shutters are frequently dark green or black. Colors known to have been in
use on similar buildings of this style in the eighteenth or early twentieth centuries may be considered for
appropriateness. Buildings of medieval inspiration (notably neo-tudor) generally have painted woodwork
and window frames of a dark brown or cream color. Half timbering is almost always stained dark brown.
The original colors of any building, as determined by professional analysis, are always acceptable for a
house, and may provide guidance for similar houses.

(10)

Relationship of architectural details. Architectural details generally relate to style. Neo-georgian
buildings display classic details, mostly in wood, and sometimes in stone. Porches, shutters, window
frames, cornices, and dormer windows are commonly, although not always, treated. Details on
"mediterranean" style or vernacular buildings including arched windows, door openings, and porches, are
often done in stone, brick, tile, and sometimes in stucco. Buildings of medieval inspiration tend to have
details in the form of carved wood or carved stone ornaments on window frames, door frames, and eaves.
In general, the various styles are rich in architectural details.

(11)

Relationship of roof shapes. A variety of roof shapes exist in the district, depending on building style.
Shallow hipped roofs with dormers, roofs with triangular gables, and steep hipped roofs predominate. A
few gambrel roofs exist. Complex arrangements of the gabled and/or the hipped types, with subsidiary or
transverse roofs, are not unusual. Dormers are common. Flat roofs are present only as subsidiary roofs
on residential structures. Garage roofs generally reflect the style and pitch of the roof on the main house.

(20)

Orientation, vistas, overviews. Most of the houses in the district have front entrances which are oriented
toward the streets running east-west. The houses on Lasalle Boulevard, from Chicago Boulevard to
Edison Boulevard, are orientated toward Lasalle. Garages are frequently oriented either toward an alley
and/or the front drive or toward a side street in the case of corner lots. Almost all garages are detached
and are at the rear of the lot.

RECOMMENDATION
It is unclear when the original garage was demolished. The proposed garage will be placed in the rear of the property,
with vehicular access to the alleyway. The proposed location is not easily visible from the Primary View Corridor,
and will not detract from any character defining features of the home. Additionally, the steep pitch of the roof is
compatible with that of the residence. Staff is unsure as to the exact tone of the “brown” color proposed for the
garage. Therefore, it is recommended that the applicant select colors from the appropriate color chart or make sure
that the selected “brown” color is an identical match to the paint on the home.
It is staff’s recommendation that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work based
on the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New addition, exterior alterations, or

 REPORT

related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
… with the condition that the applicant selects colors from the appropriate color chart or make sure that the selected
“brown” color is an identical match to the paint on the home.
Motion DRAFT

•

I move that the Commission issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for the proposed work items proposed
in application number 19-6176 because the work as described does meet the Secretary of the Interior’s
Standards for Rehabilitation Number 10) New addition, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

“brown” color is an identical match to the paint on the home.
