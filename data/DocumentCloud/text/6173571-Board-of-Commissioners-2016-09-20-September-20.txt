(Item 5)
The resolution for Item 5 approves the establishment of a $500,000 revolving loan fund and a credit
support facility in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000, utilizing CHA federal funds totaling $2,500,000,
which will provide working capital lines of credit to Section 3 businesses participating in the Job Order
Contracting (JOC) mentoring program. In March 2016, the CHA Board of Commissioners authorized
the Chief Executive Officer to participate on a contract that the New York Housing Authority (NYCHA)
had with the Gordian Group to provide professional services and to manage the Section 3 JOC
mentoring program. The Section 3 JOC mentoring program is designed to build capacity for Section 3
businesses by assisting the contractors with all activities involved in the procurement of construction
contracts for work at CHA properties. The program is intended to award contracts to approximately 50
prequalified Section 3 businesses for work totaling $10 million over the next 18 months. In order to
facilitate timely payroll and vendor payment liquidity for these Section 3 businesses, CHA staff, have
developed the following solutions to bridge working capital and receivable financing needs: Contractors
performing jobs valued at up to $25,000 (tiers 1 ,2 and 3) can access the $500,000 revolving loan fund,
which CHA staff will manage, to provide working capital and receivables financing to bridge the time
period between task order, project commencement, invoice submission, and receipt of payment from the
CHA. These loans would range from $500 to a maximum of $15,000. Additionally, contractors
performing jobs valued at between $25,000 and $250,000 (tiers 4, 5 and 6) can access pilot lines of
credit at two CHA community banking partners (First Eagle Bank and Byline Bank) for up to $100,000
for working capital and receivable financing. These loans and underwriting criteria will be based upon
each bank’s commercial lending requirements for this program. The CHA will deposit up to $1,000,000
of federal funds in each bank for a 12-month term in a deposit account bearing an interest rate of 0.10%
to be used as collateral for this program. If a borrower defaults, the bank will debit the CHA linked
deposit for all interest and principal owed. CHA will have additional financial and operational
protection as a result of vendor payment and performance bond program requirements. Each Section 3
contractor desiring to participate in the pilot line of credit program will be required to submit a loan
application and all required financial documentation in order for the lenders to underwrite the loans.
Applicants will be assisted by CHA Investment staff as well as Bank partners on necessary
budgeting/cash flow reporting essential to developing business fiscal acumen. Both of the above
programs are designed to provide credit opportunities and reporting to credit bureaus to strengthen
Section 3 businesses financial profiles and demonstrated capacity.

RESOLUTION NO. 2016-CHA-104
WHEREAS, the Board of Commissioners of the Chicago Housing Authority has reviewed the Board
Letter dated September 20, 2016 entitled “Recommendation to enter into Professional
Services Agreements for appraisal services for real estate transactions and property
acquisitions with Great Realty Advisors and Allstate Appraisals.”
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF THE
CHICAGO HOUSING AUTHORITY:
THAT,

the Board of Commissioners authorizes the Chief Executive Officer or his designee to
enter into Professional Services Agreements for appraisal services for real estate
transactions and property acquisitions with Great Realty Advisors and Allstate Appraisals
in an aggregate amount of $400,000 consisting of an original contract value of $100,000
for a 2-year base term from October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2018; plus 2 option
years in the amount of $50,000 per year to provide authority wide appraisal services. The
11

 Board delegates authority to the Chief Executive Officer to use his discretion to exercise
the options. The Chief Executive Officer shall not exercise more than one option in any
year.
This award is subject to the Contractor’s compliance with the CHA’s MBE/WBE/DBE/
Section 3 hiring and insurance requirements.
(Item 15)
The resolution for Item 15 approves submission of a Disposition Application to HUD for a long term
lease with the National Public Housing Museum (NPHM) at 1322-24 Taylor Street; and enter into a long
term lease with NPHM. The lease will have an initial term of 50 years for 18,074 square feet of the
premises. NPHM will have additional options to extend the lease up to an aggregate consecutive term of
99 years and will pay $1.00 annual rent. Beginning in 1993, a coalition of Chicago historic preservation
advocates and local public housing residents worked with CHA to identify a single structure that would
be retained in the Jane Addams development. Working with HUD, the City of Chicago and the Illinois
Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA), CHA drafted a Memorandum of Agreement that would determine
the preservation strategy and requirements for the ABLA site. Signed in 1999, the Agreement outlined
terms of the redevelopment activity, rehabilitation, on-site new construction, off-site and scattered site
replacement housing as well as the demolition of ABLA Homes. While the Agreement expired in 2003,
CHA continues to honor the commitment made to HUD and the parties associated with the Agreement.
In 2007, the National Public Housing Museum, a 501c3 organization, was formed for the purpose of
creating the museum. To date, NPHM has raised a total of $2.9MM of $6.3MM needed to complete the
project. NPHM has received commitment letters from the Illinois State Department of Natural Resources,
Pierce Family Foundation, Woods Lindey Family, Alphawoods Foundation, Seigle Family Foundation
and Ford Foundation. In May 2016, CHA commissioned an appraisal of the site. The “as is” appraisal
value for the property is $410,000. The NPHM has submitted a commensurate benefit plan valued at
almost $1million, which exceeds the value of CHA land.

communities through workforce development training and a revenue generation business model. The

workforce development program, which includes layered technical training and certification(s) in the
areas of Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD), Industrial Controls and Robotics, as well as related
apprenticeship, placement and other employment education efforts. The redeveloped facility and the
