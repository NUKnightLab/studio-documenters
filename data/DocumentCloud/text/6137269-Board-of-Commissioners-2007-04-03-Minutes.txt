PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
ANTHONY J. PERAICA, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, the governor's "gross receipts tax plan" is a massive tax on Illinois goods and services; and
WHEREAS, this tax comes off the top of what an employer takes in, whether a company is making a
profit or losing money; and
WHEREAS, although the tax is being sold to the public as one that only impacts business entities
bringing in over $ l million per year in gross revenues, these costs will be passed along to consumers
regardless of income, thus making it a regressive tax that hurts everyone, particularly those with limited
means; and
WHEREAS, the repetitive taxation of a single item would drive up the cost of doing business in Cook
County, thus costing Cook County jobs by making products and services purchased here more expensive
and Cook County employers less competitive in the marketplace; and
WHEREAS, the gross receipts tax would result in Cook County losing citizens, consumers and tax
dollars, and have a drastic impact on our schools and healthcare facilities; and
WHEREAS, according to census population estimates, Cook County posted the third largest population
decline in the nation, losing 88,000 residents by 200 l , a problem that will be exacerbated even further by
the imposition of a gross receipts tax.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President and Cook County Board of
Commissioners does hereby urge the Illinois General Assembly to oppose and defeat the gross receipts
tax in order to protect the interests of Cook County consumers and residents; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Board of Commissioners does hereby urge
Governor Rod Blagojevich to abandon this draconian tax proposal and work with members of the Illinois
General Assembly to devise a more practical means of funding state operations.

1254

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(l ), Commissioner Silvestri, seconded by

PROPOSED RESOLUTION
REVISED AGENDA ORDER
WHEREAS, Cook County Board meetings often become lengthy affairs as did the March 20, 2007
meeting lasting over 4 hours; and
WHEREAS, the long, arduous meetings have the unattended effect of holding hostage high-level
department staff; and
WHEREAS, despite the fact that we have many highly skilled professionals from the Bureau of Health
Services who must not only travel to the County Building for meetings but spend copious amounts of
time there during Board meetings; and
WHEREAS, in light of the Bureau of Health Services current situation in which they are fervently
working to restructure the Bureau, their time would be better served at work rather than waiting in the
Board Room for their items to come up on the agenda; and
WHEREAS, the Board urges the Clerk's Office to revise the agenda so that items can be taken up in
order by department; and
WHEREAS, in order to revise the agenda the C lerk's Office needs to modify or upgrade their current
software which will not currently allow for any modifications.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Commissioners does hereby support
upgrades to the Clerk's software to allow for modifications to the agenda so that items can be taken up by
department and not by business transaction, and the Bureau of Health Services can be moved to the
beginning of the agenda for more timely consideration.

In accordance with Cook County Code Section 2-108(h)(l ), Commissioner Silvestri , seconded by
Commissioner Butler, moved to suspend the rules so that this matter may be considered. The motion
carried unanimously.
Commissioner Goslin, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the Proposed Resolution be
referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. (Comm. No. 285956). The motion carried
unanimously.

are highly rated by the Michigan State Police and the California State Highway Patrol. It has
been proven that the Chevrolet Impalas will allow us to save on fuel consumption because we
will get 5-8 more miles per gallon. The Chevrolet Impala comes equipped with items we
would pay more for with the Ford Crown Victoria and the Dodge Charger. The Chevrolet
Impala includes a five-year I 00,000 miles warranty on the engine and transmission. The Ford
Crown Victoria and the Dodge Charger have a three-year 36,000 mile warranty. The
warranty will allow us to save on repairs.

Report year ended May 31, 2006 and 2006 Independent Auditor's Report.

*Referred to the Committee on Health and Hospitals on 12/06/06.
Chairman Butler called on Dr. Stephen A. Martin, Jr., Chief Operating Officer, Department of Public
Health, to address the Commissioners on the reports for the Suburban Cook County Tuberculosis
Sanitarium District.
Dr. Martin addressed the Commissioners regarding the reports for the Suburban Cook County
Tuberculosis Sanitarium District. (The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County
Clerk.)
Dr. Martin asked Dr. Michael 0. Vernon, Director, Communicable Disease Control and Prevention
Program for the Department of Public Health, to address the Committee about the facts of tuberculosis.
(The referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)
Commissioner Collins asked if the transfer that was ordered by the legislation included the transfer of the
taxing authority as well; so that the County would be able to levy special taxes.
Dr. Martin stated that the language was not put into the bill ; however as a Home Rule County the Board
has the authority to reinstate the levy or raise its current property taxes to address that issue.
In response to Comm issioner Coll ins's question regarding the staffing issue, Dr. Martin stated that
currently in the department there is no staff available to take on the additional prevention and control
activities. Further, Dr. Martin stated that the current Communicable Disease Control and Prevention
Program staff is responsible for eighty diseases at the present time. According to State Law the
employees of the district would come over as well. In conclusion Dr. Martin stated that he has not
notified the Districts employees, he is waiting to first come before the County Board and present the issue
and then go back to them and share with them that he has spoken to the County Board and that they are
aware of the issue and the transition.
Commissioner Collins asked how many of the facilities now have long term leases.
Dr. Martin stated that there is only one faci lity which is the old Sanitarium Facility or the old hospital in
West Suburban Hinsdale that has a lease with a specialty hospital that runs until the year 2012.

1372

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007

Commissioner Collins asked how much does the lease generate.
Dr. Martin responded that it generates Jess than a $ 1 million per year.
Commissioner Collins asked if the County was planning on selling the other sites.
Dr. Martin stated that the County needs to keep using the current sites until the program is set.
Commissioner Daley asked when the plan will be completed.
Dr. Martin responded tentatively May 2007.
Dr. Martin stated that when the tax levy does dissolve, the County may not be able to go back and receive
the funds for the second installment of FY2006.
Commissioner Daley asked if the levy is in the legislation, would Dr. Martin have to go back and correct
it.
Dr. Martin stated that he will definitely investigate it and will notify the Commissioners in writing what
the State's Attorney, the State of Illinois and the General Assembly say in regards to the levy issue.
Commissioner Daley asked Dr. Martin whether he would need to go back to Springfield.
Dr. Martin stated that he will go back and check, but because Cook County is a Home Rule County, the
County does not believe the General Assembly needs to act.
In response to Commissioner Sims's question regarding the empty buildings at Oak Forest Hospital of
Cook County, Dr. Martin responded that he has approached Dr. Simon in regards to the lease for the
Department of Public Health whic h runs out in 2008; and not only looking at the department but also the
Tuberculosis (TB) Program and whether it can be consolidated into any open facility on the county
grounds.
Commissioner Sims asked how individuals are being notified to let them know that there w ill no longer
be a Tuberculosis Sanitarium District, and that it will be folded in w ith the Cook County Department of
Public Hea lth .
Dr. Martin stated that the Department of Public H ealth has not done anything at this time, but as time
draws near they will use the nonnal communication channe ls because he wants the residents to feel
confident.
Commissioner Sims asked where the funds wi ll come from.
Dr. Martin stated that currently the district uses some resources to get the word out, but also it is included
in the district' s community awareness budget.
Commissioner Sims inquired whether the Tuberculosis Sanitarium District has any staff that writes
grants.
Dr. Martin stated that the Tuberculosis Sanitarium District is not in the traditiona l categories where you
would write grants for it. It is one that is funded.

1373

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007

Commissioner Peraica stated that he has a concern about the financial obligation that is placed on the
Suburban Cook County taxpayers and all of Cook County taxpayers as a whole.
In response to Commissioner Peraica 's comments regarding the overall cost of treatment, the Forest Park
site and the professional fees and legal services, Dr. Martin stated that the fees that Commissioner Peraica
saw were identified in the "Timebomb book" and throughout the nation in the ' 80s there was a switch
from doing inpatient treatment and moving towards direct observed therapy which brought down the cost
and what the Commissioner is seeing now is actually the true cost of the direct observe theory which is
the global way to treat, prevent and care for TB. In regards to the Forest Park site, Dr. Martin stated that
he will be looking at all options and it will be the will of the Board in terms of how they want to direct
him at that site. Further, Dr. Martin stated that President Stroger's office has spoken to him in reference
to the Forest Park site and to come up with a plan; but what he is concerned about at this time is to ensure
that he is providing the program at its cheapest cost and to continue a smooth transition. In regards to the
professional fees, the District has no financial individuals hired, the District is paying an accounting firm
to provide the financial services; there will be issues in terms of putting all of the accounts together with
the Chief Financial Officer who has a $3 billion dollar budget to look after and now they will also have to
focus their attention on a $6 million dollar program. Finally, in terms of the legal costs, $100,000.00 has
been budgeted but has not been spent and there is no intent of spending the $100,000.00.
Commissioner Peraica asked what is the liability for the employees to contribute into the Illinois
Municipal Retirement Fund (IMRF).
Dr. Martin stated that preliminary the County understands that if you are an employee of the District and
you're in IMRF you would conclude your time in that program at the dissolution, and going forward
those employees would contribute to the County's pension plan and if the employee chooses they will
have retirement from both of the plans. In conclusion Dr. Martin stated that this is one of the issues that
he is addressing with the attorneys as well as the IMRF and the County Pension Board to really solidify
those issues which will be addressed in the transitional plan.
Commissioner Peraica asked the time frame that the Commissioners will receive the evaluated report.
Dr. Martin stated that he will be before the Board hopefully in May with the report and other items for the
Board to discuss.
Chairman Butler asked how the City of Chicago fits into the Tuberculosis Sanitarium District.
Dr. Martin responded that they are the County's partner and continue to be at the table with the County as
we plan because the City of Chicago has concerns that disease knows no boundary.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Sims, moved to receive and file Communication
No. 283388. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007

Commissioner Maldonado noted that the Substitute Amendment is the result of his consultation with the
State's Attorney's Office, the Assessor's Office and the Chief Financial Officer.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved the approval of the
Substitute Amendment. The motion carried.
Commissioner Maldonado provided the following clarification with regard to the Substitute Amendment:
that the Substitute Amendments provides the means to enforce the Living Wage Ordinance. He touched
on the main points of the Substitute Amendments: Owner-occupied, industrial properties (Class 8
properties) are now included in the Living Wage Ordinance. The Chief Financial Officer makes the
annual adjustment to the living wage, and notifies the employers of this or any other change to the living
wage. Employers must notify current and prospective employees of the Jiving wage. Employees can file
formal complaints against their employers through the Cook County Commission on Human Rights, if a
living wage is being withheld. Any company out of compliance with the Living Wage Ordinance will
lose their tax exemptions and/or their contract with the County.
Commissioner Maldonado clarified that the amended Living Wage Ordinance applies to both employers
who have contracts with the County and employers who receive tax exemptions from the County.
Chairman Murphy inquired whether there is a two-year waiting period before an employer who has not
been in compliance can reapply for a tax exemption or contract with the County.
Commissioner Maldonado replied that, while that was originally in the Ordinance, the current version
allows that once the employer comes into compliance, they can apply to be reinstated.
The Committee gave leave for Commissioner Sims to be added as a sponsor of the Substitute
Amendment.
Commissioner Maldonado noted that Cook County's living wage is computed by taking the poverty
threshold set by the federal government for a family of four and doubling this amount. Currently Cook
County 's living wage is $9.43/hour.
Commissioner Butler inquired as to who will be enforcing the living wage.
Chairman Murphy replied that the Chief Financial Officer will require a yearly affidavit from every
company attesting that they are in compliance.
Commissioner Butler inquired as to who would police this.
Chairman Murphy replied that an employee would have to file a complaint with the Cook County Human
Rights Commission.
Commissioner Butler inquired whether the State's Attorney's Office had reviewed the amended item .
Commissioner Maldonado replied that the following entities, in addition to the State' s Attorney' s Office,
have approved the amended item: Chief Financial Officer, Assessor, Assessor' s Office, Purchasing
Agent and the Human Rights Commission.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Beavers, moved the approval of
Communication Number 285079, as amended. The motion carried.

Dalev, Elizabeth "Liz" Doody Gorman. Gregg Goslin, Timothy 0. Schneider, Deborah

PROPOSED RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING A
COUNTY GOVERNMENT RELATIONS POLICY
WHEREAS, the effectiveness of a government's re lations reflects the importance and
priority ascribed to it by the President and Members of the Board of Commissioners; and
WHEREAS, independently elected officials and department heads understand that
requests for bill impact analyses and positions should be answered promptly and be
considered a priority; and
WHEREAS, prompt decision making is vital, ultimate decision-makers on government
relations should consider it a priority to make all necessary decisions well before any
applicable legislative deadline; and
WHEREAS, the County Board should be regularly informed of county interests, and
where help is needed, encouraged to assist in the effort; and
WHEREAS, within the bounds of propriety, requests from legislators should be
responded to promptly; and
WHEREAS, government relations efforts pursued by independently elected County
officials will be required to seek County Board approval of government relations efforts
and on specific legislative initiatives; and
WHEREAS, legislative leaders will give representatives of the County a degree of
responsiveness that reflects their respective ability to : (I) generally speak for, or
promptly get authority on specific topics to speak for, the President and Members of the
Board of Commissioners; and (II) respond to proper requests from legislators.

1389

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the County's legislative agenda: (I)
should be finalized before January 1st; (II) should in the final quarter of the year, receive
recommendations from department heads and independently elected executive offices on
legislative initiatives; (III) should include initial meetings between the President and
legislative leaders, and the President and the Governor, prior to the first day of regular
session; (IV) include finalized fact sheets and sponsors before bill introduction deadlines;
(V) must include briefings of supporters of the County's legislative agenda prior to bill
introduction; and (VI) include Board ratification of a proactive agenda prior to bill
introduction; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County develop a set of general guidelines for
the government relations team to follow, including opposition to pre-emption of home
rule authority, unless the President and Board otherwise directs; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in responding to bills and amendments that affect
the County, a clear protocol be established by the County Board, with consistent
promptness followed, establishing the respective roles of the Office of President,
Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental, and Veterans Relations, and the County
Board on communications with legislative leaders, state representatives and senators and
the Governor; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the County should seek "floor leaders" in each
legislative chamber to serve as regular spokespersons on County issues and that regular
written communications to the President and to the County Board be established.
*Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans
Relations on 12/06/06.
Vice Chairman Silvestri, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to approve Communication No.
283412.
Vice Chairman Silvestri informed the committee that three amendments to Communication No. 283412
had been circulated to all members prior to the meeting.
Vice Chairman Silvestri added that Chairman Suffredin and Commissioners Butler, Daley, Gorman,
Goslin, Schneider and Sims have requested to be added as co-sponsors of this resolution.
Vice Chairman Silvestri gave a brief description of the original resolution as introduced. He believed that
the original resolution would create procedures that would be difficult to implement, however he stated
that the three proposed amendments to the resolution would instead institute a policy to be followed with
regard to legislative efforts by elected county officials.
Vice Chairman Silvestri then introduced the three amendments to the proposed resolution. The first
amendment states that other elected county officials would advise the County Board of government
relations efforts prior to pursuing specific legislative initiatives. This reduces the risk of having other
elected county officials in conflict on the same bill in Springfield. The second amendment removes the
specific deadline dates and sets a policy to be followed. The third amendment establishes a standing
opposition to preemption of home rule authority unless the President and Board otherwise direct, and also
references the communications plan under which the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and
Veterans Relations is advised of all legislative efforts in Springfield on those particular bills.

termination; and
WHEREAS, State Representative John Fritchey (D-Chicago) is sponsoring HB H6
3578 that seeks to close the pension loophole, applying the same standards to Cook
County elected officials as those in the remaining 101 counties of Illinois; and
WllEREA.S, in 2005, Geek Ceunty had a $2.2 billien in unfanded pensien liabilities, up

* Referred to the Committee on Legislation, Intergovernmental and Veterans
Relations on 12/19/06.
Commissioner Claypool indicated that an amendment to Communication No. 283675 was necessary in
order to reflect the new House Bill assigned to State Representative John Fritchey 's bill on this subject.
The new bill number that it has been assigned is HB 3578.

No. 283675, to change the House Bill number from HB 136 to HB 3578. The motion carried.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR APRIL 3, 2007
Commissioner Claypool explained that this resolution supports Representative Fritchey's efforts in
Springfield to require an election of the official in order to receive pension benefits, and also to require a
four year average to determine final salary to calculate pension benefits for elected officials in Cook
County. This would not affect any existing elected officials, but would be effective for all newly elected
officials after the bill's passage in Springfield.
Commissioner Daley asked about the status of the previous bill, HB 136.
Chairman Suffredin said that HB 136 was a shell bill that opened the Pension Code but that nothing was
ever put into it, and that HB 3578 was the substantive bill filed at a later date.
Commissioner Claypool added that Representative Fritchey initially introduced it as a vehicle with the
intent of adding the substance. He stated that HB 3578 has gone through first reading and is now in the
House on the calendar for second reading as of March 15, 2007.
Vice Chairman Silvestri asked if the elected officials in other counties in Illinois had similar provisions as
those proposed in HB 3578 for Cook County elected officials, and whether it was consistent with the
existing provisions for Cook County employees.
Commissioner Claypool responded affirmatively.
Commissioners Butler and Collins requested to be included as co-sponsors of Communication No.
283675.
Leave was granted by Chairman Suffredin to add all Commissioners as co-sponsors.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Vice Chairman Silvestri, moved to amend Communication No.
283675 by deleting the seventh (7th) Whereas clause. The motion carried.
Commissioner Claypool, seconded by Commissioner Schneider, moved the approval of
Communication No. 283675, as amended. The motion carried.
