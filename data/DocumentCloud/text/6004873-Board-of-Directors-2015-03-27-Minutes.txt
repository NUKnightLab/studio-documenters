ii. Meeting Minutes
 Charter for Audit and Compliance Committee
Director Velasquez presented the Meeting Minutes and reviewed the metrics with Cathy Bodnar, Chief Corporate
Compliance and Privacy Officer. The Board reviewed and discussed the information.
Chairman Hammock observed that it has been challenging to come up with appropriate metrics for the Audit and
Compliance Committee; however, by looking at the number and origins of compliance issues as the Board did
today, it would appear that this can be helpful information to receive on a quarterly basis. If, for example, the report
reflected a mushrooming of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)- related issues, he
believed that this would provide a clear indication to the Board that there are areas that need work.
Director Velasquez, seconded by Director Junge, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Audit and Compliance Committee Meeting of March 19, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

Board and Committee Reports
D. Managed Care Committee Meeting, March 19, 2015 (continued)
During the discussion of slide 12, Vice Chairman Butler inquired regarding the policy regarding patients who lose
or misplace their 90-day prescriptions. Dr. Claudia Fegan, Executive Medical Director/Medical Director of Stroger
Hospital, stated that when a patient loses or misplaces their 90-day supply, they will not receive another supply
without payment; they will be required to pay for the second prescription. Vice Chairman Butler noted that many of
the System’s patients are unable to afford this. Mr. Glass stated that the rules for Medicaid are a little bit different;
the administration could consider charging a co-payment or a higher co-payment, but they are not able to pass on
the full cost of the medications to someone with Medicaid. He suggested that this could perhaps be the approach
taken with someone who is uninsured. He noted that, currently, there are no co-pays required right now for
CountyCare, for either 30- or 90-day prescriptions. Chairman Hammock requested that Mr. Glass return with more
information regarding what is permitted and if a policy exists1.
An update on marketing and outreach was provided by Caryn Stancik, Executive Director of Communications. She
stated that the first year’s marketing contract was focused almost wholly on the marketing of CountyCare for the
purposes of enrollment; the administration is now winding that contract down. A new Request for Proposals (RFP)
is currently being developed and finalized; this will be for services that combine CountyCare with CCHHS, with
CCHHS being more of the priority in the next round of marketing. That RFP is expected to be released soon.
Director Lerner, seconded by Director Butler, moved the approval of the Minutes of the
Managed Care Committee Meeting of March 19, 2015. THE MOTION CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY.

purposes. He was happy to report that the Board has had excellent attendance over the last quarter. The next quarterly
report is expected to be presented in June, for the period through May 2015.
Update on Cook County Health Foundation
Chairman Hammock stated that the Cook County Health Foundation held their first event in November; for this event,
they asked for contributions and solicited gifts specifically for the Emergency Department. This morning, Dr. Shannon
and Foundation Chair Warren Batts, who is a former CCHHS Board Chairman, delivered a check in the amount of
$193,000 to the Emergency/Trauma Department as a result of that event.

Timeline

Chairman Hammock stated that this presentation is intended for Dr. Shannon to kick-off how he is planning to get
started with strategic planning. Chairman Hammock and Dr. Shannon have talked about what technique they will use to
keep the Board abreast and involved in these discussions. He emphasized that this plan will not try to predict what
health care is going to be like twenty years from now; rather, this is about a very tactical plan over the next three years
to get the System to the next level of sophistication with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Ambulatory program, etc. He
added that information will be shared with the County officials, as well.

State

a State Legislative leadership and the Governor reached agreement to close the $1.6 billion gap in the
state's FY2015 budget. On Tuesday,March 25, 2015, the Illinois House of Representatives approved
HB 317 and HB 318 which addresses the shortfall with a combination of fund sweeps and a
2.25% across the board cut in funding. This solution avoids Medicaid rate cuts to hospitals. The Illinois
State Senate approved both measures on Thursday, March 26, 2015.

The General Assembly is in recess untilApril 14, 2015 at which time legislators will reconvene to
consider the state?s FY2016 budget.

On Tuesday, March 24, 2015, the Subcommittee on Health ofthe House Energy and Commerce
Committee held a hearing on the 3408 drug program. Witnesses were limited to representatives of
the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
and the Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG).

While there is strong bipartisan support for the 3408 program, the Subcommittee was especially
interested in how HRSA maintains the integrity of the program. There was no focused issue for the
hearing, other than general oversight, however; concern was expressed about provider use of savings
from the program.

HRSA reported that in the face of a US. District Court ruling last summer which limited the statutory
authority of HRSA to issue regulations, HRSA will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of
proposed guidance later this year. The statutory authority for rulemaking will be limited to 3408
ceiling prices, the imposition of manufacturer civil penalties and the implementation of a dispute
resolution process. The guidance will cover additional issues such as whether incarcerated patients,
when treated in an outpatient setting, are considered eligible 3408 patients.

All of the witnesses agreed that until recently HRSA was not actively auditing the program. All agreed
that HRSA must be more specific about who eligible patients are. They also agreed that there should
be greater review ofthe use ofthe funds generated by the program.

Wednesday, March 25, 2015, the US. House of Representatives passed House Concurrent Resolution
27, the FY2016 Budget Resolution. The budget resolution sets the level of discretionary spending and
is a blueprint for changes in revenues and entitlement spending. In each case, Congress must take
further action, Reconciliation, to implement appropriations for discretionary spending and make
substantive changes in revenues and entitlements to fulfill the blueprint.

Key elements of the resolutions include repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
repeal of Medicaid expansion and block-granting Medicaid through new "State Flexibility Funds" with
the Children?s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) consolidated into Medicaid.

Congress will begin to earnestly consider the reconciliation of the budget resolution after the Supreme
Court rules on King v. Burwell, deciding the status of the subsidies for individuals purchasing insurance
through the Federal Exchange.

Protection of Medicaid remains a key priority for the CookCounty Health and Hospitals System at both
the State and Federal level.
