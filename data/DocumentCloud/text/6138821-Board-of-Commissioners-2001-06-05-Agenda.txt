PROPOSED RESOLUTION
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by
WILLIAM R. MORAN, County Commissioner
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

WHEREAS, air pollution has been shown to be a contributing factor to premature death, aggravating
asthma and is especially harmful to vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly and people with
existing lung and heart disease; and
WHEREAS, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that the Chicago metropolitan
area is a severe non-attainment area for ozone and failure to conform with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency Clean Air Act standards; and
WHEREAS, non-attainment area status could lead to a loss of federal transportation dollars, the
curtailment of economic opportunities and the imposition of other federal sanctions that could erode local
control for the Chicago metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS, the twenty-five coal-fired power plants in Illinois are a significant source of air pollution in
Illinois, emitting smog-forming nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide contributing to particulate pollution and
carbon dioxide contributing to climate change and toxic metals; and

1912

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I

WHEREAS, the coal-fired power plants of Illinois were built between 1951 and 1975 making them
exempt from meeting the pollution standards of the Clean Air Act; and
WHEREAS, pollution from coal-fired power plants could be reduced by installing modern pollution
controls or burning cleaner fuel s such as natural gas; and
WHEREAS, there is a threat to the health and safety of the residents of Cook County and the State of
Illinois because of the emissions from the coal-fired power plants.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that the Board
does hereby urge Governor George Ryan and the Illinois General Assembly to ensure that pollution from
coal-fired power plants be dramatically reduced by passing legislation that would effectively end the
"grandfathering" of these plants from the new plant emission standards of the Clean Air Act; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a suitable copy of this Resolution be presented to Governor
George Ryan and the Illinois General Assembly.

This item was WITHDRAWN from the consent calendar and placed on the New Items Agenda with a

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001

OFFICE OF THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
CONTRACT
Transmitting a Communication, dated June 5, 2001 from
M. VERONICA LYNCH, Chief Deputy Assessor
requesting authori zation for the Purchasing Agent to enter into a contract with Larco International,
Cicero, Ill inois, to create, mail and process the application, in a bi-lingual fo rmat, for the Homeowner
Exemption for Long-Term Properties Ordinance.
Reason:

The Homeowner Exemption for Long-Term Properties (HELP) Ordinance was approved by
the Board of Commissioners earlier today. As the first step, HELP requi red the Assessor's
Office to administer the application and qualification process.
As Chairman Daley and Commissioner Lechowicz indicated at the Finance Committee
hearing, implementation of the program would req uire additional financial means for our
office to handle the req uirements of the program in time for the 200 1 tax bills. I have
reviewed the requirements of the ordinance and identified the budget and sched ul ing
considerations for this program.
At the current stage of the tax bill process, it is imperative that the required program
applications be mailed to identifiable homeowners and returned to the Assessor's Office no
later than July 9. Also, unlike the homeowners exemption, which merely requires a verifying
signature of the homeowner, HELP, as currently amended, will requ ire that owners provide
information verifying household income. In order to maintain the integrity of the program,
this process requires manual review of income statements by my office along with accessible
space for annual income documentation.
C urrently the Assessor's Office does not possess the staff to complete these tas ks within the
ordained time parameters. Therefore, the Assessor recommends that for th is first year of the
program both the mailing and processing be contracted as a sole source to the vendor who has
been the low bidder for each of the four major ma il and mai l processing jobs undertaken by
our office. The recommended vendor is Larco International, 3250 South Central A venue,
C icero, Illinois 60804.

Estimated Fiscal lmpact: $ 109,000.00. One time purchase. ( 490-260 Account).

Commissioner Hansen, seconded by Commissioner Daley, moved to suspend the ru les so that th is matter
may be considered. The motion carried unanimously.
Commiss ioner Steele, seconded by Commissioner Maldonado, moved that the County Purchasing Agent
be authorized to enter into the requested contract. The motion carried unanimously.

PROPOSED CONTRACT AMENDMENT

Transmitting a Communication, dated May 25, 2001 from
TERRY A. STECZO, Deputy Assessor for Administration &Taxpayer Services
Re:

Assigmnent of Contract No. 99-43-1256

The Assessor's Office requests approval of assignment of the above contract from Xpedior, Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, to Risetime, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, and authorization for the Purchasing Agent to execute the
Consent to Assignment. Assigmnent of the contract to Risetime, Inc., is the most efficient and effective
means to complete the Automation Plan for the Assessor's Office. We have conferred and worked with
the State's Attorney's Office on all aspects of this transaction.
The Chief lnformation Officer has reviewed this item and concurs with this recommendation.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the request of the Deputy
Assessor for Administration & Taxpayer Services be approved. The motion carried unanimously.
Commissioner Butler, seconded by Commissioner Collins, moved to defer consideration of the contract
amendment to the June 19, 200 I Board meeting. The motion carried unanimously.

RESOLUTION REGARDING THE REGULATION OF SIGNS APPROVED AND
ADOPTED JAN UA RY 20, 1999 (PROPOSED RESOLUTION AMENDMENT).
Submitting a Proposed Resolution sponsored by Herbert T. Schumann, Jr., County
Commissioner.
PROPOSED RESOLUTION

AMENDING THE RESOLUTION REGARDING THE REGULATION OF SIGNS
APPROVED AND ADOPTED JANUARY 20, 1999
Whereas, the regulation and zoning control of signs in the unincorporated areas of Cook County
were adopted~ almost twenty-five years ago; and
Whereas, numerous conflicts have developed over the years between the growth and development
of the unincorpo rated areas and areas under municipal authority, and the proliferation of signs,
particularly large advertising signs; and
Whereas, signs permitted under the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance are now considered out
of place, particularly in areas attempting to preserve scenic and aesthetic assets; and
Whereas, a comprehensive amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has
been proposed and introduced for consideration by the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and
Whereas, the proposed amendments have been referred to the Comm ittee on Zoning fo r public
hearing and comment, which process -ts was expected to take several months to complete; and
Whereas, these proposed sig n regulations have yet to be considered by the Committee on Zoning
and Building; and
Whereas, the proposed sign regulations wi ll substantially amend the size and location perm itted
fo r many signs, and will make certain sig ns non-confo rming subject to amortization and removal; and
\Vhereas, the ongoing iss1:1ance of b1:1i lding pem1its and/or zoning relief 1:111der the e><isting zoning
ordinanee 1:1nElerrn ines the ability of Cook Co1:1nty to effeeti·,,el;' reg1:1late the proliferation of eonflieting
signs thro1:1gho1:1t the w1incorporateEI areas of Cook Co1:1nty.
Whereas the moratorium o n the issuance of permits for advertising s igns has been effective in
limiting the proliferation of advertising s igns, however, businesses in unincorporated Cook County are
seeking zoning re lief for the replacement and modernization of on premises advertising signs;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOL YEO AS FOLLOWS:
From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until review of the comprehensive
I.

RESOLUTION
Sponsored by
THE HONORABLE HERBERT T. SCHUMANN, JR., COUNTY COMMISSIONER
Amending the Resolution Regarding the Regulations of Signs
Approved and Adopted January 20, 1999
Whereas, the regulation and zoning control of sig ns in the unincorporated areas of Cook County
were adopted evei: almost twenty-five years ago; and
Whereas, numerous conflicts have developed over the years between the growth and development
of the unincorporated areas and areas under municipal authority, and the proliferation of signs, pmticularly
large advertising signs; and
Whereas, signs permitted under the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance are now considered out
of place, particularly in areas attempting to preserve scenic and aesthetic assets; and
Whereas, a comprehensive amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has
been proposed and introduced for consideration by the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and

1973

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Whereas, the proposed amendments have been referred to the Committee on Zoning for public
hearing and comment, which process is was expected to take several months to complete; and
Whereas, these proposed sign regulations have yet to be considered by the Committee on Zoning
and Building; and
Whereas, the proposed sign regulations will substantially amend the size and location permitted for
many signs, and will make certain signs non-conforming subject to amortization and removal; and
Wl"lereas, the ongoing iss1:1anee of l:milding permits and/or zoning relief 1:1nder the e"isting zoning
ordinanee 1:1ndermines the ability of Cook Co1:1nty to effeetiYely reg1:1late the proliferation of eonflieting signs
thro1:1gho1:1tthe tmineorporated areas of Cook Co1:1nty.
Whereas the moratorium on the issuance of permits for advertising signs has been effective in
limiting the proliferation of advertising signs, however, businesses in unincorporated Cook County are
seeking zoning relief for the replacement and modernization of on premises advertising signs;
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOL YEO AS FOLLOWS:
From the date of adoption of this Resolution and until review of the comprehensive
I.
amendment to Article 12 of the Cook County Zoning Ordinance has been completed, there shall be a
moratorium on the issuance of any and all permits for the construction, expansion or relocation of all signs
or for zoning relief as regulated by Article 12 of the 1976 Cook County Zoning Ordinance, excepting as
enumerated in paragraph 2 below.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall, upon sufficient evidence submitted by
2.
an applicant, have the authority to issue a permit for replacement of sign(s) located on and within the
premises of a business or property owner where such sign(s) existed prior to the moratorium and which
have come into disrepair due to damage by weather conditions, accident, intentional acts of vandalism, or
in instances where the business at which the existing sign is located has changed,. Additionally, the
Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall have authority to issue a permit for the replacement of an on
premises sign~ in instances in which the property or business owner deems that an existing on premises
sign no longer appropriately projects the qulllity identity of the business and where, due to the age and/or
deterioration of construction materials used, such sign(s) detract from the value of the business property.
The issuance of a permit for the replacement of previously existing signs shall be only for restricted to
applications for those on premises signs not req1:1iring a variation from, and that meet conform to or
require a variance from the req1:1irements provisions of, ARTICLE 12 of the 1976 Cook County Zoning
Ordinance.
3.
The Commissioner of Building and Zoning shall take appropriate steps to inform the
Zoning Admini strator and the Zoning Board of Appeals of this relief under the moratorium.
4.
If, upon the expiration of six months from the date of adoption of this amended
moratorium, review of the proposed amendments to Article 12 has not been concluded, the this amended

Chairman Daley entered responses to his questions from Assessor Houlihan and Clerk Orr, along with
supplementary letters from the offices of the Assessor, County Clerk and Treasurer into the record. (The
referenced documents are on file in the Office of the County Clerk.)

Following testimony, Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Quigley, moved to
accept the substitute version for the proposed ordinance in Item 242044. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moran voted present.
In response to Commissioner Lechowicz's question regarding how the cap of $300,000 was determined,
Veronica Lynch, Chief Deputy Assessor, responded there were several numbers that the sponsor of the
ordinance talked about in terms of the cap level as well as a group comprised of staff from the offices of
the County Clerk, Assessor, President and Commissioner Maldonado. Ms. Lynch stated Commissioner
Maldonado chose $300,000 as the cap on the market value of a home.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding the $300,000 cap referred to as the assessed
value not the market value, Ms. Lynch responded the $300,000 refers to the Assessor's market value, and
not the assessed value.
In correspondence received from the Treasurer's Office, James Crawley suggested that a deadline should
be set for the filing for this exemption so that homeowners cannot apply for a certificate of error, as they
can do now for the homeowner's exemption and senior citizen' s exemption. The Treasurer's office
processes between fifty thousand and seventy thousand refunds annually, most of which are because
people fai l to apply for their homeowner's exemption. If property owners are allowed to go back in time
and apply for this longtime homeowner's exemption by way of a certificate of error, the number of
refunds to be processed would increase to approximately one hundred thousand per year.
Chairman Daley asked Cathy Maras O'Leary, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation, to respond to comments made by Mr. Crawley, regarding the processing of
the longtime homeowner exemption.
Mrs. O'Leary stated that these exemptions would be treated like a certificate of error. The certificates of
error are currently automated, and a different reason code will be added to reflect longtime homeowners.
Mrs. O'Leary stated the system can be modified very quickly to automate this type of refund.
Chairman Daley asked Mrs. O ' Leary to confirm that there will be no problem going back ifa person files
for this exemption?
Mrs. O' Leary replied no, certificates of error are already automated . A different reason code will just be
added. She stated her office has been working with the Assessor's office on this issue, and if anyone does
mi ss applying for this exemption and they need a refund, a different type of certificate of error (C of E)
will be created.

1983

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Commissioner Maldonado stated the Treasurer's Office provided him with the percentage of homeowners
that failed to apply in time for the traditional homeowner's exemption, as approximately one percent.
Based on the estimates provided by the Assessor's Office that forty-two thousand homeowners may be
eligible for this exemption, and if one percent fail to apply, that translates to 420 homeowners that may
apply for a certificate of error. Would that really create a major burden in the Treasurer's office to
process 420 additional certificates of error?
Mr. Crawley responded that there are 1.6 million tax parcels in Cook County and currently the
Treasurer's Office processes between fifty thousand and seventy thousand certificate of error refunds.
With respect to the forty-two thousand homeowners in the Chicago assessment district that will be
eligible for this exemption, it can be assumed that a large portion of the people will not apply on a timely
basis because it is a new exemption and people may simply not know of its existence.
Chairman Daley stated in his opinion most people are going to assume that they will qualify for the
longtime homeowner exemption. Unfortunately, they will not.
In response to Commissioner Steele's question regarding the eligibility criteria, Veronica Lynch
responded there are essentially two qualifications. The qualifications are: the property is under the
$300,000 market value, and you have to have lived there ten years or more. Based on these
qualifications, the Assessor' s Office estimated between forty-two thousand and forty-nine thousand as the
number of eligible homeowners.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Lynch how the number of eligible homeowners was determined?
Ms. Lynch responded the Assessor's Office looked back at residential sales in the last ten years, and at the
market value of that home. Based on this analysis, the universe of forty-two thousand and forty-nine
thousand was arrived at.
In response to Commissioner Steele's question regarding the qualification for the homestead exemption,
Ms. Lynch stated you have to have lived in your home from January first.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Lynch what the assessed valuation would be on a $300,000 market value
home?
Ms. Lynch responded the assessed value would be $48,000.
Commissioner Lechowicz referenced a letter from Treasurer Pappas dated May 21, 200 I and attached to
that letter is correspondence dated March 7, 200 I from the Chief Information Officer, Cathy Maras
O'Leary to Patricia Shymanski, Acting Chief of Staff to the President. In the letter, Mrs. O ' Leary stated
two crucial points that cannot be overlooked: before the Department for Management of Information
Systems (MIS) can even begin modifying the required programs, detailed requirements are needed to be
completed by the affected agencies. Modifying approximately five hundred programs will take ten to
twelve months for five MIS programmers to complete. During that time no other requests can be worked
on for the Treasurer, County Clerk, Assessor, Board of Review or any other agency. Commissioner
Lechowicz asked Mrs. O' Leary to respond.
Mrs. O ' Leary responded that if this ordinance is passed, this would be a prioritized task that MIS would
do. What that means is that other requested modifications to coding might not be able to be done because
this is a priority for the Board. If this is the highest priority, we will have to focus most of our attention
on these priority items. She continued by stating there are five hundred programs that are not due to be
completed until next year. For the second installment tax bill, MIS does not have to change five hundred
programs. She believes MIS has six weeks of programming to be completed to accommodate this
ordinance.

 JOURNA L OF PROCEEDI NGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 1
Chairman Daley called upon representati ves fro m the Assessor, County Clerk, and MIS, who have been
working together on this ordinance, its impact on their respective offices, and its implementation.
Fredda Bennan, Director of Real Estate & Tax Services, County Clerk's office, explained the differential
in the calculations. The calculations referenced in her letter refer to how the exemption wi ll affect a
property owner who app lies for the exemption. Assuming the exemption is passed, and the e ligible
homeowner applies, she has determined how much they would save because they have applied for this
exemption. The figure is attributable to the amount of equalized assessed value that is removed from the
tax calculation. The figures the Assessor's provided are no different from ones that the County C lerk's
office would have come up with. The Assessor' s office analysis was based on whether the ordinance is
passed or not. For example, if the ordinance is not approved, the tax rate for everyone wou ld be slightly
lower. It was just a slightly different approach to analyzing it, but we don't disagree on the calculations.
C ha irman Daley asked Ms. Berman if she had provided information on the shift fo r the people who are
not participating in the longtime homeowner exemption.
Ms. Berman rep lied yes, she had provided the fig ures on the shift.
In response to Comm issioner Silvestri's question regarding tax collections, Ms. Bennan stated with regard
to the taxes to be collected in the second installment of this year, there will be no decrease in collections to
taxing districts resulting from this exemption. This is due to the City of Chicago sharing a very small
number of taxing districts with suburban Cook. However, when the North and South districts are
reassessed, the effect is potentially different in the suburban taxing districts. The effect may be different in
areas in suburban Cook County, depending on whether those taxing districts are at their statutory rate
ceiling. Therefore, the effect will be varied across the suburban Cook County taxi ng districts.
Commissioner Si lvestri asked Ms. Berman if most taxing districts are at their statutory limitation?
Ms. Berman responded that yes, most districts are at their rate ceilings.
Commissioner Moran w ithdrew his name as a co-sponsor of the substitute ordinance. Commissioner
Moran agrees that the tax burden for longtime homeowners should be alleviated, however, he does not
believe that the tax burden should then be shifted to Cook County residents who have not lived in their
homes for ten years. He continued by stating that if this exemption is created, instead of shifti ng the tax
burden from all homeowners regardl ess of how long they have lived in their homes, it would shift
towards homeowners who have recently purchased their new homes. He concluded by saying the County
should find alternative sources of funding or red uce the County budget to pay for the tax exemption.
In response to Commi ss ioner Schumann's question regarding which taxing districts are included in the
" opt-out" provision, Fredda Berman, Director of Real Estate & Tax Services fo r the County Clerk's
office, stated that the statute specifically prohibits the Chicago Board of Ed ucation and the C ity of
C hicago from the opt-out provision. Other taxing districts that cannot opt out include communi ty
colleges, fire protection districts, library districts, and park districts.
Commissioner Schumann stated that it is necessary to obtain background infonnation for the succeedi ng
years. For example, after this reassessment year, how will th is program affect suburban taxpayers? Who
w ill be el igible? He continued by stating that suburban taxpayers will be asked to pay part of the burden
on this tax without any information regarding the net effect in s uburban Cook County.

1985

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I
Veronica Lynch, Chief Deputy Assessor, explai ned that the difficulty with projecting any of those criteria
is that a provision in the substitute ordinance establishes that one of the qualifying levels is that your
reassessment must be one and one half times the average assessment level in an assessment district.
Based on the fact that the North and South districts have not been reassessed, it is impossible for the
Assessor's office to gauge what that average assessment is going to be in order to project the number of
qualify ing homes. She also stated that it is impossible for the Assessor's office to determine the number
of people who would be affected in the North and South triennial reassessment districts.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Lynch when the numbers will be available with respect to the North triennial
reassessment district.
Ms. Lynch responded that the North district will close in November.
Commissioner Schumann as ked Ms. Lynch to provide the members with estimates, just to have a general
idea who may or may not be eligible.
Commissioner Maldonado commented that the only data the Assessor could use to make estimates would
be based on the last triennial reassessment for the North district, which occurred in 1997. He believes that
the data would be so antiquated that it would not reflect the numbers. If the substitute ordinance is
adopted, the City of Chicago would be the first district to be implemented. Any shift would be on
ineligible property owners, not just ineligible homeowners but ineligible property owners, which includes
industrial and commercial properties within the City of Chicago.
Commissioner Schumann referenced the Village of Lemont in his district, which has seen a golf course
built, and million dollar homes built nearby. He stated that it is important to have a means test that is
income based. He concluded by stating that he believes that many taxing districts in suburban Cook
County w ill opt out.
Commissioner Goslin shares many of the concerns raised by Commissioner Schumann. He expressed
concern regarding raising expectations of residents of suburban Cook County. A Ithough there is
gentrification in the City of Chicago, the suburbs have also seen huge increases in the value of their
homes and property. He estimates that a majori ty of the property owners in hi s district will not qualify
for this exemption.
Commissioner Collins asked for an explanation of the opt out provi sion and who it applies to.
Ms. Berman explained that a tax bill is made up of a number of different taxing districts. If a taxing
district opts out, the taxes are calculated with the fu ll value of all properties in that taxing district, and
there is no effect from the ordinance for that particular taxing district. Ms. Berman explained for the
othe r taxing districts that are not opting out, all of their tax rates will be calculated in a way that does
implicate a shift.
Chairman Daley asked Ms. Berman if the shift she referenced indicates an increase.
Ms. Berman replied yes, that shift will be an increase to the tax rate w hich would then affect all of the
taxpayers in one way or another.
Comm issioner Collins referenced as an example, the Village of Oak Park, wherein there is a Village
government and a Township government. She asked if the Village government chose to opt out and the
Township government chose not to opt out, what would happen.

1986

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Ms. Berman responded that Illinoi s Statute refers to municipalities only, therefore, it does not include
townships.
Chainnan Daley asked Michael Prinzi, Assistant State' s Attorney, to identify the eligible and ineligible
taxing districts.
ASA Prinzi stated the opt out provisions are as follows: the City of Chicago and the Chicago Board of
Education may not opt out; the only entities that may opt out are municipalities and school districts in
suburban Cook County; every other taxing district must remain in. ASA Prinzi concluded by stating that
the County Clerk's office can provide a more accurate explanation as to the effect of each district opting
in and out because it does have an effect on the tax rates.
Commissioner Collins asked if a taxing district chooses to opt out, how will the taxpayers m the
municipality be impacted.
Bill Vaselopulos, Manager, Tax Extension Division for the County Clerk's Office, responded only the
municipality and the school district can opt out. Mr. Vaselopulos stated if a taxing district, for example a
school district, chooses to opt out, they would not participate in providing a break to the taxpayers that are
eligible within their district. The school district would not allow that the equalized assessed valuation be
reduced for those properties. Consequently, the tax rates for those districts that chose to opt out would
remain low. The other districts which don' t have a choice and could not opt out, and any reduction that
occurred due to the exemption, their equalized assessed valuation would be reduced and the rates would
go up a little for those other taxing districts that cannot opt out.
Commissioner Maldonado stated the estimated shift to the City of Chicago is approximately fifteen
dollars a year for an average home with a $150,000 market value.
Chairman Daley stated that the concern that has been raised is with suburban Cook County, which will
not be affected until years 2002 and 2003 respectively .
Commissioner Silvestri commented that suburban Cook County has a variety and diversity of
municipalities, school di stricts, and that many times the school districts cross municipal lines. lf the
elementary and high school districts within a municipality choose to opt out, does that affect taxpayers in
the South or North triennial reassessment district?
Mr. Vaselopulos replied the only effect is to the taxpayers within that school district, within that
municipality. It does not affect taxpayers outside of the boundaries of the districts that are choosing to
opt out.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ASA Prinzi to provide him with the legislative history on this statute.
ASA Prinzi stated the statute originally passed in 1993, and has undergone a series of amendments. The
statute relating to the non-opt-out provisions for the City of Chicago and the Chicago Board of Education
passed in 1998. As a matter of general principal statewide, the sponsors of the statute wanted to have local
taxing districts, particularly municipalities and school boards, to be able to control their expenditures. One
factor of the expenditure is the cost of the exemption. In the case of the City of Chicago, the sponsors
wanted to have the two largest taxing bodies within that ambit to be involved. If the City of Chicago and the
Chicago Board of Education could opt out there would be no effect to the statute.

1987

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I
Commissioner Silvestri asked Veronica Lynch for historical data in suburban communities that have
traditionally gone up more than one hundred and fifty percent from the last assessment, to include: how
many people in the South and North districts increased their assessment, according to the provision of this
ordinance; the number of properties in each taxing district (i.e., Chicago, North and South); and how
many of those market values were in excess of the ordinance requirements (e.g., the assessed value of
$300,000 or more).
Ms. Lynch replied that from the past assessment, the information could be provided. However, whether
or not a property owner would meet the $300,000 market value cap, or the ten-year qualification would be
difficult as the reassessment is not yet complete. All of the information the Assessor's office will provide
for the North and South Triennial reassessment districts would be based on the previous assessment.
Commissioner Sutker asked ASA Prinzi if the statute provides a procedure, via a referendum, action of
the school board, or vote by City Council or Village Board, for the municipalities and school boards to
exercise the option to opt out.
ASA Prinzi responded the statute itself is silent.
Commissioner Sutker stated that there could be hundreds of referenda if municipalities or school districts
decide to proceed in this manner. Commissioner Sutker supports the ordinance for the City of Chicago,
but has concerns as it relates to the suburban areas since there are so many imponderables.
Commissioner Silvestri does not believe that the Legislature would intend that there would be a
referendum unless they stated that in the statute.
Commissioner Sutker clarified that his concern is what the impact of the statute is upon the Village or the
municipality.
Chairman Daley recognized Commissioner Collins who asked to explain the intent of the legislation with
respect to the units of government that were allowed to opt out.
Commissioner Collins stated that the taxing district that is allowed to opt out could do so by the
governing body of that entity, not a referendum.
Commissioner Sutker stated the statute does not indicate that, which means it has been left open to
interpretation.
ASA Prinzi also noted that the statute does not state what was expressed by Commissioner Collins,
therefore there is no guidance whatsoever.
Commissioner Schumann believes that every municipality and school district in the suburbs will opt out
because they are given that option. Therefore, what happens if every municipality and school district opts
out? Who will be affected?
Ms. Berman responded that the only thing that the municipality or school district can effect is the
particular line item on the tax bill that represents their own taxing district. Therefore, if the municipality
and the school district opted out for the particular items on the tax bill that relate to those opting out
districts, the taxes would be calculated based on the full equalized value of the property. She continued
by stating for the other taxing districts that are not able to opt out, the taxes would be calculated based on
the equalized assessed value less the exemption, assuming the person were entitled to the exemption.

1988

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I
Commissioner Schumann commented approximately eighty percent of the tax bill is the municipality's
and the school district's. Therefore, the remainder left over is the only portion of the tax bill that can be
affected by taxing agencies who may not opt out.
Commissioner Sutker asked what the statute provides for regarding when and how often a taxing district
needs to declare their desire to opt out.
ASA Prinzi stated the statute is unclear, however, he has had an opportunity to talk to representatives
from the County Clerk' s Office, who would have the effect of carrying this forward. His interpretation is
that the districts who want to participate or not participate in the opt out would have to notify the County
Clerk' s office on an annual basis.
Comm issioner Sutker again expressed his support for the ordinance as it relates to the City of Chicago,
but maintains hi s reservations regarding s uburban Cook County.
Chairman Daley reiterated the concerns raised by various members that at the present time there is not
enough information for the suburban districts to ascertain what the shift will be on the opt out provision.
Commissioner Maldonado asked Mr. Vaselopulos to explain the exemption if a municipality chooses to
opt out.
Mr. Vaselopulos responded that the exemption would be less only because the municipality or the school
district opting out would not allow the reduction to be applied to their portion of the tax bill. That taxing
district that is opting out is not shifting anything because they are not asking for a reduction which then
could result in the shift to other taxpayers. Therefore, the equalized assessed valuation would stay the
same for those districts that are not opting out. For those taxing districts that are not opting out, a lower
equalized assessed valuation will be utilized for their calculations.
With respect to shifting the tax burden, Commissioner Goslin stated that if this ordinance is approved,
what will be done in the second or third year is unclear. What is known is that by passing this ordinance
taxes have been shifted to the suburban areas from those forty-one or forty-two thousand properties in the
City that qualify. He inquired as to when the information will be available regarding how many
properties will be affected in the North and South districts. If this information were available now, it
would be helpful in voting for this measure today.
Commissioner Sutker asked ASA Prinzi if the statute allows for a series of ordinances so that the County
can vote on one assessment district now and not vote on the other two assessment districts until the
information is available.
ASA Prinzi responded that the statute is silent. He continued by stating that the statute contemplates
statewide application. There is only one County that falls into the type of classification and districting
that we have here. The statute really speaks to the selection of discrete areas that may be available to
have this relief. Yet there is no prohibition to making it countywide. He stated the statute didn 't
contemplate putting it through in a sequence, even though the Board can do it by ordinance.
Commissioner Sutker asked ASA Prinzi for advice as to whether the Board should pass the ordinance to
include only the City of Chicago at this time, based on the fact that there is insufficient infonnation on the
North and South assessment districts.

1989

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
ASA Prinzi responded as a practical matter, it seems as though one unified ordinance, which would come
into effect as each triennial district was reassessed, would be the most efficient way to go and it would
have unifo rm application throughout the County. If the ordinance is piecemealed, that dis-uniformity
may give rise to another issue to attack the ordinance.
Commissioner S utker expressed his support for the substitute ordinance with the understanding that this
Board w ill seek an amendment in November of this year when the additional information is available fo r
the next assessment district, which is the North.
Comm issioner Lechowicz asked ASA Prinzi who the sponsors of the Bill were in 1993 and 1998, and
what was the intent of the legislation that was adopted in 1993 and 1998.
ASA Prinzi responded that he was not certain who the specific sponsors were. With respect to the intent
of the legislation, he believes the policy is fairly c lear. The policy is fairly stated in the preamble that
there was recognition by the Genera l Assembly that rapid ly increasing or skyrocketing property values, to
use the ir phrase, attributable to gentrification type issues - things that caught longtime property owners in
sort of an avalanche of increasing values that they could not keep up with, in terms of their tax bills,
needed to be addressed. The statute permitted Counties to look at those areas within their County that
may need this kind of relief from those rapidly appreciating values and allow them to pass an ordinance
that would allow them a deferral or exemption of the properties. As the Bill went along historically, at
some point it was determined that it was critical to make s ure the C ity of Chicago and the Board of
Educati on were involved without any option of opting out. That was the last major or substantive
amendment to the statute, which he believes occurred in 1998.
Commissioner Lechowicz clarified that this is the on ly provision of the statute that only affects Cook
County, as it relates to the C ity of C hicago. A II of the other Counties throughout the State who may be
participating in this program do not have that restriction. Commissioner Lechowicz also stated that once
the updated figures are received from the Assessor' s Office, the ordinance could be amended, as
s uggested by Commissioner Sutker. This w ill a lso take into consideration the concerns ra ised by
Comm issioners Schumann and Goslin.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked ASA Prinzi, in his opinion, if this ordinance could withstand a Court
challenge?
ASA Prinzi responded that this is highly challengeable.
Commissioner Silvestri asked ASA Prinzi if in his review of the legislative intent and process, did the
C hicago Board of Education and the C ity of C hicago take a position at the ti me of the enactment of the
statute or its amendment?
ASA Prinzi responded that he did not recall seeing anything in writing.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that thi s ordinance initially applies to the City of Chicago, and it
would be unfai r to pass something for one jurisdiction in our County w ithout knowing what that local
jurisdi ction 's opinion is.
Comm issioner Silvestri believes that there were very few areas of suburban Cook County in which the
assessment level increased one hundred and fifty percent.

1990

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Ms. Lynch clarified that the issue of whether or not the house was reassessed one hundred and fifty
percent or greater is not what qualifies a home for this program. It is one and a half times whatever the
average increase is.
Commissioner Silvestri commented that the frequency of that occurring in the s uburban taxing districts is
less than in the City of Chicago because of gentrification in neighborhoods s uch as Bucktown and Wicker
Park.
Ms. Lynch commented that each district will establish its own average. Therefore, the average in the City
of Chicago will be different than the average in the North district.
Commissioner Maldonado referenced figures provided by the Assessor' s Office. The Assessor' s Office
estimated for the year 2000 in the City of Chicago, before caps and new construction, approximately
82,000 potential longtime homeowners would be eligible for the exemption. After the caps were
included, for the City of Chicago, the number has dropped to 42,000. Based on the 1998 triennial
assessment for the North district, the average increase back then was 7.3%. Thus, one and one halftimes
of 7.3% would be an approximate 13% increase. Therefore, any longtime homeowner with an assessment
exceeding that thirteen percent increase, more or less, would have been eligible for the exemption. For
the South district, based on the 1999 triennial reassessment, 64,000 homes would have been eligible for
the exemption.
The Committee commenced consideration of the amendments:

AMENDMENT #1
Sponsor:

Commissioner Mike Quigley

Co-Sponsor:

Commissioner Earlean Collins

Explanation (purpose) of Amendment:
THE SURVIVING SPOUSE AMENDMENT, amends the Cook County Longtime Homeowner
Exemption Ordinance. This amendment will allow an inheriting spouse to potentially qualify for the
H.E.L.P. exemption when his/her spouse passes away, even if the surviving spouse was never listed as an
owner of the property. With this amendment, when a spouse listed as an owner of record passes away
and leaves the property to the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse may "tack on" the deceased spouse's
ownership time in order to qualify for the exemption, provided the remaining criteria are also met.

Amends:

Section 3 - Definitions.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS. As used in this Ordinance:
"Assessment District." Cook County has a triennial reassessment cycle wherein one of the three di stricts
within the county is reassessed each year. The three assessment districts are defined in the Illinois
Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/9-220(8)).

"AV."

Assessed Value as defined in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification
Ordinance (Section 2, Class 2 and Section 3, Class 2).

1991

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I
"Average Assessment .Increase." A percentage calculated by taking the value of all potentially
qualifying Class 2 properties within the assessment district and determining the percent difference
between the current reassessment value and the prior year's assessment value.
"EAV." Equalized Assessed Value. The assessed value multiplied by the equalization factor calculated
by the Illinois Department of Revenue.
"H.E.L.P." Homeowner Exemption for Long-term Properties calculated as follows: that portion of
the current EA V for an eligible property which exceeds the sum of: (1) the EA V for the year prior to
reassessment; plus (2) the prior year EAV multiplied by a factor equal to 150% of the average assessment
increase for the most current reassessment of the assessment district.
"Class 2 Properties." Residential properties as defined in the Cook County Real Property Assessment
Classification Ordinance (Section 2, Class 2).
"Longtime Homeowners." Persons who have owned and occupied a Cook County Class 2 property for
ten years or more as their principal residence, or five years or more ifthe owner received assistance in the
acquisition of the property as part of a government or non-profit housing program. "Longtime
homeowners" also means persons who inherited the property from a spouse who owned and occupied a
Class 2 property for ten years or more as their principal residence or five years or more if the owner
received assistance in purchasing the residence from a governmental or non-profit housing program.
"Triennial Reassessment." Any reassessment of an assessment district, which occurs every third year as
set forth in the Illinois Property Tax Code (35 JLCS 200/9-220(8)).
Leave was granted to add Commissioner Collins as a co-sponsor.
Chairman Daley recognized Commissioner Quigley to provide a summary of the amendment.
Comm issioner Quigley stated this amendment, otherwise known as the surviving spouse amendment,
takes into consideration a surviving spouse who was never listed as the owner of the property. The
widow or widower would not fall under the protection of this ordinance without the passage of this
amendment. The amendment basically allows this person to be listed as the owner of record. If the
owner of record passes away and leaves the property to the surviving spouse, the surviving spouse may
tack on the deceased spouse's ownership time in order to qualify for the exemption, which has a ten-year
requirement.
Commissioner Lechowicz expressed support for this amendment, however he asked if there would be a
problem in the administration of this amendment. Currently the Recorder of Deeds office maintains the
records with respect to the title for the property. The Treasurer's office is provided information as it
relates to the tax bill itself. Commissioner Lechowicz asked if any of the offices involved would have
any problem administering the provisions contained in this amendment.
Jim Crawley, representing the Treasurer' s Office, responded that the Treasurer' s office would not be the
office responsible for providing the information to the Assessor. Mr. Crawley explained that the forms
are sent from the Recorder of Deeds office to the Assessor's office, then to the Illinois Department of
Revenue.
Ms. Lynch responded that the Assessor's office would not have any problem administering the provisions
of this amendment.

1992

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Commissioner Silvestri concurs with the amendment, but asked if there is a requirement that the couple
be married for a certain period of time.
Commissioner Quigley responded that the amendment only requires that they be married. He believes
that was the legislative intent.
Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Lechowicz, moved approval of Amendment #1.
The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Daley proceeded with Amendment #2.
AMENDMENT #2
Sponsor:

Commissioner Mike Quigley

Co-Sponsor:

Commissioner Earlean Collins

Explanation (purpose) of Amendment:
This amendment incorporates a means test into the Proposed Ordinance. The legislative history of the
enabling statute indicates that the statute was designed to provide property tax relief for longtime low and
middle-income residents of Cook County. This means test amendment will allow the Ordinance to
comport with legislative intent and provide relief for those longtime residents who need it most. The
amendment will limit eligibility to those whose household income does not exceed 115% of the Chicago
Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area median income as defined by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development. For FY 2001, this would limit eligibility for a one-person household
to an annual income of $56,000 or less. A four-person household would qualify with an annual
household income of $81 ,075 or less.
Amends:

Section 5 - Eligibility Criteria

SECTION 5. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
The following nonexclusive criteria shall be used to verify a longtime homeowner's eligibility for the
H.E.L.P. program on an annual basis:
( 1)

Homeowner is an owner-occupant of a Cook County Class 2 property, and that property has
been the homeowner's principal residence for at least ten consecutive years as of January I
of the reassessment year. A homeowner may become eligible for an exemption in a year
subsequent to the reassessment if a ten year consecutive residency has been established by
January 1 of that year; or

(2)

Homeowner is an owner-occupant of a Cook County Class 2 property, and that property has
been the homeowner's principal residence for at least five consecutive years if the
homeowner received assistance in the acquisition of the property as part of a government or
nonprofit housing program under the following guidelines:
(a)

The program is restricted to qualified homebuyers on the basis of the household
income of the homebuyer; and

1993

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
(b)

The income restriction for the home buyer did not exceed 120% of the area median
income as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

(c)

The subsidy exceeds $5,000 or 5% of the development cost of the property, whichever
is greater; and

(d)

The homebuyer is restricted from selling the house at full market price for at least five
years from the date of purchase.

The Cook County Board shall determine whether a purchase assistance program is qualified
under the provisions of this Ordinance; and
(3)

Homeowner' s property must have an AV increase that exceeds 150% of the current average
AV increase for Class 2 properties in the assessment district where the property is located;
and

(4)

HomeowAer' s property earmot ha't'e a market vah,1e used for assessmeAt purposes that
e>rneeds $300,000 iA the eurrent reassessment )'ear Homeowner's annual household income
for the year of the homeowner's triennial assessment does not exceed one hundred and
fifteen percent ( 115%) of the Chicago Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area median income
as defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

(5)

For any triennial assessment cycle, homeowner did not cause a substantial improvement
which resulted in an increase in fair cash value in the property in excess of the $45,000
allowance as set forth in the Illinois Property Tax Code (35 ILCS 200/15-180).

Leave was granted to add Commissioner Collins as a co-sponsor.
Chairman Daley recognized Commissioner Quigley to provide a summary of the amendment.
Commissioner Quigley stated this ordinance is an attempt to deal with an inequity in a system that is
basically inequitable when considering one's ability to pay. Commissioner Quigley referenced criteria in
the statute such as, the County may impose such qualifying criteria as age and income. However, the
statute does not address how expensive the property is, in terms of putting limitations on participation in
the program. It addresses factors such as the ten-year requirement, the property is owner-occupied, and
how big the building is. The statute is targeting lower and middle class people who, through no fault of
their own, are put in a position where they can' t afford to live in their own neighborhoods. They are
forced to sell their property at an expense. While they enjoy that capital gain, through our taxing policies
we have further changed the scope and the nature of that neighborhood and exacerbated an inequitable
program. Therefore, it makes sense to make income one of the qualifying criteria. The statute references
areas that are rapidly experiencing gentrification, however including a cap of $300,000 would decrease
the number of those eligible even though their assessments have increased so much. A means test is used
with other property tax programs, such as CHAPS.
Commissioner Quigley continued by stating that this amendment creates a means test. The numbers used
are the 2001 HUD income guidelines based on the Chicago Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area. The
figures were derived from these tables based on the household size and family income. Therefore it
would not be necessary to pass legislation every year depending on what the cost of living is.
Commissioner Quigley encourages passage of this amendment as a reasonable way to accomplish and
fulfill the spirit and purpose of this statute as it applies to the people of Cook County.

1994

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
C hairman Daley asked the representatives from the offices who will administer this to address any
concerns they have. Chairman Daley called upon Veronica Ly nch, Chief Deputy Assessor, to address the
committee.
Ms. Lynch clarified that the Assessor's Office does not administer the CHAPS program. The City of
C hicago administers the CHAPS program. The Assessor's Office provides the C ity of Chicago with
information regarding their program. The C ity of Chicago reviews all of the income statements and they
review and establish who qualifies for that program. Ms. Lynch a lso believes they use the Chicago
stati stica l survey data. She explained that what Commissioner Quigley referred to is a nine-county
statistical income level.
With respect to Amendment #2, Ms. Ly nch stated that the Assessor's Office would have diffic ulty
monitoring, reviewing and qualifying people under a means test because it would require additional
personnel. The Assessor's Office has a division that administers the senior freeze, and there is an income
means test associated with that. The Department of Revenue is required to audit the information provided
to our office in order to ensure the accuracy of the income data.
Ms. Ly nch stated there are administrative issues with a means test that is placed on the Assessor's Office,
which would cause some administrative burden in order to implement it. However, she noted that the
Assessor's Office will work within whatever the Board would want to do. Ms. Lynch commented that
another concern is that the Assessor' s Office would not be able to determine who would qualify for this
program based on a means test. The Assessor' s office would only be able to verify the assessed value of
the home and how long someone lived in a home . Whether or not anyone lived in a home at a certain
income cap becomes more difficult for the Assessor to verify.
Chairman Daley called upon Cathy Maras O' Leary, Chief Information Officer, Bureau of Information
Technology and Automation.
Mrs. O'Leary indicated that most of the burden would be on the Assessor to determine the income data
through an affidavit of some type. Administratively, if the decision is to send out a card validating their
income level, her office would process the data. Mrs. O ' Leary concluded by stating that there would be
no burden on the Department for Management oflnformation Systems (MIS) at all.
Chairman Daley asked Mrs. O' Leary, for clarification purposes, would MIS have a burden implementing
this?
Mrs. O' Leary responded that MIS would not have any burden, the burden administratively is on the
Assessor.
Chairman Da ley called upon Fredda Berman, Director of Real Estate and Tax Services for the County
C lerk's Office.
Ms. Berman responded that the burden is on the Assessor's Office, not the County Clerk' s Office. The
County C lerk's office would process those people identified by the Assessor as being eligible.
C hairman Daley called upon Assistant State's Attorney, Michael Prinzi.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked ASA Prinzi to review and comment on, in particular, section five and
items one throug h two ( d) of Amendment #2.

1995

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 I
ASA Prinzi commented that the language in the substitute ordinance or in Amendment #2 could be
passed and would pass muster. The underlying statute clearly provides for income criteria if the Board
chooses to use it. The Board could even eliminate this criteria if you did not want to use it. ASA Prinzi
stated that Commissioner Quigley suggests a specific way to determine an income value, and then base
eligibility on that. Whereas, Commissioner Maldonado suggests a cutoff based on property value, in
which you infer a person's ability to pay. Either criteria involves the ability to pay. Therefore, from a
legal perspective either proposal would stand.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked for an explanation of section 5 (2) (b), wherein the homebuyer is
restricted from selling the house at full market price for at least five years from the date of purchase.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked if this is considered a restriction?
Comm issioner Maldonado responded that this is a way to clarify a definition for those longtime
homeowners as defined by statute, who bought their homes through a government subsidy or not-forprofit subsidy program.
Commissioner Lechowicz asked Veronica Lynch to again address the issue of administering this
amendment.
Ms. Lynch reiterated that it would be very difficult for the Assessor's Office to administer this
amendment.
Commissioner Lechowicz believes it will be difficult initially to get the ordinance in operation and
perform the necessary administrative functions in order to determine the eligible homes. He recognizes
the time and effort that was spent by Commissioner Maldonado, Commissioner Daley and the
administration on this proposed ordinance. Commissioner Lechowicz commented that this means test
could be construed as a litmus test on this ordinance and potentially jeopardizes the ordinance itself.
Commissioner Schumann commented that there is a lot of speculation with this ordinance on what the
intent of the Legislature was, who is going to be affected, how the suburbs fare versus the City. This
amendment applies to those individuals on a fixed or low income in the suburbs and the City of Chicago,
and makes them eligible for the exemption.
Commissioner Steele commended Commissioner Maldonado for his vision and leadership. However, this
ordinance may not really reach the people that it is intended to reach. Commissioner Steele expressed her
support for the use of the income criteria versus the property value.
Comm issioner Goslin expressed his support of this amendment. He noted that both he and Commissioner
Quigley have remarkably similar districts demographically speaking. In his district, the rise in property
values has been astronomical, however income levels have not risen anywhere near that to support the
cost of paying the taxes on those homes. Commissioner Goslin asked ASA Prinzi if he believes this
amendment adds to the "challengeability" of the ord inance?
ASA Prinzi does not believe that Amendment #2 adds to the " challengeability" of the ordinance. He
stated this is a lesser problem .
Commissioner Sutker stated he appreciates all of the work that has gone into this ordinance and all of the
time and effort, especially by Commissioner Maldonado. During previous testimony, a means test was
alluded to by various speakers. However, because there is so much uncertainty, and there may well be
litigation with respect to this ordinance, certainly as it concerns the school board and municipalities of
this County, it is important to include a means test. Commissioner Sutker stated that real estate taxes are

1996

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
a regressive tax. The ability to pay is a critical factor. Those who are able to pay should be paying the
full amount of the real estate tax that their property requires. This amendment adds credibility to the
entire ordinance. Commissioner Sutker concluded by stating this ordinance will need to be readdressed
when the next assessment infonnation is made available in November.
Commissioner Butler asked which pat1 of the ordinance is countywide?
Chairman Daley responded that ASA Prinzi previously stated that the ordinance is countywide.
Commissioner Silvestri reiterated his concern regarding the absence of the City of Chicago's position on
this proposed ordinance. Commissioner Silvestri expressed his support of this amendment because it is a
fairer system which protects those that need the protection. The provision of a means test as reflected in
this amendment makes this an even better ordinance.
Commissioner Moreno agrees with Commissioner Quigley' s comments that property tax reform needs to
be implemented. This amendment captures the population that was targeted for assistance. This
ordinance plants the seeds for more activity on property tax reform. The manner is which schools are
funded by the property tax base in the neighborhoods, has to come to an end.
Chairman Daley recognized Veronica Lynch, Chief Deputy Assessor.
Ms. Lynch clarified that in its first year of implementation as it relates to the City of Chicago, the
Assessor' s office would not be able to verify any income. In fact, it is very difficult to verify the income
data provided for the senior freeze. The Department of Revenue has an audit function with res pect to the
senior freeze, therefore, the Assessor's Office would ask for the Board to consider some sort of audit
function. The Assessor's Office does not have the ability or the information to verify whether someone
does, in fact, have two incomes, three incomes, or if they make more than the statistical averages. In
conclusion, Ms. Lynch stated her concerns are directed around the verification and the qualification of
those people who would apply to be included as part of this amendment.
Commissioner Silvestri asked Ms. Lynch how does that differ from the verification of someone applying
for a homeowner exemption or senior exemption, or anything else?
Ms. Ly nch responded that the homeowner exemption does not have a means test.
In response to Commissioner Silvestri's question regarding how a homeowner exemption card is verified,
Ms. Lynch noted State law requires that someone other than the Assessor perform an audit. The
Assessor's office tries to eliminate those homeowners who may receive multiple cards.
Chairman Daley entered a letter from the City of Chicago in reference to the ordinance into the record.
(The referenced document is on file in the County Clerk's Office.)
Commissioner Maldonado indicated that during the course of several meetings with the working groups,
the Assessor's Office, the County Clerk's Office, the President' s office and his office, the means testing
concept was discussed at length. Because of the time frame to implement the ordinance for the second
installment of this year for the assessment district of the City of Chicago, the concept of a property value
cap was addressed. Commissioner Maldonado expressed his support for the passage of the substitute
ordinance including Amendment# I. However it is likely this ordinance will be revisited in November to
address the suburban areas, and at that time, the issue of means testing could be addressed.

1997

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 2001
Chairman Daley stated he will be supporting this amendment because the means test is a good tool to
ensure that assistance is targeted to those who need it most. Regardless of what the Board does, and
based on testimony heard in the past weeks, the main problem is people are unable to pay their taxes.

Commissioner Quigley, seconded by Commissioner Schumann, moved approval of Amendment #2.
The motion carried unanimously.
Chairman Daley proceeded with discussion on the substitute ordinance.
Commissioner Butler commented that he thinks the senior citizens in his area will believe this ordinance
will save their homes, however, he doesn't believe there is enough money in it to do that. Based on the
numbers provided, forty percent may save fifteen dollars, and seventy-five percent may save one
thousand five hundred. By the time you get to that level the house is already too expensive for you to live
in if you are on a fi xed income and that is not going to change.
Commissioner Silvestri referenced the provision in the eligibility criteria, section five, paragraph five,
with respect to the substantial improvements under $45,000. He asked Veronica Lynch if this provision
applies in everyone's reassessment cycle?
Ms. Lynch replied yes.
Commissioner Silvestri further inquired if substantial improvements are made and are less than $45,000,
that does not affect the reassessment?
Ms. Ly nch responded in the affirmative.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if a person is eligible for this exemption and does improvements on their
property in excess of$45,000, does that affect the assessed value of that home?
Ms. Lynch responded that it does affect the assessed value of the home, but there is a four to six year
period before that assessment increase would kick in, based on the time you were issued the permit.
Commissioner Silvestri stated if a person meets all of the other criteria and improves the property in
excess of $45,000, they are not going to get the exemption, however, if it is below $45,000 they will.
Commissioner Silvestri asked if this provision provides greater control on the accuracy of the ordinance.
Ms. Lynch responded that there is a greater degree of control with this provision.
In response to Commissioner Collins' s question regarding the need for the new construction provision,
ASA Prinzi stated that section five is a disqualifier. ASA Prinzi stated the $45,000 allowance is
referenced in the property tax code. For purposes of this ordinance, it just delineates that number and it
refers back to the statute, if you can make substantial improvements to your property you can probably
afford to pay the taxes. If someone makes a $30,000 improvement to their home, that assessed value
(AV), or that market value translated to AV is not added to the value for tax purposes.
Chairman Daley thanked all of the members and Commissioner Maldonado for their hard work and
leadership on this issue. Chairman Daley agreed with Commissioner Butler's remark, and also shares
concern that many people are going to believe that this is property tax relief. Unfortunately, it is not;
however, it is the only thing we have been given by the General Assembly. He continued by stating he
believes many people will misunderstand the term "longtime homeowner," and they are not going to
benefit; however it is a beginning.

1998

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR JUNE 5, 200 l
Commissioner Maldonado stated the General Assembly has given us authority to provide some property
tax relief to longtime homeowners. We have developed this reputation in Cook County that we are a
County of neighborhoods. The people responsible for this reputation are those longtime homeowners.
People that stay in neighborhoods for a long time, those are the ones that really help to build viable, stable
communities. Those are the ones that reall y have earned the great reputation that we have developed
throughout the years of Cook County being a County of neighborhoods.

Commissioner Maldonado, seconded by Commissioner Butler, moved that the Cook County
Longtime Homeowner Exemption Ordinance (substituted Item 242044) be approved and adopted,
as amended. The motion carried.
Commissioner Moran voted present.

of Cook County the following:
TITLE OF ORDINANCE: (New) Longtime Homeowner Exemption Ordinance.
An Ordinance creating the Homeowner Exemption for Long-term Properties ("H.E.L.P.") Program to

dramatic rise in property taxes directly or indirectly attributable to gentrification. To be eligible, the
longtime homeowner must own and reside in a Cook County Class 2 property for a minimum of ten
years, or five years if the homeowner received assistance in the acquisition of the property as part of a
government or nonprofit housing program . The homeowner will be ineligible ifthe property has a market
value for assessment purposes exceeding $300,000 in the current reassessment year or substantial
improvement which resulted in an increase in fair cash value in excess of the $45,000 allowance as set
forth in the Illinois Property Tax Code. The Assessor shall verify potential eligible homeowners on an
annual basis and provide to the Cook County Clerk the information necessary to calculate the exemption
in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Ordinance. The Cook County Clerk shall then remove
the exempt value from the calculation of the property tax and the Cook County Treasurer shall state on
the tax bill the amount of tax saved by the exemption.
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Longtime
Homeowner Exemption Ordinance."
SECTION 2. PURPOSE. The intent of this Ordinance is to stabilize the effects of soaring property

"AV." Assessed Value as defined in the Cook County Real Property Assessment Classification
Ordinance (Section 2, Class 2 and Section 3, Class 2).
"Average Assessment Increase." A percentage calculated by taking the value of all potentially

by the Illinois Department of Revenue.
"H.E.L.P." Homeowner Exemption for Long-term Properties calculated as follows: that portion of
the current EA V for an eligible property which exceeds the sum of: (I) the EA V for the year prior to
