January 4, 2017
In addition to the benefits granted to members and spouses each month, the Secretary will also be
presenting, for informational purposes only, items of interest that may affect our members. Questions
regarding any member’s specific situation should be addressed directly to the Fund Office.
MONTHLY NEWS AND INFORMATION FROM THE FUND SECRETARY
The Fund is looking towards a challenging year in 2017. The Fund has concerns regarding Public Act 990506, which further delays actuarial funding until 2020. We recognize the significance of the City adopting an
industry acceptable funding mechanism; however, the actuarial required contribution funding methodology
will not be adopted for another 5 years, after being postponed again in 2016. The Board has real concern,
considering the funding status, if the Fund can maintain benefit payments given the funding schedule currently
in place.
3% COLA Implementation - The State Legislature passed SB440, allowing anyone born in the 11-year
period between 1955 through 1965, a 3% Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) starting at age 55, with no limit
to how much the COLA can grow. The Fund is not aware of any legislation that has been proposed by Local 2
to grant a 3% COLA for members born after 1966. Any member born after 1966 will only receive a 1.5%
COLA that won’t start until age 60 and is capped at 20 years. Regardless of when you were born, if you
started employment with the CFD after 2010 you are considered a Tier II member of the pension fund. Tier II
members, generally speaking, receive reduced benefits compared to Tier I members. Tier II COLAs are
calculated at the lesser of ½ the rate of inflation or 3%, whichever is less, but never less than zero.
The 3% COLA benefit in SB440 will be paid on the January benefit check; however at the December 2016
monthly Board meeting the Trustees requested further legal review of the legislative language. The issue is
determining if the Legislature intended to grant an initial 3% COLA increase to those that have already
received a 1.5% COLA increase back to the date they retired, or just going forward from the date SB440
became effective as a public act. The Board will apply the legislative change based on a thorough review of
the language and intent. It is my opinion, that this is what happens when all stakeholders are not included in
the discussions, and the crafting of pension changes occurs outside the agreed to bill process. As a reminder,
the Pension Board does not advocate the Legislature for more benefits or draft legislation, that is the function
of Local 2 or the City. The Pension Fund administers the Fund based on the laws the Legislature in
Springfield pass. Although the Board was against the COLA language found in SB440, because it provided an
unfunded benefit, and because what such a provision may do to the Fund’s long-term solvency, the Board
would not ignore the intentions of the Legislature.
Healthcare - Every member of the Pension Fund should be aware that the City is terminating health care
coverage for a large group of retirees effective January 2017. This is a good illustration that some benefits that
are viewed as guaranteed, are not - laws and City administrations change. While the courts have ruled
healthcare is not guaranteed in retirement, pension benefits remain solidly guaranteed by the State
Constitution. In response to the loss of City-paid health care insurance, Local 2 has sponsored a group plan
through Aetna and had asked the FABF to provide personal information to help them identify and sign up

 retirees that will lose their insurance. Local 2 was not aware that the FABF is legally obligated to protect
personal information and was not at liberty to share it with other parties. The City has also sponsored an
employee paid plan through BCBS. The Pension Fund was asked by both the City and Local 2 to help assist
communicating with and enrolling members. This falls outside the scope of what the FABF is legislatively
authorized to do; the pension fund administers pension payments, it is not a health and welfare
fund. Nevertheless, the FABF has sent out two separate letters addressing the health care changes to affected
members. Those letters have generated a large response from retirees. We directed retirees to contact Local 2,
BCBS or Aetna for specific information regarding their health care options. The Fund worked within the
constraints of the pension code, to help members navigate this very difficult transition. Additionally, in
December, Fund staff attempted to contact, by phone, any retiree that was losing their City paid health care
plan but had not notified the Fund that they had signed up for another plan. The Fund has taken the position
that any retiree that has lost their insurance benefit through the City, should be made aware of their
options. The Fund staff did a remarkable job of reaching out to retirees given the difficult circumstances
presented to them.
I hope you all had a Blessed Christmas and New Year,

Timothy McPhillips
Fund Secretary
