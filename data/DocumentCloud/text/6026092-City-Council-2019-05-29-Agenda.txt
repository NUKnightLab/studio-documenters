TRAFFIC WARNING SIGNS AND/OR SIGNALS:

West 52nd Street and South Kedzie Avenue; Two Way Stop Sign, Stopping North and
South bound traffic on South Kedzie Avenue, Not Recommended . South Kedzie
Avenue is a minor arterial roadway with significantly higher traffic volumes than W.
S2nd Street, a local roadway. Stop signs on streets with higher volumes such as S.
Kedzie Avenue tend to increase rear-end crashes, increase congestion, and create a
false sense of security for pedestrians that every vehicle will stop. Therefore, COOT
does not recommend an all-way stop at this intersection. -- (19-01069380)
