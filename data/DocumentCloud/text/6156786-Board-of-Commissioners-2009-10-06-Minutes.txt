 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
RECOGNIZING OCTOBER OF 2009
AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH IN COOK COUNTY
WHEREAS, one third of American women report being physically abused by a husband, boyfriend or
partner at some point in their lives; and
WHEREAS, the crime of domestic violence in one way or another affects every family in Cook County;
and
WHEREAS, this form of violence is not confined to any group or groups of people, but cuts across all
ages, as well as across economic, racial and societal barriers; and
WHEREAS, domestic violence is particularly devastating because it wears a familiar face – the face of a
spouse, a parent, or a partner; and
WHEREAS, societal indifference to domestic violence contributes to the endangerment of families in
Cook County; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government recognizes the importance of educating its own workforce on
domestic violence because domestic violence often does not stay at home, but rather follows its victims to
their place of employment; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the very human toll of domestic violence, there is a very real cost to
employers in Cook County in lost wages, chronic absenteeism, excessive use of sick time and increased
medical expenses; and
WHEREAS, Cook County government, through the work of the Cook County Commission on Women’s
Issues, the Cook County Bureau of Human Resources and the Cook County Employee Assistance
Program recognizes the need to heighten employee awareness of both the County’s Domestic and Sexual
Violence Workplace Policy as well as the County’s Violence in the Workplace Policy; and
WHEREAS, collaboratively, these Cook County departments and other partners will conduct training
and provide guidance for Cook County management and employees to help them to recognize the signs
and symptoms of violence, to learn appropriate responses and procedure, and to be knowledgeable about
available resources and referrals; and
WHEREAS, raising public awareness about domestic violence, the inter-generational cycle of violence,
and the needs of victims and survivors of domestic violence are crucial to the safety and well-being of the
residents of Cook County, our families and the communities in which we live; and
WHEREAS, the dedicated professionals in Cook County who work within victim-advocacy
organizations and shelters, within our medical, public health and mental health communities, and within
our criminal justice system merit recognition and encouragement for their exceptional efforts to reduce
domestic violence, treat victims and survivors, and punish perpetrators.

2956

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the month of October is recognized as Domestic
Violence Awareness Month in Cook County; all residents and employees of Cook County are urged to
observe this month by supporting those who are working toward its end, by becoming more aware of the
tragedy of domestic violence, by learning to recognize the signs and cycles of domestic violence, and by
learning to speak out and respond to violence in our homes and in our communities.
Approved and adopted this 6th day of October 2009.
TODD H. STROGER, President
Cook County Board of Commissioners
Attest: DAVID ORR, County Clerk

Mr. Daniel Degnan

Cook County Employees’ and
Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund
Dear Mr. Degnan:
In an effort to better assess Cook County’s pension liabilities and the solvency of
the Cook County Employees’ and Officers’ Annuity and Benefit Fund, the Cook
County Board of Commissioners requested that the Annuity and Benefit Fund
study the possibility of increasing pension contributions for new hires and how
such a requirement would effect the future of the Cook County Annuity and
Benefit Fund.
It is respectfully requested that you attend the October 6, 2009 Cook County
Board Meeting and make a brief presentation to the Board of Commissioners and
address any findings made by the Annuity and Benefit Fund regarding the Fund’s

Thank you in advance for your attendance.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
A RESOLUTION URGING THE ILLINOIS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO PASS
AND THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN, SENATE BILL 1868 CHANGING THE
VETO OVERRIDE REQUIREMENT OF THE COOK COUNTY BOARD FROM 4/5 TO 3/5
WHEREAS, a study of the Illinois Counties Code revealed that of the County Board Chief Executive
Officers in Illinois that have veto power, a 3/5 majority is required for an override with the exception of
one county; and
WHEREAS, veto override requirements of all of the municipal governments in Illinois, overriding an
executive veto requires not more than a 2/3 majority; and
WHEREAS, the override requirement for a veto of the Governor of Illinois is only 3/5; and
WHEREAS, the County of Cook is the only government in the State of Illinois with a veto override
requirement of 4/5 of the members of the legislative body; and
WHEREAS, this unprecedented veto power is inherently unfair to the citizens of Cook County who are
represented by the County Board; and
WHEREAS, on April 1, 2009, the Illinois Senate unanimously passed Senate Bill 1868 which seeks to
correct this unfair veto override requirement by amending the Counties Code to provide for the same 3/5
veto override requirement as is required in every other County with veto power.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Cook County Board of Commissioners that we urge
the Illinois House of Representatives to pass Senate Bill 1868 as currently engrossed, or any other
substantially similar legislation, and urge the Governor to sign it into law; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Cook County Clerk transmit copies of this Resolution to the
President and minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker and minority leader of the House of
Representatives and the Governor of the State of Illinois.
Approved and adopted this 6th day of October 2009.

Administrator, transmitting a Communication, dated August 21, 2009:
requesting authorization for the Purchasing Agent to increase by $5,042,594.85 and extend
for thirteen (13) months, Contract No. 08-41-321 with THE WACKENHUT
CORPORATION, Westchester, Illinois, for security services including: night watch,
escorted movement and control services, direct residential supervision, emergency staffing,
and timekeeping monitor functions on a 24 hours per day, 7 days per week basis.
Board approved amount 05-20-08:
Previous increase approved 11-19-08:
This increase requested:
Adjusted amount:
Reason:

$1,862,848.00
1,550,000.00
5,042,594.85
$8,455,442.85

Pursuant to Clause 5(f) of the agreed order appointing a Transitional
Administrator, 99 C 3945 Doe v. Cook County, the Office of the Transitional
Administrator, in its authority as established in the Court Order entered on
August 14, 2007, has selected The Wackenhut Corporation to provide security
services to ensure the safety and security of the Juvenile Temporary Detention
Center (JTDC) residents and staff members while the JTDC continues to
implement its hiring plan. The JTDC continues to experience unexpected
terminations, resignations, transfers and new eligibility requirements, causing
fluctuations in the needs for the JTDC staff coverage. The expiration date of the
current contract was May 31, 2009. The contract was extended on June 16, 2009
for the period beginning June 1, 2009 through August 31, 2009; however, the
contract was not extended due to a delay on the part of the vendor. We are
projecting the need for continued services provided by the Wackenhut
Corporation through June 30, 2010.

Estimated Fiscal Impact:
$5,042,594.85 (FY 2009:
$542,594.85; and FY 2010:
$4,500,000.00). Contract extension: June 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. (569-260
Account).
Approval of this item would commit Fiscal Year 2010 funds.
* Referred to the Committee on Finance on 09/16/09.
Chairman Daley stated Earl Dunlap, Transitional Administrator for the Juvenile Temporary
Detention Center has requested that the Finance Committee convene in Executive Session with
respect to Communication Number 302621.
Commissioner Peraica questioned the legality of convening in Executive Session without notice. Patrick
T. Driscoll, Jr., Deputy State’s Attorney, responded that the request for Executive Session does meet the
guidelines for the Open Meetings Act, inasmuch as Doe v. Cook County is pending litigation.

Chairman Daley entered into the record a facsimile entitled, “National Press Release”, dated October 5,

extension with Wackenhut Corporation at the September 16, 2009 Board meeting. The County Board
referred the matter to the Finance Committee at the last Board meeting. Furthermore, the statement that
the Finance Chairman has questioned Brenda Welch’s salary, is absolutely false. (Attachment A
submitted).

OFFICE OF ADOPTION AND CHILD CUSTODY ADVOCACY
TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 26, 2009 from
ANGELA M. BAILEY, Director, Office of Adoption and Child Custody Advocacy
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $1,600.00 from and to the
accounts listed below, for continued administrative operations as court ordered.

3054

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
Reason:

The Office of Adoption and Child Custody Advocacy has seen an increase in court orders to
conduct home investigations. Due to the increase, processing, postage and office supply funds
have been depleted. This transfer will allow for operations to continue as court ordered.

From Account:
451-186

$1,600.00

To Accounts:
451-225
451-350

1.

Postage
Office Supplies

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
It became apparent that Account 451-225 would require additional funds on June 5, 2009. The
balance of the account on that day and 30 days prior was $300.00. The account has a zero balance
currently.
It became apparent that Account 451-350 would require additional funds on August 15, 2009. The
balance of the account on that day was $154.00 and 30 days prior was $ 329.00.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Account 451-186 was identified as the source of transferred funds because of an unanticipated
surplus in the account. There were no other accounts considered.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 451-186.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
This account has a surplus because this office was anticipating hiring new staff. New staff
participate in various trainings which enhance their performance levels. Due to budget restrictions,
no new staff will be hired.
_________________________

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Steele, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.

February 20, 2007, the City amended its original agreement to provide for the implementation of Taleo’s
software services and to have Taleo provide hosting, and maintenance support services so that the City
would have an automated recruiting, hiring and onboarding system.
Due to Taleo’s familiarity and experience with providing automated hiring in both private and public
organizations as well as healthcare institutions and its successful relationship in implementing the City’s
automated hiring system, the Bureau of Human Resources hereby requests that the Purchasing Agent and
the Bureau of Human Resources be authorized to negotiate project definition services, implementation
services, system licenses, and the appropriate schedules of compensation to engage Taleo in the provision
and implementation of Taleo Software services as well as the hosting, maintenance and support services

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 1, 2009 from
TIMOTHY C. EVANS, Chief Judge, Circuit Court of Cook County
requesting approval by the Cook County Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $9,000.00,
from Account 326-260, Professional and Managerial Services, to Account 326-186, Training Programs
for Staff Personnel.
Reason:

These funds are necessary to provide training sessions for probation personnel who are
required to complete a minimum of twenty training hours per year to be in compliance with
Supreme Court standards. Our department has exhausted the 2009 appropriation. We plan
on providing training sessions on trauma, victimization, sex offenders and issues related to
mental health and addiction. Currently, approximately twenty percent (20%) of sworn
personnel have not met the minimum training requirements.

From Account 326-260

was the balance 30 days prior to that date?

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
a. The professional services account has a small surplus because a contract that was advertised
for Request for Proposal (RFP) came in slightly less than anticipated. RFP No. 08-50-2016P
b. The services for minors or indigents account was considered but related costs have not decreased
this year.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from professional services 326-260.
None.

4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
At the time of budget preparation for FY 2009, the contract for Juvenile Court Clinic Services was
scheduled to be advertised for RFP. The cost of the new contract in 2009 was then unknown. The
cost of the new contract for the remainder of FY 2009 is slightly less than was originally
anticipated.

Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Peraica, moved that the transfer of funds be approved.
The motion carried unanimously.

OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT
Transmitting a Communication, dated September 22, 2009 from
NANCY L. JONES, M.D., Chief Medical Examiner, Office of the Medical Examiner
requesting authorization for the Office of the Medical Examiner to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, to study the
potential influence of genetic polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene on asthma mortality and to determine
how race influences this association.
Reason:

This study is designed to measure the frequency of genetic polymorphisms in ADRB2 in
people that have had a fatal asthma exacerbation. Fatal asthma cases will be identified with
help from Medical Examiner office records as people who have asthma listed as the primary
cause of death on their death certificates. Non-identifiable information will be abstracted by
CDC investigators from death certificates and medical examiner records for each case. It is
expected that science and society in general will benefit if scientists are better able to
understand the causes of differences in asthma morbidity; this information may lead to
improved intervention and prevention strategies for asthma.

Estimated Fiscal Impact: None. Contract period: November 1, 2009 through October 31, 2010.

the account that funds are transferred from: 259-215, 259-237, 259-268, and 259-630.
There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc. in the 215-Scavenger Services Account that funds

Account that funds will be transferred from.

There will not be any delays, cancellations, etc. in the 630-Rental of Office Equipment Account
that funds will be transferred from.
4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
The amount of purchases from the 215-Scavenger Services Account fluctuates from year to year.
However, due to this surplus we have adjusted the FY2010 request to reflect this account's
decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 237-Services for Minors or the Indigent Account fluctuates from
year to year. The number of cases from day to day cannot be determined; therefore, we are unable
to estimate how many cases will require County burial after cases are sent to funeral homes or
Veterans' Affairs. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this
account's decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 268-Court Reporting, Stenographic, Transcribing, or Interpreter
Services Account fluctuates from year to year. Given that the volume of cases and the length of
these cases will change from year to year, it is difficult to determine how many cases and lines will
be used in a year's contract. For much of 2009, we were using moneys encumbered from a 2007
contract. Due to this surplus, we have adjusted our FY2010 request to reflect this account's
decreased spending.
The amount of purchases from the 630-Rental of Office Equipment Account fluctuates from year to

Cook County Department of Public Health Fall 2009 novel Influenza A (H1N1) Response
Submitting information and requesting Board approval of novel Influenza A (H1N1) Response
Activities in suburban Cook County.
The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH), in its role as the state certified local public
health department for most of suburban Cook County, is engaged in planning and response activities with
respect to the present novel Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. The Department is collaborating with other

Homeland Security and Emergency Management (CCDHS) and governmental partners throughout Cook
County.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in coordination with the Illinois
Department of Public Health (IDPH), is providing supplies of vaccine against novel Influenza A (H1N1)
to health providers and public health authorities beginning in October for administration beginning with
persons in identified priority groups for vaccination. These groups include children and young people
aged 6 months to 24 years, persons caring for infants under 6 months of age, pregnant women, persons
with certain health conditions placing them at higher risk for complications for H1N1 and healthcare
workers. In an effort to quickly disseminate the vaccine supplies to a large number of persons within the
targeted priority groups as quickly as possible, the CCDPH is coordinating with the CCDHS in carrying
out a multi-pronged vaccination strategy which includes:
•
•
•
•

•

Promotion of vaccination, particularly to priority groups, through media and partner outreach.
Promotion of vaccination capabilities of private providers.
Scheduling of school vaccination clinics directed by the CCDPH in cooperation with the CCDHS
and local government entities for children in grades pre-K through 8; expanding to high schools
as resources permit, in School Districts choosing to participate.
Provision of vaccine supplies and direction to nurse consultants serving licensed daycare centers
to vaccinate enrolled children whose parents request that they be vaccinated, at daycare centers
choosing to participate that are served by nurse consultants/nursing agencies choosing to
participate.
Regional vaccination clinics offered at identified sites operated by the CCHHS and the CCDPH
to offer vaccines to persons in the priority categories.

Changes or additions to these activities may be identified as the influenza season begins, to permit
flexibility based on factors such as the quantities of available vaccine supplies, the availability of
personnel including volunteers, and epidemiologic information.
In order to carry out these vaccination programs, the CCDPH has developed several agreements and will
continue to develop additional form and individual agreements to memorialize the details of program
implementation. To date, these include agreements with:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Licensed daycare centers and their nurse consultants/agencies wishing to collaborate with the
CCDPH to offer vaccination to their enrollees.
Schools and/or Districts wishing to offer vaccination to students enrolled in District Schools
through the CCDPH vaccination program.
Colleges offering educational programs in the health professions to assign students and faculty to
provide vaccinations as part of a supervised clinical training program.
Persons enrolling in the Cook County Medical Reserve Corps, a program of the CCDPH in
collaboration with the CCDHS.
Health providers employing groups of health professionals willing to assist in vaccinating
children in schools under the direction of the CCDPH.
Provider groups employing health professionals willing to assist in vaccinating children in
schools under the direction of the CCDPH.
Government partners employing nurses and EMTs willing to assist in vaccinating children in
schools under the direction of the CCDPH.
Government partners wishing to collaborate in the Medical Reserve Corps program.
Pharmacy firm(s) to support storage and release of vaccine to providers that have entered into the
state provider agreement for receipt of vaccine supplies.

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
In addition to the vaccination campaign, the CCDPH continues to be involved in epidemiologic
surveillance activities gathering information that is key to the development of public health
recommendations and in a public information campaign to educate the public about prevention messages,
including vaccination. In addition to vaccine, the CCDPH may be called upon to assist in the distribution
of federal supplies of antiviral medications and other supplies or equipment in coordination with the
IDPH to assist in responding to the H1N1 pandemic.
The Cook County Board of Health Ordinance provides authority for the Chief Operating Officer of the
Cook County Department of Public Health to enter into various types of programmatic agreements and to
engage in activities consistent with the above. This item is submitted to the Cook County Board of
Commissioners, in its dual capacity as the Cook County Board of Health, for its information.

the District by the County.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:
The foregoing recitals are incorporated herein as findings of the Board of Commissioners of Cook
County, Illinois.
a.
The Property Defined. The Lake Parcel and the Crawford Parcel are hereinafter referred to
collectively as the “Property.” The property on which the Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County and other
County-owned facilities are located, immediately west of the Lake Parcel, is referred to herein as the
“Oak Forest Hospital Campus”.
b.
Conveyance Authorized. The Board hereby determines that the conveyance of the Lake Parcel
and the Crawford Parcel to the District is in the public interest. The Board hereby authorizes the
conveyance of the Property to the District by quit claim deed, in consideration of a total purchase price of
$15,050,000.00 (the “Purchase Price”), for the public purposes of preserving the existing burial areas in
an appropriate manner and as required by applicable laws, protecting and preserving historic sites, and

3107

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
Joint Planning Effort. The Board hereby recognizes that the history of the Property’s use by the County
and the history embodied on the site require careful consideration and planning of future uses, and should
be appropriately preserved and commemorated in a manner conducive to education of the public, and that
such planning and preservation is the responsibility of both Cook County and of the District. The Board

historic preservation, investigations, environmental restoration, and planning for the District’s proposed
use of the Property and the impacts of such use on the Oak Forest Hospital Campus. Further, the Board

one-half the cost of such efforts, including the retention of consultants, planners and other experts, it
being understood that the District will likewise pay one-half the cost.

TRANSFER OF FUNDS
Transmitting a Communication, dated August 12, 2009 from
ANITA ALVAREZ, Cook County State's Attorney
by
RAYMOND BALCARCEL, Chief Financial Officer
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $275,000.00 from and to
the accounts listed below.
Reason:

Although every effort is made each year to accurately budget our non-personnel operating
accounts given the current fiscal constraints, many of these costs vary from year to year and
are difficult to predict. This reallocation of less than one half of one percent of our budget
should be sufficient for the remainder of the fiscal year.

1.

On what date did it become apparent that the receiving account would require an infusion of funds
in order to meet current obligations? What was the balance in the account on that date, and what
was the balance 30 days prior to that date?
240: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $7,040.00; the 6/30 balance was
$5,169.00 (the increased balance was due to a canceled purchase order). The transition to a new
administration required the printing of new letterhead, envelopes, business cards and other
materials, the costs of which were slightly underestimated.
268: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $74,619.00; the 6/30 balance was
$193,535.00. This account is used to pay for court transcripts provided by the Official Court
Reporters. After the submission of the budget, the statutory per page fees for these transcripts were
increased by approximately 25% for 2009.
440: This account currently has a negative balance. The 7/31 balance and the 6/30 balance were
both $59,236.00. After the budget was passed, it was determined that our two heavy duty copiers at
26th Street are not covered under the county wide maintenance agreements, resulting in the need
for this transfer.
441: This account is not currently in a negative balance, but after reviewing the July 31 balances it
was determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $38,316.00; the 6/30 balance
was $39,368.00. The maintenance and support contract for our Juvenile case management system,
payable prior to the end of the current fiscal year is for approximately $44,000.00.
660: This account is currently in a negative balance. After reviewing the July 31 balances it was
determined that a transfer was advisable. The 7/31 balance was $8,017.00; the 6/30 balance was
$13,497.00. On July 21, 2009 the Real Estate Management Division of the Department of Planning
and Development asked the Board of Commissioners to approve a one year extension, effective
September 1, of the lease for our warehouse space at 5410 West Roosevelt, since our intended
space at 23rd and Rockwell was not yet ready. This resulted in an additional obligation of three
months' rent which was not included in our original budget.

2.

How was the account used for the source of transferred funds identified? List any other accounts
that were also considered (but not used) as the source of the transferred funds.
Accounts 217, 225, 263, 445: After reviewing the July 31 balances, and projecting expenses
through the end of the fiscal year, we have identified these accounts as having sufficient surplus for
transfer.

3.

Identify any projects, purchases, programs, contracts, or other obligations that will be deferred,
delayed, or canceled as a result of the reduction in available spending authority that will result in
the account that funds are transferred from 250-217, 250-225, 250-263 and 250-445.
None.

3114

 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS FOR OCTOBER 6, 2009
4.

If the answer to the above question is “none” then please explain why this account was originally
budgeted in a manner that caused an unobligated surplus to develop at this point in the fiscal year.
217: This account is used for the travel expenses of witnesses brought in from out of town to
testify, and for the extradition of prisoners from other jurisdictions. Expenses this year have been
10% to 15% lower than originally anticipated, resulting in this surplus.
225: Despite the recent increase in postal rates, our total postage expenses have been slightly
lower than our original projections due to the increased use of electronic media.
263: This account provides for the hiring of outside counsel, primarily in civil cases where special
expertise is required or where potential conflicts of interest may exist. It is difficult to predict these
cases in advance, and 2009 costs have been slightly less than original estimates.
445: This account pays for gasoline. At the time the budget was prepared, prices were significantly
higher than current levels.

by
RAYMOND BALCARCEL, Chief Financial Officer
requesting approval by the Board of Commissioners to transfer funds totaling $75,000.00 from Account
562-814, Appropriation Adjustment to Account 562-579, Computer Equipment for the purchase of trial
technology and courtroom presentation equipment to be used in the felony trial courtrooms.
Reason:

The Bad Check Restitution Program was established by Illinois statute to divert from
prosecution individuals who write bad checks, with the condition that they make restitution
and complete an educational program. This program is funded by administrative fees paid by
the participants, with any additional revenues to be used in the enforcement and prosecution
of criminal laws. At the time the budget was established, we were still evaluating a number
of possible spending plans; the funding was placed in the Appropriations Adjustment
Account with the intention of later transferring the funds, with Board approval, as needed.
This transfer would allow previously unallocated funds to be used for the purchase of trial
technology and courtroom presentation equipment to be used in the felony trial courtrooms.
