GENERAL BACKGROUND
As part of the Capital Maintenance Program, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) solicited
bids for general contractors to perform capital maintenance work for Buildings 1, 2 and 5 at
Bridgeport Homes (IL2-004). The work is to be performed in the ten (10) units at the following
addresses: 841 W. 31st St., 845 W. 31st St., 851 W. 31st St., 853 W. 31st St., 857 W. 31st St., 3113

S. Green St.
The interior Scope of Work includes the creation of two (2) new ADA accessible units. For each
ADA unit, the bottom floors of two (2) side-by-side duplex row houses will be joined together
into a single street level unit. The upper levels of the row houses will also be joined together to
provide a single “flat-style” unit. All units will receive new kitchens, bathrooms and mechanical,
electrical and plumbing upgrades. In all of the units, the existing drywall will be patched and
painted and the light fixtures, tub surrounds, range hoods, and selected doors will be replaced.
On the outside, selected shrubbery will be removed or replaced and designated concrete landings
and patios will be replaced. Concrete walks and ramps will be installed and brick infill work
performed. In addition, selected windows, sills and doors will be upgraded.
PROCUREMENT HISTORY
The CHA advertised Invitation for Bid (IFB) No. 10 – 00602 on September 20, 2010 for capital
maintenance work needed in and around Buildings 1, 2 and 5 (Group 1) at Bridgeport Homes.
The IFB was advertised in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Defender, El Dia, on the CHA
website and on BuySpeed Online.
The Pre-bid meeting and Site Visit were held on September 24, 2010. The CHA issued
Addendum No. 1 on October 13, 2010. It changed the bid submittal date from October 14, 2010
to October 22, 2010. Addendum No. 2 was issued October 15, 2010 to answer Requests for
Information, to distribute a limited number of revised and new drawings and technical
specification sections, and to release updated BF pages.
The CHA received and opened four (4) bids on October 22, 2010. A fifth bid submittal was
delivered after the opening of the bids and was rejected as late.
After reviewing the bid submittal materials, the Department of Procurement and Contracts and
the Capital Construction Department held a pre-award survey meeting with Chicago Commercial
Contractors, LLC. the apparent low bidder. The firm’s representatives responded to questions on
the thoroughness of its bid, the amount of the work it planned to self-perform, and its capacity to
perform this work. The firm’s proposed project team was reviewed and its projection of a longer
lead-time for several materials was discussed. In addition, the Compliance Officer gave an
overview of new compliance procedures.
