DETROIT HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION
DRAFT RESOLUTION 19-03
By Commissioner ___________________________
A Resolution to Amend the Detroit Historic District Commission
Fence and Hedge Guidelines
WHEREAS The Commission has issued Fence and Hedge Guidelines for historically appropriate
fences and hedges under the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation
of Historic Properties, be it
RESOLVED The Commission amends those Guidelines as follows:
 Vinyl no longer is an allowable type of material for fences, for the reason that
vinyl fences do not sufficiently replicate the look of historic wood or iron
fences;
 Unfinished wood is not historically appropriate and fences must be painted or
stained;
 The Allowable Colors section shall be as follows:
The color of the fence should complement the colors of the house and
comply with the Detroit Historic Districts Style and Color Guide systems A
through F (as available from the Historic District Commission Staff).
