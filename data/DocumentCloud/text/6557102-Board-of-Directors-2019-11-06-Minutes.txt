 MINUTES OF THE DETROIT BROWNFIELD

DETROIT ECONOMIC GROWTH CORPORATION
500 GRISWOLD SUITE 2200 DETROIT, MI – 4:00 PM
CALL TO ORDER
Chair Matthew Walters called the meeting to order at 4:04 PM.
GENERAL
Approval of Minutes:
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the minutes of October 23, 2019 as presented. The Board took
the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Wilkins, seconded by Ms. Washington, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-02-266
was unanimously approved.
Acceptance of DBRA FY 2018-19 Audit
Ms. Kanalos presented the DBRA FY 2018-2019 Audit to the DBRA Board.
Copies of the DBRA Audited Financial Statements and Management Report as of June 30, 2019 were
distributed to each DBRA Board Member via email on October 30, 2019.
The attached resolution indicated the Board’s formal receipt of the DBRA Audited Financial Statements and
Management Report as of June 30, 2019, with comparative totals as of June 30, 2018, as prepared by
George Johnson and Company, Certified Public Accountants.
Ms. DeSantis asked why the audit did not state that internal controls were reviewed. Mr. Long stated that
because only a random selection of transactions were reviewed in the audit and not every single transaction
conducted by the DBRA in FY 2018-19, the auditor cannot definitively state that internal controls were
reviewed. An audit on all individual transactions performed by the DBRA would be a very expensive review.
Mr. Walters called for a motion accepting the DBRA FY 2018-19 Audit as presented. The Board took the
following action:
On a motion by Ms. Washington, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-01-216
was unanimously approved.
PROJECTS
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Exchange Transaction
Ms. Navin presented the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Exchange Transaction to the
DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, FCA US LLC (“FCA”), the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority
(“DBRA”) and the City of Detroit (the “City”) are parties to that certain development agreement (the

 “Development Agreement”) relating to the following investment proposed by FCA in the city of Detroit (the
“Project”):
•

•

Construct a new assembly plant at the site of its current Mack Engine Plant located at Mack and
St. Jean, with an estimated investment of $1.6 billion and creation of approximately 3,850 net new
full-time jobs; and
Invest approximately $900 million at its Jefferson North Assembly Plant, located at Jefferson and
St. Jean, creating approximately 1,100 net new full-time jobs.

In April and May, 2019, the DBRA Board and City Council approved several land transactions relating to
the Project, including but not limited to certain transactions with Hantz Farms LLC (“Hantz”) whereby the
City agreed to sell certain City-owned parcels to and Hantz agreed to transfer to DBRA certain parcels
needed for the Project.
It was recently discovered that certain of the City-owned parcels transferred to Hantz pursuant to the abovereferenced transactions are necessary for the Project. Similarly, certain parcels approved for transfer by
the City to DBRA for the Project are no longer needed for the Project. Therefore, DBRA staff recommends
the Board’s approval of an exchange of parcels as follows:
Parcels to be transferred to DBRA by Hantz for the Project:
11256 Mack, Detroit, MI 48214
11244 Mack, Detroit, MI 48214
11234 Mack, Detroit, MI 48214
Parcels to be transferred by DBRA to Hantz:
11200 Charlevoix, Detroit, MI 48214
2662 Beniteau, Detroit, MI 48214
11215 Kercheval, Detroit, MI 48214
2620 Beniteau, Detroit, MI 48214
11201 Kercheval, Detroit, MI 48214
2124 Beniteau, Detroit, MI 48214
11231 Kercheval, Detroit, MI 48214
A resolution was attached for the Board’s consideration.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into Exchange
Transaction, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Mr. Scott, seconded by Ms. Washington, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-262-31
was unanimously approved.
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Enter into a Letter of Intent, Development Agreement, and
Land Transfer Agreement with Northpoint Development LLC for Former Cadillac Stamping Plant
Ms. Belanger presented the Authorization to Enter into a Letter of Intent, Development Agreement, and
Land Transfer Agreement with Northpoint Development LLC for Former Cadillac Stamping Plant to the
DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit (the “City”) administration has requested the assistance of the
City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (“DBRA”) in industrial land assembly activities aimed at
establishing market-ready industrial sites within City limits in order to attract manufacturing and logistics
companies (the “Land Assembly Project”).
DBRA staff have identified a site located at 9501 Conner Street, Detroit, MI and formerly known as the
Cadillac Stamping Plant (the “Property”), as a key site for industrial development. Acquired by the City in

 October 2018 as a tax foreclosed property, the 18-acre site was previously used or various industrial uses,
including as a stamping plant for General Motors.
DBRA staff has identified NorthPoint Development, LLC (“Developer”) as a potential developer of the
Property to undertake demolition of the existing structures, any necessary remediation, and construct a
facility of at least 200,000 square feet intended for industrial uses related to advanced manufacturing,
assembly, or transportation, distribution and logistics. Subject to City Council approval, DBRA proposes to
enter into a land transfer agreement for the Property with the City (the “Land Transfer Agreement”) and
then to subsequently transfer the Property to the Developer pursuant to a development agreement
(“Development Agreement”) to be negotiated by Developer and DBRA consistent with the terms contained
in the letter of intent attached hereto (the “LOI”), a summary of which is described below:
Purchase Price: $1,778,893
Site Prep Credit: DBRA will provide Developer a credit at closing for anticipated costs of
demolition and remedial action undertaken by Developer at the Property
Due Diligence: 90 days, subject to 2 30-day extensions
Approvals Period: 45 days after due diligence to receive governmental approvals for the project
Closing: 30 days following the expiration of the Approvals Period
Construction Commencement: 90 days from closing
Construction Completion: 30 months from closing
DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval of the LOI and the approval to negotiate and execute the
Development Agreement and the Land Transfer Agreement consistent with the terms set forth in the LOI.
A resolution was attached for the Board’s consideration.
Ms. Wilkins asked if the DBRA was being asked to vote on how the property will be demolished and not to
decide on who the end user of the Property is. Ms. Belanger stated that the DBRA was being asked to enter
into the Letter of Intent, a Development Agreement, and a Land Transfer Agreement with the Developer.
Ms. Wilkins asked if the type of industrial end use is known. Ms. Belanger stated that it will be a spec build
of a 200,000 square foot facility or larger and will likely be occupied by a supplier for FCA given the
Property’s close proximity to the Jefferson North Assembly Plant.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA has any leverage to ensure the demolition of the Property is handled
appropriately. Ms. Belanger stated that the project is still in the due diligence phase and that the method of
demolition has not yet been decided and any demolition would have to comply with all City of Detroit
requirements and regulations for demolition.
Mr. Walters asked if the current structure on the Property was one-story. Ms. Belanger stated that the
current structure is three stories and approximately 1 million square feet.
Ms. DeSantis stated that she was concerned about notifications to the community regarding an implosion,
specifically in the case of the Detroit Edison Conner’s Creek Power Station. Mr. Scott stated it has not yet
been decided if the Detroit Edison Conner’s Creek Power Station will be imploded or will be deconstructed
using another method. Should the Detroit Edison Conner’s Creek Power Station be imploded there would
be notification and a community meeting regarding the implosion, following the City of Detroit’s procedures
for implosions. Ms. DeSantis stated that she received a call from someone at DTE regarding the implosion
date. Mr. Scott stated that an implosion date has not been established and an implosion of the Detroit
Edison Conner’s Creek Power Station has not been approved at this time.

 Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA has any control over how the current structure on the Property will be
demolished. Ms. Belanger stated that the City of Detroit would determine how the current structure on the
Property is demolished.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA has any authority over the demolition on the Property. Mr. Walters stated
that the DBRA does not have any intervention on building permits.
Mr. Walters asked Mr. Scott if the DBRA Board can be made aware when any permits are pulled for the
Property through the Building Safety Engineering and Environment Department. Mr. Scott stated that the
information on permits is open to the public through the open data portal and that he would make the DBRA
Board aware if there are any permits pulled for the Property.
Ms. DeSantis asked for clarification on the purchase price and the site preparation costs. Ms. Navin stated
that the purchase price was determined based on the City of Detroit Assessor’s value of the both the land
and the building on the Property with consideration given to the estimated $10 million cost of demolition.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Authorization to Enter into a Letter of Intent, Development
Agreement, and Land Transfer Agreement with Northpoint Development LLC for Former Cadillac Stamping
Plant, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Washington, seconded by Mr. Gonzalez, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-26232 was unanimously approved.
Land Assembly Project: Authorization to Revise Terms of Development Agreement with Dakkota
Integrated Systems for Former Kettering High School & Rose School Sites
Ms. Bridges presented the Authorization to Revise Terms of Development Agreement with Dakkota
Integrated Systems for Former Kettering High School & Rose School Sites to the DBRA Board.
As the Board will recall, in the summer, 2019, the DBRA Board of Directors authorized the purchase of the
former Kettering High School and Rose School sites (the “Property”) from Detroit Public Schools (“DPS”)
and the subsequent transfer of the property for development to Trinity Investments LLC (“Trinity”) for use
by Dakkota Integrated Systems, LLC (“Dakkota”).
Following due diligence by Trinity and Dakkota, due to the higher costs and a longer timeline than expected
to prepare the Property for construction, Dakkota has proposed purchasing only the south 19 acres of the
Property (the “Dakkota Parcel”) for construction of an approximately 300,000 square foot facility. The
northern portion of the Property, consisting of approximately 13 acres, (the “Retained Parcel”) would be
retained by the DBRA and marketed for use by another industrial user. In addition, because certain of the
improvements to the Property would be for the benefit of both the Dakkota Parcel and the Retained Parcel,
DBRA staff proposes making a financial contribution towards Dakkota’s construction of the shared
improvements.
The proposed revised terms are described in the term sheet attached as Exhibit A, signed by Trinity,
Dakkota and DBRA’s authorized agents (the “Revised Terms”). In addition, since the execution of the
Revised Terms, Trinity has determined it will no longer be a party to the transaction, and Dakkota will be
the developer and the end-user of the Dakkota Parcel and intends to assign any interest in the Development
Agreement to Dakkota.
DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval to enter into a Development Agreement with Dakkota consistent
with the Revised Terms and an amended and restated funding agreement with the City of Detroit in order
to accept funding for the purchase of the Property and the DBRA’s funding obligations under the Revised
Terms.
A resolution is attached for the Board’s consideration.

 Ms. DeSantis asked if the Retained Parcel will be owned by the City of Detroit. Ms. Navin stated that the
DBRA will own the Retained Parcel.
Ms. Wilkins asked if concerns regarding contamination impacted the transfer of the Retained Parcel. Ms.
Bridges stated that it was discovered that the Retained Parcel cannot have interior lead and asbestos
abatement and demolition performed in enough time to fit in the timeframe needed by Dakkota. Dakkota
will be relocating a large gas main that runs through the parcel Dakkota is retaining.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Revise Terms of Development Agreement with Dakkota
Integrated Systems for Former Kettering High School & Rose School Sites, as presented. The Board took
the following action:
On a motion by Ms. Washington, seconded by Ms. McClain, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-262-33
was unanimously approved.
Land Assembly Project: Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Issuance of Tax Increment Revenue
Bond in Connection with MSF Loan
Ms. Navin presented the Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Issuance of Tax Increment Revenue Bond in
Connection with MSF Loan to the DBRA Board.
As the Board is aware, the City of Detroit Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (the “DBRA”) entered into a
Development Agreement with FCA US LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“FCA”), dated June 3,
2019 (the “Development Agreement”), related to the construction of a new assembly plant (the “Project”) at
the site of the Mack 1 Plant and Mack 2 Plant. Under the Development Agreement, the DBRA agreed to
pay certain Eligible Costs (as defined and described in the Development Agreement) related to the
assembly of land to be transferred to FCA for the Project.
In order to provide DBRA with a portion of the funds necessary to pay its obligations under the Development
Agreement:
1. The City of Detroit agreed to provide a loan in the amount of Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($7,500,000) (the “City Loan”) to the DBRA; and
2. The Michigan Strategic Fund (the “MSF”) agreed to make a performance-based investment award
(the “MSF Investment”) in an amount up to Fifty-Five Million Dollars ($55,000,000) pursuant to the
terms of that certain Investment Agreement between the MSF and the DBRA, dated as of June 14,
2019 and amended as of October 15, 2019 (the “Investment Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the DBRA is obligated to repay an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) and (ii) the amount ultimately disbursed to DBRA by the MSF under
the Investment Agreement, plus interest thereon (we note that the full $20,000,000 is almost certain to be
drawn and disbursed). As evidence of DBRA’s obligation to repay such portion of the MSF Investment, the
DBRA agreed to issue its Tax Increment Revenue Bond, Series 2019 (the “Bond”) to be repaid solely from
tax increment revenues generated by the Project (“Tax Increment Revenues”).
The projected annual debt service on the City Loan and the Bond is shown on Exhibit A. In the event Tax
Increment Revenues in any given year are insufficient to pay debt service on the Bond, resulting in a
payment of less than the amount of debt service payable to the MSF in such year, any excess Tax
Increment Revenues in future will be used to bring current all sums then due to the MSF under the Bond.
In order to issue the Bond, state law requires that the Board adopt a bond authorizing resolution (the
“Resolution”) containing, among other things, the financial parameters of the Bond and a description of the
security pledged in support of the Bond (i.e., the Tax Increment Revenues).
DBRA staff seeks the Board’s approval of the issuance of the Bond according to the material terms set forth
in the Resolution, which are summarized on Exhibit B to this memorandum. The full text of the Resolution
was attached.

 Ms. Wilkins asked if this was the first time the DBRA has issued a bond. Ms. Navin confirmed that this is
the first time the DBRA has issued a bond.
Mr. Scott asked if the DBRA will be the entity issuing the bond to the State of Michigan. Ms. Navin confirmed
that the DBRA will be the entity issuing the bond to the State of Michigan.
Ms. McClain asked why there needs to be a roll call vote on the resolution. Mr. Liscombe stated that under
the Open Meetings Act a roll call vote is not required, but for documentation purposes the DBRA would like
to have a roll call vote.
Ms. Wilkins asked for more clarification on the necessity for the bond and its impact on the DBRA’s liability
for the loan from the MSF. Ms. Navin stated that the bond is another form of a loan and that the City of
Detroit did not require a bond to secure the loan to the DBRA.
Mr. Walters asked what the DBRA will be paying the MSF back for. Ms. Navin stated that the DBRA has
not yet received this loan from the MSF and that once the bond is issued and other required documentation
is provided to the MSF, the next $20 million loan will be given to the DBRA.
Mr. Walters asked if the loan is to be use toward clean up and site preparation costs and the DBRA will be
selling a bond to pay back the MSF for the loan. Ms. Navin confirmed that the loan is to be use toward clean
up and site preparation costs and the DBRA will be issuing a bond to pay back the MSF for the loan.
Ms. DeSantis asked where the TIF revenue will come from and what it will be used for. Ms. Navin stated
that under the Mack and Conner Brownfield Plan, the property taxes paid by FCA will be captured by the
DBRA to pay the City of Detroit and the MSF for the respective loans received by the DBRA. Ms. Navin
also stated that the MSF loan received by the DBRA can only be paid using tax increment revenues so if
the tax increment revenues actually generated under the Plan are less than what was projected and there
is an end balance left to pay on the loan, the MSF cannot ask the DBRA to pay such end balance using
other funds available to the DBRA.
Mr. Walters asked why the MSF is requiring a bond from the DBRA to pay back the loan. Ms. Navin stated
that the MSF is requiring the bond because by law, a bond holder has a statutory lien on the revenue
stream, which in this case is the tax increment revenue and clarified that the lien is not applicable to the
property included in the Plan. Mr. Liscombe added that the only thing the lien is applicable to is the tax
increment revenue generated under the Plan and if there isn’t sufficient tax increment revenue generated,
the MSF does not have any recourse against the DBRA regarding the loan.
Mr. Liscombe stated that public entities only have the authorities granted to them through state statute and
there is no state statute that says that the DBRA can take out a loan from the state, so the funds received
by the DBRA from the MSF must be in the form of a bond. Ms. Navin added that the bond gives the MSF
protection in the case of the DBRA becoming insolvent and the tax increment revenues dedicated to
repaying the MSF would be protected and used for its intended purpose.
Ms. DeSantis asked if the DBRA Board members have any personal liability for the bond. Ms. Navin stated
that the DBRA Board members do not have any personal liability for the bond.
Ms. Wilkins asked if the DBRA is taking on the financial burden to ensure that the FCA project is completed.
Ms. Navin stated that the DBRA is not taking on the financial burden to ensure that the FCA project is
completed, and that the MSF is taking on the risk with having the loan paid back through tax increment
revenues.
Mr. Walters asked if the bond would be difficult to take to market. Ms. Navin stated that the bond would be
difficult to take to market. Mr. Liscombe stated that the bond is the equivalent of a loan.

 Mr. Gonzalez asked who will begin paying the MSF loan in 2021. Ms. Navin stated that the DBRA will begin
paying the MSF loan in 2021 using tax increment revenues, if available. Mr. Liscombe added that there will
be principal and interest payments annually to be paid through tax increment revenues.
Ms. DeSantis asked for confirmation that if there aren’t any tax increment revenues generated through the
Mack and Conner Brownfield Plan then the DBRA will not be liable for paying the loan using other funds.
Ms. Navin confirmed that loan is to be use toward clean up and site preparation costs and the DBRA will
be selling a bond to pay back the MSF for the loan. If there is insufficient tax increment revenue from the
Mack and Conner Brownfield Plan, the DBRA will not be liable to pay the bond using other funds.
Mr. Liscombe added that the bond would be next to impossible to sell to the public and that the low interest
rate on the loan the DBRA is receiving from the MSF is 1.16% annually.
Mr. Walters called for a motion approving the Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Issuance of Tax Increment
Revenue Bond in Connection with MSF Loan, as presented. The Board took the following action:
Ms. McClain made a motion approving the Adoption of Resolution Authorizing Issuance of Tax
Increment Revenue Bond in Connection with MSF Loan, as presented. Ms. Washington seconded
the motion. A roll call vote was conducted with the following result:
Ayes: Ms. DeSantis, Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. McClain, Mr. Scott, Mr. Walters, Ms. Washington
Nays: Ms. Wilkins.
DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-262-34 was approved.

letters from the Church of the Messiah, and a letter from Villages Property Management.
Mr. Walters stated that the TIF ask under the Plan is under $300,000 and that there are eight residential
units with two of them to be available at 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) and that the Villages CDC
represents the area more than the Charlevoix Villages Association.
Ms. DeSantis stated that there are more board members of the Villages CDC that live in the area but that
there is some tension between the Villages CDC and some members of the community. Ms. DeSantis
stated that she would have liked to have seen support a letter from GenesisHOPE.
Mr. Walters called for a motion to approve the 2119 Field Street Brownfield Redevelopment Plan and its
submittal to the Detroit City Council, as presented. The Board took the following action:
On a motion by Ms. McClain, seconded by Ms. Washington, DBRA Resolution Code 19-11-280-02
was approved. Ms. DeSantis voted nay.
AMC Site Presentation
Mr. Vosburg stated that following up on the DBRA Board’s request for an update on the status of the AMC
Site, there are representatives from SME and the DEGC to provide more information. Mr. Cassidy provided
a presentation to the DBRA Board regarding the AMC Site.
Mr. Cassidy gave an overview of the past uses of the AMC Site, the current conditions of the existing
structure and the rest of the property including the amount of debris and stockpiled soil and waste, the
environmental reviews and assessments conducted and the results of those assessments, the number and
location of underground storage tanks remaining, the estimated costs of remediation, demolition, and clean
up of the AMC Site and the variations of those costs when other creative solutions are considered.

 Mr. Walters asked what the most conservative estimated amount for clean up and demolition of the site.
Mr. Cassidy stated that about $25 million is the most conservative estimated cost for clean up and
demolition of the site and that in another scenario with other solutions applied, the clean-up and demolition
costs were reduced to about $15 million. Mr. Vosburg added that the $15 million scenario would require the
commitment of a developer that had an end use compatible with and was willing and comfortable exploring
creative solutions for the clean up and demolition of the site including reusing the materials currently on the
site to the extent those materials could be used.
Mr. Walters asked if the City of Detroit were to use funds to clean up the site then would it be closer to the
$25-30 million amount. Mr. Vosburg confirmed that if the City of Detroit were to use funds to clean up the
site then it be closer to the $25-30 million amount. Mr. Cassidy added that the $25-30 million amount would
only address the clean up and demolition costs for everything above grade and would not address any
remediation that may be required for contamination located in the ground.
Ms. DeSantis stated that using contaminated soil to create berms would only be delaying the cost of
remediation which would need to happen regardless.
Mr. Walters stated that any developer taking on the clean up and demolition of the site would need to have
significant funds available to take on such costs.
Ms. Wilkins asked if there are any barriers currently in place to keep the general public out of the site. Mr.
Cassidy and Mr. Dailey confirmed that there is a fence around the site to keep the site secure from the
public and the prevent further illegal dumping on the site. Mr. Vosburg stated that all of the stock piled soil
and debris on the site is the result of illegal dumping and that the site is being monitored by Detroit Police.
Additionally the City of Detroit is working to control weeds and clear non-environmental debris from the site
as staff and resources allow.
